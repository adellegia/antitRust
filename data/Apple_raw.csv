On Tuesday Apple announced it will voluntarily correct its unfair policy of charging greater commission fees to South Korean app developers.
Despite Apple’s announcement to voluntarily correct its commission policy, the Fair Trade Commission made clear it will continue to look into unfair business activities by Apple.
“If Apple fixes the problematic action well, it will ease difficulties faced by domestic app developers to some extent. Active communication between app market operators and app developers will also help establish a fair and dynamic app market ecosystem,” said Fair Trade Commission Chairman Han Ki-jeong during talks with app industry insiders held in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, Tuesday.

The decision comes after South Korea’s antitrust watchdog began a probe into the iPhone maker over its Korea-exclusive charging system that is based on consumer prices, including value-added tax.
This means Korean developers are forced to pay a 33 percent commission to Apple, above the 30 percent rate imposed in other markets.
In an official statement, Apple said that starting from January next year it will calculate the commission for Korean developers excluding value-added tax from app-generated sales, and that additional details will be explained to app developers step by step.
“We will support Korean app developers to grow in all app stores around the world and feel pride in their work by providing them with the best tools and technology,” the statement read.

On Tuesday UK watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority launched a new probe into Apple and Google’s control of the mobile browser market.
The regulator said it will explore the companies’ “stranglehold” over browsing, as well as Apple’s control over cloud gaming through the App Store, it said in a release. The CMA said Google and Apple powered 97% of all web browsing that took place in the UK in 2021.
Big tech rivals such as web developers, cloud gaming service providers and browser vendors have offered “substantial support”  to move along the probe, according to the results of a June consultation released by the authority.

Among the list of complaints is that Apple’s restrictions make it difficult to build innovative new apps for UK consumers, and that they are forced to contend with glitches and bugs while building webpages.
Sarah Cardell, interim chief executive of the CMA, said  “Many UK businesses and web developers tell us they feel that they are being held back by restrictions set by Apple and Google,” she said. “We plan to investigate whether the concerns we have heard are justified and, if so, identify steps to improve competition and innovation in these sectors.”
A Google spokesperson said “Android gives people a greater choice of apps and app stores than any other mobile platform. It also enables developers to choose the browser engine they want, and has been the launchpad for millions of apps.

A Federal Appeals Court is now weighing in on a lawsuit between Apple and the maker of Fortnite. Epic Games claims that Apple’s app store fees violate antitrust laws because Apple requires a cut of purchases made by other companies that use its app store.
Epic Games  aimed to get the court to allow for third-party app stores and alternate methods of getting apps on iOS devices, but ‌Epic Games‌ largely lost the lawsuit, leading it to file an appeal. Apple won the antitrust suit, but was ordered to allow developers to add in-app links to outside websites where payments could be accepted.

Apple does not want to change its ‌App Store‌ rules and also appealed, leading to the court battle today. Epic Games will argue that the court made “multiple legal errors” in its initial ruling, once again arguing for sideloading to be allowed.
Apple maintains that ‌Epic Games‌ lost the trial because of “unprecedented” and “unfounded” accusations of anticompetitive conduct that ultimately did not sway the judge. Epic, says Apple, made far-reaching claims at the edges of antitrust law, and there is no basis for the ruling to be overturned on appeal. Apple will also argue that the original court made an error when implementing an injunction that will force ‌App Store‌ changes.

 Epic Games on Monday will try to overturn portions of a court ruling in an antitrust trial last year that largely favored Apple.
The “Fortnite” creator sued Apple in 2020 alleging that the iPhone maker’s App Store rules, under which software developers must pay commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases, violated US antitrust law.
After a three-week trial last year, a judge largely sided with Apple, stopping short of dubbing the company an “illegal monopolist” and upholding its right to charge the commissions.

The two sides will argue their case before the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday, with representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice and the state of California also making appearances to describe relevant laws.

Apple and Amazon were accused in an antitrust lawsuit on Wednesday of conspiring to drive up the prices of iPhones and iPads. The lawsuit claims that Amazon and Apple colluded to eliminate third-party sellers on Amazon who offered these products at a lower price. 
The lawsuit was filed by law firm Hagens Berman in Washington. It alleged that the companies had an ‘unlawful horizontal agreement’ to reduce the ‘competitive threat posed by third-party merchants’, thus violating the US antitrust laws that prohibit such coordination, especially when it leads to higher prices or other harms to consumers, such as loss of quality or access.

The lawsuit claimed that Amazon expelled third-party sellers after it signed a deal with Apple in 2019. The number of Apple resellers on Amazon fell to around 20 per country, according to reports. Apple, in return, gave Amazon up to a 10 percent discount on its products. Based on a MacRumors report, there were about 600 third-party sellers of Apple devices on Amazon, but only seven were left following the 2019 agreement.  
The change transformed Amazon into the dominant reseller of new iPhones and iPads. According to a Reuters report on the lawsuit by plaintiff Steven Floyd of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, prices rose more than 10 per cent, while Apple stabilised the prices it charged in retail stores.

7,"October 6, 2022",French Court Cuts Down Antitrust Fine Against Apple,"
An appeals court in France today lowered a fine levied against Apple by the French Competition Authority due to alleged “anti-competitive behavior towards its distribution and retail network,” according to Reuters. 
The antitrust regulator fined Apple in 2020 after finding that it imposed prices on Apple Authorized Resellers in France so that prices were in line with those charged at Apple Stores and on Apple.com. The fine was reduced after the appeals court dropped one of the three main charges related to price-fixing allegations, and significantly lowered the rate applied to calculate the overall fine, according to the report.
At the time, it was the biggest fine levied by the antitrust regulator, which said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the internet.
The appeals court backed the antitrust watchdog’s charge that Apple abused the retailers’ economic dependency on the company but tossed the fixed-pricing charge, one of the two sources said.
The investigation began after a dispute between Apple and one of its leading French wholesalers, which alleged that it went out of business due to Apple’s uncompetitive rules. When fined in 2020, Apple said the French Competition Authority’s decision was “disheartening” and “discards thirty years of legal precedent.”

By Damien Geradin (TILEC) & Stijn Huijts (Geradin Partners)
Cloud gaming represents a new model of video game distribution. It involves playing games that are streamed from a remote server (the cloud), and has the potential to revolutionize gaming as it is, at least in theory, device-agnostic, allowing AAA games to be played on any device with a connection to the internet. However, Apple blocks the emergence of cloud gaming apps on its Apple App Store, and Google, although not completely blocking them, still imposes restrictions on them. Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps has led the UK Competition and Markets Authority to make a Market Investigation Reference, which could lead to the authority imposing remedies on Apple.
This paper provides an introduction to cloud gaming and explains why it is an important development that offers huge potential for competition and innovation in digital markets. It then discusses Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps and examines Apple’s stated rationale for this policy, after which it also touches on Google’s restrictions. This is followed by a section that sets out other reasons why it may be in Apple’s commercial interest to block the emergence of cloud gaming apps, looking in particular at whether this may be linked to a desire to protect its position in the distribution of apps on iOS devices and its revenues from the sale of hardware. After this, the paper discusses how these restrictions have led to the UK Market Investigation Reference, and how they may be treated under the forthcoming EU Digital Markets Act.

An administrative court in Italy today scrapped a €173.3 million ($170.4 million) fine leveled at Apple and Amazon last year for alleged anti-competitive cooperation when selling Apple and Beats products, Reuters reports.
In November 2021, Italy’s antitrust watchdog hit Apple and Amazon with a $196 million fine in the culmination of an investigation that began in 2020 over allegations that the two companies had been blocking the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition and keep prices high.
The regulator said contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the two companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell the products on Amazon’s Italian store, which was in violation of EU rules and affected competition on prices.
Amazon was fined €68.7 million euros ($67.6 million), while Apple received a fine of $132.3 million. The watchdog also ordered the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to the Italian Amazon web store in a “non-discriminatory manner.”
Both Apple and Amazon appealed against the fines. “To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,” Apple said, denying any wrongdoing. In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was “disproportionate and unjustified.”
Earlier this year, the fine was reduced to an overall €173.3 million ($170.4 million) due to a “material error” in the initial calculation. Amazon welcomed today’s ruling in a statement, while Apple and Italy’s antitrust regulator declined to comment.

Since 2018, the health app has been able to connect with healthcare systems and reference laboratories to pull in clinical information, labs, test results, and office-based measurements.

Apple is raising the price of apps and in-app purchases in some countries in Europe and Asia as of Oct. 5, though auto-renewable subscriptions will be excluded.
“Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price,” Apple said in a blog post for developers on Monday (Sept. 19). “If you offer subscriptions, you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers.” 
The new prices will affect Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Sweden, Poland and all territories that use the euro currency, as well as Chile and Egypt.
“In Vietnam, these increases also reflect new regulations for Apple to collect and remit applicable taxes, being value added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax (CIT) at 5% rates respectively,” according to the post.
The reason for the increases in other countries wasn’t provided in the post, but could be due to a combination of a strong dollar against a weakening euro and yen, high inflation and interest rates and a weakened world economy.
Price hikes in the Euro market are roughly 20%, while the increases in Japan are about 30%, according to a reportin The Verge. The yen recently dropped to a new 24-year low against the US dollar.
The App Store pricing increases follow Apple’s move to raise the prices of the new iPhone 14 and Apple Watch Series 8 models in many markets outside the US.

An association for app developers gets more than half of its funding from the same source that gives many of its members reason to gripe — Apple.
The App Association, known as ACT, calls itself the “leading industry voice on the app economy for our members as well as policymakers.” Its members and experts frequently testify before Congress, and earlier this month, it sent a letter to Congress outlining its top legislative priorities for the remainder of the legislative session. 
Apple not only funds the organization, but it is a background influencer that has a hand in forming the group’s policy positions, Bloomberg reported Monday (Sept. 19), citing four unnamed sources who previously worked at the ACT. The former employees also said the percentage of Apple’s support of the organization is much higher than 50%.
The association’s lobbying agenda closely aligns with Apple’s, Bloomberg reported, and it aligns even when it runs counter to what is in the best interests of developers. 
Rick VanMeter, a former congressional aide and the head of the Coalition for App Fairness, a rival association, told Bloomberg that the ACT is a deceptive organization because of its relationship with Apple.
“When you pretend to be something that you’re not in order to make a point, that’s bad for the lawmaking process,” VanMeter said, per the report.

14,"September 19, 2022",Court Rules DOJ Can Join Arguments In Apple-Epic Antitrust Trial,"
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has been granted time to present its own oral arguments during the upcoming Apple v. Epic Games appeal, along with the State of California. 
On Friday, US Dept. of Justice officials filed a request to present 10 minutes of oral arguments during the trial, in addition to the 20 minutes of argument time per side. The lawyers said they wanted time to explain to the court the proper legal framework for evaluating the antitrust claims against Apple.
Though the Justice Department’s arguments will technically be in support of “neither side,” per court filings, its intention is to spell out its existing concerns over how the lower courts had originally ruled on the case. In an amicus brief filed back on January 27, 2022, U.S. officials indicated there were “multiple legal errors” in the district court’s analysis of US antitrust law, the Sherman Act, which could “imperil effective antitrust enforcement, especially in the digital economy,” the new filing explained.
Specifically, the DoJ had concerns over various aspects of that analysis, including how the lower court had too narrowly interpreted parts of the law, as well as other issues related to the lower court’s misunderstanding of the market and Apple’s monopoly power with regard to pricing, among other things. The lawyers asked for time to present these errors to the court and to explain how, if uncorrected, they could harm antitrust enforcement beyond this case alone.
The US’s request to join the arguments for this legal battle follows the news that the Justice Department is in the early stages of preparing its own antitrust lawsuit against Apple. Lawyers for the U.S. government have been interviewing impacted parties, including app developers large and small, and even hardware makers like Tile. It likely doesn’t want any decision in the Apple-Epic ruling to set a precedent in terms of antitrust law that could harm its own forthcoming case.
In addition to the DoJ request, the State of California also asked for time to present arguments in court in order to present its views on how the court should evaluate its consumer protection law known as California’s Unfair Competition Law.

The Justice Department filed a brief to enter the case at the start of the year. The agency said it was concerned that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had improperly interpreted US antitrust law. Apple has argued that the district court wrongly decided the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) issue.
 In 2019, reports surfaced that the DOJ was preparing to launch a probe of Apple’s business practices. A decision to uphold the company’s win over Epic could limit the DOJ’s ability to sue it for antitrust violations.

“The United States believes that its participation at oral argument would be helpful to the court, especially in explaining how the errors (in antitrust law interpretation) could significantly harm antitrust enforcement beyond the specific context of this case,” the Justice Department wrote on Friday.
The agency has asked for 10 minutes of the court’s time. Neither side is against the Justice Department’s involvement, though Apple has requested that the DOJ’s argument time count against Epic’s total time allotment or that the court extends the proceedings.

16,"September 16, 2022",Designating Large Platforms Under The DMA And The DSA: Comparing Apples and Oranges?,"
By: Konstantina Bania (The Platform Law Blog)
The Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) and the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) will soon start to apply. Broadly speaking, both instruments have the same objective, which is to address concerns arising from the increasing reliance on online platforms. However, despite being presented as parts of the same “package”, the DSA and the DMA do not have many similarities because they target different problems. The DMA imposes obligations to protect businesses and consumers against unfair platform practices. The DSA imposes obligations for a “safe, predictable and trusted online environment” through a framework for conditional liability exemptions and rules on due diligence obligations. In other words, the DMA primarily seeks to improve market conditions whereas the DSA, which is essentially content regulation, attempts to strike a balance between restricting the dissemination of illegal content online and the effective exercise of fundamental freedoms (e.g., freedom of speech, freedom to conduct business). The two instruments are also based on a different logic. The DMA only applies to “gatekeeper” platforms, that is, platforms that act as gateways between businesses and consumers. The DSA sets a baseline for all intermediaries and adopts a “graduated” approach whereby the rules become stricter depending on the category to which an intermediary belongs (intermediaries; intermediaries that are hosting service providers; hosting service providers that qualify as online platforms; and very large online platforms). 
However, the DMA and the DSA have certain similarities with respect to the regulation of the large service providers that fall under their scope. The entire text of the DMA and Section 4 of the DSA are based on the premise that “gatekeeper platforms” and “very large online platforms” (or “VLOPs”) pose unique challenges that can only be addressed through rules that target them specifically. Both instruments are based on user thresholds to determine the size (and, by extension, the power) of platforms that should be subject to such rules and they both envisage a designation process. Such similarities may be the reason for the misunderstanding that platforms that fall under the scope of the DSA will certainly abide by the DMA. This may not necessarily be the case because the definitional criteria, the designation process, and the methodology to calculate the size of the platform concerned are different. This blog post discusses this issue, detangling the conditions and the process pursuant to which a platform may qualify as a gatekeeper or as a VLOP under the DMA and the DSA respectively…

Apple may face yet another competition probe from regulators in Mexico, after a former telecommunications chief filed a complaint against tech giants on Friday.

The complaint, seen by Reuters, claims the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store charge between 15% and 20% commission, which in turn forces price inflation.Addati was previously the head of the telecommunications federation that existed before being replaced by the IFT.
He claims Mexico’s competition regulator declined to open an investigation into the matter, therefore prompting a turn toward the IFT over the matter.
“I have full confidence that (the IFT) will investigate and exercise its powers, in line with international best practices, so that these companies stop abusing their market power to the detriment of developers and consumers,” said Addati.
