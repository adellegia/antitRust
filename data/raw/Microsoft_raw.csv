The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly “likely” to file an antitrust lawsuit to block the $68.7 billion deal that would see Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard.
As reported by Politico, this news comes by the way of “three people with knowledge of the matter,” and they stress this lawsuit is “not guaranteed.”
The FTC’s four commissioners haven’t taken the time to vote out a complaint or even meet with the lawyers from Microsoft and Activision, but the FTC staff reviewing the deal are “skeptical of the companies’ arguments.”

As for where the deal stands, much of the “heavy lifting” has been completed, including depositions of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick. This means a decision on a potential antitrust lawsuit could arrive as soon as December.
The main crux of the problem, according to the FTC, is some worry this deal will give “Microsoft an unfair boost in the video game market.”
Sony has, obviously, been one of the biggest opponents against the deal, and the question of where Call of Duty will appear has been one of the hottest topics. Despite Xbox head Phil Spencer stating Call of Duty will continue to ship on PlayStation “as long as there’s a PlayStation to ship to,” there are still concerns with what other issues this deal may create.
Sony has previously said that Microsoft is a “Tech Titan buying up irreplaceable content at incontestable prices ($68.7 billion) to tip competition to itself.”
There are concerns beyond Call of Duty, however, as there is worry about what future mega-hit titles will do to tip the scales if they are locked behind one platform.
Google is also said to be against the deal, claiming Microsoft has “purposely degraded the quality of its Game Pass subscription service when used with Google’s Chrome operating system.” If the deal were to go through, it believes it would “further [Microsoft’s] incentive to do so.”

A Swedish state-run pension fund sued Activision Blizzard Inc. and Microsoft Corp., claiming their planned $69 billion merger was rigged to exploit the beleaguered gaming giant’s sexual harassment crisis and protect its CEO.
The 205-page complaint also targets embattled Activision chief Bobby Kotick, plus current and ex-members of its board. It accuses them of engineering an underpriced deal in exchange for terms allowing Kotick to stay at the helm, at least until the transaction closes after a drawn-out regulatory review.
Knowing Activision and Kotick were “weak and wounded,” Microsoft used the leverage created by the scandal to acquire Activision “at a bargain price,” at an inopportune time, and following a sham process, according to the proposed class action. It was made public Nov. 10 in Delaware’s Chancery Court.

“Microsoft knowingly exploited the harassment scandal and its commercial leverage over Activision precisely to offer Kotick a way to save his own skin,” the lawsuit says. “It conspired with Kotick and the board to help them evade the personal and professional consequences of that scandal.”
Joe Christinat, a spokesman for Activision, defended the transaction Monday.
“This is a great deal for shareholders,” Christinat told Bloomberg Law. “We garnered 98% approval of votes cast. The board went through a thorough process to decide the right move for employees, shareholders, and players.”
A spokesperson for Microsoft told Bloomberg Law in a statement that “our proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard was negotiated lawfully and fairly.”

“The Commission’s preliminary investigation shows that the transaction may significantly reduce competition on the markets for the distribution of console and PC video games, including multigame subscription services and/or cloud game streaming services, and for PC operating systems,” the European Commission said in a statement.
“In particular, the Commission is concerned that, by acquiring Activision Blizzard, Microsoft may foreclose access to Activision Blizzard’s console and PC video games, especially to high-profile and highly successful games (so-called ‘AAA’ games) such as ‘Call of Duty’,” it said.

The boss of the UK media regulator Ofcom warned “metaverse” forays from tech giants like Meta and Microsoft will be subjected to incoming rules forcing platforms to protect users from online harms.
Speaking at an event in London hosted by policy consulting group Global Counsel on Tuesday, Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said self-regulation of the metaverse, a hypothetical digital world touted by Meta and others, wouldn’t fly under UK online safety laws.
“I’m not sure I really see that ‘self-regulatory phase,’ to be honest, existing from a UK perspective,” Dawes said. “If you’ve got young people in an environment where there’s user-generated content according to the scope of the bill then that will already be caught by the Online Safety Bill.”

The Online Safety Bill is a set of legislation that seeks to curb harmful content from being widely shared on the internet. The rules would impose a duty of care on firms requiring them to have robust and proportionate measures to deal with harmful materials such as vaccine disinformation or posts promoting self-harm.
Violations of the law — once it is approved — could lead to fines of up to 10% of annual global revenues. Down the track, senior tech executives may also face criminal liability for more extreme breaches.
The bill is especially concerned with the protection of children, having been developed in response to the death of Molly Russell, a U.K. teen who took her own life after being exposed to suicide-related posts on Instagram. In September, a coroner investigating Russell’s death made the landmark conclusion that “negative effects” of social media contributed to her death.

This week Microsoft has accused UK’s competition watchdog of relying on “self-serving” input from rival Sony inits decision to probe the tech giant’s $69 Billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, reported Reuters. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month that the acquisition could harm competition and needed to be investigated in depth.
Microsoft could use its control over popular games to harm rivals, including those operating in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming, it said.
“The CMA is concerned that having full control over this powerful catalogue (…) could result in Microsoft harming consumers by impairing Sony’s — Microsoft’s closest gaming rival— ability to compete,” it said.
Microsoft said the CMA had adopted Sony’s complaints without the “appropriate level of critical review”.
In its submission, it said Sony’s PlayStation had been the largest console platform for more than 20 years, and it was not credible to suggest its dominance would be challenged by losing access to one title.
“The Referral Decision incorrectly relies on self-serving statements by Sony which significantly exaggerate the importance of ‘Call of Duty’ to it and neglect to account for Sony’s clear ability to competitively respond,” Microsoft said.

The Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft is one that has caught many eyes on both the gaming industry and community. 
The deal, if approved, would see Microsoft owning the Call of Duty IP as well as other IPs in the Activision Blizzard repertoire. The deal is currently going through heavy scrutiny by several organizations. One of which is the European Commission.
As of now, Microsoft will have to wait until November 8 to hear more about whether the European Commission will permit the deal to go into its next phase. The acquisition is scrutinized by global regulators amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry, after all, so every bit of scrutiny is justified.
Now, several antitrust regulators from the EU are asking game developers whether Microsoft will be incentivized to block access to Call of Duty from rivals. According to the document that Reuters first spotted, these regulators also want to know if Activision’s trove of user data would give Microsoft a competitive advantage in developing, publishing, and distributing computer and console games.
The regulators also want to know if there would be sufficient alternative suppliers in the market following the deal and also in the event Microsoft decides to make Activision’s games exclusively available on its Xbox, Xbox Game Pass and its cloud game streaming services. Another one of the questions asked if rivals such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW, PlayStation, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Facebook Gaming would be considered attractive following the deal’s closure. All of these questions have to be answered by October 10, 2022.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could reportedly rule on Microsoft‘s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by late November.
That’s according to Seeking Alpha, which claims the US regulator’s inquiry is still at the staff level, but that it’s expected to progress through the Bureau of Competition and onto the commissioners over the coming weeks.
The publication’s sources claim FTC staff have significant concerns about the $68.7 billion merger, and that the regulator has been engaging with a number of competitors opposed to the transaction, including Sony and Google.
The Information reported in April that the FTC’s investigation into the deal was likely to focus on the consumer data that both companies hold as well as its potential impact on the labour market.
It also said the FTC would review the deal’s potential impact on workers who have accused Activision of harassment and discrimination, as well its potential impact on the competitive metaverse.
The acquisition is currently being scrutinised by regulators around the world amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry.
The UK competition regulator announced on Tuesday that it has set a deadline of March 1, 2023 to publish the findings of its inquiry into the deal.

EU antitrust regulators will decide by Nov. 8 whether to clear Microsoft Corp’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard, according to a European Commission filing on Friday.
The deal, the biggest in the gaming industry, will help the US software company better compete with leaders Tencent and Sony.
The EU competition enforcer can clear the deal with or without remedies after its preliminary review, or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
The Commission is likely to do the latter because of recent regulatory concerns over deals by Big Tech, sources familiar with the matter said.
“The European Commission’s review of the deal is progressing in line with the expected regulatory schedule and process, and we remain confident that the acquisition will close in fiscal year 2023,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.

Concerns about exclusivity and access to popular gaming franchises have also played a part in this case, with PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan previously stating that Microsoft’s offer  about extending the availability of the multi-billion dollar Call of Duty games on their platforms for only three years was inadequate. Microsoft did assure SIE that the franchise will always be multiplatform.

Media regulators are looking into whether large US tech companies including Amazon and Google have formed a monopoly over cloud computing in Britain, officials said Thursday.
Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.
“Because the cloud sector is still evolving, we will look at how the market is working today and how we expect it to develop in the future — aiming to identify any potential competition concerns early to prevent them becoming embedded as the market matures,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Evening Standard.
Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.
Other popular digital tools are also on the watchdog’s radar, including Meta’s WhatsApp, Apple’s Zoom and FaceTime and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa — services that so far have seen little, if any, regulatory oversight.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the United Kingdom confirmed it is moving forward with a more in-depth investigation of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition. Sony has responded, praising the regulator’s decision.
The CMA announced on Thursday that it has referred the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal for an in-depth investigation, which the regulator calls a Phase 2 inquiry.
UK’s market competition watchdog released its initial findings last Sept. 1, saying the $68.7 billion deal could lead to a “substantial lessening of competition.” According to CMA’s rules, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard would have to present remedies within five working days to prove that their deal will not negatively impact the video game market in the UK.
In its reference decision published on Thursday, the CMA said it was informed last Sept. 6 that Microsoft chose not to provide remedies to the regulator’s concerns. This corroborated a report from the Financial Timeswith sources that claimed Microsoft did not expect the CMA to accept any commitments that would have prevented a Phase 2 inquiry. Per the timetable CMA posted, the in-depth investigation could run through March 2023.
Sony, one of the companies most vocal about the acquisition, praised the CMA for its decision. “By giving Microsoft control of Activision games like ‘Call of Duty,’ this deal would have major negative implications for gamers and the future of the gaming industry,” the company told GamesIndustry.biz. “We want to guarantee PlayStation gamers continue to have the highest quality gaming experience, and we appreciate the CMA’s focus on protecting gamers.”

UK officials have launched a deeper antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s $68.7 billion purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard, reflecting concerns that the deal may lead to reduced competition.
The second-stage probe comes after the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Sept. 1 that the acquisition — which would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest video game publisher — posed a risk to markets including console and cloud gaming.
As part of the proposed deal, Microsoft could gain ownership of popular video game franchises, including “Call of Duty,” “World of Warcraft” and “Candy Crush.”
UK regulators have expressed concerns that the acquisition could allow Microsoft to restrict that valuable content from other gaming platforms, particularly Sony’s PlayStation.
Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In February, the company launched a charm offensive with regulators worldwide, announcing several commitments, including a promise not to give preferential treatment to content it owns on platforms it runs.
Earlier this month, the CMA gave Microsoft several days to respond to its preliminary finding with proposed solutions. On Sept. 6, Microsoft declined to make such an offer, the CMA said on Thursday, setting the stage for a phase-two investigation.
Under the agency’s practices, that deeper probe could result in a decision to clear the deal, to impose restrictions or divestitures on the acquisition, or to block the deal outright.

Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard faces in-depth probes in Brussels and the UK following growing concerns the deal is anti-competitive and will exclude rivals from accessing the blockbuster game Call of Duty.
It comes as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is expected to launch an in-depth investigation this week after Microsoft decided not to offer any remedies atthis stage, according to two individuals with knowledge of the situation.
Earlier this month, the CMA became the first global antitrust regulator to sound the alarm over the transaction, giving Microsoft five days to come up with undertakings that would resolve its worries or face an extended “phase 2” probe.
The companies have already been in talks with regulators in Brussels since the deal was announced eight months ago, in what is known as the pre-notification stage — an indication of how scrupulous officials will be during the probe.
Regulators and others involved in the deal expect a prolonged EU investigation once Microsoft officially files its case in Brussels in the coming weeks. People familiar with the EU’s thinking say regulators will take their time to examine this deal because of its size, the nature of the buyer and the rising concerns from rivals, including Sony. “It is a big deal, a difficult deal,” said a person in Brussels familiar with the transaction. “It needs an extensive investigation.”

The United Kingdom’s antitrust watchdog said Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard could hinder competition and warrants further investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in statement Thursday (Sept. 1), the deal — the largest ever for both gaming and Microsoft — could harm the industry if Microsoft were to block competitors from accessing Activision’s popular games.
“We are concerned that Microsoft could use its control over popular games like ‘Call of Duty’ and ‘World of Warcraft’ post-merger to harm rivals, including recent and future rivals in multi-game subscription services and cloud gaming,” the authority said.
Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith told PYMNTS: “We’re ready to work with the CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns. Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about ‘Call of Duty,’ but we’ve said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less.”
Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer underscored this point in a company blog post: “We know players benefit from this approach because we’ve done it with ‘Minecraft,’ which continues to be available on multiple platforms and has expanded to even more since ‘Mojang’ joined Microsoft in 2014. As we extend our gaming storefront across new devices and platforms, we will make sure that we do so in a manner that protects the ability of developers to choose how to distribute their games.”

Apple also is being considered for examination. 
Under the act, which went into effect in January 2021, Germany can move fast to prohibit conduct that is anti-competitive, such as self-preferencing and pre-installation of services, per the report. 
To be subject to the rules, companies must be found to have “paramount significance for competition across markets,” according to the report. 
Elsewhere in Europe, Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision Blizzard is being looked into by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, Reuters reported in July. 
“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” said Lisa Tanzi, corporate vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, according to the Reuters report.

By Jonathan Lee, Washington Post
Call of Duty is a massive, sprawling video game franchise that has sent players through dozens of battlefields ranging from the beaches of Normandy to the abandoned city of Pripyat to the frozen moon Europa. Now, it has become the staging ground for a new conflict brewing between Sony and Microsoft.
In January, Microsoft announced its intention to buy Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. While the Federal Trade Commission has been scrutinizing the deal in the United States, Brazil also placed Microsoft under review by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (or CADE), the country’s national antitrust regulator, and asked various gaming companies such as Ubisoft, Riot Games, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Sony for comments on the potential merger. Out of the 11 companies CADE reached out to, Sony was the sole objector.
At the heart of Sony’s concern was Microsoft potentially owning Call of Duty, which Sony claimed would position Microsoft at the critical mass of a gaming monopoly. Microsoft had already gained some of gaming’s most revered franchises such as Fallout, The Elder Scrolls and Doom after purchasing ZeniMax Media in 2020. These high profile acquisitions have been integral to Microsoft’s plan to solidify the power of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service where users gain access to a rotating catalogue of downloadable games for a monthly fee.

The National Security Agency last year picked Amazon as the sole vendor for a cloud contract that could be worth potentially as much as $10 billion over the next decade, renewing an existing business relationship.

Technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Netflix are being invited to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance’s hearings next week on alleged anti-competitive practices of big tech firms.
“We are extending invitations to Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and others. Even if  they are not able to attend, there will be representatives from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Competition Commission of India (to communicate their own positions on the matter),” said Jayant Sinha, chairperson of the committee and a Member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party.
On July 21, the committee conducted a hearing that was attended by top executives of eight domestic tech firms, including Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and OYO founder Ritesh Agarwal. Representatives from Flipkart, MakeMyTrip, Zomato and Swiggy also attended the meeting.
“We covered a wide range of topics as digital markets cover everything from e-commerce to ride sharing. After all the hearings are concluded, we will present our findings in a report,” said Sinha.
According to people in the know, there were discussions about widening the ambit of CCI’s powers with regards to the tech industry. Moreover, alleged unfair practices by big tech companies to further their dominance, commissions charged by tech platforms and allegations of predatory pricing also came up.

26,"July 24, 2022",EU Questions Microsoft-Activision Rival Access,"


European antitrust enforcers are asking whether Microsoft would shut rivals out from Activision’s popular video game library as part of a review of the tech giant’s planned $69 billion deal for the game developer, according to people familiar with the matter and documents seen by Politico.
The European Commission circulated questionnaires to competing firms in early July and officials have also been holding meetings with Microsoft’s rivals to discuss their concerns about the record-breaking deal, which is yet to be formally notified in Europe.
According to the Commission’s request for information, regulators are keen to know whether and “how Microsoft could selectively degrade the compatibility and accessibility of Game Pass” on rival platforms. Game Pass is Microsoft’s video game subscription service for Xbox and PC users.  
Competitors have voiced concerns over Microsoft potentially restricting access to some of Activision’s titles, such as Call of Duty,  for rival subscription gaming services if the deal is approved.
While the Commission’s formal review of a deal only kicks off once the companies file for approval, it frequently sends questionnaires during the so-called pre-notification period to gather information that lets it identify potential antitrust issues.

Netflix said on Wednesday it has selected Microsoft Corp as technology and sales partner for its planned ad-supported subscription offering, as the streaming giant looks to plug slowing subscriber growth by rolling out a cheaper plan.
Netflix announced in April that it would introduce a new, lower-priced version of its service in a bid to attract more subscribers. The announcement came as the pioneering subscription service posted its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, and projected deeper losses to come.
Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said in a blog post that Netflix chose Microsoft because of its ability to innovate over time, as well as its for its strong privacy protections.
“It’s very early days and we have much to work through. But our long-term goal is clear. More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers,” Peters said.

The UK competition regulator on Wednesday announced the launch of an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s proposed $68.7 billion acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard.
The probe into what would be Microsoft’s biggest acquisition in its history will focus on whether the deal may substantially lessen competition — or create expectations that it might.
Microsoft has previously said it expects antitrust officials to scrutinize how the deal, announced in January, may affect competition in the video game industry, app stores and even labor markets.
“We expect and think it’s appropriate for regulators to take a close look at this acquisition,” Lisa Tanzi, corporate vice president & general counsel at Microsoft, said in a statement Wednesday. “We have been clear about how we plan to run our gaming business and why we believe the deal will benefit gamers, developers, and the industry.”
“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” Tanzi added. “We remain confident the deal will close in fiscal year 2023 as initially anticipated.”

Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and former chief economist at Microsoft, is joining the Justice Department as its top antitrust economist.
Athey, an expert on the economics of internet platforms — particularly search engines and online advertising, joins the Justice Department as it prepares for trial against Alphabet’s Google and is pursuing an investigation of Apple and another Google case.
Because of her previous work, though, Athey is likely to be recused from the Justice Department’s Google and Apple cases, said two people, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal DOJ matters.
Athey consulted for Microsoft for almost a decade, aiding the company’s years-long antitrust fight against Google. More recently, she served as an economic expert for Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple related to the iPhone-maker’s mobile App Store restrictions.
In her work for Microsoft, Athey worked closely with Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, who represented the Windows-maker in its antitrust battles with the DOJ in the early 2000s and later against Google.
A professor at Stanford since 2013, Athey previously taught at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She resigned last month from the board of directors of Expedia Group, a position she had held since 2015.

30,"June 16, 2022",FTC Looking At Labor Impact Of Microsoft-Activision Merger,"


The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft Corp.’s proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. and how it might impact workers, chair Lina Khan told lawmakers.
In a June 9 letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, Khan confirmed the agency is looking into the proposed deal, noting that the companies previously disclosed the FTC’s merger review.
“I strongly believe that merger investigations must scrutinize the impact on labor markets,” Khan said. “Whenever the FTC initiates a merger review, we are committed to thoroughly examining effects on competition in all relevant markets for potential law enforcement action.”
Khan’s letter was a response to a March 31 missive from Warren and other senators urging the FTC to closely examine how the proposed deal would impact workers at Activision, who have called for greater accountability at the company in the wake of sexual harassment and discrimination allegations.

Microsoft stopped supporting the Internet Explorer web browser on Wednesday, indicating the end is near for a 26-year-old brand with baggage that includes an antitrust case, security flaws and lagging performance. Users will instead be pointed to Microsoft’s newer Edge browser.
While Microsoft doesn’t derive revenue directly from browsers, Edge defaults to the company’s Bing search engine, through which the software and hardware maker generates advertising revenue. That category represents about 6% of Microsoft’s total revenue, at nearly $3 billion in the first quarter.
Microsoft won’t offer technical support or security updates to customers as it focuses more on Edge, a browser that’s available on mobile devices, Mac and even Linux, rather than being confined to Windows. Microsoft released Edge as part of Windows 10 in 2015, to exist alongside Internet Explorer as something new and efficient yet similar to what Windows users already knew.
Internet Explorer still has a small group of devotees, though, in part because it remains the only way to reach certain corporate web applications. It won’t be vanishing yet, even though it’s being retired.
“Over the next few months, opening Internet Explorer will progressively redirect users to our new modern browser, Microsoft Edge with IE mode,” Sean Lyndersay, a general manager at the company, wrote in a blog post. “Users will still see the Internet Explorer icon on their devices (such as on the taskbar or in the Start menu) but if they click to open Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge will open instead with easy access to IE mode. Eventually, Internet Explorer will be disabled permanently as part of a future Windows Update, at which point the Internet Explorer icons on their devices will be removed.”
A “Reload in IE mode” button will appear in the Edge toolbar, and the browser will ask people if they’d like to open a page in IE mode next time, Lyndersay wrote.

32,"June 8, 2022","UK Watchdog To Directly Oversee Amazon, Microsoft Cloud Services","


The UK Treasury released a policy paper on Wednesday (June 8) proposing a new regulatory framework that would provide the Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with new powers to oversee tech firms that provide critical services to the financial industry. 
The government is concerned about the growing dependence of banks on cloud computing, as these services are mostly provided by a handful of players. As of 2020, over 65% of U.K. firms used the same four cloud providers for cloud infrastructure services, according to the Treasury statement. 
If many firms rely on the same third party for material services and this company fails, it could have a systemic impact across the financial system, the paper argues.  
The government doesn’t cite by name which non-financial companies may be “critical” for the industry, but Amazon and Microsoft are two of the companies that may be affected by this regulation. The financial regulators’ current powers are not sufficient to tackle the systemic risks that disruption at a third party providing key services to multiple firms could cause, so the Treasury is proposing new legislation to address this concern. 
First, the Treasury, in consultation with the BoE and the FCA, will designate certain third parties as “critical.” The policy paper doesn’t offer information about the criteria that regulators will use to designate a company as “critical,” only that it will take into account “the number and type of services and the materiality of these services.”
These criteria will be set out in primary legislation, and it is expected that the third parties affected could also make representations to the Treasury about this designation. 
Second, once a company has been designated as “critical,” the financial regulators will be able to make rules relating to the provision of these material services, gather relevant information from critical third parties and take formal action (including enforcement) where needed. More information about these powers is expected via primary legislation, but the Treasury advances that the regulators will be able to enter companies’ premises as part of an investigation, request information and require the production of documents.  
The paper doesn’t include all the potential penalties for the companies if they don’t comply with the regulator’s requests, but as a last resort, the government is considering granting regulators the power to prohibit a critical third party from providing future services or continuing to provide services to firms. 
The government’s next steps are to propose new legislation and publish a discussion paper on this topic shortly after such legislation is introduced. Legislation could be passed within this parliamentary session that started in May as the government included this plan in the Queen’s speech, which usually determines the laws that will be discussed in a parliamentary session.

After complaints from rivals,  Microsoft is relaxing business terms for its cloud computing service in an attempt to avoid a full antitrust probe in Brussels, reported The Financial Times.
The new changes follow concerns from rival cloud providers that Microsoft is using anti-competitive practices to draw customers to its Azure cloud computing platform and away from competitors. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, confirmed last month that Brussels was “actively following up” on a complaint about Microsoft’s cloud service practices. 
Related: Microsoft Responds To Cloud Antitrust Complaints
On Wednesday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the tech giant was taking steps that were “very broad but not exhaustive” as he sought to address concerns from regulators and competitors.
Smith said the changes being introduced were “grounded in feedback” he had received from multiple cloud providers across Europe. In a blog post, he wrote: “Some of the most compelling feedback for me personally came from a CEO who said that he felt that he ‘was a victim of friendly fire in Microsoft’s competition with Amazon’. It was hard to hear this — but he was right.”
At issue is a set of licensing rule changes that make it more expensive to run Microsoft Windows, Office, Windows Serverand SQL Server on cloud services other than Microsoft Azure. In a report Tuesday, Bloomberg spoke to customers affected by the issue, including one that found switching to Google Cloud would cost an extra $50 million in Windows licenses. It’s unclear exactly how much expense the rule changes add for the typical customer, though.
“While not all of these claims are valid, some of them are, and we’ll absolutely make changes soon to address them,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. “We’re committed to listening to our customers and meeting the needs of European cloud providers.”

Microsoft’s security business is growing faster than any of its main products, and now the company is adding heft to its offerings with three new services designed to help organizations spot and respond to cybersecurity incidents.
Microsoft is among the leaders in cloud software and infrastructure, which means its technology is already the backbone for many businesses of all sizes. That puts the company in position to not only make security software available to its client base, but also offer consulting-oriented services in a market where demand far exceeds supply.
The investment comes as organizations ramp up their security spending to manage the increased threats of ransomware attacks and network hacks. Last year, Microsoft and other technology companies pledged to help fill about 500,000 cybersecurity jobs in the U.S., and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said annual research and development spending in cybersecurity would jump to $4 billion from $1 billion.
Security already represents a $15 billion annual business for Microsoft, and in 2021 it increased faster than any other significant product or service the company sold.
Vasu Jakkal, a Microsoft corporate vice president focused on security, told CNBC that a big part of Microsoft’s added spending is on people.
“We’re just expanding the scale because of the demands we are seeing,” Jakkal said.
Among the new products being launched is Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting. It will involve Microsoft engineers flagging issues they find in clients’ devices, Office 365 productivity software installations, cloud applications and identity programs, for $3 per person per month. The launch will put Microsoft in more direct competition with pure-play security software companies like CrowdStrike.

Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people alive and renowned investor, has given his own insight into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, stating that he believes the deal will go through. 
Earlier this year, much to the shock of everyone, Microsoft announced it was planning to acquire Activision Blizzard for just shy of $70 billion. If it goes through, it will be the biggest deal in the history of the gaming industry and give Microsoft ownership of massive franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and many, many more. 
Due to the immensity of the deal, there has been some pushback from politicians and investors, leading some to believe the deal could get shot down.
Warren Buffett, however, has bet that deal will be approved. The billionaire investor’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, increased its position in the company from 2% to 9.5%, a position worth about $6 billion. Buffett made it clear that it was his decision to increase the position. 
“It is my purchase, not the manager who bought it some months ago,” said Buffett. “If the deal goes through, we make some money.”

South Korea’s antitrust regulator said on Thursday it has started to review the proposed deal by US software giant Microsoft to buy leading game developer Activision Blizzard.
The Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said it plans to see if the merger of the two US firms could hurt competition in the online game market, reports Yonhap news agency.
In January, Microsoft announced a plan to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and it asked the KFTC last week to review its proposed takeover for approval.
The US competition watchdog is also reportedly reviewing Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty (CoD) maker gaming company Activision Blizzard.
Microsoft’s acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard is yet another play by the tech giant to secure its stake in the nascent Metaverse and bring more intellectual property (IP) under the Xbox and Game Pass umbrella.
When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony.
Following on the 2014 acquisitions of Mojang (makers of Minecraft) and 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media/Bethesda (makers of Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Fallout), Activision Blizzard brings IP like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush to Microsoft’s portfolio.

EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft’s rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company.
The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.
The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer’s radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France’s OVHcloud and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices. The complaint focuses on the way Microsoft licenses its products, such as its Office productivity suite, that may make it more expensive to use cloud services.
“The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,” the questionnaire said.
Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft’s licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.
They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft’s operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.
Having been at the center of a historic antitrust case in the 90s, Microsoft has often managed to avoid the close scrutiny levelled at other Big Tech companies, such as Google or Meta (formerly Facebook). However, other recent moves by the company have also been questioned, signalling a tougher stance from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

By: Alex Petros (Public Knowledge)
Virtual bullets and explosions dance across the screen, yet I’m far more focused on what’s coming in through my Playstation headset. Two of my best friends live across the country, yet we stay in touch through the team-based online shooter game Overwatch. Bemoaning the substandard play of our competitors (and occasionally other teammates) is interspersed with discussions of our families, professional lives, and significant others. It almost feels as if we are back in the college dorm room where we met a decade ago, instead of three time zones apart.
Our online gatherings, and many others like it, are now in jeopardy. You see, Overwatch is made by Activision Blizzard and the three of us play on Sony’s Playstation console. Microsoft, Sony’s chief gaming rival, has announced it will be acquiring Activision Blizzard for a whopping $68.7 billion. The deal merits rigorous scrutiny by antitrust enforcers.
Defining the Market
“Video games” can be a nebulous market, and strategic companies are more than capable of stretching the market definition to make themselves seem unthreatening to the watchful eye of antitrust scrutiny. For example, mobile games have skyrocketed in popularity and while there is some overlap, few believe a phone to be a viable substitute for a video game console today. A technically demanding game like Overwatch can’t be played competitively on a mobile device. In addition, mobile game controls lack the precision of console controllers and as of now developers exclusively make blockbuster games for consoles, with few exceptions. Mobile games also mostly operate with a different business model — free-to-play, with monetization driven by advertising and subsequent purchases of in-game currency or premium features. Enforcers will need to determine whether mobile games are part of the market or not (they’re probably not).
Video gaming is dominated by three companies (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) across four platforms (Sony’s Playstation 5, Nintendo’s Switch, and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles and PCs). Today’s consoles are more than just some fancy computer hardware and a disc drive. They come with apps, a virtual storefront, and premium services enabling online play and cloud-based gaming. These combine to form an entire ecosystem with multiple ways to monetize consumers.
Of the three major companies, Nintendo is an aberrant player. The Switch lacks the processing power of the other consoles and is focused on exclusive games (Zelda, Mario, etc.) and other metrics like mobility that Sony and Microsoft mostly eschew…

The US Federal Trade Commission has sought additional data from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft related to the antitrust review of their deal, the games developer said in a regulatory filing on Monday.
Microsoft in January agreed to acquire the “Call of Duty” maker for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history. The all-cash deal will bolster Microsoft’s firepower in the booming videogaming market, where it will take on leaders Tencent and Sony.

In order to woo US. and other regulators, the company said in February that it had developed a new set of principles for its app store, including open access to developers who meet privacy and security standards.

French cloud-computing company OVHcloud has filed an antitrust complaint in Europe against Microsoft Corp., adding to recent criticism of the competitive practices at a company that has largely avoided the recent regulatory scrutiny aimed at rival tech giants.
OVHcloud said it filed the complaint with the European Commission, the European Union’s top competition regulator. The complaint focuses on the way Microsoft licenses its products, such as its Office productivity suite, that may make it more expensive to use cloud services.
The complaint, which OVHcloud filed last summer but which hasn’t previously been reported, also alleges that Microsoft’s software doesn’t work as well on other cloud services, making it harder for them to compete, the people said.
“Through abusing its dominant position, Microsoft undermines fair competition and limits consumer choice in the cloud computing services market,” said a spokeswoman for OVHcloud, whose formal name is OVH Groupe SAS.
“Cloud providers enjoy many options to provide cloud services to their customers using Microsoft software, whether purchased by the customer or the partner,” the Microsoft spokesman said in a statement. “We’re continuously evaluating how we can best support partners and make Microsoft software available to customers across all environments, including those of other cloud providers.”
OVHcloud said the complaint was filed jointly with “several companies.” It wouldn’t name the other companies.
As governments around the world have gone after big tech companies, Microsoft has not been at the center of attention. The company has positioned itself as having learned from its own antitrust battles two decades ago when the US Department of Justice and the EU sued the company for its business practices.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced this Wednesday its decision to clear Microsoft’s planned acquisition of artificial intelligence company Nuance Communications.
Although the CMA found that Nuance holds a “strong position in the supply of healthcare transcription software”, the watchdog found no reason for concern regarding competition in this sector following the proposed merger. 
The competition regulator said it is not referring the merger to a Phase 2 investigation under the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002. “Based on the available evidence, the CMA does not believe that the Merged Entity would have the ability to foreclose Microsoft’s rivals.”
“In particular, the CMA considers that the Merged Entity would not be able to foreclose rivals by bundling patient administration tools, patient engagement tools, or remote healthcare tools with healthcare transcription software”, it added.
It ultimately said that the combined offering of the two companies was unlikely to cause a “substantial lessening of competition in the UK in relation to conglomerate effects”, and would not be taking the investigation any further. The UK follows both the European Union and the United States competition authorities in clearing the deal. 
Health transcription services are a mainstay of modern medical practice, taking health providers’ voice recordings and transcribing them into written – often electronic – formats. Such records are increasingly required for compliance, research, and other purposes, making this an attractive area for Artificial Intelligence developers such as Nuance.

By: Damien Geradin (The Platform Law Blog)
It is no secret that Microsoft has charted a rather different course compared to Apple and Google when it comes to ex ante regulation – a course aiming to embrace, rather than fight, regulation (see for example, this May 2021 blog post where Microsoft in principle voiced its support for the EU Digital Markets Act). It is also no secret that Microsoft is at odds with Apple’s (and, to a lesser extent, Google’s) app store policies, with the Seattle-based software company recently filing an amicus brief in support of Epic Games’ appeal before the Ninth Circuit against the ruling of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. As discussed below, to some extent this reflects the starkly different approaches of Microsoft and Apple to cloud gaming, with Microsoft heavily investing in cloud gaming with its Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Apple “block[ing] the emergence of cloud gaming on iOS”, as the CMA found (see the excellent post of our colleague Stijn Huijts on this issue).
It is thus with great interest that I saw yesterday Microsoft’s Brad Smith announce a set of “Open App Store Principles” in what he describes as a proactive move to adapt ahead of regulation. Specifically:
Grounded in existing or forthcoming legislation: The Open App Store Principles are said to be grounded in app store legislation currently being considered across the world, including the US (this is presumably a reference to the Open App Markets Act, recently voted by the US Senate Judiciary Committee), the EU (the DMA), the Republic of Korea (see here), and the Netherlands (presumably this refers to the Dutch Competition Authority’s decision mandating Apple to allow dating app developers to use alternative in-app payment systems; as I explained earlier this week, Apple refuses to comply, begging the question of whether it is a threat to the rule of law).Scope: According to the blog post, the Open App Store Principles shall apply to “the Microsoft Store on Windows and to the next-generation marketplaces [Microsoft] will build for games”. Some of the principles will also immediately apply to the Xbox console store, with Microsoft committing to close the gap on the remaining principles over time (more on this later).Content: The announced principles are said to reflect Microsoft’s commitments in four areas:– Quality, safety, security, and privacy (principles 1-3): Microsoft commits to continue protecting user security and privacy, and allow developers to access its app store as long as they meet reasonable quality and safety standards.– Accountability (principles 4-5): Microsoft commits to hold its own apps at the same standard it holds rival apps, and not to use non-public information from the app store to compete against rivals (this reminds me of Article 6.1(a) of the DMA)).– Fairness and transparency (principles 6-7): Microsoft commits not to unreasonably self-preference its own apps and to be transparent about rules for promotion in its app store.– Developer choice (principles 8-11): In what I consider to be the most interesting part, Microsoft commits to, among others, (i) allow developers to use their own in-app payment processing system, and not disadvantage them if they do so; and (ii) allow developers to communicate directly with their users inside the app on, inter alia, pricing terms.– Operating systems: Finally, Microsoft commits to (i) continue allowing developers for Windows to make their apps available through alternative app stores or sideloading; (ii) continue providing such developers with timely access to interoperability information; and (iii) enable Windows users to use third party app stores and apps, including by changing defaults…

Confidential data reviewed by POLITICO has revealed gatekeeper search engines are funneling low-value ads to smaller search partners.
The report alleges Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp. are using the online advertising market to the detriment of smaller rivals. The action threatens to establish a new antitrust clash in Europe, reported PMNTS. 
These two tech giants appear to be inundating smaller search engine partners with spam ads while keeping the most valuable adverts for themselves, the report found.
The report comes a week after the European Publishers Council (EPC) — an association that includes The New York Times, Germany’s Axel Springer and the UK’s Guardian — filed a complaint with the European Commission against Google, asking the regulator to restore conditions for effective competition in the AdTech value chain.
The European Commission has been investigating Google’s advertising practices since last year, when it sent questionnaires to publishers and advertising companies asking them about the role of Google as middleman in the AdTech value chain.
In addition, the US Department of Justice has been expediting its investigation of Google’s alleged antitrust practices.
Last fall, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, said the European Parliament and European Council should approve legislation regulating Big Tech as soon as possible.
The data, compiled by anonymous researchers working in the AdTech space, found that Google and Microsoft release “low-value and irrelevant ads” to their partners.

Executives at Microsoft are pledging the company’s new video game app store will be governed by open-market principals, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday (Feb. 9).
These remarks were made to reporters ahead of meetings between Microsoft and lawmakers about the company’s landmark purchase of gaming giant Activision Blizzard, reported PYMNTS. 
Among the principles the company pledges to adopt for its store: developers won’t need to use a proprietary, something Apple has been criticized for by lawmakers and developers alike.
“We are more focused on adapting to regulation than fighting against it,” said Microsoft President Brad Smith.
Last month, Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision for $75 billion, its largest purchase ever and a deal that would help bolster the company’s subscription gaming service Game Pass. The service gives users access to a catalog of games for a monthly fee. These users would get to play wildly popular franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft if the deal goes forward.
As many observers have pointed out, the deal is also Microsoft’s bet on the burgeoning metaverse, a 3D world of immersive activities that mix with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
The deal is subject to regulatory approval, with the US Federal Trade Commission trying to determine if the acquisition will hamper competition in the gaming world.

48,"February 8, 2022",Microsoft May Buy Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant,"


Microsoft is considering a deal to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Mandiant became a standalone entity again last year when FireEye Inc – which acquired the company in 2013 – sold its products business and the FireEye name for $1.2 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm Symphony Technology Group.
Mandiant, which has a market capitalization of about $3.6 billion, focuses on cyber-incident response and cybersecurity testing.
A deal to buy Mandiant would help Microsoft beef up its products that protect its clients from cybersecurity threats. The software giant bought two smaller cybersecurity companies in 2021 and said it would spend $20 billion on cybersecurity over the next five years.
Cyberthreats have been rising in severity globally, with Microsoft’s products often in the crosshairs. In March 2021 attackers linked to China used flaws in the code of Microsoft’s Exchange software to break into tens of thousands of organizations. In a breach disclosed in December 2020, suspected Russian hackers compromised popular software from Texas-based firm SolarWinds Corp., inserting malicious code into updates for SolarWinds software, an attack that also impacted Microsoft and many of its customers.

Microsoft’s US$70 billion bid for Activision may be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in what will become its first test to show its new approach to mergers since the joint consultation with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division (DOJ) to review the merger guidelines, reported PYMNTS.
In the US, merger reviews are conducted by the FTC or the DOJ, depending on the sectors affected by the merger. If this merger is reviewed by the FTC, it will be the first big deal that FTC Chair Lina Khan, a noted critic of Big Tech, reviews from Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, or Microsoft. 
Related: Microsoft-Activision Deal To Face Antitrust Scrutiny
Khan has already displayed a tough approach to big deals since she was appointed by President Joe Biden in June 2021. Her first case was Nvidia’s US$40 billion planned acquisition of Arm, which the FTC sued to block in December 2021. The deal may never go to trial as the parties are reportedly considering walking away given the increasing number of regulatory hurdles, including national security concerns in the UK.
The second example, from January, is Lockheed Martin’s US$4.4 billion takeover of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of Khan’s intentions to scrutinize Big Tech companies is the current litigation where the FTC is seeking to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. The FTC will face an uphill road to prove allegations of harm in the court, as the judge expressed in his opinion, “whether the FTC will be able to prove its case and prevail at summary judgment and trial is anyone’s guess.” However, if the regulator succeeds, it will be the biggest divestment since Standard Oil was ordered to break up in 1911.

Microsoft will begin offering more information to customers about how it automatically renews Xbox online gaming subscriptions in Britain, the UK’s competition watchdog stated on Wednesday, January 26.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) secured undertakings from Microsoft for the US tech giant to tell customers upfront about auto-renewals for Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass subscriptions that start at £7 (US$9.50) a month.

Microsoft’s US$69 billion deal to buy video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard is expected to win out with regulators despite vows in Europe and the US to rein in tech titans, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Analysts interviewed by AFP after the merger plan was announced on Tuesday, January 18, said the deal would certainly be scrutinized, but likely less intensely than would an acquisition by Amazon, Google, or Facebook-parent Meta.
“From a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other tech stalwarts,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella “saw a window to make a major bet on consumer while others are caught in the regulatory spotlight and could not go after an asset like this,” Ives added.
The analyst noted that there are bound to be some “speed bumps navigating both the Beltway and Brussels” given the epic size of the deal.

Microsoft is buying “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants stake their claims to a virtual future, reported Reuters.
The all-cash deal announced by Microsoft on Tuesday, January 18, its biggest-ever acquisition, will bolster its firepower in the booming videogaming market where it takes on leaders Tencent and Sony.
It also represents the American multinational’s bet on the “metaverse,” virtual online worlds where people can work, play, and socialize, as many of its biggest competitors are already doing.
“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.
Microsoft’s offer of US$95 per share represents a premium of 45% to Activision’s Friday close. Its shares were up 27% at US$83.35 in early trading, still a steep discount to the offer price, reflecting concerns the deal could get stuck in regulators’ crosshairs.
Microsoft has so far avoided the type of scrutiny faced by Google and Facebook, but this deal, which would make it the world’s third largest gaming company, will put them on lawmakers’ radars, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard.

A month after the European Commission opened an investigation into Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of transcription software developer Nuance Communications, the EU’s competition bureau determined that the $19.7 billion business combination wouldn’t pose a threat to antitrust regulations and doled out an unconditional all-clear to the transaction.
Regulators began looking into the purchase in November, after the companies submitted their proposal for review. At the time, per Reuters, E.U. authorities sent out questionnaires to clients and competitors of Microsoft and Nuance to ask whether they viewed the two companies as competitors and if they believed the merger would negatively impact their own businesses.
Once the preliminary probe had been launched, officials had until Dec. 21 to either extend the investigation or sign off on the acquisition. They ultimately settled on the latter, noting in a statement on Tuesday that “the commission found that the transaction, as notified, would not significantly reduce competition in the transcription software, cloud services, enterprise communication services, customer relationship management, productivity software and PC operating systems markets.”
The investigation focused on a handful of core concerns. The first of these, according to the statement, was the potential overlap between transcription software offered by both Nuance and Microsoft, though regulators concluded that Nuance’s out-of-the-box products—used largely by hospitals and other healthcare clients—are “very different” from the speech recognition capabilities available to users of Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services.

On Monday UK’s antitrust regulator said it will look into Microsoft’s  $16 billion purchase of artificial intelligence and speech technology firm Nuance Communications.
According to Reuters, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has been stepping up its regulation of Big Tech, said it was considering if the deal would result in lesser competition in the UK market.
Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance in April to boost its presence in cloud services for healthcare. The deal has already received regulatory approval in the United States and Australia, without remedies given.

Microsoft has also been in preliminary talks with the CMA ahead of a formal request for approval of the Nuance deal, the sources had said.
The transaction, which was expected to close this year, would be Microsoft’s second-largest deal, following the software giant’s $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016. Burlington, Massachusetts-based Nuance has about 7,100 employees, more than half of whom are outside the US.
British regulators have stepped up scrutiny of tech-related acquisitions. Last month, the competition authority ordered Facebook to undo its purchase of Giphy and sell off the GIF-sharing platform because it found the deal stifles competition for animated images and hurts social media users and advertisers.

The previously unreported outreach is the most extensive by an antitrust authority since the companies announced the acquisition in April, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Microsoft declined to comment, and Nuance did not respond to a request for comment.
After minimal review, the US Departmentof Justice in June and the Australian Competition Commission in October said they would not contest the deal. The companies filed for approval from the European Commission’s competition bureau last month, and the regulator has until Dec. 21 to clear the deal or open a bigger investigation.
The companies had expected to close the deal by the end of this year, but said last month the timeline could slip to early next year.
The questionnaire asks whether Microsoft and Nuance are competitors and whether a tie-up could affect clients and rivals, including whether Microsoft could favor Nuance over competing services.

Microsoft announced a new round of technologies aimed at making its cloud computing services work in data centers it does not own – including the cloud data centers of its rivals.
The strategy, Microsoft executives and analysts say, has been key to the company’s rise in the cloud computing infrastructure market, which research firm Gartner estimates hit $64.3 billion and where Microsoft is second only to market leader Amazon.com’s Amazon Web Services. Microsoft said revenue from Azure, its flagship cloud offering, grew 48%, results that helped it overtake Apple  as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.
Microsoft’s strategy has involved constructing its most lucrative cloud software services, such as database tools, so that they can run inside its own data centers, those owned by customers or even those of rivals like Amazon.
Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence chief Scott Guthrie told Reuters that the move has persuaded some customers to use its services when they cannot always use Microsoft’s data centers. Royal Bank of Canada, Guthrie said, faces legal requirements to keep some of its computing work in its own data centers and uses a technology called Azure Arc to connect those facilities to Microsoft’s cloud.

EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies by asking Microsoft’s rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product gives it greater clout, reported Reuters.
In a questionnaire sent to rivals and seen by Reuters, the European Commission is focusing on the period 2016 to 2021. Microsoft introduced Teams in early 2017 to compete with Slack and others in the fast-growing workplace collaboration market.
Slack, bought by business software maker Salesforce in July, took its grievance over Microsoft’s Teams software to the Commission last year.
Microsoft, which has been handed €2.2 billion (US$2.6 billion) in EU fines for cases involving so-called tying and other practices in the previous decade, declined to comment.
Slack alleged that tying or bundling Teams with Office was illegal and urged the EU competition agency to separate the two.
It claimed that Microsoft pre-installs the workplace chat, it was difficult to uninstall and that the US company refused to provide information which would allow rival products to work with Teams and Office.
This has prompted the Commission to ask if bundled products give companies access to data that may increase their market power in both markets and at the same time make it harder for rivals, in particular those with only product, to compete.

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the company “is on the right side of history” in the antitrust debates about whether big technology companies abuse user privacy and squash competition, reported Bloomberg. 
While Congress and U.S. regulators have clashed with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. over the companies’ business practices, Microsoft hasn’t received the same kind of scrutiny more than 20 years after it was sued by the U.S. Justice Department on antitrust issues.
The software company “makes sure” user privacy and internet safety are among its highest priorities for products “and then when it comes to competition, I mean you should go talk to the people who are investing a lot of capital and a lot of M&A competing with Microsoft and we welcome that,” Nadella said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
During the interview, the Microsoft CEO also spoke about cybersecurity threats, the future of remote work and the company’s rivalry with Alphabet’s Google.
Nadella said he is concerned about the wave of hacks in the past few months, which have included ransomware attacks that stopped business at a major pipeline company and food producer in the US.
“We have another real pandemic, which is a cyber” pandemic, he said. “The level of attacks for sure have increased, but the need for our response to be top notch has also increased. We just have to get better as an industry.”
Nadella also discussed tensions with Google, following the end of a five-year cease-fire between the two companies, which mutually agreed not to fuel legal lobbying efforts against one another. He said he “has a lot of respect” for Google and its leadership.
“We’re fighting the good fight to sort of compete against colossal lead in that space,” he said of digital advertising sales, which is led by Google and Facebook.
Nadella weighed in on Microsoft’s work-from-home policy, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and accommodating “changed expectations” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke with Bloomberg Television after appearing at Microsoft’s Inspire conference for partners, where the company among its announcements unveiled a cloud-based version of Windows aimed at remote workers.

The US Department of Defense announced it’s calling off the US$10 billion cloud contract that was the subject of a legal battle involving Amazon and Microsoft. But it’s also announcing a new contract and soliciting proposals from both cloud service providers where both will likely clinch a reward.
The JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, deal has become one of the most tangled contracts for the Department of Defense. In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that “due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”
Shares of Microsoft were down about 0.4% following the news and Amazon shares were up 3.5% after already reaching a 52-week high.
The fight over a cloud computing project does not appear to be completely over yet. The Pentagon stated in the press release that it still needs enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability.
The agency stated it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.
The lucrative JEDI contract was intended to modernize the Pentagon’s IT operations for services rendered over as many as 10 years. Microsoft was awarded the cloud computing contract in 2019, beating out market leader Amazon Web Services.
A month later, Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS, filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims protesting the JEDI decision.

Microsoft will decrease the share of money it charges independent developers that publish PC games on its online store, starting in August, reported The New York Times.
Developers will keep 88% of the revenue from their games, up from 70%. That could make Microsoft’s store more attractive to independent studios than competitors like Valve’s gaming store, called Steam, which typically starts by taking a 30% cut. Epic Games’ store takes 12%.
“We want to make sure that we’re competitive in the market,” said Sarah Bond, a Microsoft vice president who leads the gaming ecosystem organization. “Our objective is to have a leading revenue share and really a leading platform.”
The share of revenue that developers get to keep has come under greater scrutiny across the tech industry. Google and Apple have faced antitrust questions for the 30% fees they charge developers whose programs appear in their app stores.

Microsoft has agreed to acquire speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications for US$19.7 billion, adding to a series of big deals the company has struck to offer an expanded range of software tools to its customers.
The two companies on Monday, April 12, announced that Microsoft agreed to pay US$56 per Nuance share in the all-cash deal, a 23% premium over Friday’s closing price. The deal value includes Nuance debt, the companies said.
The acquisition is Microsoft’s second largest under CEO Satya Nadella after the company spent about US$26 billion for professional network LinkedIn in 2016.
Nuance, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, was a pioneer in speech recognition and artificial intelligence technology. Its software formed the basis of Apple’s Siri voice assistant before the Cupertino, California-based company switched to an in-house version. Nuance has explored a possible sale as far back as 2014, when Samsung Electronics and private-equity firms were seen as the most likely buyers.

UK-based pre-owned software license reseller ValueLicensing has filed a lawsuit in the London High Court against Microsoft for abusing its dominant position in the European markets to restrict resale of perpetual licenses for Windows and other company products, reported TechRadar.
In its claim, ValueLicensing calls into question certain contractual practices employed by Microsoft, which it contends have stifled the supply of pre-owned Microsoft licenses in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). 
The license reseller argues Microsoft’s contractual practices go against the spirit of a 2012 European Court ruling that allowed the resale of perpetual licenses bought within the EEA as long as they are for an unlimited period.
The controversial clause, which ValueLicensing claims has been in force since at least 2016, forces organizations to agree not to resale their perpetual licenses in order to get a bulk discount. 
It argues that with the clause Microsoft has abused its dominant position in the market to undermine the activities of its reseller rivals and has allowed the Redmond-based software giant to assume a monopolistic position.
“In purchasing software, public and private-sector organizations presently have little option but to move to subscriptions offered by Microsoft, because there are so few preowned perpetual licenses available now, as a result of Microsoft’s campaign to almost entirely drain the market,” said ValueLicensing’s founder and managing director, Jonathan Horley.
ValueLicensing is asking the High Court in London to award damages for the losses it has suffered as a result of Microsoft’s conduct, to the tune of £270 million (US$371 million).

Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar deal to build customized versions of its HoloLens goggles for the US Army is moving forward, one year after the Senate considered freezing half the contract, reported Bloomberg.
The deal, initially unveiled three years ago, is now worth as much as $21.9 billion over 10 years, according to Microsoft. The agreement runs for an initial five years, with an option to add another five years. The software maker will manufacture the augmented-reality devices in the US The Army announced the contract Wednesday on its website.
The initial commitment includes outfitting the Army’s entire Close Combat Force, more than 120,000 soldiers, Microsoft said. The contract also includes some Azure cloud services.
The program, known as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, or IVAS, aims to develop a “heads-up display” for US ground forces, similar to those fighter pilots use in the cockpit. The system would let commanders project information onto a visor in front of a soldier’s face, and would include other features such as night vision. In October 2018, the US Army awarded Microsoft a $480 million contract to adapt its HoloLens AR headset, a set of goggles that overlay holograms on top of a user’s field of view, for the program.

Microsoft is in talks to buy messaging platform Discord for more than US$10 billion, Bloomberg News reported.
Discord has reached out to potential buyers and Microsoft is one of them, according to the report which cited people familiar with the matter. One person said it was more likely to go public than sell itself.
Discord, which is valued at around US$7 billion as of last December, is a platform on which users coordinate group activities such as games, discussions, and even virtual parties.
The Xbox maker has been seeking to strengthen its video game offerings with US$7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax Media last year, its biggest gaming acquisition ever.
The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the prospects of gaming companies as people stayed at home and turned to video games for entertainment during lockdowns.
With its strong gaming business, Microsoft has also been looking to own mass social media platforms. Its last big social media deal was the US$26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, while it failed in its bid for short video app TikTok’s US assets in September last year.

Microsoft’s professional networking site LinkedIn, one of the few US social networks available to mainland Chinese users, is pausing new member registrations in the country as the company works to ensure it remains in compliance with national law.
“We’re a global platform with an obligation to respect the laws that apply to us, including adhering to Chinese government regulations for our localised version of LinkedIn in China,” Microsoft stated according to The Wall Street Journal.
LinkedIn, which entered China in 2014, is a rare example of a US social network that remains accessible within the country, where a government-built firewall blocks nearly all of the platform’s popular peers, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and, most recently, the live-audio chat app Clubhouse.
Instead, China has cultivated its own social media ecosystem consisting of the likes of microblogging site Weibo and messaging app WeChat for its more than 900 million internet users. Home-grown professional networking platforms such as Maimai – LinkedIn’s biggest rival in China – have also attracted a considerable number of users.

Microsoft and Google sparred Friday over their practices and treatment of news outlets in a battle between antitrust targets of past and present, reported CNBC.
In his written testimony for a hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Friday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Google has made journalism outlets dependent upon its vast array of services, including analytics and advertising tools, while profiting from access to their content. Smith said Google relies on content from these outlets to keep its users engaged, citing his own experience with Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
Smith said referral traffic from Google has real value to news outlets, but “monetizing that traffic has become increasingly difficult for news organizations because most of the profit has been squeezed out by Google.” He pointed to a steep decline in newspaper advertising revenue from $49.4 billion in 2005 to $14.3 billion in 2018, according to Pew Research. Over the same period, he said, Google’s ad revenue grew from $6.1 billion to $116 billion.
“This is not a coincidence,” he said.
Google swung back at Smith in a statement released ahead of the hearing, calling back to Microsoft’s period of antitrust scrutiny two decades ago.
“We respect Microsoft’s success and we compete hard with them in cloud computing, search, productivity apps, video conferencing, email and many other areas,” Google’s senior vice president of Global Affairs Kent Walker said in a blog post. “Unfortunately, as competition in these areas intensifies, they are reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests.”
“They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival,” Walker wrote. “And their claims about our business and how we work with news publishers are just plain wrong.”

Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are among major tech companies that have complained to US antitrust regulators regarding NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm. Bloomberg reported that at least once complaining company wants the deal killed, though it did not specify which. The concern from the tech giants is that NVIDIA purchasing Arm will hurt competition.
Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are asking antitrust officials to intervene with the deal, according to sources that spoke with Bloomberg that have asked to not be identified as they aren’t authorized to publicly speak on the subject.
NVIDIA officially started to acquire Arm limited in September 2020, though rumors of a potential deal started in July 2020. The deal price was valued at US$40 billion and was announced by NVIDIA.
Arm licenses out its chip designs and software to several major tech companies, including Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Amazon, and many others. Most people have used one of their chips on a phone, tablet, or PC at some point. Bloomberg calls Arm the “Switzerland of the industry” and highlights the concern that NVIDIA owning Arm could limit access to chips for rival companies.
According to Bloomberg, NVIDIA claims that there isn’t any incentive to change the neutrality of Arm. The company cites the purchase price of Arm as a reason to not change what’s working, but Bloomberg states that rival companies and many people don’t believe that to be the case.

Microsoft was in talks with US$51 billion Pinterest for a possible acquisition deal, but the discussions are currently on hold, Financial Times reported on Thursday, February 11, citing sources.
The discussions were part of Microsoft’s strategy to snap up social platforms with engaged communities that could operate parallel to its cloud, one of the sources told FT.
Pinterest is a social media community where people curate their own virtual corkboards with lifestyle ideas — recipes, hairstyles, décor, and more. It has experienced a pandemic-fueled surge in popularity, with 459 million members and a 600% increase in market value since the virus took hold in March. In contrast, Microsoft, valued at US$1.83 trillion, saw an 80% increase from a pandemic low.
The deal would have been Microsoft’s biggest acquisition to date — and President Joe Biden’s first big tech mega-merger to consider. Microsoft mostly falls under the antitrust radar because it largely does business with corporate and government entities.
Microsoft had previously looked into the acquisition of the Chinese social video platform TikTok, but Oracle stepped in and put the kibosh on the deal. Over the years, Microsoft has scooped up several prominent companies, including LinkedIn for $26 billion in 2016, GitHub and Minecraft, FT reported.
Pinterest went public in 2019 at US$19 a share and raised US$1.43 billion at a US$10 billion valuation. It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange April 18, 2019. It had 82 million regular users, about 80% of which are a powerful demographic — American mothers.
Pinterest is also taking advantage of the social commerce trend, integrating augmented reality features like virtual try-on tools and teaming up with Shopify to expand the availability of merchandise.

82,"February 7, 2021",Microsoft CEO Says Big Tech Antitrust Issues Can Be Solved With Laws,"


Microsoft President Brad Smith said that though Microsoft isn’t a target for these new big tech antitrust cases, there are key lessons governments should take from its 2001 case, reported CNET.
“Twenty years ago, almost solely the vehicle that governments used was an investigation and a lawsuit. It was a case against individual companies,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said Tuesday, February 2, during an editorial roundtable with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. This time around, Smith said, governments appear to realize that legislation can help solve larger concerns about competition. “I think regulators have broadly concluded that cases are both too narrow and too slow.”
The European Union has introduced ideas like the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to spell out how much companies with large user bases can promote their own products to users ahead of those from a competitor, and the Digital Services Act, which would put pressure on companies to do a better job moderating their platforms. Tech companies could face fines of up to 10% of their global revenue — easily reaching into the billions of dollars — for breaking these rules if they’re implemented.
The EU isn’t the only government targeting tech. Microsoft’s comments come at a time when governments around the world are expressing concerns about increasing signs of bad behavior among tech companies. Amazon, Apple and Google have been accused of kneecapping competitors by pushing their own products to the top of search results, deservedly or not. 
To Nadella, this is part of a larger problem with the tech world, where companies worry about growing first before they worry about unintended consequences that come with that type of scale. For example, he said, companies need to consider how their growth can impact people’s trust. And whether the company’s being fair as it grows.
“The business model and the technology need to account for the unintended consequence, with the unit of scale being one,” he said to CNET.
For many tech watchers, that’s a bit rich coming from the CEO of Microsoft, a company whose software reached a worldwide scale so quickly and forcefully that it eventually led to the antitrust ruling in 2001.

Microsoft stated on Wednesday, February 3, it would never threaten to leave Australia after Google suggested it could pull its widely used search engine from the country, reported CNBC.
Google made the threat last month after the Australian government proposed a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for the right to link to their content.
“One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, in a statement.
“We are committed to supporting the country’s national security and economic success.”
Microsoft is well placed to capitalize from any fallout between Google and Australia. Google currently dominates search in the country, boasting a 94.5% market share, according to web analytics firm StatCounter, while Microsoft’s Bing holds just 3.6%.  
Smith said that he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week, who recently told reporters that Australia “did not respond to threats.”

Microsoft reached out to Australia’s competition regulator to open up Apple’s iPhones and iPads to competition and ensure Apple can no longer block competing apps, reported The Australian Financial Times.
In a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Microsoft strongly criticized the walled-garden approach Apple takes to its phones and tablets, and suggested the regulator get Apple to open up its devices so they operate more like Windows 10.
The software giant, which itself battled regulators and legislators over its monopolistic practices 20 years ago, recently vowed to always allow competitors to distribute Windows 10 apps whichever way they pleased, and that it would always treat developers fairly if they chose to distribute their apps on the Microsoft Store.
Apple prevents app developers from distributing iPhone and iPad apps through any means other than the Apple App Store, which charges a 30% commission on many purchases, and it places onerous conditions on the App Store that many developers complain stifles competition.

The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that Oracle had been chosen as the winner in bidding for TikTok, and that an announcement would be made soon that Oracle will be TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the US. The deal would apparently fall short of an outright sale of the popular app.
That report came shortly after Microsoft said in a blog post that its bid for TikTok had been turned down. Neither Microsoft nor ByteDance offered an explanation for why the deal was rejected.
“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” Microsoft said. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.

Two months ago, Slack filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission against Microsoft for bundling Microsoft Teams with Office 365, and in a recent filing, the company revealed that they are concerned about retaliation by Microsoft due to this.
The concern was revealed in their latest 10-Q filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission which noted “Furthermore, we could be subject to retaliatory or other adverse measures by Microsoft, its employees, or agents in response to the complaint that we filed with the European Commission.”
The San Francisco-based company has been outspoken in its criticism of Microsoft, accusing the Redmond company of illegally bundling its Teams software with its widely used Office apps. It’s common for companies to caution investors about standard risks and uncertainties associated with such legal actions. But the new filing takes Slack’s public statements against Microsoft to another level, going beyond its core allegations to warn that its larger rival could strike back in an unspecified way against Slack for making those claims, reported GeekWire. 
The filing also stated, “Slack currently interoperates with Microsoft products, including Teams, in limited capacities but it is possible that Microsoft may be uncooperative with any future efforts for Slack to interoperate with Teams or other Microsoft products, which could limit Slack’s functionality and make Slack less attractive to users of Microsoft products.”

TikTok does not operate in China, and such a deal would not extend to its China-facing sister app Douyin. Meanwhile, Microsoft executives have sought to assuage the Chinese government as it seeks to avoid being caught in crossfire between Beijing and Washington, two people said. One person close to Microsoft pushed back on the suggestion that the US tech group was discussing asset swaps in China as part of a deal.
The shift from Sunday underscores how preliminary the talks between the two sides remain as they race to meet a mid-September deadline to reach a deal and prevent TikTok from being banned in the US.  
One person close to ByteDance’s Asia-Pacific operations suggested that Microsoft had been attracted to the idea of buying all of TikTok’s global business by the difficulty of separating back-office functions such as HR and to ensure that TikTok users in one country could still use the app if they travelled to another.

The Trump administration has been weighing TikTok’s fate since last year, launching an investigation into the short video company amid fears that its Bejing-based parent ByteDance shares customer information with the Communist Chinese government.
“The question is, given China’s civil-military infusion … can we trust any company that operates in China, has servers in China, has software in China, to protect your children?” Navarro told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” on Monday.
ByteDance entered into talks about a month ago with Microsoft to buy TikTok’s US operations as a way to save the business from a decision by the administration that would prevent the popular app from being used by US consumers.
Microsoft confirmed Sunday that it was in talks over a potential TikTok purchase.
“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns,” the company said in a statement. “It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.”

95,"August 2, 2020",Microsoft Interested In TikTok Acquisition After Talks With Trump Sunday,"


Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella spoke with US President Donald Trump on Sunday to salvage the company’s effort to buy TikTok’s operations in the US and several other countries, reported The Wall Street Journal.Microsoft, in a blog post Sunday, said it would move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok parent Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., over a potential purchase and aims to complete the negotiations by Sept. 15.
The statement, which was the software giant’s first confirmation it was interested in acquiring TikTok’s US business, said the deal talks also entail the app’s service in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
US officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans to China’s authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so. Officials also worry that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform’s moderators are censoring content to appease Beijing.The Wall Street Journal and other outlets Friday reported Microsoft’s interests in the deal. Soon after, Mr. Trump said he opposed a transaction and that he preferred to ban the app, temporarily pausing the talks between Microsoft and ByteDance and throwing uncertainty over the discussions.
“Microsoft appreciates the US Government’s and President Trump’s personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country,” the company said in its statement. The Redmond, Wash.-based company said it would continue the dialogue with the US government, including the president, as talks progress.
With TikTok, Microsoft said in its statement Sunday, it would ensure the data of American TikTok users would be transferred to the US where it would remain and that it would ensure that data from Americans stored overseas would be deleted once transferred. Microsoft said that TikTok, under its ownership, would build on the popular user experience while adding privacy and security protections.

96,"July 22, 2020",Slack Files Competition Complaint Against Microsoft In The EU,"


Slack has filed an anti-competitive complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission. “The complaint details Microsoft’s illegal and anti-competitive practice of abusing its market dominance to extinguish competition in breach of European Union competition law,” reported The Wall Street Journal.
Slack alleges that Microsoft has “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”
“Microsoft is reverting to past behavior,” claims David Schellhase, general counsel at Slack. “They created a weak, copycat product and tied it to their dominant Office product, force installing it and blocking its removal, a carbon copy of their illegal behavior during the ‘browser wars.’ Slack is asking the European Commission to take swift action to ensure Microsoft cannot continue to illegally leverage its power from one market to another by bundling or tying products.”
Microsoft claimed Slack doesn’t have the “breadth and depth” to reinvent work, and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield has previously said that Microsoft is “unhealthily preoccupied with killing us.”
The competition between the two companies first began nearly four years ago when Slack paid for a full-page newspaper ad to “welcome” Microsoft Teams as a competitor. Microsoft overtook Slack usage a year ago, and has hit big user numbers recently thanks to pandemic-related demand. Microsoft revealed it had 75 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams back in April, and the company may well update that figure during its earnings call later today.

Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith reportedly expressed concerns about the Apple App Store in a meeting with the US House antitrust committee investigating dominant tech companies.
The meeting came a few weeks before the House’s Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee is set to grill prominent tech executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet and Google CEO Sundai Pichai.
Amid the ongoing antitrust probe, the committee met with Smith via videoconference earlier in the summer, The Information reported. According to sources familiar with the meeting, the primary goal was to get Microsoft’s perspective as a major technology company that has faced past antitrust regulation. 
But The Information notes that Smith also discussed some of Microsoft’s “concerns” about how Apple operates its App Store — an issue at the forefront of the House committee’s investigation.
Specifically, the concerns centered on the “arbitrariness of Apple’s practices around approving apps, while also criticizing Apple’s requirement that developers use the company’s payment mechanism through their apps.” Smith did not levy any criticisms against other tech companies, sources claimed.
Spotify, Basecamp and other companies have complained about Apple’s 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchases made through its payment system. In June, the House antitrust chairperson called the fees “highway robbery.”
Apple, for its part, says that those fees are meant to ensure consistency across the App Store — not to generate excess profits.

 Microsoft has expressed interest in buying Warner Bros’ gaming unit, The Information reported on Monday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Warner Bros parent AT&T was discussing a sale of its Interactive Entertainment gaming division that owns popular videogame “Mortal Kombat” for a deal that could be worth about $4 billion, CNBC reported last month. However, Warner Bros. parent company AT&T has yet to decide whether it will sell the business, but is weighing the possibility in order to pay down its $154 billion in debt, The Information said. Investment bank LionTree is reportedly helping AT&T field interested parties, but no deal is currently imminent.
An acquisition of the business, which consists of game development studios scattered around the US, Canada and the UK, would help Microsoft expand the game-making capabilities of its Xbox group. But Warner’s parent, AT&T, hasn’t yet decided whether to sell the business. It is weighing the possibility as it looks at ways of paying down its $154 billion in debt, which stems partly from its 2018 acquisition of Time Warner, now known as WarnerMedia.

Microsoft’s Brad Smith, taking a subtle hit at Apple’sApp Store, called for regulators to look into possible antitrust violations over the way companies are treating stores for those who want to distribute products.
Smith didn’t name Apple directly, but said that some stores were crafting very high barriers and “increasingly say there is only one way to get on to our platform and that is to go through the gate that we ourselves have created.”
“In some cases they create a very high price per toll — in some cases 30% of your revenue has to go to the toll keeper,” he said, speaking at a Politico event Thursday (June 18), according to Bloomberg.

Slack is partnering with Amazon in a multiyear agreement that means all Amazon employees will be able to start using Slack. The deal comes just as Slack faces increased competition from Microsoft Teams, and it will also see Slack migrate its voice and video calling features over to Amazon’s Chimeplatform alongside a broader adoption of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Amazon’s roll out of Slack to all of its employees is a big part of the deal, thanks to an enterprise-wide agreement. It’s not immediately clear how many of Amazon’s 840,000 employees will be using Slack, though. Up until today, Slack’s biggest customer has been IBM, which is rolling out Slack to its 350,000 employees.
While Slack has long used AWS to power parts of its chat app, it’s now committing to using Amazon’s cloud services as its preferred partner for storage, compute, database, security, analytics, machine learning, and future collaboration features. The deal means it’s unlikely we’ll see Slack turn to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services or Google Cloud to power parts of its service in the foreseeable future.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is demanding information from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft on their mergers over the past nine years, significantly increasing the pressure on the tech industry’s biggest players amid growing antitrust scrutiny, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The agency announced on Tuesday, February 11, that it issued the investigative subpoenas to the companies, seeking details on deals that fall below the threshold of normal federal antitrust reviews, as part of a study into acquisitions of startups.
The FTC has been particularly focused on re-examining mergers that already have been approved by the government. That re-examination could eventually lead the FTC to try to unwind deals that it finds to be having anticompetitive effects now, officials have said.
According to the Journal, the FTC action reflects growing concern in Washington and around the country that some US tech companies have grown so large and powerful that they have begun to squelch competition in various ways and harm consumers.
In a joint statement, the two Democrats on the five-member panel urged the Commission to study “consumer protection issues arising from the privacy and data security practices of technology companies, including social media platforms.”
“In particular, we encourage the FTC to study whether and, if so, how content curation and targeted advertising practices impact data collection, use, and sharing,” said the statement from Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra.

104,"January 21, 2020","How to lose a monopoly: Microsoft, IBM and antitrust","
By Benedict Evans
When Steve Wozniak created the original Apple I in 1975, IBM dominated the computing industry. It was nicknamed ‘Big Blue’, it was so far ahead of its competitors that people talked about ‘IBM and the seven dwarves’, and it had just come through yet another anti-trust case. IBM’s dominance, of course, was based on the mainframe, which was the central paradigm of the computing industry, and it had sealed its dominance just a decade earlier with the launch of the 360 system. However, over the next decade it became obvious that the flood of PCs that followed the Apple 1 were going to overtake the mainframe. All of the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved to the PC. Indeed, PCs created the very idea that software could be a separate industry, and not just something that was bundled with your hardware. Microsoft, not IBM, dominated the PC ecosystem, and so Microsoft became the centre of the tech industry – it became the new sun in the solar system. 
The funny thing is, though, that mainframes didn’t go away. IBM went through a near-death experience in the 1990s, but mainframes carried on being used for mainframe things and IBM remained a big tech company. In fact, IBM’s mainframe installed base (measured in MIPS) has grown to be over ten times larger since 2000. Most people working in Silicon Valley today weren’t even born when mainframes were the centre of the tech industry, but they’re still there, inside the same big companies, doing the same big company things. (This isn’t just about IBM either – the UK’s sales tax system runs on DEC’s VAX. Old tech has a long half-life). Mainframes carried on being a good business a long time after IBM stopped being ‘Big Blue’.  
Much the same thing then happened to Microsoft. 20 years after the Apple 1, Microsoft launched Windows 95, which sealed its dominance of the PC industry, but Netscape had launched a year earlier, and Netscape and the web ended Microsoft’s dominance just as the PC had ended IBM’s dominance – the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved elsewhere. Instead of creating software and companies around Windows APIs, the industry moved to creating software and companies around the internet and, especially, around the web. Microsoft never had dominance in the web, though it tried, just as IBM never had dominance in PCs, though it tried. And so in the 1970s, people worried about what IBM might do, and in the 1990s people worried about with Microsoft might do, but today, very few people in tech worry about what Microsoft might do – they worry about Google or Apple or Facebook or Amazon. Microsoft (or even IBM) might be a competitor, but they no longer have that dominance. Indeed, if you talk to senior Microsoft execs about this, they will say that for 20 years everything in tech was a PC accessory, but now the PC is just a smartphone accessory.

105,"January 20, 2020","US: Microsoft, IBM and Google granted access to medical records","
Hospitals have granted Microsoft, International Business Machines, and Amazon the ability to access identifiable patient information under deals to crunch millions of health records, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
This breadth of access wasn’t always spelled out by hospitals and tech giants when the deals were struck.
The scope of data sharing in these and other recently reported agreements reveals a powerful new role that hospitals play—as brokers to technology companies racing into the US$3 trillion health-care sector. Rapid digitization of health records in recent years and privacy laws enabling companies to swap patient data have positioned hospitals as a primary arbiter of how such sensitive data is shared. 
“Hospitals are massive containers of patient data,” said Lisa Bari, a consultant and former lead for health information technology for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center. 
Hospitals can share patient data as long as they follow federal privacy laws, which contain limited consumer protections, she said. “The data belongs to whoever has it.”
Microsoft and Providence, a Renton, Washington, hospital system with data for about 20 million patient visits a year, are developing cancer algorithms by using doctor’s notes in patient medical records. The notes haven’t been stripped of personally identifiable information, according to Providence. 
And an agreement between IBM and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, to jointly develop artificial intelligence allows the hospital to share personally identifiable data for specific requests, people involved in the agreement said—though so far the hospital hasn’t done so and has no current plans to do so, according to hospital and IBM officials. 
Microsoft executive Peter Lee in July described how his company would use Providence patient data without identifying information for algorithm development. In a December statement, he said patients’ personal health data remains in Providence’s control and declined to comment further.

Apple, Microsoft and BMW, together with a broad group of other tech companies and carmakers, have called on the EU to take action against so-called patent trolls, who buy up patents in the hope of making a profit through licenses or lawsuits. 
In a letter to the European Commission, the group of 35 companies and four industry groups warned that patent trolls were stifling innovation. 
They called for Thierry Breton, the new commissioner who oversees industrial policy and technology, to draw up tough rules to stop patent hoarders from “gaming the system”.
In particular, they asked for EU courts to take a softer approach, noting that in the past judges have issued blanket bans on products when just a single patent was found to be infringed. 
“The experience of our member companies indicates that Europe’s patent system is not working properly and is undermining Europe’s ability to compete globally in the next frontier of technologies,” said Patrick Oliver, executive director of IP2Innovate, one of the industry groups that signed the letter.
“We are urging Commissioner (Thierry) Breton to draft a set of guidelines that address imbalances in the patent system — in particular guidelines that support the application of a proportionality requirement in patent enforcement by judges around Europe, as required by EU law,” the companies said.

By Eric Newcomer, Bloomberg
Hi all, it’s Eric. Two decades ago, Microsoft Corp. fended off the U.S. government’s best effort to break the company into pieces. But even as it kept regulators from cleaving it apart, Microsoft seemed to fall into something of an antitrust-induced stupor. According to one popular theory, the company’s executives became overly worried about what their counterparts in legal might say, slowing innovation. 
Today’s technology giants are staring down their own antitrust dilemma and seem resolved not to get too fussed about it. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are venturing into all sorts of industries even as the regulars are bearing down. It’s almost like they’ve studied Microsoft’s regulator-abetted lethargy and are making sure to avoid it.
Google recently announced it would pay $2.1 billion to buy Fitbit, the wearable device maker, and is also building a search engine for a hospital network, scooping up healthcare data on “millions of people across 21 states” in the process. (Google says there’s nothing nefarious about the effort, dubbed “Project Nightingale.”) It’d like to be your banker, too. This week, the Wall Street Journal revealed Google’s plans to create checking accounts in a partnership with Citigroup Inc.

Microsoft stated in a blog post on Monday, November 11, that it would honor California’s privacy law throughout the United States, expanding the impact of a strict set of rules meant to protect consumers and their data.
Microsoft wrote in the post it was a “strong supporter” of the California Consumer Privacy Act, known as CCPA, which will go into effect on January 1. 
The California law is widely expected to harm profits over the long term for technology companies, retailers, advertising firms, and other businesses dependent on collecting consumer data to track users and increase sales. 
The law raised fears among companies of a rise in a patchwork of state laws and prompted efforts in Washington to write federal legislation that would preempt state efforts. 
“Under CCPA, companies must be transparent about data collection and use, and provide people with the option to prevent their personal information from being sold. Exactly what will be required under CCPA to accomplish these goals is still developing,” Julie Brill, Microsoft’s chief privacy officer, wrote in the post.

The nation’s antitrust enforcers and Congress are stepping up their scrutiny of the tech giants. Disruptive investigations, federal lawsuits and new rules could loom for Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.
The companies and their executives don’t need to look far for guidance about how this could all play out. One of their top competitors, Microsoft, faced the government’s ire in the 1990s, leading to a bruising battle in federal court. The company was found to have repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws, and it agreed to change its corporate behavior as part of an eventual settlement.
“The Microsoft case is incredibly front and center, the road map, in all these discussions about big tech and antitrust,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University and co-author of “The Microsoft Antitrust Cases: Competition Policy for the Twenty-First Century.”

This article discusses one specific issue raised by new technologies in antitrust investigations: the production of documents stored abroad. Until recently government agencies could only request the production of documents available on the territory where they had jurisdiction, but new technologies have challenged the concept of what is “available” in a particular territory. Generally the governing law is silent in this respect. Over the last couple of years legislatures and courts around the globe have started to address this issue. This article reviews these recent developments, with a particular focus on U.S. antitrust proceedings and an overview of the main developments in Canada and Europe.

Microsoft’s upcoming US$7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub has cleared another major hurdle: the EU has approved the deal after determining that there are no antitrust concerns in Microsoft buying the popular open-source software repository, reported the Financial Times.
European antitrust authorities have reportedly determined that “the merged entity would continue to face significant ongoing competition from other players.” Officials also aren’t concerned that Microsoft could “undermine the open nature of GitHub,” noting that developers have other options they could switch to if Microsoft’s stewardship of the platform isn’t to their liking.
The GitHub purchase was first announced in June this year, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella commenting at the time, “We are committed to being stewards of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-first ethos, operate independently and remain an open platform. We will always listen to developer feedback and invest in both fundamentals and new capabilities.”

“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Nadella said in a release when announcing the deal in May.

117,"September 17, 2018",EU: Commission ruling on Microsoft’s GitHub acquisition expected next month,"

Back in June, Microsoft announced plans to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion. As reported by Reuters, the EU will be ruling on Microsoft’s GitHub acquisition on October 19.
In an effort to quell any antitrust concerns, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has assured users that GitHub will continue to be an open platform and will remain compatible with public cloud services.
GitHub, the world’s largest code host with more than 28 million developers using its platform, is Microsoft’s largest takeover since the company bought LinkedIn for US$26 billion in 2016.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Nadella said in a release announcing the deal in May.

En entrevista con Andy Serwer, editor en jefe de Yahoo Finance,  se le preguntó al antiguo CEO de Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, cómo ve las condiciones actuales que se yerguen sobre la industria de la tecnología. Su respuesta: las compañías tecnológicas deberían tratar de trabajar rápidamente con el gobierno para encontrar una solución, a diferencia de lo que Microsoft hizo durante su mandato, cuando se enfrentó a una demanda antimonopolio del gobierno.
“No estoy tratando de decir  ‘ay de mí’, pero recuerden que recibimos una demanda antimonopolio en Microsoft por parte del [Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos]. Esto del gobierno […] es algo serio. Y sabiendo lo que sé ahora, habría resuelto los problemas”, dijo Ballmer.
“Creo que debimos haber resuelto antes cómo arreglar las cosas. No creo que haya sido útil para nuestra empresa el camino que tomamos. Creo que la industria de la tecnología ahora podría […] repetir esa experiencia “.
Continuó: “Creo que aceptar completamente que las cosas no son como deben ser, y ponerse a trabajar en esos temas de tal manera que la gente entienda que lo tomamos en serio, en lugar de que la industria tecnológica parezca generalmente arrogante.”
Facebook ha estado plagado de escándalos, desde la propagación de propaganda rusa hasta el escándalo de Cambridge Analytica. Google, Microsoft y Amazon se han visto sacudidos por las protestas internas de sus empleados contra los contratos de la compañía con órganos militares y policiacos. Existe un cuestionamiento cada vez mayor respecto a si la industria tecnológica tiene demasiado poder, e incluso se ha sugerido la necesidad de tomar acciones antimonopolio.
Ballmer está instando a la industria tecnológica a aceptar que hay un problema y a trabajar con los reguladores para solucionarlo.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, Microsoft’s former chief executive Steve Ballmer was asked how he sees the current storm clouds over the tech industry playing out. His answer: Tech companies should try to work quickly with government to find a solution—unlike what Microsoft did under his tenure, as it faced an antitrust suit from the government.
“I’m not trying to do a ‘woe is me’ thing, but remember we got by an antitrust lawsuit at Microsoft by the [US Department of Justice]. This government stuff […] it’s serious stuff. And knowing what I know now, I would have resolved the issues,” Ballmer said.
“I think we should have figured out how to settle matters out earlier than we did. I do not think it was helpful for our company, the path we took. I think the tech industry right now […] could well repeat that experience.”
He went on, “I think fully accepting that things are not the way they need to be, and going to work on those issues in a way that people understand you are serious about, as opposed to the tech industry generally appearing arrogant, I understand that.”
Facebook has been beset by scandals, from the spread of Russian propaganda to Cambridge Analytica scandal. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been roiled by internal employee protests against company contracts with the military and law enforcement agencies. There is growing scrutiny of whether the tech industry has too much power, and suggestions of antitrust action are being thrown around.
Ballmer is urging the tech industry to get over it, accept there’s a problem, and work with regulators to fix it.

Microsoft has acquired Flipgrid, a video discussion platform used by more than 20 million teachers and students around the world. Flipgrid is a platform that allows students to discuss and reply to topics with video clips at home or in the classroom, reported CNBC.
The move shows Microsoft remains eager to win share in education, where Google’s Chromebooks have become popular.
Microsoft is making Flipgrid free of charge. Schools that already have subscriptions will receive prorated refunds, Microsoft said.
The acquisition comes 1½ years after Microsoft announced a partnership with Flipgrid. Today, Flipgrid integrates with many Microsoft products, including Teams for chatting with other people and OneNote for taking notes. But Flipgrid has paid to use Amazon Web Services cloud, which competes with Microsoft’s own Azure.

Microsoft has reached an agreement to buy GitHub, the source repository and collaboration platform, in a deal worth US$7.5 billion. The all-stock deal is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval in the US and EU.
Decade-old GitHub is built on Git, the open source version control software originally written by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git is a distributed version control system: each developer has their own repository that they make changes to, and these changes can be propagated between repositories to share those changes.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a release announcing the deal. “We recognize the community responsibility we take on with this agreement and will do our best work to empower every developer to build, innovate and solve the world’s most pressing challenges.”
Microsoft says the transaction, which must pass the usual regulatory scrutiny, will close by the end of 2018.

Speaking at Recode’s Code Conference in Palos Verdes, California, Microsoft President Brad Smith drew lessons from the software giant’s “gut wrenching” antitrust battles of the late 1990s that seem to resonate today, as Facebook faces scrutiny of its data privacy practices by regulators in the US and Europe.
“If you create technology that changes the world, the world is going to want to govern you, it’s going to want in some measure to regulate you,” Smith said on Wednesday, May 30, in the opening day of the Code Conference on Rancho Palos Verdes. “You have to come to terms with that.”
Microsoft was cast as a monopolist for its command of the software operating 90% of the world’s computer desktops in 1998, when antitrust regulators accused it of anticompetitive practices in its bundling of the Internet Explorer browser as part of its operating system, placing the rival Netscape browser at a disadvantage.
Now Microsoft finds itself at odds with the government again, though this time it’s over immigration policy. The software giant has joined many tech executives speaking out against President Donald Trump’s efforts to change immigration.

What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us

By Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu
Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.
Microsoft, the world’s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world’s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.
After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft’s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.

What Microsoft’s Antitrust Case Teaches Us About Silicon Valley
In the Twilight of the 20th century, Bill Gates was well and truly a tentacular squid, with his sucker-covered limbs extending into every level of the computer industry. The one area that Gates didn’t dominate: the World Wide Web. And how he tried to conquer that newfangled internet led to an epic court battle that continues to shape how the world sees the five-headed beast that Big Tech has become.
Microsoft famously missed the rise of the web in the early ’90s, with Gates dedicating only a fraction of his mid-’90s tome The Road Ahead to the internet. Meanwhile, Netscape introduced millions to the pleasures of browsing and surfing, forcing Microsoft to do one of its notorious “fast follows” (i.e., rapid copycat product launches). The company introduced Internet Explorer in 1995 and wasted no time in browbeating and cajoling companies the world over into making it the default web browser on their systems.

An article published on January 29 on Polygon has garnered a lot of buzz online. While the piece, which speculates on the evolution of the Xbox One and Xbox brand, is well-worth a read in its entirety, of particular note is a paragraph that mentions the possibility of Microsoft acquiring Electronic Arts (EA), Valve, and PUBG Corp.
“The most recent one we heard (from a reliable source close to Microsoft) was, in fact, Electronic Arts,” the article reveals. “We also heard a whisper about Valve and about Korean outfit PUBG Corp., which Microsoft last year signed to a timed exclusive for its hit survival shooter, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.”
The Xbox One has often been criticized for lacking in quality first-party video games so it does make sense that Microsoft would be considering purchasing additional game companies. EA is one of the biggest players in the video game industry right now though so acquiring it would be a massive game-changer. It would also be fairly expensive.

The lobbying group representing major internet players like Amazon, Netflix, and Google said it plans to join the legal battle over the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) move last month to repeal net neutrality.
The Internet Association (IA) said it would act as an “intervenor” in expected litigation over the FCC’s action. What that means is that the group wouldn’t be filing its own lawsuit, but would join a legal action filed by others. Public interest groups and some state attorneys general have said they intend to challenge the repeal in court.
“The final version of Chairman Pai’s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers,” Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. “This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet. IA intends to act as an intervenor in judicial action against this order and, along with our member companies, will continue our push to restore strong, enforceable net neutrality protections through a legislative solution.”
The FCC, in a 3-2 party-line vote, repealed rules that ban internet providers from blocking or throttling content, or from creating “fast lanes” that would be for sale to sites that want speedier access to consumers. They left in place rules that require that ISPs disclose how they handle internet traffic.
The FCC posted the final text version of its action earlier this week, and it is expected to enter the Federal Register in the coming weeks.

The Commission unconditionally clears the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft By Anna Renata Pisarkiewicz (European University Institute)1
The Facts of the Microsoft/GitHub Acquisition
On September 14, 2018, Microsoft and GitHub notified the European Commission about their intention to merge. Both parties to the transaction supply various software development and operations (“DevOps”) tools that individuals and organizations use when developing and releasing software. GitHub, in particular, supplies the popular code hosting platform for version control and collaboration on software development, which can be used online (GitHub.com), and on-premises (GitHub Enterprise). At the time of the notification, with more than 28 million developers in its community, and 85 million code repositories, GitHub was the largest host of source code globally.2
Given that the EU turnover of GitHub was less than EUR 250 million in the last financial year for which data was available at the time of the notification, the transaction did not have a Union dimension under Article 1(2) or Article 1(3) of the Merger Regulation. However, it did have such a dimension pursuant to Article 4(5), as it was capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of four Member States, namely Austria, Cyprus, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Having reviewed the transaction, the Commission approved it ...

With Broadcom’s Qualcomm buyout offer, Microsoft and Google have expressed private concerns over the potential purchase. That is, at least according to sources close to the matter. Both companies — along with other unnamed tech companies – have expressed several concerns.
The first concern is the possible influence Apple may have over the deal. The second concern revolves around Broadcom’s reputation for cutting costs over investing in upcoming technology. So far, a Qualcomm buyout hasn’t come to fruition as Qualcomm hopes to get more out of Broadcom.
Qualcomm has recently rejected Broadcom’s offers. The company has since nominated a new board of directors earlier this week. Broadcom has even considered boosting its offer. Though, the Snapdragon chip maker has expressed antitrust concerns. Even so, Qualcomm has asked Google and Microsoft — among other tech companies — to keep their concerns private.
Of course, there’s a possibility that Apple will benefit greatly from the Qualcomm buyout. Qualcomm currently provides chips for both the iPhone and iPad. Though, legal battles between Qualcomm and the Cupertino company have strained the relationship. Broadcom chief Hock Tan has expressed a positive outlook moving forward if his company buys Qualcomm.

From Microsoft to Google: eyes wide shut on predatory innovation? By Dr. Thibault Schrepel
On June 27, 2017, the European Commission (“Commission”) has fined Google 2.7 billion dollars1 for having abused its dominant position by giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. According to the Commission, Google had notably “demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results.” We do not know – yet – if that demotion was purely contractual, but if it also involved technical changes, it would mean that Google has implemented practices of  predatory  innovation. We shall soon know, once a non-confidential version of the decision will be made public.
And we are already expecting another decision to be released against Google, in the Android case. In its statement of objections,2 the European Commission held that Google imposed restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. Some of them are technical – those related to anti-fragmentation, for instance.
These strategies – without making any assumption about their legality in these particular cases – are falling within the definition of predatory innovation which covers the “alteration of one or more technical elements of a product to limit or eliminate competition.”3 And they are implemented on a daily basis.

A couple of weeks ago, Eugene Kaspersky, from the Russian multinational cyber security and anti-virus provider Kaspersky, fired shots at Microsoft and filed a new antitrust complaint against the company in the European Union. The issue as heart at the time was Microsoft’s Windows Defender antivirus solution, and Microsoft pushing its own antivirus over third party software in Windows 10. Now that some time has passed, Microsoft has indirectly responded to Kaspersky’s antitrust complaints by highlighting its antivirus efforts in a new post to the TechNet blog.
Titled “Partnering with the AV ecosystem to protect our Windows 10 customers,” the 1,000-word post is penned by Rob Lefferts, Partner Director, Windows & Devices Group, Security & Enterprise at Microsoft. He highlights the impacts of the WannaCry attacks and addresses the importance of how Microsoft is trying to make Windows 10 the safest and most secure version of Windows ever.
Though Lefferts does not address Kaspersky directly in the post, he does mention that Microsoft’s approach to security in Windows 10 “includes both the end-to-end protections we build in natively, as well as support for the larger ecosystem of ISV [Indepedent Software Vendors] and OEM partners to do their best work.” This would appear to address Kaspersky’s claim that Microsoft is using its “dominant position” to promote Windows Defender.

Russian security software maker Kaspersky Lab has filed antitrust complaints against Microsoft with the European Commission and the German federal cartel office, it said in a statement on Tuesday.
Kaspersky Lab said Microsoft was abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market, creating obstacles for independent software security vendors by distributing its own Defender anti-virus software with the ubiquitous Windows operating system.
Microsoft built the anti virus software into Windows, saying this protected users but Kaspersky said it was anti-competitive.
Microsoft said in a statement on Tuesday that it had not violated any laws.
“Microsoft’s primary objective is to keep customers protected,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We are confident that the security features of Windows 10 comply with competition laws. And we will answer any questions regulators may have.”
Kaspersky filed the complaints after the two companies failed to resolve their differences through private negotiations.
The Moscow-based company said in a statement that Microsoft’s action had resulted in “a lower level of protection for users, a limitation on their right to choose and financial losses both for users and security solutions manufacturers.”
Kaspersky in November threatened to complain to the European Commission but in April said it would hold off because Microsoft had agreed to make some changes.

Kaspersky, the popular computer security firm based in Russia, has withdrawn its antitrust complaint against software giant Microsoft though the dispute is not totally gone. The security vendor lambasted Microsoft for allegedly taking advantage of its market influence to edge out antivirus providers.
The dispute arose from the new changes Microsoft introduced in the Creators Update that made Windows Defender the preferred security tool for Windows 10. The Creators Update removes some third-party security products from PCs that upgrade to the update. For Kaspersky, that means exposing users to security risks. The move also aims to force out security vendors, according to Eugene Kaspersky, founder and chief executive:
“Several years ago Microsoft decided to overhaul the Windows platform. Ostensibly this was in the name of better ease of usage, security, performance and so on. Behind the scenes what Microsoft was up to was elegantly seizing niche markets: squeezing independent developers out of them, taking their place, and offering users their own products, which in many cases were in no way better.” Said in the Kaspersky’s blog.

Google Android after Microsoft: some thoughts on the proceedings brought against Google for abuse of a dominant position
By Giulia Funghi & Alessandro Rosanò (University of Padua)
Abstract:     In April 2015 the European Commission opened an antitrust proceedings against Google with regard to its business practices related to Android, the famous smarthpone and tablet operating system. According to the Commission, Google has abused of its dominant position in that it has allegedly required or incentivised smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively pre-install Google’s own applications or services, prevented smartphone and tablet manufacturers from developing and marketing modified and potentially competing versions of Android, tied or bundled certain Google applications and services distributed on Android devices with other Google applications, services, and/or application programming interfaces of Google. The purpose of the article is to find a solution to the case in light of the judgment passed by the Court of First Instance of the European Union in Microsoft and show that Google’s business practice does not amount to a violation of competition rules in that it protects both consumers and free competition.

144,"December 6, 2016",EU: Microsoft $26 billion LinkedIn buy approved with light conditions,"
The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.
The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.
“A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today’s decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,” said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.
The concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft’s desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.

145,"December 6, 2016",US/EU: Salesforce wants antitrust regulators to ‘be vigilant’ with Microsoft,"
There’s at least one company that’s not too happy that Microsoft has received European Union approval for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn: Microsoft’s rival Salesforce.
Salesforce had been protesting to the EU about the deal, hoping that the EU would force Microsoft into promising that it would keep access to LinkedIn’s treasure trove of data open to all competitors.
The EU did extract a rather lengthy list of concessions from Microsoft, but not about LinkedIn’s data. The list centered on things like making Microsoft promise not to use its market position with Windows and MS Office to squash other social networks.
Salesforce, which tried to buy LinkedIn itself, is now warning that regulators will have to watch Microsoft closely and hints that if Microsoft does close access to LinkedIn’s data, Salesforce won’t accept the situation silently.

La Comisión Europea deberá decidir este 6 de diciembre si aprueba la operación, o si por el contrario desea iniciar una investigación a fondo. Fuentes cercanas a la operación han comentado que es poco probable que se opte por una investigación.
El acuerdo podrá depender de la aplicación de ciertas concesiones, ofrecidas por Microsoft para aliviar preocupaciones por parte de la CE en noviembre. Sin embargo, aún puede haber cambios menores a los compromisos realizados.

La venta, por 21 millones de libras, de la red social LinkedIn al gigante tecnológico Microsoft está cada vez más cerca de ser aprobada por autoridades Europeas, esto tras una semana de acuerdos y concesiones alcanzados con la Comisión Europea.
La autoridad de competencia habría expresado dudas iniciales, temiendo que la operación daría a Microsoft una ventaja injusta dentro del mercado al permitirle sofocar a servicios rivales.
Microsoft despejó estas preocupaciones al asegurar que permitirá a los rivales de LinkedIn accesar a su programa de Outlook add-ins, permitiendo a fabricantes de hardware (como Dell o HP) deshabilitar a LinkedIn u otros servicios de redes sociales, si así lo desean. Las concesiones obedecen a una consulta por parte de la UE hacia clientes y empresas rivales.

Microsoft’s £21 billion purchase of social network site LinkedIn is likely to gain EU approval, following reported agreement with the European Commission over a number of concessions this week.
Antitrust regulators initially raised concerns that the buyout would give Microsoft an unfair advantage in the market, suffocating rival services.
But Microsoft recently said it would allow LinkedIn rivals to access its Outlook add-ins program, according to Reuters, and, subsequently, that it would allow desktop manufacturers such as Dell and HP to disable LinkedIn and install other social services if they wished.
The latest concessions came after the EU sought feedback from a number of customers and rival companies, according to sources close to the deal, speaking to Reuters.

Microsoft will still allow LinkedIn’s rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the US firm, people familiar with the matter said.

The offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators.
Both the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday.
The EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6.
The Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition.

Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the US software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.
The move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.
The Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.
The LinkedIn acquisition will allow Microsoft to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.
LinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

In their review of Microsoft Corp.’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., European Union antitrust regulators are attempting to measure the rough value of the professional network’s data and whether rival sites can replicate it, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The commission has previously said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, and may start reviewing deals involving smaller companies, especially in cases when a firm snaps up another just to get hold of its data.

Reuters first reported on news of the filing, writing that the commission has set a Nov. 22 deadline to review the case. Should the commission have any concerns, they can open an investigation on the matter.
The company stressed to regulators that the deal could unfairly exclude other companies from accessing LinkedIn’s vast amount of data and that Microsoft could gain an unfair advantage by combining its software with this data.
European Commissioner on Competition Margarethe Vestager has previously said that data is something the commission will look at in assessing antitrust cases.
“A company might even buy up a rival just to get hold of its data, even though it hasn’t yet managed to turn that data into money,” she said.
“We are therefore exploring whether we need to start looking at mergers with valuable data involved, even though the company that owns it doesn’t have a large turnover.”

155,"October 4, 2016","EU: US giants at it in Brussels, Salesforce against Microsoft over Linkedin deal","
When earlier this year Microsoft snapped up the world’s headlines by announcing it would have acquired LinkedIn with a colossal $26.2 billion deal, everyone was already preparing for the shockwaves this move would have generated.
Last week, US cloud computing company Salesforce.com openly urged European Union regulators to block the acquisition over unfair competition concerns. The breaking news made clear that antitrust will be once more a huge weapon for competition, and that the match will be once again played on the EU field.
US giant Microsoft Corp. announced three months ago a deal to buy the world’s largest professional networking platform LinkedIn, with an all-cash deal worth a total of $26.2 billion, $196 a share. The deal represents the company’s largest purchase and one of the biggest technology acquisitions ever in history. Microsoft indeed has been chasing the acquisition desperately, in a strong attempt to revitalize its activity after some tough years behind competitors. Chief Executive Satya Nadella openly declared he was hoping the deal will open new horizons for Microsoft’s Office suite to escape a saturated market.
The entire Redmond, Washington-based company had hoped indeed to get EU approval quickly and to be able to close the deal in the next few weeks, however the situation looks now a bit more complex. Last Thursday, the Californian Salesforce.com openly said the deal threatens innovation and competition, and formally urged the European Union, regular punisher of Microsoft, to take a close look at Microsoft’s takeover of LinkedIn through an official statement.

The European Commission has mentioned that it may start requiring all data-rich merger to seek approval rather than continuing with current guidelines which require approval only for mergers where the annual turnover of the combined businesses exceeds specified thresholds.
One current deal that seems to be spurring these considerations is the acquisition of the online careers site LinkedIn by Microsoft.
Salesforce, a leading opponent of the deal, is also suggesting to regulators that Microsoft will create proprietary bundles of its services and LinkedIn data.
Data in all forms seems valuable right now, because rich and varied data is at the core of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the basis for analyzing and predicting almost any action that can be digitally measured.
Essentially, the people are proposing judging anti-competitiveness on the basis of something with imputed value, the uses of which aren’t fully understood yet.

Any probe into Microsoft’s acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn Corp. is likely to focus on the tie-up’s potential to leverage vast amounts of user data, the European Union’s antitrust chief said Friday.
The European Commission would look at whether “the data purchased in the deal has a very long durability and might constitute a barrier for others, or if they can be replicated so that others stand a chance to enter the market,” Margrethe Vestager said.
“We’ve done that kind of analysis in the past and it’s something we’re generally paying a lot of attention to,” she said in an interview in Copenhagen Friday.
The Dane, who took office at the end of 2014, has signaled a willingness to delve more into how merging companies leverage the treasure trove of data at their disposal. Data was one of the key considerations in the review of Facebook’s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, even though her predecessor in the end concluded there were no data-usage concerns.
Vestager warned earlier this year that even though the regulator hasn’t found a data competition problem yet, “this doesn’t mean we never will.”

Microsoft has bought LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, as the Seattle-based software company seeks to expand its reach into professional networking.
The deal is Microsoft’s biggest-ever acquisition, and follows a pattern of bold moves by chief executive Satya Nadella to reinvent the company that is known primarily as the maker of Windows.
The purchase of LinkedIn will allow Microsoft to link the professional network with its intelligent digital assistant, Cortana, and its customer relationship management software.
LinkedIn, which has a growing network of more than 100m monthly active users, had seen its share price fall 40 per cent this year before the deal was announced. Analysts have expressed concern that the company’s growth would slow and that the subscription service it sells to recruiters was vulnerable to a global economic slowdown.
Both companies are facing increased competition in the professional software market, as companies try to change the way people communicate in the office. Popular work chat app Slack and Facebook’s professional subscription service Facebook at Work have led some analysts to predict that professional use of the internet will be shaped by social networks in the same way that the consumer internet has been.

A casi dos años del hecho, las pesquisas continúan. Ésta semana la CEO de Microsoft, Satya Nadella, se dirige a Beijing para reunirse con funcionarios del gobierno para tratar el tema de la persistente investigación.

Durante las etapas iniciales del proceso, la SAIC habría dicho que Microsoft no había mostrado “total transparencia” en sus declaraciones de ventas en China. En la versión de Microsoft, las objeciones del SAIC se refieren a los programas de software empaquetados como parte de Windows y Office, así como ciertos problemas de compatibilidad y verificación de archivos. 
En enero de este año la SAIC exigió a Microsoft una explicación formal para resolver “problemas importantes” descubiertos durante su revisión inicial de datos digitales.

Early in the investigation, SAIC claimed that Microsoft had not been ‘fully transparent’ in declaring its sales data in China. According to Microsoft, the SAIC’s concerns are connected with software bundling related to Windows and Office, as well as issues of compatibility and ‘file verification’.

Xiaomi has sealed a deal to buy some 1,500 patents from Microsoft, a move that will help the Chinese smartphone maker expand exports and earn the US technology giant some badly needed goodwill in Beijing.
The transaction addresses a key weakness facing Xiaomi, which is seeking to sell its devices in countries outside its home market but has been hindered by its relative lack of intellectual property to fend off lawsuits.
“In terms of patents we are a young company,” Xiaomi said on Wednesday, adding that the Microsoft deal is “a big milestone for us. It will help us with operations in new markets.”
The agreement comes on the eve of a visit to Beijing by Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. The US company is still the subject of an antitrust investigation in China over bundling of software, with its offices raided by Chinese authorities in July 2014.
The patent deal includes Xiaomi installing Microsoft’s Office and Skype software on its phones. Financial terms were not made public.

US District Court for the District of Delaware denied InterDigital’s motion to dismiss an antitrust suit filed by Microsoft. In the suit, Microsoft alleged that InterDigital engaged in an unlawful scheme to acquire and exploit monopoly power over standard essential patents required for 3G and 4G cellular devices. Specifically, Microsoft asserted that InterDigital falsely promised to license its 3G and 4G SEPs on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory terms in order to ensure its SEPs were included in standards set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.
According to the complaint, InterDigital failed to live up to its commitment to FRAND licensing terms, and instead acquired monopoly power in the 3G and 4G cellular technology markets and used that power to demand supra-competitive royalties, “double-dip” royalty demands, and has pursued “baseless” International Trade Commission litigation against Microsoft and others.
In its motion to dismiss, InterDigital asserted that Microsoft failed to adequately plead a Sherman Act § 2 monopolization claim, namely that Microsoft failed to show that InterDigital possessed and exercised monopoly power and failed to adequately allege injury. The court disagreed, finding Microsoft’s allegations to be materially similar to those found to be sufficient by the Third Circuit in Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm . With respect to monopoly power, the court found that Microsoft’s allegations as to the necessary technology standards, market entry barriers, and InterDigital’s market share to be sufficient. The court found that allegations of an “intentional false promise” to license technology on FRAND terms, which was relied upon in selecting the technology for inclusion in mandatory standards, and breach of such promise was “sufficient to show anticompetitive conduct.”

Keith N. Hylton, March 20, 2016
United States v. Microsoft Corp. (Microsoft III) is now fifteen years old, and that I would write such a long introduction to a reprint of significant portions from the opinion is a sign its significance has not died out. Just the opposite, I think it will become more significant in the near future, and not only because of its impact on U.S. antitrust law. The decision lays the groundwork for international enforcement of antitrust in high technology markets, at least as we have come to know them, and this is likely to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.
As for U.S. law, it has become increasingly clear that Microsoft III is the second most important monopolization decision after Learned Hand’s United States v. Alcoa. To be sure, Alcoa must and will always be the most important Section 2 opinion because it sets the foundational principles for modern (post-1945) monopolization law. Judge Hand overturned a doctrinal framework that had induced a passive approach to antitrust enforcement against dominant firms and replaced with a framework that enabled and encouraged aggressive antitrust enforcement. Microsoft has had a comparatively limited impact, but it clarifies and updates the monopolization standard and constrains judges, and in these senses fundamentally alters the law from Alcoa.

ICOMP was founded in 2008 to fight for an “online competitive marketplace.”

The Department of Justice’s Section 2 Report (“Report”) considered in great detail how courts should best go about identifying exclusionary conduct and how they should best remedy that kind of conduct once they found it. Even though the new Assistant Attorney General has now withdrawn the Report as an official statement of Antitrust Division policy, the questions the Report addressed remain for the new administration. In this essay, I will comment on two subsidiary but nonetheless critical subjects that the DOJ addressed in the Report: general (as opposed to practice-specific) standards of exclusion and affirmative-obligation (as opposed to prohibitory) remedies. In both instances, my observations will draw on the experience of United States v. Microsoft; the DOJ’s last and still pending monopolization case.

As someone who has spent a considerable portion of the last five years working on issues involving Microsoft’s conduct and the competition laws, I read with interest the commentary that followed the issuance of the Court of First Instance’s decision on September 17. Much of the focus of the commentary was on the significance of the decision with respect to the state of “convergence” of U.S. and European Community (Community) competition law relating to unilateral conduct of “dominant” firms. While convergence, or the lack thereof, is obviously a major issue, the decision is also important because of what it reflects about regulatory and judicial views in Europe and the United States on issues at the intersection of intellectual property and competition law. These issues have broader implications than just the Microsoft case.
But first a small point; the standard of review applied by the CFI may have been a significant driver of the outcome. In paragraph 87 of the decision, the CFI states that its review of the “complex economic appraisals” is “necessarily limited to checking whether the relevant rules on procedure and on stating reasons have been complied with, whether the facts have been accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or a misuse of powers.” Similarly, in paragraph 88 of the decision, the CFI notes that “complex technical appraisals  are in principle subject to only limited review by the Court, which means that the Community Courts cannot substitute their own assessment of matters of fact for the Commission’s.” The CFI thus rejected Microsoft’s invitation to perform a “searching inquiry into the soundness of the Commission’s decision” (paragraph 86), opting instead to apply a standard of review akin to an “abuse of discretion” standard in the United States. Regardless of what one thinks of the merits of Microsoft’s appeal to the CFI, application of this standard perhaps doomed it from the start.

172,"December 21, 2015","Strong Spine, Weak Underbelly: The CFI Microsoft Decision","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Harry First, Sep 28, 2007
INTRODUCTION The CFI’s decision in Microsoft came as something of a surprise. In the run-up to its issuance, commentators had been predicting some sort of “split-the-difference” approach, seeing the Court as most likely upholding the Commission’s decision on Microsoft™ refusal to supply interoperability information to Sun but reversing its decision on Microsoft’s refusal to dis-integrate Windows and the Windows Media Player. I thought the opposite. Immediately after the Commission’s decision in 2004 Microsoft had petitioned the CFI for interim relief to suspend the Commission’s remedial orders. Although the CFI denied the petition, Judge Vesterdorf, President of the CFI, had not dismissed Microsoft’s attack on the interoperability issue out of hand. He recognized that there was a serious dispute on a number of points. Was the protocol information “indispensable” within the meaning of prior case law? Was the assertion of intellectual property rights to these protocols sufficient, in itself, to constitute an “objective justification” for a refusal to provide the information? Microsoft’s contention that the Commission’s decision was wrong on these points, Judge Vesterdorf wrote, “could not be regarded as prima facie unfounded.” I took that to mean that Microsoft had some plausible defenses.
The surprise, to me, was how completely and thoroughly the CFI demolished those defenses. This was an opinion in the style of Woody Hayes (the legendary Ohio State football coach)—three yards and a cloud of dust, relentlessly moving down the field, but with few exciting long passes. On virtually all points of contention, the CFI, after stating the arguments on both sides, agreed with the Commission’s analysis of the applicable case law and how the Commission marshaled the facts to support its conclusions. Indeed, the Court’s language on more than one occasion shows, perhaps, some impatience with Microsoft’s arguments. For example, the Court stated that Microsoft’s complaint about whether the Commission needs to prove more than a “risk” of anticompetitive effect in the targeted market “is purely one of terminology and is wholly irrelevant” (para. 561). “Microsoft’s assertions [about its competitors in the work group server operating system market] ” are scarcely credible (para. 592). Microsoft’s arguments about the exact language of Sun’s request “are purely formal and must be rejected” (para. 773). Microsoft’s arguments that the bundling analysis is inconsistent with Article 82(d) of the EC Treaty “are purely semantic and cannot be accepted” (para. 850). Microsoft’s arguments that tying the Media Player to Windows did not result in foreclosure of competition and that the Commission applied a new and speculative theory are “unfounded and  based on a selective and inaccurate reading of the contested decision” (para. 1033). Not the first time Microsoft has aroused these reactions, as I will mention further in this paper.

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Robert O’Donoghue, Sep 20, 2007
Few cases in the annals of antitrust law have provoked as much reaction and interest as the various Microsoft proceedings, which have now continued in the United States (U.S.), the European Union (EU), and elsewhere for over a decade. Reasons for the inordinate level of interest are fairly obvious. First, Microsoft itself, as a company, has long incited strong opinions and passions. Proceedings outside the United States also had the added feature that Microsoft is a company of U.S. origin, prompting trade protection accusations. Second, the affected technology markets are complex, and of obvious major importance to producers and consumers alike, given the ubiquity of personal computers (PCs) and related software. Enforcement agencies continue to struggle to develop clear standards, as well as consistent, useful enforcement action with respect to technology markets. Finally, the principal legal issues in the various Microsoft proceedings “the extent to which a single firm can be compelled to deal with third parties and the limits on its ability to bundle separate products” are arguably the most controversial issues in antitrust law at the moment.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court of First Instance (CFI) judgment in the appeal against the 2004 Commission decision fining Microsoft almost 500 million for unlawful refusal to deal and bundling practices was eagerly anticipated. However, the CFI ruling will probably do very little to quell the controversies alluded to above.

174,"December 17, 2015",China: Microsoft just struck a big deal with Beijing,"
Microsoft has struck a deal with a Chinese technology company to sell its new Windows 10 operating system to the country’s civil service, the company said late on Wednesday.
The new joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in China and is provisionally called C&M Information Technologies, will see Microsoft and its partner China Electronics Technology Group, license, deploy, manage and optimize Windows 10 for China’s government agencies and state owned enterprises. The joint venture will provide support and services for the customers.
The move comes as Microsoft looks to improve its image in the world’s second-largest economy. U.S. companies in China received a bad reputation after National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden alleged that foreign products were being used for spying. And last year, China’s antitrust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft’s offices in China.
“We’ll continue to keep Windows 10 secure and sustain our strong privacy standards, while recognizing that public sector solutions may differ from technology offered to private sector enterprises and consumers around the world,” Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of the Windows and Devices Group at Microsoft said in a blog post.

The Commission’s ‘Next Big Thing’?: Why the Google Case is Not ‘Microsoft Reloaded’ Torsten Koerber (Georg-August-Universität)
Abstract: On April 15, 2015 the European Commission sent Google its statement of objections (SO) in the Google Search case with regard to Google Shopping.
On the same day, it opened investigations against Google with regard to Android. The question of whether the contractual framework of Android licensing violates competition law has been covered in another SSRN article (it does not).
The following article is aimed at assessing the Commission’s competitive analysis and comparing the Google search case to other EU decisions, in particular to the European Commission’s decisions in the Microsoft cases. This is not an easy task because neither the SO nor Google’s response of August 27, 2015 have yet been published in full.
The following remarks, therefore, only reflect preliminary thoughts about the sparse information that has been revealed to the public in the Commission’s press releases and Google’s blogs. Based upon this information, the Commission does not seem to have a particularly strong case against Google.

Aún así, las autoridades opinan que las prácticas de venta de Microsoft habrían violentado seriamente las reglas de competencia y anti-monopolio del país.
La investigación, la cual exoneró al producto Xbox de cualquier violación, no está relacionado con una investigación de mayor duración por parte de la Administración Estatal de la Industria y el Comercio de China acerca de las prácticas de venta de los programas de software de Microsoft, particularmente Windows y Office.

El gigante tecnológico Microsoft ha evitado un fuerte traspié a su negocio de telefonía móvil este viernes, toda vez que la International Trade Commission de EEUU rechazó la opción de bloquear las importaciones de sus dispositivos como parte de una disputa por violación de patentes.
La decisión anula la orden emitida en abril pasado por un Juez de EEUU, quien habría encontrado a Microsoft culpable de violar dos patentes para dispositivos inalámbricos de InterDigital Inc, y por lo cual se recomendaba prohibir la importación de estos dispositivos.
El fallo de la comisión es una buena noticia para Microsoft, quien ha encontrado problemas intentando competir contra los exitosos dispositivos lanzados por Apple Inc y por Samsung Electronic Co Ltd. La empresa estadounidense ha captado tan solo el 3 por ciento del mercado de teléfonos móviles de acuerdo a estimados globales.

Microsoft Corp avoided a potentially costly setback to its financially troubled mobile phone business on Friday as the US International Trade Commission declined to block the import of its devices in a longstanding patent dispute.
The decision rejected a ruling in April by a US trade judge who found that Microsoft had infringed two InterDigital Inc wireless patents, and recommended an import ban.
The commission’s action is good news for Microsoft, which has been struggling to compete with popular Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd devices. The Redmond, Washington-based company has captured just 3 per cent of the smartphone market in both the US and globally, according to recent estimates.

180,"June 2, 2015",US: Microsoft sues IRS over hiring of antitrust attorney Boies,"
Microsoft filed another suit against the US Internal Revenue Service, seeking information about the tax agency’s decision to hire outside lawyers, including one-time Microsoft nemesis David Boies, to help conduct an audit of the company. David Boies is the lawyer who beat Microsoft in an antitrust case in 2000.
The lawsuit, which was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks information from the IRS about contracts it made with two high-powered law firms to investigate Microsoft. What sparked the case are a pair of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests the company made regarding deals with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP and Boies Schiller & Flexner, LLP.
The extensive audit by the IRS stems over how tax is calculated for income made by Microsoft overseas, including its transfer prices to local affiliates in Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Retaining profits abroad is a common practice that can lower a U.S.-based company’s tax burden.
According to the complaint, Boies Schiller was awarded a $350,000 contract in 2013 to provide legal services to the IRS in connection with its audit of Microsoft. David Boies, the firm’s chairman, who’s known for his role as the lead prosecutor in the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust suit against Microsoft, was named as lead counsel in the contract.

186,"February 19, 2015",Refusal to License as an Abuse of Market Dominance – From Commercial Solvents to Microsoft,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
 Refusal to License as an Abuse of Market Dominance – From Commercial Solvents to Microsoft –  Matthias Lamping (Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition)
Abstract: Although intellectual property rights do not automatically confer a dominant market position, they may put the right holder in the position to behave more or less independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumers. The extent of that relative immunity from competition depends on a number of factors, from the specific characteristics of the protected subject-matter through to the structure of the relevant market. In extreme cases, an intellectual property right will constitute an “essential facility” and therefore enable the right holder to control access to, and thus competition in, the market. In such cases, a refusal to license may lead to an abuse of market dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the abuse may consist in a discrimination of trading partners, an unjustified foreclosure of competitors, a negligence of market needs or an expansion of market power to another related market. However, a compulsory license will not always be the appropriate remedy to stop the established abuse, its anti-competitive effects, and its recurrence. In principle, the European Commission asks the dominant company to cease and desist from the abusive conduct, but it does not grant compulsory licenses.

But Samsung’s ongoing patent licensing dispute with Microsoft presents a major hurdle for Samsung’s potential new Windows phones. The companies secured an agreement several years ago that saw Microsoft obtain licensing royalties from Samsung.

A proposal backed by technology giants including Microsoft and Intel is fighting what they consider excessive licensing fees charged by owners of standard Wi-Fi patents, a move experts say would upend the business model used by Qualcomm, the world’s largest chipmaker.
According to reports, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is being urged to adopt the proposal that would limit standard essential patent owners, like Qualcomm, in litigating to block product sales from companies that implement those patents without paying licensing fees.
Qualcomm legal representatives say the entire proposal is “more an attack on Qualcomm’s business model and licensing model,” adding that attacking the company’s licensing operations puts it at a competitive disadvantage.
But according to the policy backers – Microsoft, Intel, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Broadcom – the new rules would curb excessive litigation related to patent licensing. The companies have cited cases launched by competition authorities across the globe that have reviewed complaints filed against owners of standard patents, which are often accusing of demanding excessive licensing fees.
The case will see the IEEE standards board considering what constitutes a “reasonable” licensing fee for the first time, according to reports. The board could place limits on what patent owners can demand from licensees.
The IEEE is may vote on the matter as early as this weekend, though the decision will be reviewed by its board of directors as well as the Department of Justice.

Microsoft, Oracle and several animation companies are filing their first briefs in the latest legal battle over non-poaching agreements, say reports.
The companies are facing allegations of anticompetitive conduct by colluding to agree to not hire each others’ employees, which kept salaries unfairly low, plaintiffs argue.
The case is the third major wave in non-poaching litigation in the past two years. Several months ago Google, Apple, Adobe and Intel settled non-poaching claims for $324.5 million; that case is ongoing, however, as US District Judge Lucy Koh denied acceptance of the offer, arguing it was too low for Silicon Valley employees. The companies appealed her decision and the matter is currently at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Last year, Pixar Animation, Lucasfilm and Intuit settled their own non-poaching claims for $20 million.
Now, however, Microsoft is looking to distance itself from being grouped into what some claim is a conspiracy between technology companies to keep wages low. A lawyer for Microsoft filed a brief Monday claiming “nothing…suggests this ‘overarching conspiracy’ included Microsoft.”
Similarly, Oracle has denied involvement in such collusion. “Oracle was deliberately excluded from all prior litigation filed in this matter because all the parties investigating the issue concluded that there was absolutely no evidence that Oracle was involved,” the company’s Vice President Deborah Hellinger said last month.

Nonprofit Massachusetts-based healthcare system Partners HealthCare is reportedly urging a federal judge to examine major antitrust cases including disputes involving Microsoft and Citigroup to decide whether to approve of Partners’ plans to acquire hospital assets.
According to reports, Partners wants Suffolk Superior Court Judge Janet L. Sanders to base a ruling not on whether the acquisitions will solve problems in the healthcare market, but whether they were legitimately negotiated. In a court filing, Partners argued that a 1995 antitrust settlement reached between Microsoft and federal antitrust officials was made after a court ruled a settlement cannot be rejected just because “other remedies were preferable.”
Reports say Partners also cited the more recent antitrust dispute involving American Airlines’ acquisition of US Airways and securities fraud charges against Citigroup, all major deals that were ultimately cleared despite public criticism.
Partners is looing to acquire South Shore Hospital and the Hallmark Health System in the state. The plans have raised criticism and concern that the takeovers would lead to higher medical costs.

South Korea-based Samsung is reportedly fighting to avoid paying $1 billion to US-based Microsoft in patent royalty payments after Microsoft sued the company earlier this year to collect funds.
Reports say Samsung wants a federal judge to invalidate a collaboration agreement made between the companies, a contract that included Samsung’s payment of patent royalties to Microsoft.
Microsoft has made several similar agreements with various smartphone makers to collect royalties from the use of its Android operating system on smartphones.
Microsoft filed a lawsuit against Samsung earlier this year accusing Samsung of violating terms of their royalty agreement; among the accusations was that Samsung failed to pay $1 billion in annual patent fees.
Now, Samsung is fighting back and seeking an invalidation of the agreement on grounds that Microsoft’s takeover of Nokia in April violated their initial collaboration agreement made in 2011.
Microsoft acquired the wireless phone assets of Nokia for $9.4 billion. That takeover, Samsung argues, places Microsoft in direct competition with Samsung and the South Korean firm is now allowed to terminate their agreements on collaboration and patent royalty.
According to reports, court documents show Samsung also argues that if it continues to pay royalties to Microsoft following the Nokia takeover, Samsung would be in violation of antitrust law. “The agreements, now between competitors, invite charges of collusion,” Samsung said in its court filing.

199,"September 3, 2014","China: Experts discuss controversial, confusing Microsoft probe","
Amid controversy and confusion surrounding China’s antitrust investigation into Microsoft, experts say that the case should be taken seriously by the tech company.
China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce, once of three regulators tasked with antitrust duties, recently gave Microsoft 20 days to respond to inquiries regarding the company’s business practices. But as China continues its crackdowns, the exact nature and charges of the case against Microsoft remain unclear.
China’s action against foreign companies through competition watchdogs has caused many antitrust experts to question whether the nation is acting unfairly and biased against the firms in favor of domestic competition.
David S. Evans (GlobalEcon/UChicago), recently interviewed by Bloomberg on the topic, stressed that Microsoft should take China’s probe “very seriously,” despite the fact that the exact reason for the investigation remains unclear.
Evans was interviewed along with Gordon Chang, author of “The Coming Collapse of China,” who stressed that even the trend of executives traveling to China to promote their business abroad has not helped companies’ cases in competition matters.
The nation’s Anti-Monopoly Law has only been in existence for six years, as Evans notes, which is extremely young relative to other jurisdictions’ competition legislations. Now, Evans says, China has been quick to so aggressively utilize their rules, noting that it is “surprising” how harshly the young rules have been implemented as of late.
Chang, however, disagreed, suggesting that domestic conglomerates are earning an increasingly powerful presence within the government that may be influencing how federal officials in China are treating their foreign competitors.

200,"September 1, 2014",China: Government demands answers from Microsoft,"
The Chinese government is increasing its pressure on Microsoft in the midst of a competition probe into the company’s compatibility issues of its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software. According to reports, Microsoft has been given 20 days to respond to inquiries regarding the investigation.
The nation’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce has questioned Microsoft’s Vice President David Chen, the agency said Monday. The SAIC’s actions follow recent complaints filed by rival companies in China against Microsoft’s requirement of verification codes for its operating system and its Office products.
That use of verification codes “may have violated China’s anti-monopoly law,” state media said Monday.
But some antitrust experts don’t buy it. The head of Beijing-based technology consultancy BDA, Duncan Clark, told reporters that applying anti-monopoly law to Microsoft’s use of verification codes is questionable. “How does an anti-piracy measure constitute monopolistic behavior if other suppliers can also use the same technique?” he asked.
The use of verification codes, reports say, is a common technique used by technology companies to combat piracy of their products.
Microsoft said it is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Microsoft is just one of a slew of foreign companies that have been targeted by Chinese officials in recent months. It’s a trend some competition experts find troubling.
A recent editorial on the topic published in Caixin Online highlights the worries of investors that China could be unfairly targeting foreign companies for the benefit of domestic competitors. Further, some experts say, as claims of bias within Chinese competition regulators increase, officials are facing the threat of undermined credibility.
Some are now calling on Chinese regulators, including the SAIC, National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce to address the claims of bias.

201,"August 10, 2014","China: Microsoft, auto probes revive foreign relations anxieties","
China’s ongoing crackdown of foreign auto makers, combined with reports of dawn raids of Microsoft offices in the nation, are reviving anxieties that China is using antimonopoly regulation to favor domestic companies over their foreign counterparts.
Reports emerged last week that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce launched a second round of searches into Microsoft offices in several major cities. The investigations are also said to extend to Microsoft financial services provider Accenture.
The searches coincide with the National Development and Reform Commission’s broadening investigation into foreign car makers; officials said last Wednesday it plans to punish Volkswagen’s Audi, Fiat’s Chrysler and possibly others for anticompetitive practices.
In recent weeks Mercedes-Benz decided to cut prices on certain products in the nation because of the investigations. Toyota and Honda also announced similar plans to follow suit.
Together, the investigations demonstrate China’s growing use of its six-year-old antimonopoly law, say reports. Some experts are concerned that the nation’s recent strengthening of it competition regulation has unfairly hit foreign companies more than China’s own entities, suggesting that China may be unfairly disciplining new market entrants, according to reports. Last April, the US Chamber of Commerce asked Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to tighten its grip against China because of these emerging patterns against foreign companies.

202,"August 6, 2014",China: New raids hit Microsoft,"
As Chinese authorities continue its investigation into Microsoft, reports say the nation’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce has heightened the investigation and conducted new searches of Microsoft offices.
The SAIC said Wednesday that it raided the offices of Microsoft and its partner Accenture. The agency revealed last week that it had launched an investigation into the technology behemoth.
Both Microsoft and Accenture confirmed that they are being investigated in China and that they are complying with regulators to cooperate with the probe.
While details of the exact reason for the investigation are not available, Microsoft has been under antitrust watch in the nation since last June and experts predict it could be for compatibility and market dominance issues.

203,"August 4, 2014",China: Microsoft warned to behave itself,"
Soon after reports emerged that Chinese officials are investigating Microsoft for possible anticompetitive behavior, reports say regulators are warning the company to behave itself during the investigation.
According to reports, the nation’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce has not accused Microsoft of obstructing the investigation, but warned the company that if it hinders the probe in any way, the government would take action. The SAIC made the remarks in an emailed statement to Reuters on Monday.
Despite the warning, the SAIC said that Microsoft has “promised to respect Chinese law and fully cooperate” with the probe, which was first revealed last month after officials confirmed dawn raids of Microsoft offices in four major Chinese cities.
Since reports of the investigation emerged, new details are being reported that the investigation is centered around concerns of Microsoft’s practices of bundling Microsoft products together, like Office and Windows, and other issues of compatibility.

204,"August 4, 2014","US: Microsoft, Samsung feud over Nokia buyout heats up","
Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, a move that is heating up a disagreement between the two over patent royalty payments.
According to reports, Microsoft and Samsung signed a contract in which Samsung agreed to pay patent royalties to Microsoft. But after Microsoft’s decision to acquire Nokia’s handset operations, Samsung has refused to pay those royalties.
Samsung reportedly argues that the 2011 agreement to pay royalties on Microsoft patents does not apply to products sold by Microsoft after its acquisition of Nokia. Microsoft agrees, and has now filed a lawsuit against Samsung, which Microsoft says eventually paid the disputed royalties but has refused to pay interest.
According to reports, Microsoft first began seeking royalty payments from handset makers to ramp up its ability to compete in the smartphone market. Samsung, LG and HTC have all signed agreements to do so. Motorola, however, has refused to sign the agreement; the companies have been involved in a separate legal battle since 2010 over the dispute.
Microsoft is seeking monetary recover from Samsung but the company has not publicized exactly how much it is seeking.
Samsung has previously expressed disapproval of Microsoft’ acquisition of Nokia, arguing that Nokia is now demanding higher patent likening fees from the company following Microsoft’s acquisition. Nokia was feared to become a patent troll after Microsoft acquires its handset operations, leaving Nokia to evolve into a company that depends on its intellectual property for profits.

205,"August 3, 2014",China: Revelations in Microsoft probe only lead to more questions,"
When reports emerged late last month that Microsoft is now the subject of an antitrust investigation by Chinese regulators, little information was available about why, exactly, the company was targeted.
But with new information trickling in about the probe, some new questions arise.
According to reports, Chinese officials raided Microsoft offices in four major cities on July 28; the next day, officials launched an antitrust investigation into the company, Windows and Office.
The nation’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce first began eyeing the company in June following a complaint that Windows and Office products caused compatibility and document verification issues. Reports say there were also complaints of bundling practices Microsoft uses with the products.
But reports say it is unclear exactly how these complaints related to matters of competition in the industry. More likely, some experts say, the probe is more closely related to political tensions between China and the US, and China’s distrust of Western spying through technological companies.

206,"July 28, 2014",China: Microsoft targeted by antitrust officials,"
US-based Microsoft is reportedly facing an antitrust investigation in China after reports emerged Monday that the company’s offices in the Asian nation were searched by government officials.
Local media reported Monday that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce conducted surprised searches at Microsoft offices in four Chinese cities over the weekend, including in Beijing and Shanghai. It remains unclear, however, as to the exact nature of the searches.
In a statement, Microsoft confirmed the raids and said the company would fully cooperate with the probe.
According to the Financial Times, the investigation may be part of China’s larger goal of strengthening domestic tech firms against their foreign rivals, which hold significant market share.
Further, say reports, the deal may strain already tense relations between the US and China after China banned the use of Microsoft’s Windows 8 operating system on new computers in the nation. Reports say the ban, first imposed in May, was a direct response to recent revelations of US spying programs utilized by tech companies; the scandal has lead to anti-US technology sentiment abroad, including in China.

207,"July 16, 2014",US: Report casts doubt over validity of Microsoft patents,"
Microsoft is known for shrouding its patent portfolio in secrecy, though reports have emerged in recent months that suggest Microsoft makes billions of dollars a year with its licensing agreements through Android. Now, reports say, new revelations released by financial advisor M-Cam suggest that a significant portion of Microsoft Android patents could be invalid.
M-Cam published the report on Microsoft in its Patently Obvious series and looked into China’s recent decision to publish a list of hundreds of Microsoft patents as part of its investigation into the company’s acquisition of Nokia. China’s Ministry of Commerce disclosed a list of 310 Microsoft patents last April.
”With this disclosure, China may be attempting to counteract Microsoft’s chokehold on the smartphone market. By disclosing the detailed list of these patents, companies who currently pay a license to Microsoft for the Android platform may discover that they have patents on the same technologies which precede Microsoft’s patents. This may create an opening for them to either negotiate a better deal or demand that Microsoft license from them,” M-Cam’s report said.
Further, analysis found that about one-fifth of Microsoft’s patent portfolio was directly commercially relevant.

Microsoft Bulgaria, a unit of Microsoft, has been fined more than $130,000 by Bulgaria’s Commission for Protection of Competition following a complaint by software distribution firm BMG.
According to reports, BMG filed a competition complaint against Microsoft regarding a suspended agreement between the two.
Reports say the CPC found Microsoft Bulgaria published a misleading statement that “created a mistaken impression that the plaintiff might no longer be able to carry out services related to the offering of Microsoft products.”
Microsoft confirmed that it suspended its contract with BMG, but authorities found tat the company’s statement incorrectly mislead BMG to believe it could no longer offer Microsoft Volume Licensing programs.
That misleading statement caused harm to competition, the authority said.
As a result of the statement, BMG said, several of its customers suspended their own contracts with BMG thinking they could no longer get the Microsoft product.

209,"June 16, 2014",China: Microsoft/Nokia merger reveals secretive IP licensing deals,"
While Microsoft generally keeps its patent licensing agreements tightly under wraps, China’s Ministry of Commerce offered a glimpse into the money the tech giant makes from those deals, particularly with rival Google.
MOFCOM reportedly published details of Microsoft’s licensing deals made with Google for Android smartphone devices, reporting 73 standard-essential patents that were reviewed by regulators. The information was published on its site in part of its review of Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Nokia’s handset operations, a $7.2 billion deal that concerned Chinese authorities over how it would affect Microsoft’s patent licensing agreements. Reports say MOFCOM examined the deal to determine whether the patents acquired through the Nokia purchase would encourage the companies to hike licensing fees.
MOFCOM approved of the merger last April.
In addition to the SEPs, MOFCOM reported 127 patents implemented in Android products that were developed by Microsoft. Reports say Microsoft acquired those patents through its involvement in the Rockstar Consortium, which also includes Apple, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony, formed to negotiate licensing deals.
Reports did not indicate the financial details of Microsoft’s licensing deals, but analysts late last year calculated the company was earning up to $2 billion through those agreements.

An antitrust dispute that originated in the 1990s has met its end after the US Supreme Court reportedly declined to hear the case, first filed against Microsoft over allegations of harming competition with its Windows 95 operating system.
Reports say Novell first filed the suit against its rival for harming competition and making Novell’s own word-processing program, WordPerfect, less attractive to consumers because it was not entirely compatible with Windows 95.
According to Novell, Microsoft withheld software components at last-minute in the operating system’s rollout that caused difficulties in running word programs other than Microsoft’s own Microsoft Word.
The suit, first field in 1994, was rejected by the Supreme Court Monday; the justices issued their decision without comment.
Novell is now part of Wizard Parent LLC.
The dispute preceded the US Department of Justice’s high-profile antitrust suit against Microsoft, filed in 1998 on allegations the company held too much market power.

Last year’s record-breaking fine levied against Microsoft by the European Commission for the company’s failure to adhere to commitments to offer its users a choice of Internet browsers has come back to haunt the company.
The Commission fined Microsoft $731 million more than one year ago for breaching its agreement with competition authorities to offer users browser choices other than its Internet Explorer. That agreement, made in 2009, was reportedly broken when a probe found a software update issued between May 2011 and July 2012 resulted in customers no longer having that choice in browsers.
The company only explained the case as a “technical error.” Sources had stated at the time that the software update was connected to the Windows 7 rollout.
Now, reports say shareholder Kim Barovic filed a lawsuit in the US over Microsoft’s alleged failure to property respond to the case and perform an adequate investigation into the matter. Reports say the lawsuit names the company’s executives, including founder Bill Gates, as defendants.
Microsoft has responded to Barovic’s lawsuit by repeating similar claims it stated when the EU first issued its fine, and in an emailed statement said that “the board thoroughly considered [Barovic’s] demand as she requested and found no basis for such a suit.

213,"April 8, 2014",China: Microsoft clears hurdle to acquire Nokia handset business,"
Microsoft and Nokia have finally cleared a major hurdle in their plan for Microsoft to acquire Nokia handset operations and a significant portion of its patent portfolio, but not without conditions, say reports.
China’s Ministry of Commerce has approved the deal after forcing the parties to delay their anticipated closure date; the companies had originally looked to finalize the deal in the first quarter of this year.
While China is notorious for taking longer than some of its international counterparts to review mergers, the acquisition earned criticism from Chinese handset rivals, including Lenovo and ZTE, that relayed those concerns to Mofcom.
The majority of the concern, reports say, have to do with how the transaction will affect Nokia’s patent licensing fees. Similarly, the European Commission received opposition to the deal on the grounds that it could entice Nokia to charge higher licensing fees.
But in a statement released Tuesday, Nokia said that “no authority has challenged Nokia’s compliance with its FRAND undertakings related to standard-essential patents…or requested that Nokia make changes to its licensing program or royalty terms.”
Still, Microsoft reportedly offered to Chinese regulators to license its standard-essential patents on FRANT terms in addition to making non-exclusive licenses available to Android phones.
While China’s approval of the deal means the companies have progressed towards completing the acquisition, Nokia is facing challenges in India with a tax dispute that had Indian regulators require a $573 million guarantee before one of its manufacturing plants in the nation could be transferred to Microsoft.

214,"April 3, 2014",US: This week marks 14th anniversary of landmark Microsoft antitrust ruling,"
On April 3, 2000, a federal judge made a landmark ruling against Microsoft deciding that the company violated antitrust law in requiring Windows users to use the Internet Explorer browser.
US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson’s ruling followed his earlier findings, issued in 1999, that Microsoft had sought to abuse its dominance and retain its monopoly by crushing its Apple competition.
The 2000 ruling was a pivotal role for the US Department of Justice, which brought the case against Microsoft in May of 1998. The DOJ claimed that Microsoft’s bundling of Windows and IE escalated what it called the “browser wars,” and that the company had illegally squeezed rival Web browsers from the market.
It wasn’t until November 2001 that Microsoft finally reached a settlement with the DOJ, a move that earned criticism for being insufficient at curbing Microsoft’s anticompetitive practices.

After early disapproval, reports say Nokia shareholders have cleared Microsoft’s $7.2 billion buyout offer of the company’s handset device business.
Report say 99.7 percent of shareholders approved of the buyout in a general meeting held in Finland.
This is the first of several hurdles Microsoft will need to clear in its Nokia pursuit, however, as the deal remains subject to regulatory approval within the US and Europe. Should the buyout earn clearance, Microsoft plans to take over Nokia’s Lumia and Asha smartphone businesses, as well as other devices and software services.
Microsoft has reportedly declined to acquire Nokia’s mapping technology HERE, but will license the technology, as well as other patents.
Following the deal, Nokia said it plans to focus on its HERE technologies, network and patents.
Microsoft first announced plans to acquire Nokia last September.

As Microsoft completes its $5.2 billion buyout of Nokia’s mobile phones operations, reports say Nokia is predicting a more stable, profitable future as it re-focuses on the NSN networks equipment business.
The Finland-based company is also rumored to be considering a buyout of struggling rival Alcatel-Lucent’s wireless business, though Nokia declined to comment on that deal.
Microsoft’s buyout, most recently cleared by the Competition Commission of India, is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. While Nokia Lumia smartphone sales have risen in the third quarter, reports say Microsoft may still struggle to make the phones competitive against Samsung and Apple products.
As the acquisition deal closes, reports say 90 percent of Nokia’s sales will be made up of NSN, the Nokia Siemens Networks business.

A partnership between Yahoo! and Microsoft – which has Yahoo!’s search producing results from Microsoft’s search engine Bing – must be upheld in Taiwan and Hong Kong, a judge ruled.
US District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. ruled Yahoo! cannot back out of the alliance, inked to last a decade and signed in 2009. The partnership aimed to compete against search dominator Google.
The deal was made under former leadership for both Yahoo and Microsoft. Now, reports say Yahoo!’s current CEO Marissa Mayer attempted to slow the rollout of the search alliance within Taiwan and Hong Kong because she was unhappy with the deal.
Judge Patterson Jr. ruled that the search partnership must be implemented by October 28 in Taiwan and by November 11 in Hong Kong.
Reports say part of the reason Mayer wanted to delay the implementation of the partnership was to ensure that the terms of the deal would remain the same under Microsoft’s new CEO, following the exit of its current head Steve Ballmer.
According to reports, the search partnership was made following Yahoo!’s decline of a $44.6 billion buyout offer from Microsoft. The two companies have implemented their joint venture in 14 of their targeted 16 global markets so far.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has reportedly cleared a joint venture between Google and Yahoo!7, Yahoo!’s Australian branch, in a deal that will allow Yahoo!7 to present Google search results.
According to reports, the agreement means Yahoo!7 will transfer its search inventory to Google’s ad platform.
The parties received a letter from the ACCC clearing the partnership based on available information and therefore said it would not investigate the deal, say reports.
Earlier reports said rival Microsoft may lodge a complaint with regulators to block the deal, which brings an end to the trend of partnerships between Yahoo! and Microsoft.
An earlier partnership between the two meant Yahoo! search results would be generated by Microsoft-owned Bing. While the deal was supposed to apply to Australia as well, reports say discussions over the deal broke down, with both sides blaming each other for the deal’s failure.

A spokesperson for Google confirmed the probe, which is similar to a case launched by the European Commission.
According to reports, Microsoft, as well as other rivals in Brazil, are accusing Google of favoring its own product listings over  rivals’ in its search results, among other claims. Microsoft’s complaint alleged Google of giving an unfair advantage over competitors to its AdWords advertising service by blocking ad campaigns across rival search engines.
Reports say the advertising makes up 95 percent of Google’s revenue.
Other complaints were lodged with CADE by price comparison sites Buscapé and Bondfardo.
The investigation marks the next development in a trend of intensifying scrutiny of major US internet firms by Brazilian regulators, say reports.

Now, reports are exploring the new patent agreements, which includes 8,500 design patents to be acquired by Microsoft. Additionally, Microsoft will non-exclusively license 30,000 utility patents for $2.7 billion.
Together, the patents make up nearly all of Nokia’s portfolio, except for its Nokia Siemens Network infrastructure patents.

The rivalry between tech giants Google and Microsoft hit a new high last week as Google reportedly blocked Windows smartphones from running the Google-owned YouTube app. The dispute has carried on for months, beginning with Google’s cease and desist letter sent to Microsoft over the app alleging the use of the application is in violation of three of Google’s terms of services. In response, Microsoft vowed to work with Google to resolve the issue in efforts to have the application run on Windows smartphones with the same ease as Android or iPhone. The application was re-released by Microsoft last week, only to be blocked again by Google.
Both companies have issued statements on the issue, with Google insisting that Microsoft’s re-released YouTube app “violates our Terms of Service.”
But Microsoft’s vice president David Howard slammed the app blockage, claiming “The roadblocks Google has set up are impossible to overcome, and they know it” Further, Microsoft says Google is requiring its rival to transition the app to the HTML5 coding language, despite the requirement not pertaining to either Android or iPhone devices.
No antitrust complaint has been filed as of yet regarding the matter.

An appeals court reversed Jackson’s ruling a year later. Jackson is survived by his wife Patricia, who told reporters he died at his home in Maryland.

The deal, made for $8.5 billion, occurred in 2011. The remarks, made by Cisco officials, were part of an ongoing case between Cisco and Microsoft disputing whether the merger approval should be annulled by European officials. According to lawyers for Cisco, the Commission should have issued conditions on its approval of the buyout as the move allowed Microsoft to have a near-monopoly in the video communications market. It was a buyout, said Cisco, that unfairly squeezed out competitors through “so many factors” that could harm competition.

According to reports, the EU General Court will hear the case on May 29; Cisco argues that the European Commission ignored an anticompetitive consequence of the deal. Specifically, the equipment company says the merger hampers competition because Microsoft does not use open standards for video communication software, so competing products cannot be compatible with Skype. It’s a missed opportunity, argues Cisco, for the Commission to require Microsoft to use such an open standard. The deal earned approval from the regulator without concessions in October of 2011.

Motorola, owned by Google, has been dealt a blow by a US district judge concerning its ongoing rivalry with Microsoft concerning the use of patents. US District Judge James Robart has ruled that Motorola cannot require $4 billion a year in payments from Microsoft for the use of patented wireless technology, noting that the licenses for the technology are worse less than half of that $4 billion sum. The ruling is the latest development in the rivalry, in which both companies sued each other for use of those patents; Motorola accused Microsoft of patent infringement, while Microsoft accused Motorola of excessive licensing fees. It’s part of a larger issue concerning patents within antitrust, as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as well as the International Telecommunication Union requires both conglomerates to license essential patents on a RANT basis – reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Judge Robart had previously chastised both companies for being “arrogant” in their cases, arguing that the companies are part of a larger ploy in the fight for “commercial advantage.” The judge’s earlier decision ruled that Microsoft is entitled to a license from Motorola; soon after, a judge in Germany ruled that Microsoft had breached its licensing agreement with Motorola.

Jose Gonzalez-Magaz, William Gordon, Mar 28, 2013
Parties seeking dual settlements with the European Commission and the U.S. antitrust agencies are challenged by their differing frameworks. Part of the complexity stems from their separate approaches to competition law enforcement, while other components of the problem relate to their respective settlement processes. Since Microsoft settled its Windows case in the United States in 2001, but was unable to achieve that result with the EC, parties seeking resolution of anticompetitive allegations by means of concessions must take into account the risk of diverging settlement opportunities across the Atlantic. A decade later, the stress of that concern is intensified by Google’s recent settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the prospect of the EC again not following suit.

The group, Hispalinux, is arguing that Microsoft’s UEFI Secure Boot- which prevents Windows 8 from running Linux systems – is a “technological jail” for computer booting systems. There are loopholes to the Linux ban, however, as computer operators can disable the firmware settings – reports say that, in practice, there most likely has not been a significant decrease in Linux usage on computers running Windows.

Microsoft Fined for Non-Compliance: A Game-Changer in Antitrust Settlements  by Mario Mariniello (Bruegel)
Introduction by Europe Column editor Anna Tzanaki
Our March Europe Column is dedicated to the Commission’s landmark decision earlier this month fining Microsoft for breach of its legally binding commitments. Microsoft offered voluntary commitments to close the Commission’s tying case back in 2009, by pledging to introduce a web browser ballot screen. Notably this was the first time that the Commission has fined a company for not respecting an antitrust settlement. However, the calculation of the fine was equally interesting, and as duly noted by Commissioner Almunia, it served as a signaling mechanism of specific and general deterrence against future infringements. This is of critical importance if the Commission is to continue adopting Article 9 commitments decisions, while ensuring strict compliance and the benefits of antitrust settlements. Competitors such as Google may be happy to see strict enforcement of Microsoft’s commitments but they should be careful about not finding themselves in a similar situation…
 Mario Mariniello (Bruegel) explains the intricacies of the Microsoft fining decision and provides an insightful cost-benefit analysis of settlement decisions as a matter of antitrust policy. We hope you enjoy this month’s Europe Column!

The Financial Times and other media outlets are reporting that the $733 million fine issued to Microsoft by the European Commission earlier this week was the result of a tip-off from longtime rival Google. Microsoft, fined for breaching its previous settlement agreement with authorities to offer its customers a choice in Internet browsers, apparently neglected to include its “choice screen” – which the company promised to offer until 2014 – on products between February 2011 until July 2012. It’s an oversight that was only revealed when a third party complained about the issue; that third party, reports the Financial Times, was Google, which was working with Opera, a browser company in Norway. Google’s decision to call-out Microsoft, however, may bring difficulties to the search giant as it remains in the midst of its own case with the Commission for abuse of dominance claims. According to reports, the result of Microsoft’s fine may cause the Commission to develop stricter monitoring conditions on the companies with which it settles.

The rumors were true: The European Commission has fined Microsoft about $732 million. Previous speculation suggested the Commission was to fine Microsoft by Easter. According to reports, Microsoft’s fine is due to their breach of a 2009 settlement agreement concerning the choice of Internet browsers offered to consumers; the case stems back nearly two decades. The fine marks the first time the EU has issued sanctions against a company for failing to live up to terms of a previous antitrust settlement – the Commission pointed this case out as the first time a company has been fined for “non-compliance with a commitments decision.” While the fine is relatively small, some analysts say the action should be considered more of a “message” sent to companies about the seriousness of the Commission’s rulings. Commissioner Joaquin Almunia found Microsoft had failed to comply with the agreed-upon terms last October.

Neil Barrett helped secure a nearly $2.6 billion fine against Microsoft in the case, which began with a fine issued to Microsoft in 2004. He is now facing a lawsuit for alleged breach of contract and trust. According to reports, Barrett became head of Monitoring Trustee Limited, which was appointed to monitor Microsoft to ensure the company was complying with its settlement with the European Commission. Microsoft was ordered to pay the fees of that monitoring body, but an appeal by Microsoft lead the European Court of the First Instance to delegate that the Commission should be responsible for paying those fees. When Microsoft was again fined in 2008 for not complying with its settlement agreement, the Commission hired auditors Moore Stephens to provide a report of Monitoring Trustee Limited’s accounts following that 2008 fine. The auditors found that MTL paid Barrett for funds not covered by the Trustee Mandate, agreed upon by the Commission, Microsoft and Barrett. The Commission is now arguing that Barrett should repay those fees, but Barrett is reportedly contesting those claims.

Posted on Microsoft’s blog, the 1,400-word post voices concerns over what Heiner considers contradictory business practices when it comes to allowing Google’s advertisers to access their own data from advertising campaigns. Microsoft also made a pledge in the statement to make their standard essential patents available to other corporations under reasonable terms, which Heiner notes as a practice Google did not adhere to.  Heiner lastly noted that while the investigation is over in the US., the “good news” is that there are ongoing investigations overseas, most notably by the European Commission.

The Times highlights Penn’s history in politics – sometimes scarred by soured relationships – and highlights his merciless battle to help Microsoft finally pull ahead of Google.

The European Commission has agreed to spare Microsoft Corporation from being forced to open its Windows RT operating system to competing internet browsers, though has maintained its formal Statement of Objections against the computer software company. The decision might be seen as a reversal to previous analyses that the EC’s issuing of formal charges against the corporate giant sent a stern message to all major companies.

Following review, European Union antitrust commissioner Joaquín Almunia has officially issued Microsoft Statement of Objections for the company’s antitrust violations of a 2009 settlement over access to competitor’s browsers on their newest operating system, Windows 8, due for release later this week. Experts say that there are stronger implications beyond Microsoft, as the Statement of Objections was issued in the midst of Almunia’s office also investigating concerns over Google’s dominance of Internet search markets. The commissioner’s actions, say experts, sends a strong message to mega-corporations about the consequences of antitrust law violation.

Microsoft is about to receive a formal antitrust complaint from European Authorities, after the software giant left out its required ‘browser choice’ screen to 28 million users in 2009. According to German publication Der Spiegel, European authorities are ready to issue Microsoft with a formal ‘statement of objections’ that would charge Microsoft with a list of accusations. Microsoft has already admitted its wrongdoing in the case as a ‘technical error’ in its iteration of Windows 7, in the hope that it may dampen the harsh stick of justice from the European authorities. Microsoft could face up to 10 percent of its global annual turnover should it be found flouting European antitrust laws.

The European Commission has opened proceedings against Microsoft to investigate possible non-compliance with its 2009 commitments relating to browser choice. Microsoft had committed to offer, for a five-year period, a “choice screen” that allows users to select a web browser instead of requiring Internet Explorer. The Commission believes that this screen is missing in the Windows 7 Service Pack 1, which would have affected 28 million Windows users in the EU. Yet Microsoft had submitted in a compliance report to the Commission in December 2011 that the choice screen was included.

Stephen Houck, May 14, 2012
In the wake of the U.S. government’s unsuccessful prosecution of IBM (begun in 1969 and dropped in 1982), many knowledgeable observers believed that of the Sherman Act was no longer relevant and was too cumbersome to apply to fast-moving high-tech companies. The government’s prosecution of Microsoft, settled in 2001, proved them wrong.
Government antitrust enforcement agencies are now considering the applicability of to certain of Google’s practices, like its display of thematic search results. It is crucial that the government get it right. For one thing, an unsuccessful enforcement action is an enormous drain on resources that means significant lost opportunity costs for the government agency. An erroneous enforcement decision also risks undermining hard-won, infrequent government victories like Microsoft by creating precedents that will make future enforcement even more difficult than it already is today. And, most importantly, an ill-conceived enforcement action, especially in a rapidly evolving business like search, may actually impair consumer welfare by deterring and distorting innovation. This is a particular concern where the objective of those who encourage government action is to protect less efficient competitors rather than consumers.

On Aug 31, 2011, the Department of Justice, joined later by seven state attorneys general filed suit to block AT&T’s pending merger with T-Mobile USA. To be sure, the Department of Justice has never expressed any regret over the Microsoft case or any other recent antitrust action. But the decision to sue has plenty of self-interested fans, including AT&T competitors Sprint and Cellular South as well as advocacy groups in Washington who believe every merger will end the consumer internet as they know it.
Though different provisions of antitrust law apply to the two cases, both lawsuits repeat the same fatal flaws:

Both rely on a definition of the “relevant market” that is narrow and static.
Both cling to old models of economic analysis better suited for mature industrial age markets than to rapidly-evolving information markets, where new categories of products and services rise and fall in the time it takes to bring a case to appeal.
Both cases pursue sweeping remedies with little regard for their structural impact, either on the defendant or on fast-growing consumer markets.

In the tying part of the Microsoft case, as in the interoperability part of the case, the CFI upheld the Commission´s Decision. But it did so on grounds that were confused and inconsistent. For all of the central elements of the case, the CFI appears to have been unable or unwilling to set out a clear statement of principle and apply it properly to the facts. The judgment also sets the CFI in direct conflict with the more economic approach being developed by the Commission in its assessment of Article 82 cases. The only clear signal provided by the CFI in this case is that it will not engage in a reform of Article 82 policy. Fortunately, this does not prevent the Commission from doing so; indeed, the legal uncertainty resulting from this judgment makes clear guidance from the Commission all the more imperative.

The Microsoft judgment was a big decision in the sense that it is long and concerns an important company. If it can be called a landmark decision, what sort of landmark is it? This article considers whether at least on the interoperability side of the case the Microsoft judgment can really be seen as important and, in doing so, makes certain observations about the tests applied and problems remaining in relation to refusal to supply cases. The article concludes that, at least on the interoperability side of the case, the decision does not break new ground and leaves unresolved various problems in relation to the relevant legal tests.

This article agrees with John Vicker´s observation that the Court stretched each of the Magill/IMS criteria defining circumstances so exceptional that they warrant a duty to deal, and thus created confusion as to the limits of exceptionality. It argues that the Court should have resorted to concept rather than factors (principles rather than rules) to define exceptionality, and that, doing so, it might have reached the same outcome, but in a more principled way. The article concludes, however, that the duty-to-deal outcome in Microsoft is not the only logical one; indeed, where a court ends is a function of where it begins.

Arguably the largest abuse of dominance case in Europe before Microsoft was the IBM case of the early 1980s. Both cases were about interoperability and bundling, and both followed litigation in the United States. Unlike Microsoft, the European IBM case was settled without a decision being taken, so the public record is thin. This paper looks back at the case, and the increasingly competitive environment surrounding IBM, and contrasts it with the situation of Microsoft. The September 2007 judgment of the Court of First Instance in Microsoft is then discussed. That the Commission won on interoperability is welcomed, but not the apparent ease of its victory, which may have left unclear limiting principles for the future.

Denis Waelbroeck, Jan 25, 2008
The judgment of the European Court of First Instance in Microsoft raises several issues. In this article, we will look in particular at the main findings regarding the two abuses (refusals to license and product integration). Under the applicable case law before Microsoft (i.e., the IMS Health and Magill judgments), the refusal by a dominant undertaking to allow access to a product protected by intellectual property rights (IPR) was regarded as abusive only in exceptional circumstances, where three conditions were met:

(i) where the IPR is “indispensable” to exercise an activity in a neighboring market;


(ii) where the refusal is likely to “eliminate all competition” on such market; and


(iii) where the undertaking intends to use its IPR to hinder the production of “new products” that it does not offer and for which there is a potential consumer demand.

It is essentially with regard to this third condition, the “new product” condition, that the Microsoft judgment introduces significant changes to the existing case law.

As someone who has spent a considerable portion of the last five years working on issues involving Microsoft’s conduct and the competition laws, I read with interest the commentary that followed the issuance of the Court of First Instance’s decision on September 17. Much of the focus of the commentary was on the significance of the decision with respect to the state of “convergence” of U.S. and European Community (“Community”) competition law relating to unilateral conduct of “dominant” firms. While convergence, or the lack thereof, is obviously a major issue, the decision is also important because of what it reflects about regulatory and judicial views in Europe and the United States on issues at the intersection of intellectual property and competition law. These issues have broader implications than just the Microsoft case.
But first a small point; the standard of review applied by the CFI may have been a significant driver of the outcome. In paragraph 87 of the decision, the CFI states that its review of the “complex economic appraisals” is “necessarily limited to checking whether the relevant rules on procedure and on stating reasons have been complied with, whether the facts have been accurately stated and whether there has been any manifest error of assessment or a misuse of powers.” Similarly, in p...

Harry First, Sep 28, 2007
The CFI’s decision in Microsoft came as something of a surprise. In the run-up to its issuance, commentators had been predicting some sort of “split-the-difference” approach, seeing the Court as most likely upholding the Commission’s decision on Microsoft’s refusal to supply interoperability information to Sun but reversing its decision on Microsoft’s refusal to dis-integrate Windows and the Windows Media Player. I thought the opposite. Immediately after the Commission’s decision in 2004 Microsoft had petitioned the CFI for interim relief to suspend the Commission’s remedial orders. Although the CFI denied the petition, Judge Vesterdorf, President of the CFI, had not dismissed Microsoft’s attack on the interoperability issue out of hand. He recognized that there was a serious dispute on a number of points. Was the protocol information “indispensable” within the meaning of prior case law? Was the assertion of intellectual property rights to these protocols sufficient, in itself, to constitute an “objective justification” for a refusal to provide the information? Microsoft’s contention that the Commission’s decision was wrong on these points, Judge Vesterdorf wrote, “could not be regarded as prima facie unfounded.” I took that to mean that Microsoft had some plausible defenses.

On September 17, 2007, the European Commission’s (EC) antitrust decision of 2004 in Microsoft was upheld on appeal almost in its entirety by the Court of First Instance (CFI). The case had two parts: the first on the inclusion of Windows Media Player (WMP) in Windows, and the second on the interoperability of Windows clients with Sun servers. The consequences are significant both for Microsoft and the computing industry. With regard to media players, the Commission forced Microsoft to sell in Europe “Windows-N,” a version of Windows without WMP. Microsoft complied. Windows-N sales were less than 1% of Windows sales. It is evident that consumers and computer manufacturers do not want an operating system with less functionality. However, with its decision upheld, the Commission can now force any dominant firm (and remember that dominance can be established at much lower market shares in the EU than the U.S.) to sell products with functionality or components removed from them. Is the EU requirement likely to make a difference? The marketplace said no. And, while the EU battled Microsoft on media players for nine (!) years at the behest of Real Networks, Adobe’s Flash emerged as the dominant PC video player and Apple grabbed the lion’s share in the online song download market with a proprietary format.

The Commission initiated an investigation. In February of 2000, the Commission expanded its investigation to look into actions by Microsoft regarding its Windows Media Player. Late that year the Commission sent a Statement of Objections to Microsoft alleging that it had failed to disclose interoperability information for its Windows operating system. In August 2001, the Commission sent a second statement of objections to Microsoft alleging that Microsoft had improperly tied its Windows Media Player software into the Windows operating system. In August 2003, the Commission sent a third Statement of Objections confirming the objections sent to Microsoft in the previous to statements. Microsoft responded to all of these statements, and, in response to the third statement of objections it requested a hearing from the Commission. The hearing was held in November of 2003. The Commission issued its decision in March 2004 in which it declared that Microsoft had abused its dominant ...

309,"April 19, 2007",Are Article 82 EC and Intellectual Property Interoperable? The State of the Law Pending the Judgment in Microsoft v. Commission,"
Maurits Dolmans, Paul-John Loewenthal, Robert O’Donoghue, Apr 19, 2007
The objectives of intellectual property rights (IPR) and competition law are essentially the same: both promote innovation to the benefit of consumers. IPRs are, however blunt instruments that strike the right balance in general, but in exceptional individual situations may not achieve (and may sometimes even obstruct) the innovation policy goal. Competition law is a useful tool to redress the balance in these situations, and the European Commission and EC courts have recognized that in exceptional cases the exercise of IPRs may infringe competition law. This article examines the extent to which Article 82 EC restricts the use of IPRs, pending the judgment of the CFI in Case T-201/04, Microsoft v. Commission.

The big three cloud service providers, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, account for nearly three-quarters of the European cloud market, according to data published by Synergy Research Group.
And although all three companies have been subject to various EU antitrust investigations over the years, their respective cloud businesses have not yet felt the full force of European competition law.

That said, the European Commission (EC) has been investigating Microsoft for anticompetitive practices after complaints were filed by rival cloud providers, including Germany’s Nextcloud and France’s OVHcloud, last year.
No formal probe has been launched since, but the implementation of changes to Microsoft’s outsourcing and hosting terms in October has been widely perceived as an attempt to appease the EU’s antitrust concerns.
The revised terms are intended to make it easier for users of Microsoft’s software products to deploy them on non-Azure cloud servers and form part of the Big Tech firm’s previous commitments to support European cloud providers.
Yet the recent amendments weren’t enough to stop the trade association Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) from filing another complaint with the European Commission earlier this month, alleging that the new terms not only fail to address Microsoft’s market abuse, but add new unfair practices to its contractual requirements.
“Microsoft’s ongoing position and behaviors are irreparably damaging the European cloud ecosystem and depriving European customers of choice in their cloud deployments,” CISPE stated, urging the EC to launch a formal inquiry.

Facebook parent Meta is facing demands that it stop harvesting personal data in the UK for targeted advertisements in a new lawsuit that goes to the heart of Facebook’s business model.
The legal challenge, which is being brought by human rights campaigner Tanya O’Carroll, is seeking a declaration that Meta is in breach of the regional General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by continuing to process her data and use it to profile her for ad targeting purposes.
This case attacking Meta’s business model adds to a series of regulatory and legal risks for Meta in Europe, ranging from trans-Atlantic data flows to antitrust actions in Germany and the UK. 
Related: UK Questions If Meta & Microsoft Can Self-Regulate Their Metaverses
Meta has built tools for privacy check-up and ad preferences, where it explains what data people have shared and how they can exercise control over the type of ads they see, Meta said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg. “We know that privacy is important to our users, and we take this seriously,” Meta’s spokesperson said.
O’Carroll was the chief coordinator of the People vs. Big Tech campaign and a former director and co-founder of Amnesty Tech. She’s now a senior fellow at the law firm Foxglove.
O’Carroll objected to “being surveilled and profiled,” AWO said. “A win could set a precedent for millions of users of search engines or social media in the UK and EU who have been forced to accept invasive surveillance and profiling to use digital platforms,” it added.
On paper, the European Union’s GDPR provides a suite of rights for individuals attached to their information including a right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes and an unqualified right that personal data shall no longer be processed for such a purpose if the user objects.
“We shouldn’t have to give up every detail of our personal lives just to connect with friends and family online. The law gives us the right to take back control over our personal data and stop Facebook surveilling and tracking us,” said O’Carroll in a statement.

312,"November 17, 2022",The Interoperability Hope,"
Interoperability is being put forward as a structural remedy to resolve issues of market power in networks — particularly, social media. When network effects are present, this means that it is possible that having one or a few operators is not only what arises but also efficient at any given point in time. Regulators can only be assured that a situation is efficient if there is potential competition that can bolster innovation by incumbents. A degree of interoperability to make any centralised outcomes contestable even if it does not lead to lower concentration per se. For social media networks, it is suggested that the principle of allowing the portability of identity (similar to interconnection in telecommunications) would be an appropriate goal with respect to the practical implementation of interoperability.

I. INTRODUCTION
Social media was built for network effects. Launch a social media platform, and its entire success is built upon whether people use it to interact with other people (regardless of knowing them personally or not). From a media perspective, the content is (mostly) provided by users, but the attention garnered and a platform’s ability to monetize it through advertising rivals all forms of old media where the content was created by skilled practitioners. The difference is that user-generated content has the potential to be ‘two-way.’ That is, I provide content intending that others will interact with it and vice vers...

313,"November 17, 2022",Interoperability as a Remedy in Antitrust Cases,"
Interoperability between the products and services of different firms promotes competition by lowering switching costs. Requiring dominant firms to make their products interoperable, or reducing barriers to interoperability, are important components of competition policy for the digital age. This article makes the case for interoperability remedies in antitrust enforcement actions against Internet services. It explains the problem of “gatekeeper” firms in Internet-related markets, and describes the ways that Internet services can interoperate with one another, including through “competitive compatibility” achieved without permission from an incumbent firm. The article then lays out a spectrum of remedies that antitrust enforcers or private litigants can pursue to promote interoperability, from mandates on an incumbent firm to bans on interfering with a bona fide interoperator. Finally, the article explains how interoperability can be reconciled with the protection of users’ privacy.

By Mitch Stoltz[1]
 
Interoperability has always been a powerful pro-competitive tool in high-tech markets. The ability to build new products and services that are compatible with established products gives consumers more choices and helps competitors avoid entry barriers. That’s why so many iconic exercises of competition policy can be seen as interoperability remedies, from the Federal Communications Commission’s 1965 Carterfone order, to the conditions imposed on Microsoft...

314,"November 9, 2022",How the New Anti-Merger Policy May Be the New Antitrust Paradox,"
Neo-Brandeisian policies that would chill acquisitions by highly capitalized companies, or companies with 30%+ market share in some related market, would remove from the competitive race the companies that often have the best prospects for de-consolidating many markets, including digital markets that are prone to tipping.

By Maureen K. Ohlhausen & Taylor M. Owings[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Neo-Brandeisians are in control at the White House, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”). Raising barriers to mergers is in; concern about the impact of overenforcement is out. The classic Borkian antitrust “paradox” (that certain misguided forms of antitrust enforcement can be counterproductive to the goal of increasing competition) is out of vogue and maligned in public discourse. A little over a year since the Biden Executive Order on competition,[2] it’s helpful to take stock of the Administration’s policy on mergers and whether it risks falling into the original paradox of counterproductive overenforcement.
 
II. THE POLICY
Public statements from President Biden, FTC Chair Lina Khan, and Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter have all sounded the call that antitrust enforcers should be discouraging or blocking more mergers.[3] The Biden Executive Order on competition prompted a joint FTC/DOJ statement expressing skepticism that the merger guidelines accurately reflect current economic rea...

Contemporary merger guidelines are heavily dependent on empirical observations of past and present markets. This feature makes the guidelines inadequate for addressing market power in the dynamic high-tech industries. Competition regulators should redirect merger policies towards focusing on industry features that do or that will create market power – i.e. protect firms from competitive pressure – and then adopt policies that challenge mergers that would extend the reach of such monopoly-inducing features. Antitrust strategies for diminishing the presence of such features to the extent practicable would also be in order.

By Mark A. Jamison[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Companies engage in mergers for many reasons, including to respond to deregulation or to technology change, or because of a desire to achieve scale or acquire resources.[2] Another reason is to eliminate existing or potential competition in specific markets.[3] Because of this potential of lessening competition, antitrust regulators scrutinize and potentially stop mergers that, in their opinions, have a high likelihood of decreasing competition to the harm of consumers.[4]
Merger analysis is generally a two-step process where, first, the competition authority defines the markets where the merger might increase power – i.e. the ability to avoid competitive pressure – and second, whether the merger does indeed result in greater market power to the harm of consumers.[5] The first step is data intensive ...

An important part of the Chicago Revolution in antitrust was the argument that no monopoly is forever. Eventually, someone will innovate and offer a superior product that the monopolist cannot match. And, just like that, the monopolist will be history.
Microsoft’s lock on operating systems looked assured in 1998 when the Justice Department tried to break the company up. But that remedy was never ultimately imposed. And in the end it didn’t matter. For, less than ten years later, smartphones arrived, and now most people do most of their computing on operating systems not made by Microsoft.
It seems to follow that antitrust action is a waste of time.
So interesting, then, to hear all the talk of late about how, despite its best efforts, China won’t be able to catch up with the West in chip production.

317,"October 31, 2022","Behavioral Insights in the DMA: A Good Start, But How Will the Story End?","
The EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) contains several provisions which reflect important behavioral insights, and in particular the importance of choice architecture for end user decision-making. This article discusses three roles played by such insights. First, several DMA obligations address conduct whose anticompetitive effects arise from the interlinkage between choice architecture and end user behavior. Second, certain DMA obligations more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing users. Third, the heavy emphasis on effectiveness within the DMA creates a potential role for behavioral insights. If gatekeepers are to be effective in promoting fairness and contestability, to comply with the DMA, then they may need to do more to address behavioral biases than the provisions state explicitly “on their face.” But does the DMA go far enough in considering the implications of behavioral economics? Arguably not. This article also describes some residual questions and challenges arising where more clarity could be given or more could usefully be done.
By Amelia Fletcher[1]
  
The way in which options are presented to people – the so-called “Choice Architecture” they face – can have a dramatic impact on their choices. This key behavioral insight is increasingly well understood and is having ramifications across many policy areas. The UK Competition and Markets Authority recently published a report discussing the implications of online choice architecture for consumer protection and competition policy (CMA, 2022),[2] and we can also see its impact in the new EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”).
This heightened focus on choice architecture reflects the growing recognition that individuals exhibit behavioral biases, which in turn arise from their cognitive limitations. We are not super-calculating fact-based machines. Rather, we think about things subjectively, have limited attention, and utilize rules of thumb.
This toolkit serves us reasonably well most of the time. It can be perfectly sensible to accept default options, choose the highest ranked or more prominent recommendations, or stick with the status quo. However, our tendency to do so can also lead us astray.  Because our behavior tends to exhibit systematic biases, knowledge of these can be exploited by others. As a simple example, if a firm knows I have a strong predilection for accepting the default option, this can potentially be used to sell me products I don’t need, or to discourage me from searching even when I do. The US Federal Trade Commission recently found that such so-called “dark patterns” are on the increase online (FTC, 2022).[3]
The EU Digital Markets Act imposes new rules on a small set of the largest “gatekeeper” platforms. Recognizing the limited attention of their end users, these platforms have worked hard to make the consumer journey as smooth as possible. This can be beneficial. The use of defaults, for example, can be helpful in reducing the number of active decisions end users have to make, and so ease the adoption of innovative new services. However, it can also be harmful. The EU’s 2018 Google Android decision[4] (recently upheld by The General Court)[5] found that the use of such defaults in the presence of end user “status quo bias” can enable leverage of market power from one service into another.
During the final stages of negotiations on the DMA, A variety of changes were made which more firmly embedded behavioral insights within the regulation. These changes are broadly positive. This short article discusses three key ways in which insights relating to choice architecture and behavioral biases underpin the final version of the DMA:

Several DMA obligations seek to address conduct whose anticompetitive effects arise from the interlinkage between choice architecture and user behavioral biases.
Certain DMA obligations more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing users.
The heavy emphasis on effectiveness within the DMA also creates a potential role for behavioral insights. If gatekeepers are to be effective in promoting fairness and contestability, to comply with the DMA, then they may need to do more to address behavioral biases than the provisions state explicitly “on their face.”

But does the DMA go far enough in considering the implications of behavioral economics? Arguably not. This article describes some residual questions and challenges arising where more clarity could be given or more could usefully be done.
 
I. DMA OBLIGATIONS TO ADDRESS ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECTS ARISING FROM CHOICE ARCHITECTURE
Certain DMA requirements are designed to address conduct, the anti-competitive effects of which are underpinned by the interlinkage between choice architecture and behavioral biases.
For example, a key behavioral insight is that individuals can be highly – and unduly – influenced by ranking and salience. This was important in the 2017 Google Shopping decision,[6] which sets out how Google was able to leverage its position in general search by demoting rival shopping sites down its search rankings (exploiting “ranking bias”) and making its own Shopping Box highly prominent (exploiting “saliency bias”). Likewise, the ongoing Amazon Buy Box case[7] has its (alleged) anticompetitive effect because consumers have a strong tendency to use the salient offer in Amazon’s Buy Box and are far less likely to scroll down or click through to find alternative offers.
Recognizing this vital importance of ranking for end user decision-making, Article 6(5) of the DMA requires that “the gatekeeper shall not treat more favourably, in ranking and related indexing and crawling, services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself than similar services or products of a third party. The gatekeeper shall apply transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions to such ranking and related indexing and crawling.” Recital (52) clarifies that this also covers “instances where a core platform service presents or communicates only one result to the end user.”
Similarly, the EU’s ongoing Apple App Store case[8] partly relates to Apple’s “anti-steering provisions,” which limit the ability of app developers to inform end users of alternative purchasing possibilities outside of apps. Such restrictions restrict competition to the app store by creating both informational and behavioral barriers – they both limit end users’ awareness of alternative purchasing possibilities and make it harder for them to access them.
Again, this concern is addressed by the DMA. Article 5(4) prohibits such provisions, while Article 5(5) ensures that purchases made outside of apps can be used smoothly.
 
II. DMA OBLIGATIONS THAT MORE EXPLICITLY COVER THE CHOICE ARCHITECTURE FACING END USERS
The role of behavioral insights within the DMA provisions described above is somewhat implicit. However, there are certain DMA obligations which more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing end users.
These essentially take two forms. First, and most prevalent, are a set of provisions that require the gatekeeper to enable end users to switch services. While these are primarily about reducing switching costs, additional wording was added to the DMA at a late stage that has a more behavioral bent. It is no longer simply required that switching is possible, but also that it is easy. For example:

Articles 6(3) requires that the gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable end users to easily change default settings” in relation to search engines, web browsers and virtual assistants, while Article 6(4) imposes a similar requirement in respect of third party software apps or app stores.
Article 6(3) requires that end users should be able “to easily uninstall” any apps.
Article 6(13) requires them to ensure that conditions of termination provision “can be exercised without undue difficulty.”
The wording in Articles 6(6) takes slightly different form, but arguably comes to the same thing. Gatekeepers are required not to “restrict technically or otherwise the ability of end users to switch between, and subscribe to, different software applications and services.” (All underlining added).

While they may seem innocuous, the terms “easily,” “without undue difficulty” and “or otherwise” are important. We know that real end users are unlikely to act in the way that the regulation intends if it is in any way difficult to do so. There is also ample evidence that gatekeepers are well positioned to tweak the choice environment, sometimes subtly, to make such actions harder, rather than easier. This final terminology should help to prevent this.
The second set of obligations go further. They recognize that it may not be sufficient to enable end users to make choices, or even to make them easily. End users may exhibit such strong “status quo bias” that they still fail to act. And if they fail to act, then the interventions will not have their desired impact on fairness and contestability.
This issue is addressed by facilitating the use of prompts and requiring some use of choice screens, which force end users to make an active choice. Specifically:

Under Article 6(4), gatekeepers must allow third party providers of apps and app stores to prompt end users to decide if they wish to make that app or app store their default. Such prompts are expected to help to overcome “status quo bias” and really shift end user choices.
Under Article 6(3), gatekeepers must require end users to choose – from a list of the main available service providers ­– their online search engine, virtual assistant, or web browser, at the time of their initial use. Such a choice screen is designed to prevent gatekeepers from benefitting from “default bias” by setting their own services as defaults.

  
III. BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS AND THE “EFFECTIVENESS” PROVISIONS OF THE DMA
A third potential linkage between behavioral economics and the DMA lies in the DMA’s heavy emphasis on “effectiveness.” Under the DMA, effectiveness does not simply relate to whether an obligation is formally achieved in itself. For an obligation to be met, it must also be effective in achieving the DMA’s overall objectives of fairness and contestability.
This is seen in the overarching compliance framework, as set out in Article 8.

Article 8(1) states that: “The gatekeeper shall ensure and be able to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of this Regulation. The measures implemented by the gatekeeper to ensure compliance with those Articles shall be effective in achieving the objectives of this Regulation and of the relevant obligation.”
Article 8(2) enables the Commission to specify “the measures that the gatekeeper concerned is to implement in order to effectively comply with the obligations,” and Article 8(7) states that in doing so, “the Commission shall ensure that the measures are effective in achieving the objectives of this Regulation and the relevant obligation.”

It is noteworthy that in both underlined sections in the previous bullets, the wording “of this Regulation and” was added in the final wording of the Regulation, presumably to make absolutely clear that effectiveness was to be viewed in the context of the overall objectives of fairness and contestability.
The focus on effectiveness is also seen within individual obligations. Specifically:

Article 6(4) requires gatekeepers to “allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of” third party apps and app stores.
Article 6(7) requires gatekeepers to allow “effective interoperability”
Article 6(9) requires gatekeepers to provide “effective portability of data,” including “tools to facilitate the effective exercise of such data portability.”
Article 6(10) requires data access for business users that is “effective, high-quality, continuous and real-time.”

This focus on effectiveness within the DMA does not make explicit reference to behavioral considerations. However, they seem likely to be critical in practice.
Indeed, choice architecture is explicitly addressed in Article 13 which relates to anti-circumvention measures. Here, gatekeeper platforms are specifically prohibited from using behavioral techniques or interface design to undermine effective compliance. This includes a prohibition on making the exercise of end user choice unduly difficult by “offering choices in a non-neutral manner,” or “by subverting end users or business users’ decision making via the structure or design of a user interface.”
How might this emphasis on effectiveness play out in practice?
To consider this, consider the end user data portability requirement under Article 6(9). As is discussed in Recital 59, data portability will be “effective” in promoting contestability if it genuinely enables end user switching and/or multi-homing, and thereby incentivizes gatekeepers and business users to innovate.
This in turn requires that there are no barriers to end users making use of data portability. It seems reasonable to assume that the requirements around effectiveness will prevent gatekeepers from creating behavioral barriers to data portability, such as making end users click through excessive warning screens before porting their data. It should also prevent gatekeepers putting in place rules that restrict third party services encouraging or prompting the use of data portability.
But even if gatekeepers do nothing to inhibit take up, that may not be enough. Experience from multiple other markets tells us that enabling users to switch need not lead to them actually switching or multi-homing. In the face of inactive and cautious consumers, even more proactive stimulation may be needed. For example, despite the UK Current Account Switching Service (“CASS”) being successful in eliminating most of the difficulties that consumers faced in switching bank, consumers were insufficiently aware of this and switching rates remained stubbornly low. As a result, CASS has now been additionally required to engage in the active promotion of its services.
Looking forward, it will be interesting to see whether the Commission seeks to use the requirement of effectiveness to drive similar proactive interventions in an online context – interventions that may even go beyond what the DMS sets out “on its face.”
  
IV. DOES THE DMA GO FAR ENOUGH IN INCORPORATING BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS?
While these various DMA provisions reflect a far better understanding of behavioral science than might have been expected from the DMA’s initial drafting, there nonetheless remain a number of residual questions and additional challenges.
First, the DMA’s emphasis on users being able to take certain actions “easily” or “without undue difficulty” is clearly helpful. If end users find it hard to take actions, then they will not do so. But how should these terms be interpreted in practice?
For example, it is required under Article 6(3) that end users should be able to able to change their default search engine easily. But there are typically multiple access points to search engines on a device. Users can go to a search app, they can go to a particular browser and use its default search engine, they can search via the voice assistant and use its default search engine, they can use text search (or “look-up”) from within another app, or they can use a search widget. Should it be presumed that being able to switch search engine “easily” means that end users should be able to switch the default setting for all of these at once? Or – arguably even better – that they should have access to a single screen where they can simply tick which access points they wish to switch?
It is also not clear that sufficient thinking has been done in relation to the different way in which end users interact with voice assistants versus screens. For the former, users are less likely to be able to deal effectively with long lists of options. It is one thing to enable a user to say “Siri, I wish to change my default browser,” it is quite another to think about how the available options can then be presented in a neutral way.
Also, what will firms be expected to do in order to demonstrate compliance with these provisions? This will presumably involve needing to show how easily users can switch default. But this raises the question of how to “audit” choice architecture.
There are established methods for testing the impact of choice architecture, such as A/B testing. A natural way of demonstrating compliance, therefore, would be for gatekeepers to share with the Commission evidence derived from such experimental work. But will this be enough? It may well be that the Commission will need to require additional targeted testing. There may also be merit to its finding a way of systematizing such testing and its reporting, so that all gatekeepers use a common framework.
Second, it is not clear that the regulations take a fully consistent or appropriate approach to the repeating of prompts. Under Article 5(2), which restricts the collection, combination, and cross-use of personal data across services without active end user consent, the CMA states specifically that where consent “has been refused or withdrawn by the end user, the gatekeeper shall not repeat its request for consent for the same purpose more than once within a period of one year.”
This wording seems to be partly motivated by concerns around “consent fatigue.” This seems sensible. However, there is no equivalent wording in Article 6(4) that would similarly limit the frequency of prompts from third parties, or allow gatekeepers to do so. As such, there is a serious risk that end users become overwhelmed by prompts from third parties seeking to become their default. This is in turn likely to generate “choice fatigue,” creating a risk either that end users either ignore the prompts, thus dampening their potential impact on contestability, or (even more worryingly) that end users actually make mistakes.
There must also be a risk of such prompts being misleading. In telecoms markets, when it was made too easy for third parties to switch consumers to their own services, we saw the emergence of “slamming” whereby consumers would find they had switched provider without fully realizing it.  This would not be a good outcome here, but the risk is not addressed by the DMA, and nor is it clear that the DMA would allow gatekeepers to step in and ameliorate it.  
Third, there can be important tensions in designing choice architecture, and it is not clear that these have been considered fully. For example, in relation to the right to termination (as addressed under Article 6(13)), the associated Recital (63) proposes that “closing an account or un-subscribing should not be made be (sic) more complicated than opening an account or subscribing to the same service.” 
Whilst this would seem a desirable objective in principle, it may be difficult to achieve in all cases without creating unintended consequences. For example, when end users are setting up a new device, they value being led through the process of signing up to a series of services in a well ordered and straightforward fashion. It is not clear how it would be possible to make it as easy to unsubscribe to these services as to sign up to them without giving the end user regular prompts to consider doing so. But this could easily annoy end users and could even lead to them making mistakes as discussed previously. In practice, it is to be hoped that the Commission would accept a proportionate solution, such as the introduction of easy-to-find cancellation buttons. But this could usefully be clarified.
Likewise, the requirement under Article 5(2) not to repeat consent requests more than annually might seem sensible, but what if a user has switched off location services and then wishes to use a proprietary mapping app. Is the gatekeeper really prohibited from advising the user that they will need to switch on location services to do so?
Fourth, while the DMA is designed to open up end user choice, we would expect end users to have a tendency to choose brand names they already know, and risk averse in terms of tying out new options. This has two important implications.
First, it means that the design of the default choice screens required under Article 6(3) really matters. The precise choice architecture adopted will be critical to their success. There are many different aspects that could become relevant here, from the number of options provided and their ordering, to whether there should be brief descriptions of each option. These options will need to be tested to ensure that the choice screens have their desired impact. Another element that is almost certain to be helpful would be clear reassurance that users can easily reverse their choice later if they wish to do so.
Second, it means that opening up choice for some services could backfire, by enhancing the market position of the biggest players yet further. Take Microsoft Bing for instance. Currently this is the default search engine on Microsoft devices. Despite Bing only having around 5 percent of the EU search market, it seems plausible that Microsoft will be required to offer users an upfront choice of search engine. This in turn may well lead to a further loss of Bing’s market share to Google; presumably not the result the Commission was seeking.
 
V. CONCLUSION
Overall, the DMA already exhibits a strong understanding of the importance of choice architecture and end user behavioral biases. However, it is not clear that the DMA has in fact gone far enough in considering the implications of behavioral science. Some challenges and unanswered questions remain. How “easy” do actions need to be to satisfy the obligations, and how will compliance be demonstrated? Is there a risk of end users being overwhelmed or misled by third party prompts, and how can this be addressed? Are there unintended effects of some of the proposals around choice architecture? And is there a risk that greater end user choice could in fact embed market positions even more strongly?
It is to be hoped that many of these questions will be considered and addressed by the Commission during the process of DMA implementation. This is not a simple matter and would require serious resources and expertise. If it can be done, the DMA stands to be the most advanced regulation to date in terms of its embedding of behavioral insights. But if not, its effectiveness may be seriously compromised.

318,"October 31, 2022","Online Choice Architecture: The Good, the Bad, and the Complicated","
Online choice architecture (“OCA”) encompasses the set of design features that impact choice in digital environments. From default settings and notifications to personalization and recommender systems, OCA features are present in almost every interaction with technology. Existing evidence on the effects of OCA on human behavior have often been one-sided, focusing either on positive or negative outcomes. In online settings, the effect of OCA practices on consumer welfare is often complicated. In this paper, we describe the design process and practices of OCA, analyze applications of OCA for good and for bad, and discuss future direction for research and practice of OCA design. We recommend that designers and researchers measure and capture a wider range of outcomes, beyond user engagement and satisfaction. We also highlight the interplay between data, algorithms and OCA design since many OCA practices are embedded in the design of interfaces and are often data-driven. Therefore, advancing good and preventing bad OCA design might require an approach that goes beyond the individual user or designer, and looks at structural changes across the market.

EU antitrust officials are looking to establish a 40-man team and hire a technology expert to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, reported Reuters.
The rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of do’s and don’ts for Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and other gatekeepers which control access to their sites and the data there.

CPI reported in July that the European Commission was considering creating a new directorate to allay concerns that it may struggle to get deep-pocketed and well-advised tech companies to comply with the new rules.
A 12-man unit headed by antitrust veteran Thomas Kramler who is currently handling the Apple and Amazon antitrust investigations and a 9-person strong task-force will move to the new directorate, the official said.
The EU competition enforcer aims to hire 19 more people for the directorate and a chief technology officer to focus on data, the official said.
The new unit will need the green light from the college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries in the coming weeks before it can be set up.
Enforcement of the DMA will be done jointly with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which has also set up a new unit for the task.

320,"October 25, 2022",FCA Exploring Implications of Big Tech Entry Into Financial Services,"


As the likes of Google and Apple have diversified their offering to include payments and other financial services, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is looking to understand the consequences of this trend for competition.
“The potential competition impacts of Big Tech entry and expansion in retail financial services,” a discussion paper the regulator published Tuesday (Oct. 25), explores the impact of Big Tech firms’ arrival in payments, deposit taking, consumer credit and insurance markets.
Related: UK Financial Watchdog’s Plan Includes Crypto & Big Tech
The paper lists Google, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Microsoft as global Big Tech Firms. It adds Alibaba, Tencent and Mercado Libre as regional ones.
The regulator observes that in the U.K., the global Big Tech firms listed have some FCA permissions to offer retail financial services. Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple have some payment permissions, and Google and Meta also have some e‑money permissions. Apple and Amazon have some consumer credit and insurance permissions.
The initial paper will be followed by an expert panel discussion in November and sector-specific workshops in December. The FCA has also requested comments from interested parties, who have until Jan. 15 to respond.
“In recent years, Big Tech’s entry into financial services, in the UK and elsewhere, has demonstrated their potential to disrupt established markets, drive innovation and reduce costs for consumers,” FCA Executive Director of Consumers and Competition Sheldon Mills said in a press release. “Across the world, we’ve seen the capability of Big Tech to offer transformative new products in areas such as payments, deposits and consumer credit … The discussion we are starting today will inform the FCA’s pro-competitive approach to digital markets, and I encourage consumers, firms and fellow regulators to join the conversation.”
Hinting at potential antitrust concerns, the release states that “in the longer term, Big Tech firms could pose competition risks if they rapidly gain market share, and they are able to exploit market power.” For each of the financial services it discusses, the paper lists potential competition benefits and harms presented by Big Tech.
At present, no regulatory changes are being proposed and the FCA’s paper aims only to stimulate discussion on the topic.
Should the FCA ever deem that Big Tech moves in the financial services space are uncompetitive, it would likely work with the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) in any resulting investigation.
The discussion paper references multiple CMA Big Tech probes including the case of Meta’s Giphy acquisition. As PYMNTS reported recently, Meta is set to sell Giphy following an order from the CMA.

US chipmaker Broadcom will seek early European Union antitrust approval of its proposed $61 billion (A$98 billion) acquisition of cloud computing company VMware by pointing to competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Google, people familiar with the matter said.
Announced in May, the deal is the second biggest globally so far this year and marks Broadcom’s attempt to diversify its business into enterprise software.
Tech deals have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world concerned about power concentration in a few players and the possibility of bigger companies acquiring start-ups only to shut them down.
“This (deal) is creating more competition in the cloud market where there are very big players now. This doesn’t have to go to phase two at all,” one of the people said, referring to the European Commission’s four-month long second phase investigation.
“For the Commission to go to phase two, there has to be a real competition problem – horizontal, vertical, foreclosure risk – and I think we can show those risks don’t really exist in this case,” the person said.
“We continue to make progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, with that work moving ahead as expected,” the company said.

322,"October 11, 2022",EU Telecom Regulators Are Against US Big Tech Paying For Infrastructure,"


A group of European telecom regulators does not support the idea of having big tech firms such as Google and Netflix paying for telecommunications infrastructure, it said in initial findings published on Tuesday.
The findings by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) come as the European Commission is debating whether internet platforms should be obliged to fund digital infrastructure such as 5G telecoms networks, given they make heavy use of it.
The telecommunications industry has argued Google, Netflix, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple should pay for a “fair share” of telecom infrastructure as their services make up more than half of internet traffic.
However, digital rights groups fear that if the big tech firms fund infrastructure, they will also strike deals with telecom firms to give their own traffic preferential treatment, undermining the principle of net neutrality.
In a reaction to the BEREC findings, telecom lobby group ETNO – the European Telecommunications Network Operators, which represents Deutsche Telekom, Orange Group, Telefonica and others – rejected the BEREC findings as outdated and said it would submit new evidence to the Commission to support its position.
BEREC’s findings said the internet had proved resilient to changing traffic patterns in the past and following ETNO’s proposals “could be of significant harm”.

323,"October 11, 2022",Are Businesses Shying Away from Non-Competes in Response to Increased Antitrust Scrutiny of Labor-Related Issues?,"

By Bruce McCulloch, Meredith Mommers, & Tyler Garrett1
 
I. Increased Antitrust Scrutiny of Labor-Related Issues
It is no secret that labor antitrust issues recently have received more attention from the federal antitrust agencies. Wage-fixing and no-poach enforcement actions made major headlines in 2020 and 2021 when, for the first time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) brought criminal charges in wage-fixing2 and no-poach cases3 and took those cases to trial. Non-competes have also ridden the swell of the renewed antitrust agency vigor and interest. For example, in October 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) approved a transaction on the condition that the acquirer was prohibited from entering into or enforcing employee non-competes.4 This trend of increasing scrutiny and enforcement bears greater examination, and an investigation into whether companies have begun adjusting their behavior to lessen antitrust risk.
 
II. Non-Competes Historically Have Not Attracted Significant Federal Antitrust Attention 
Non-compete agreements can arise either in the M&A or in the HR context, as both contexts can involve labor issues. M&A non-competes typically restrict the seller and its affiliates from competing with the buyer, or from soliciting employees of the buyer (commonly known as “non-solicits”), for a period of time after closing. These M&A non-competes are designed to protect the buyer’s substantial investment in the acquisition by preventing the seller from immediately re-entering the business and re-appropriating the goodwill, intellectual property, talent, and relationships that the buyer purchased. As a result, M&A non-competes are reviewed under the rule of reason, and unchallenged precedent and agency policy long have agreed that many M&A non-compete clauses are lawful.5 M&A non-competes are generally enforced if they meet a legitimate business need and are reasonably tailored in terms of product scope, geographic scope, and duration.6 While these are fact-intensive considerations, best practice is to limit the terms of the M&A non-compete to what is reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill and business of the acquired company.
Outside of M&A, non-competes typically take the form of an agreement between an employer and an employee whereby the employee agrees not to work in a similar profession or trade in competition against the employer for a certain period after leaving the company. Common purposes of these HR non-competes are to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information, to protect an employer’s valuable customer relationships, and to preserve the benefits of the costs of employee training.7 HR non-competes are likewise analyzed under the rule of reason8 but carry higher risk of unenforceability under applicable state law—particularly when applied to low-wage workers.9 Neither type of M&A nor HR non-compete has been prosecuted criminally at either the federal or state level.10
Prior to late 2016, labor-focused non-compete agreements and other labor-related antitrust issues did not attract much attention from federal antitrust enforcers. Instead, regulation was often left to the states.11 While most legislative and regulatory actions against HR non-competes continue to occur at the state level, political winds have favored federal pursuit of more aggressive and antitrust-focused policies towards labor-focused non-competes since 2016, when the Trump Administration’s FTC and DOJ issued their Antitrust Guidance for HR Professionals.12 This pursuit has only accelerated since the commencement of the Biden Administration.
  
III. Recent Federal Enforcement Actions & Policy Statements Suggest Labor-Focused Non-Competes Carry Greater Antitrust Risk 
The Biden Administration has repeatedly made it clear that it will scrutinize non-competes closely, in particular as they relate to labor. President Biden himself issued an executive order in 2021 that stressed the importance of using antitrust tools to augment workers’ abilities to switch jobs and negotiate higher salaries.13 The DOJ and FTC, under U.S. Assistant Attorney General (“AAG”) Jonathan Kanter and Chair Lina Khan, have moved in lockstep with this approach. For example, Chair Khan has stated that “the key question is not whether antitrust law and competition policy can or should protect workers as well as consumers, but instead precisely how they can or should do so,” and later answered this question by explaining that the FTC is both “scrutiniz[ing] mergers that may substantially lessen competition in labor markets” and “scrutinizing whether certain terms in employment contracts . . . may violate the law.”14 In addition, recent reports suggest that the FTC will consider a new rule in September 2022 that would prevent companies from implementing and enforcing any HR non-compete—which, if passed, would create a uniform national policy barring HR non-competes.15
AAG Kanter has weighed in as well, explaining that the DOJ’s new partnership with the Department of Labor (and the DOJ’s overall focus on potential labor antitrust violations) came about because “[p]rotecting competition in labor markets is fundamental to the ability of workers to earn just rewards for their work.”16 The Biden Administration’s focus on labor antitrust issues is consistent with the growing movement that does not view consumer welfare as the holy grail of antitrust but favors a more holistic approach—thus considering antitrust a tool to protect workers as well as consumers. As a result, the agencies have set their sights on labor-related non-competes in both the M&A and HR contexts.
On the M&A front, the FTC recently approved a transaction (DaVita-Total Renal Care) under the condition that DaVita was prohibited from entering into or enforcing non-solicit agreements and other employee restrictions.17 In addition, the FTC’s September 2021 study of unreported acquisitions by large technology companies highlighted the prevalence of non-compete clauses in merger agreements, in particular as they relate to founders and key employees of acquired entities,18 and Chair Khan noted that the FTC will increase scrutiny of the use of M&A non-competes in non-reportable transactions.19 And while the DOJ has not recently initiated an enforcement action, in October 2021 then-acting DOJ Antitrust AAG Richard Powers said that the Antitrust Division’s “focus on labor markets extends beyond its cartel program” to “using its civil authority to detect, investigate, and challenge anticompetitive non-compete agreements.”20
The use of HR non-competes, although not yet subject to any notable federal enforcement actions, remains an area of enforcement priority for both agencies. In December 2021, the DOJ and FTC hosted a joint workshop on antitrust in labor markets, where both Chair Khan and AAG Kanter spoke in favor of promoting greater competition in labor markets.21 The workshop’s keynote address came from Tim Wu, President Biden’s top antitrust advisor, in which he emphasized that “President Biden feels very strongly that it’s wrong . . . for any worker, particularly a low wage worker, not to have the freedom to change jobs, look for a better wage” and urged the DOJ and FTC to “take seriously labor markets and the effects of mergers [upon workers].”22 Just two months later, the DOJ filed a statement of interest arguing that the per se rule should be applied to condemn a collection of HR non-competes which prevented a group of anesthesiologists from competing with their employer, the exclusive provider of anesthesiology services to a local hospital.23
  
IV. Businesses Are Slowly Changing Their Standard Labor-Focused Non-Compete Practices
In light of this greater agency scrutiny of labor antitrust issues, we would expect some companies to have adapted to the increased risk profile associated with labor-focused non-competes and to take one of three approaches: (A) cease including non-solicits in their merger agreements, (B) more narrowly tailor the scope and duration of any labor-focused non-compete provisions to align with procompetitive justifications, or (C) refrain from enforcing existing any such provisions.
So, how have companies responded? The answer is that firm behavior in the M&A context has shifted slightly away from non-solicits over the 6 years since the DOJ and FTC first promulgated their Antitrust Guidance for HR Professionals in October 2016.24 We gathered data25 from 590 publicly available merger agreements announced on October 1, 2016, through June 30, 2022, where the transaction was a strategic acquisition of a U.S. target with a reported value of greater than the minimum size-of-transaction reportability threshold for the year the transaction was announced.26 The data show that both the percentage of transactions containing a non-solicit term,27 and any such term’s duration, have decreased since 2016.

Although we cannot draw conclusions from this data set about corporate implementation and enforcement of HR non-competes, there is some indication that dominoes are also beginning to fall on non-competes outside the M&A context. In a June 2022 blog post, Microsoft announced it would remove HR non-compete clauses from its U.S. employment agreements for all but its most senior staff and cease enforcing existing non-compete clauses.28 The announcement referenced “concerns that the noncompetition clauses in some U.S. employee agreements . . . feel at odds with our talent principles,”29 and thus the policy change could be as much a public-relations move as an antitrust risk mitigation strategy, but it is unlikely to be a coincidence that Microsoft’s change came amidst increasing federal and state attention on HR non-compete agreements (as well as mounting antitrust scrutiny of big tech generally).
 
V. Ongoing Antitrust Risk Assessment in Response to Today’s Enforcement Climate Is Essential
Labor antitrust issues, including non-compete agreements, are an enforcement priority for the Biden Administration, and we have seen increased scrutiny over recent years of non-competes in both the M&A and HR contexts. Businesses seem to have taken note, and prevalence of non-solicits in merger agreements is slowly decreasing. Companies will need to continually assess the antitrust risks of including a labor-focused non-compete provision in future M&A and employment agreements in the context of the current enforcement climate. And companies should be prepared to respond to agency concerns about how any non-compete provision is appropriately tailored to the legitimate business objective of the agreement housing the relevant provision.

9 There is considerable variation in treatment of HR non-competes among the states. For example, California bans HR non-compete clauses except in limited circumstances and 11 other states have banned HR non-competes for low-wage workers, whereas Texas and Florida impose few restrictions on the use of HR non-compete provisions and Alabama considers a restriction of two years or less to be presumptively reasonable.

A lobbying organization with apparent ties to former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s dark kitchen startup is preparing to go to war against food delivery apps, reported PYMNTS. 
The Digital Restaurant Association (DRA) was formed in March by executives at Tusk Holdings, a lobbying firm hired by Kalanick’s City Storage Systems (CSS) — the parent company of CloudKitchens, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (Oct. 5).
PYMNTS reported last month that CloudKitchens has the backing of Microsoft, which helped the company with an $850 million funding round last November, giving the company a $15 billion valuation.
The DRA’s goal is to help restaurants deal with regulatory fights surrounding dark kitchens, which purchase property to prepare food to be sold through delivery apps. A senior CSS executive, Guido Gabrielli, was listed on the DRA’s board but was removed following inquiries by FT into the group’s background and leadership, according to the report.
The DRA’s goal is to “fight to ensure restaurants have access” to customer information, something delivery apps have chafed at, pointing to privacy concerns, the report stated. The association also said it will lobby for permanent caps on delivery fees charged by third-party apps, something cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco have already passed.
A senior Tusk executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told FT they disputed the notion that there are ties between the DRA and Kalanick’s CSS, saying the lobby group is currently “fully operated and funded” by Tusk Holdings.

325,"September 21, 2022",Patent Law Considerations For Drug Discovery Innovations Utilizing Artificial Intelligence,"
Taking a drug to market is a complex process that involves prediction of one or more combinations of molecules that can be transformed into a drug, and performance of experiments on each molecular combination to test for efficacy, stability, safety, and other metrics.  This road of trial-and-error experimenting with different molecular combinations can take many years, and cost billions of dollars.  Artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools can substantially reduce the time of trial-and-error experimenting with molecules by trimming the molecules that are not ideal based on historical data.  This quickens the process and reduces the investment for finding effective, stable, and safe molecular combinations that can be developed into a drug.  This article elaborates on the confluence of drug discovery and AI, some industry partnerships between pharmaceutical and AI companies, implications of pharma-AI confluence for patent law, and various recommendations for protecting technological aspects of the pharma-AI confluence.

By Carl Kukkonen, Patricia Campbell & Gurneet Singh[1]
  
I. DRUG DISCOVERY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
In the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, taking a drug to market is a tedious process. For example, to create a drug, scientists first predict one or more combinations of molecules that can be transformed into a drug. Next, scientists perform experiments on each molecular combination to test for efficacy, stabi...

By:  Merisa Heu-Weller (Microsoft On The Issues)
In the United States, some communities have very different experiences in their interactions with the justice system. There are policies, programs and practices within the criminal legal system that exacerbate racial inequities and disproportionately impact Black and African American communities.
At Microsoft, through our Justice Reform Initiative, we provide support to organizations using data and technology to develop alternatives to incarceration, accelerate the adoption of new models of public safety and expand access to data driven insights.
Today, Microsoft is partnering with the Prosecutorial Performance Indicators (PPI), a national effort led by researchers at Loyola University of Chicago and Florida International University, to expand access to data-driven insights via new, publicly available data dashboards created in partnership with Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab at the University of Denver and Colorado district attorneys’ offices. In the spirit of promoting transparency, prosecutors worked together with researchers, and with input from their communities, to create the data dashboards that will enable community members to gain a better understanding of the work going on in their local office, including trends in cases filed and resolved over time, identify patterns in how individuals are treated and evaluate how they are addressing serious crime and protecting and serving victims.
Prosecutors hold significant decision-making power, and the public wants to know what their local prosecutors are doing, especially given the increasing scrutiny on prosecutors and ongoing concerns that disparities in charges and sentencing recommendations are often correlated to race, ethnicity or wealth. However, most district attorneys’ offices are not able to aggregate, review, interpret or share data publicly…

327,"September 13, 2022",Smaller Indie Tech Backs Measures To Rein In Big Tech,"


More than a dozen tech companies whose products offer alternatives to those produced by technology giants have come out in favor of federal regulation that would rein in the largest companies.
DuckDuckGo, which offers a privacy-focused search engine that competes with Google, and Mozilla, the longtime purveyor of a browser that competes with Microsoft’s, both stated their support for the proposed legislation in a letter to members of the U.S. House and Senate.
Proton, a Switzerland-based email service that encrypts communication, also added its support alongside firms like Tutanota and Efani Secure Mobile, according to a Tuesday (Sept. 13) Reuters report.
The letter states, in part: “Massive tech platforms can exert influence over society and the digital economy because they ultimately have the power to collect, analyze, and monetize exorbitant amounts of personal information.
“This is not by accident, as some of the tech giants have intentionally abused their gatekeeper positions to lock users into perpetual surveillance while simultaneously making it difficult to switch to privacy-protective alternatives.”
Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are the lead sponsors of the “American Innovation and Choice Online Act,” which would rein in companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and Meta. According to Reuters, the likelihood the bill will become law in 2022 is declining.
“While more and more Americans are embracing privacy-first technologies, some dominant firms still use their gatekeeper power to limit competition and restrict user choice,” the alternative tech firms wrote in their letter. “We implore you to pass AICOA as it would remove barriers for consumers to freely select privacy protective services.”
Klobuchar said last week that significant opposition from Big Tech companies that don’t want new regulations may prevent the bill from becoming law.

In this edition of CPI Talks, we have the pleasure of presenting an interview with Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.




Is there a new drive to redefine antitrust rules for the contemporary digital economy? What in your view should the thrust of these rules be? Do you foresee further legislative reform in the U.S., along the lines of developments in Europe and elsewhere?



A central problem, as I have explained previously (including in this congressional testimony),[1] is that the courts have put too much emphasis on the risks of over-enforcement, while neglecting the risks of under-enforcement. Because the courts have undermined effective antitrust enforcement, with cases like Amex and Qualcomm elevating theoretical justifications for business conduct over rigorous empirical analysis, both legislators and enforcers need to respond. With respect to the digital economy, there are unique challenges when dominant Internet platforms acquire substantial market power and maintain it through anticompetitive means. In addition to enforcement actions, I also believe that legislative action is justified to oversee the conduct of such platforms and to require non-discriminatory access arrangements, as I explain in this letter to Congress.[2]
 



Technological innovation appears to be accelerating, particularly in certain spaces such as mobile, search, and social media. How can enforcers keep pace? Last year you launched (another) high-profile antitrust suit against Go...

Competition and monopoly power in technology platforms have become global issues in the past decade. In many cases, challenges to those platforms have struggled to adapt the antitrust laws to new technological and economic realities. Two main solutions have arisen: writing new laws and re-invigorating existing ones. First, new legislation provides laws that specifically address issues arising in technology platforms. Second, existing law, such as California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”), provide effective ways to curb anticompetitive and unfair practices. This article gives an overview of proposed and enacted new legislation, and then discusses the UCL, its application in the Epic v. Apple decision, and its broad power to promote competition.

Monopolization of technology platforms by their owners has become a globally-recognized issue over the last decade. In many cases, enforcement actions have proven difficult, as most existing antitrust laws were written long before digital marketplaces arrived.
Two solutions have arisen: passing new legislation on the one hand, and re-invigorating existing laws on the other. On the legislative front, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and abroad have been trying to pass new laws that can further ensure competition on modern technology platforms.

Section 16 of the Clayton Act authorizes “injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage” due to an antitrust violation “under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct . . . is granted by courts of equity [.]” While State enforcers and other plaintiffs have long turned to this provision for non-monetary relief to redress anticompetitive conduct, the Supreme Court’s initially expansive construction of Section 16 and other federal laws has narrowed in recent decisions. Facing this potential retrenchment in federal remedies, antitrust enforcers should consider the laws of many individual States, which offer alternative, additional remedies beyond traditional injunctions and damages. This paper summarizes Supreme Court developments and explores State-law remedies, some grounded in equity practice and others expressly included in State antitrust and consumer protection laws. The paper also presents a sampling of decisions from jurisdictions throughout the country recognizing the authority of State Attorneys General or other government officials to secure equitable relief extending to both residents and non-residents of the State.

In this article, we examine the impact of last year’s Supreme Court decision in NCAA v. Alston. Not only did the Court confirm that the NCAA’s cap on education-related compensation was anticompetitive, but they also questioned the ability of the rest of the compensation scheme to pass antitrust muster. This decision sparked further changes to the NCAA’s name, image, and likeness rules for college athletes, provoked new legislative proposals, and inspired more legal challenges. Even professional baseball’s notorious antitrust exemption has not been immune from the renewed scrutiny about how sports should be organized. It has been more than a year since the Alston decision, and there will likely be many more changes before these questions are resolved. However, one thing is clear – the next big play for the future of sports will be under review by antitrust officials.

Apple spent a record $4.6 million on federal lobbying during the first six months of 2022 as the technology company faced growing pressure from Congress and federal investigators over its alleged monopolistic behavior, an OpenSecrets analysis of federal lobbying disclosures found. 
The record lobbying spending puts Apple on pace to exceed the $6.5 million paid during all of 2021. The company spent nearly $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2022 – the most it has ever spent – and dropped $1.9 million during the second quarter.
But after years-long investigations by the Department of Justice, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission into alleged anticompetitive behavior by Apple and other Silicon Valley tech giants including Amazon, Google and Meta, POLITICO reported last week that lawyers at the DOJ are drafting an antitrust complaint against Apple.
Apple’s troubles have not been limited to the US. The company found itself in the European Commission’s crosshairs after Spotify complained that Apple unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.
 Likewise, Apple and a number of other large digital firms have been criticized and scrutinized recently in Asia, with their representatives being invited to India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for hearings on alleged anti-competitive practices of big tech firms.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the greatest engine for economic growth in the recent history, digital platforms have transformed people’s ways of lives, and brought convenience as a standard. With innovated ways of doing businesses, platforms with the help of technology advances are now able to substantially bring down, if not to eliminate, transaction costs, by bypassing middleman and expanding business reach nation-wide or even world-wide. Consumers are now able to enjoy a wider range of products with reduced prices. More jobs are created as platforms increase opportunities and ways of doing businesses. Competitors in the traditional non-digital world certainly have different thoughts, however, as innovations and the fast expansion of their digital counterparts are threatening the very existence of their livelihood. Users, in particular business ones, are highly dependent upon those platforms, and hence have concerns over the influence exerted by platforms on their businesses.

Judd Smith, a senior Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee who was instrumental in drafting legislation to rein in tech giants, is leaving to take a job as a lobbyist for Amazon Web Services, according to two people briefed on the matter.
Smith’s move is particularly notable because the legislation he was working on — the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — is losing steam. Its sponsors are pushing for a floor vote, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has so far resisted their pleas.
The bill would ban Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta from favoring their own services in an anticompetitive way, similar to a House bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a marathon markup last summer.

Smith was one of the main Republican staffers working to draft the bipartisan legislation led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to curtail the power of Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.
The legislation — the most serious attempt at tightening oversight of the tech industry in years — would bar those companies from prioritizing their products over their competitors who rely on those companies to reach customers. Amazon, for example, would be barred from promoting its own private-label products over rival items on its e-commerce platform.

By: Brian Albrecht (Inside Sources)
With the clock ticking down on Congress’ legislative calendar before the midterm election season begins, sponsors of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) are left with a problem. As leadership seeks to wrangle the needed 60 votes in the Senate, even the measure’s putative backers appear confused about precisely what it would, or would not, do.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says he supports the legislation because it will limit Big Tech’s ability to censor, or deplatform, Republican-friendly users. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has expressed reservations about the bill for precisely the same reason. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the bill’s primary sponsor, insists that it will do no such thing. But she’s also been reluctant to add explicit language that would either affirm Cruz’s interpretation or assuage Wyden’s fears.
Vague and equivocal language can sometimes make for good politics, although it remains unclear whether that is the case here. It is clear that legislation with such fundamental uncertainties will make it harder for companies to operate and innovate, making their services worse for consumers.
The bill would make it illegal for large technology firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook to “self-preference.” Self-preferencing is when a company gives some kind of advantage to one of its own products. When you search “nearby restaurants” on Google and see a Google Maps box at the top, that is self-preferencing. Under AICOA, this behavior would likely be illegal and subject Google to massive fines of 10 percent of its U.S. revenues.
I say likely because no one knows what will be illegal if the bill becomes law. As the American Bar Association’s Antitrust Law Section put it in a recent letter to Congress, the bill’s prohibitions “are vague and fact-specific, preventing advance prediction of what conduct is protected and what conduct is prohibited.” The uncertainty here runs deeper than usual, so supporters can have different readings of what it would do, specifically around content moderation…

Instead, the leading tech companies design their sprawling ecosystems to extract value (often at the expense of individuals and business users), while crushing entrepreneurs that pose a threat. As a result, we get less disruptive innovation that actually benefits us and more innovations that surpass the dreams of yesteryears’ autocracies.

In most digital platforms recommender systems provide consumers with recommendations across a variety of contexts. While recommender systems generate efficiencies by lowering the cost and improving the quality of product discovery, their impact on individuals’ purchase and consumption has the potential of affecting downstream competition of products and industries. These systems may also present sensitive issues for national security, democracy, and public health. Recommender systems have therefore come under increasing scrutiny from governments around the world in recent years. The scale of efficiencies and benefits offered by recommender systems motivates their continued use and expansion in the future. In this paper we explore approaches that merge innovation and regulation as part of technological advancement. We offer an approach built on increased transparency on the side of companies regarding both their data and algorithms, as well as through collaborations between digital platforms, academics, and regulators. By taking responsibility for regulating their recommender systems in the short-term, companies will be well-positioned to reap long-term benefits and to serve as leaders in the ecosystem. Improved regulation and monitoring by external bodies will also help cultivate the market.

The formation of consumer expectations for digital products affects competition between digital platforms that offer competing products. Unfair competition may occur if the competitive outcome is influenced my misled expectations, notably if the company that wins the competition either misled consumers or did not affirmatively correct consumer expectations that were incorrect. The ability to exploit customers whose expectations have been misled is particularly strong for networks that have tipped, as outside alternatives for dissatisfied consumers may no longer be realistic or viable alternatives for consumers. Unilateral deviations by a company’s product away from the future product expectations that have been created around their products may be unfair and create anti-competitive outcomes in growing digital markets.

Inaccurate expectations lead them to choose based on an incorrect view of the future features of the product.

Sony Interactive Entertainment Corp. has hired a new top antitrust and public policy lawyer in Gregory McCurdy, who held a similar position at Uber Technologies.
McCurdy, Sony’s new senior director for competition and regulatory affairs, arrives as the company’s gaming subsidiary recently made a key acquisition and scuttled an antitrust class action. He left Uber last month, shortly before the ridesharing giant’s former top European lobbyist leaked a trove of company documents.
A Sony spokesperson confirmed McCurdy’s hire, which he announced in a recent message posted to his LinkedIn profile.
“The world of video games is fascinating and will be a great new adventure for me,” McCurdy said via LinkedIn. He spent more than 15 years as a senior litigation and policy lawyer for Microsoft Corp. prior to joining Uber in 2015. “I know it a bit from my Microsoft days when Xbox launched to compete with PlayStation,” McCurdy said.
His senior director role at Sony is a new one, per an online posting for the job. The posting said the person filling the role would would become a “senior level member” of the PlayStation video game console maker’s global legal leadership and “primary competition and regulatory counsel” for the company’s business worldwide.
McCurdy didn’t respond to a request for comment. Nor did Stephanie Burns, who joined Sony last year as legal chief for its San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming unit.
That business includes PlayStation and the video game company Bungie Inc., whose $3.6 billion sale to Sony closed earlier this month. Sony reportedly has plans to turnBungie into a subscription service for video games.
Sony and its lawyers from Shearman & Sterling also scored a win this week by convincing a federal judge in California to dismiss a putative class action accusing its PlayStation store of anti-competitive practices. McCurdy, a former co-chair of the American Bar Association’s antitrust committee, is well-versed on such issues.
At Uber, he led a team handling US antitrust litigation and merger clearance proceedings. McCurdy was also previously Microsoft’s first antitrust litigator in Europe, where he spent eight years managing antitrust proceedings before the European Commission in Brussels and appeals to courts in Luxembourg.

Amazon, in its attempt to ward off two European Union antitrust investigations as part of a sustained increase in scrutiny of the internet behemoth by major jurisdictions, has promised to take actions that will lead to treating third-party merchants on its website fairly, the bloc’s competition watchdog said Thursday.
The US-based online retail giant offered to make a number of commitments to ease competition concerns, and the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, said it will now seek feedback on them from “interested parties.”
The commission launched an investigation four years ago over concerns Amazon breached EU competition rules by using data from merchants selling products on its platform to gain an unfair advantage over them.
It also opened a separate investigation into whether Amazon favors its own retail business and merchants that use its logistics and delivery system over other sellers.
Related: German Watchdog Subjects Amazon To Stricter Rules
The investigations are part of the bloc’s wider efforts to curb the power of big technology companies. Amazon also is facing similar scrutiny in the US.
Amazon said that while it disagreed with several of the conclusions, it has “engaged constructively with the commission to address their concerns and preserve our ability to serve European customers and the more than 185,000 European small- and medium-sized businesses selling through our stores.”
The company also said it has “serious concerns” about new EU digital regulations, known as the Digital Markets Act, that it said are “unfairly targeting Amazon and a few other US companies.” The act, part of the EU’s overhaul of its digital rulebook, aims to prevent tech giants from becoming dominant by making them treat smaller rivals fairly under threat of hefty fines.
Under the commission’s investigation, Amazon had faced a possible fine of up to 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue, which could have amounted to billions of dollars.

It is common to characterize patents as monopolies.  This assumption, which underlies the standard dichotomy between intellectual property and antitrust law, is challenged by evidence that large companies in technology markets (outside biopharmaceuticals) tend to advocate for weaker patent protection or, in some cases, no patent protection at all.  This revealed preference for weaker patent protection reflects the fact that large integrated firms can often capture returns on innovation through economies of scale and scope and other non-patent-dependent capacities that few other firms can match.  Relatedly, a weak-patent environment can confer a competitive advantage on integrated firms against smaller and more innovative firms that rely on patents to capture value on innovation through licensing and other contract-based monetization strategies.

There is widespread support for antitrust reform, fueled mainly by concerns about major platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Many believe that these companies have become too large and that they use their power in harmful ways. In the United States, some of the most aggressive reforms have recently been codified into two proposed bills, which focus largely on “self-preferencing” by online platforms and various restrictions imposed by mobile operating systems. This short article evaluates the proposed Big Tech reforms based on everything we’ve learned from antitrust’s successes and failures over the last fifty years. In some situations, the reforms could help to curb anticompetitive unilateral conduct that is extremely difficult to challenge under current law. Overall, however, the proposals are an ill-conceived, knee-jerk reaction to a set of complex issues requiring a more careful response. They do a very poor job of limiting antitrust scrutiny to cases that plausibly involve anticompetitive behavior. The self-preferencing proposals in particular offer no secure way to avoid scrutiny other than to stop introducing new products. For these and other reasons, these proposed reforms would have significant adverse effects on competition and innovation — the two things they are supposed to protect.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the digital economy has matured, “Big Data”— extremely large datasets that require sophisticated tools to analyze[2] — has enabled extraordinary innovation, creating a number of benefits, including free products and greater efficiencies. Precisely because Big Data is such a powerful tool, though, scholars, governments, and litigants have called attention to what they view as its potential to harm both competition and consumers.[3]
The debate over the effect of Big Data on competition is occurring amidst renewed interest in Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which governs single-firm monopolistic conduct. States, regulators, and private plaintiffs have brought numerous ...

The willingness of national courts to set global FRAND royalty rates for patents that are essential to key industry standards has led to international jurisdictional conflicts, competing anti-suit injunctions and a global race to the courthouse. This essay supports the adoption of legislation that repudiates global FRAND rates set unilaterally by courts in other countries and instead mandates the adjudication of FRAND royalty rates for national patents through a multi-party proceeding. It is hoped that such a system will eventually lead to a consolidated, international mechanism for global FRAND rate determination.

By Jorge L. Contreras[1]
 
Courts have increasingly been asked to adjudicate disputes over the level of fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (“FRAND”) royalty rates that holders of standards-essential patents (“SEPs”) are permitted to charge manufacturers of standardized products. Courts making these determinations may assess FRAND rates only as to SEPs issued in their own countries (the “national FRAND approach”) or as to all SEPs worldwide that would be included in a license had it been negotiated by the parties (the “global FRAND approach”). These competing approaches are discussed below, along with some of the international jurisdictional issues that they have raised and potential legislative solutions that could address these issues.

Without resorting to an overly simplistic statement, it remains difficult to evade the perception that the digital economy is prone to leveraging conducts directed at extending dominance between services. Navigating the internet with Google will often yield Google services at preferential placements. Similarly, Amazon might artificially favor its own retail products on Amazon Marketplace, while Meta (formerly known as Facebook) appears to be using data collected on its social networks to outcompete competitors on Facebook Marketplace. Naturally, tech companies deny bias and self-favoring, referring to misunderstandings, the evolution of the internet, or other plausible explanations. Yet, the anti-competitive effects of leveraging conducts have formed the core of recent EU antitrust investigations, such as Google Shopping and Google Android as well as vintage cases as Microsoft I. In particular, the matter of self-favoring discussed in the Google Shopping case has crystallized the concept of leveraging infringement, where a super dominant position is extended to an adjacent activity or market. Similar allegations are at the center of pending EU antitrust investigations into Facebook or Amazon.

The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is launching dual investigations into Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of videogame maker Activision Blizzard, and Amazon’s competitive practices related to its Marketplace platform.
In January 2022, Microsoft announced it was planning to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, making it potentially Microsoft’s biggest-ever acquisition at $26 billion more than the company paid for LinkedIn in 2016.
On July 6, 2022, the CMA started inviting views on the deal, with a submission deadline of July 20. The CMA has provisionally set itself a deadline of September 1, when it will either approve the deal or instigate a more in-depth phase two review.
Earlier this month, Linda Khan, chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), also confirmed that the agency was “examining effects on competition in all relevant markets for potential law enforcement action.”

By PYMNTS
Since December 2020, when the European Commission revealed its proposal for a Digital Markets Act (DMA), Big Tech companies knew that this legislation could significantly affect the way they operate their platforms.
Despite intense lobbying efforts to water down the legislation, the proposed bill remains essentially the same, and the few changes added during the negotiations among the European institutions didn’t alter its scope.
This week, according to the Financial Times, the European Union could unveil its final text. One last-minute amendment to the law may increase the threshold for a company to be considered “gatekeeper” to 75-billion-euro market capitalization, which would still include Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alibaba and Booking.com just to name a few.

352,"June 30, 2022",Identifying Barriers to Entry: A South African Perspective,"

By Willem H. Boshoff1
 
Abstract:
Barriers to entry are now a core concern of South African competition policy. Conventionally, entry barriers represent one factor relevant to assessing the sustainability and effects of market power and its abuse. South African competition policy now looks beyond conventional concerns, focusing on barriers to the participation and expansion of small firms and – especially – firms owned by historically disadvantaged individuals (“HDIs”) in South Africa. Such a broader policy focus requires identifying industries and markets where such barriers are high. This piece considers some of the associated analytical challenges.
 
I. Evolving Policy Thinking
A broader view of entry barriers has gained traction in South African competition policy over the past twenty years. Following the global financial crisis, policymakers in South Africa grew increasingly concerned about the causes of relatively low levels of economic growth. These concerns grew markedly from around 2016, fueled by two international antitrust developments. One key trend was the academic, and later policy, debate in the US about rising concentration levels and their claimed impact on the dynamism of the American economy. A second, and related trend, involves the debate around the social impact of big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and the like) and the ability of newcomers to challenge these companies in their respective digital markets.
Reflecting these international developments, the result was that many South African industries and markets are characterized by low levels of new entry and, especially, entry by firms owned by HDIs. This evolving stance of the South African competition authorities on entry barriers is reflected both in wide-ranging amendments to the Competition Act, and in policy practice over the past few years. Indeed, “deconcentrating” the economy and advancing the position of small firms and firms owned by HDIs are now prominent policy goals of South African competition policy.
This piece argues that a broader view of barriers to entry further strengthens the need for context-specific economic analysis. While policy slogans, such as deconcentration, may be broad and cross-cutting, addressing barriers to entry requires industry- and market-specific evaluation. Furthermore, form-based approaches to identifying entry barriers – for example, in the digital sphere, by identifying whether incumbents are platforms – are likely to be of limited use. Ultimately, an economic assessment of the products or services being sold and the rivals and consumers involved is required – a task that requires considerable information to be collected by competition authorities.
 
II. Entry Barriers and Concentration
One consequence of the South African focus on broader barriers to entry and participation in markets is that concentration has acquired a broader meaning among policymakers. Policymakers now consider broader sectoral patterns to identify industries characterized by a lack of dynamism and entry or by limited participation by firms owned by HDIs. While a more expansive view of concentration certainly reflects policy priorities, it also creates challenges for certainty and dialogue. Using concentration to refer to market structure, industry structure. and ownership structure (sometimes interchangeably) creates significant challenges for conceptual clarity.
Analytical accuracy requires distinguishing between three types of concentration measure:
The first, and more traditional, measure of concentration relates to market concentration. Market Concentration measures are based on revenue or volume shares enjoyed by the various firms operating in a relevant market. Competition policy in South Africa and internationally treats a market as a carefully defined collection of products that are substitutable to buyers2. Market concentration measures, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, measure the distribution of market shares: the greater the market shares of the larger firms, the higher the calculated concentration in the particular market.
A second measure, quite distinct from the first, relates to industry or sector concentration. Any one industry may consist of several and indeed hundreds to thousands of different markets. The South African competition authorities have recently published a concentration tracker report, which seeks to measure concentration in the South African economy at large3. This report relies on industry measures to calculate concentration.
The South African competition authorities acknowledge that their concentration measures are not market based, but it nevertheless infers market power on the basis of these industry measures. In some industries, relatively similar players may be active across most of their constituent markets, so industry-level concentration could be an indicator of market power across markets in a particular industry. In others, aggregating the individual markets to an industry level can greatly mask what may be sharp differences in the structure of individual markets and the level of dynamism and entry. It is therefore critical to differentiate industry concentration from market concentration and to be clear about the specific conditions under which these two concepts may be aligned.
A third measure relates to ownership concentration. In keeping with their broader policy goals, the South African Competition Commission argues for a link between market concentration and ownership spread, by which it means the distribution of corporate ownership among a larger number of owners4. The promotion of a greater spread of ownership is a goal of South African competition law, but it is critical not to conflate the concept of ownership concentration with that of market concentration. Large incumbents, facing limited threat of entry, may well be owned by a variety of owners.
Clarity about how ownership concentration is measured is also important to the policy goal of promoting entry by firms owned by HDIs. Higher levels of HDI ownership need not translate into a broader ownership distribution measured in terms of the size of shareholders. Nor does it have any necessary link to entry. These conceptual ambiguities are worsened when referring to industry concentration to make claims about ownership concentration.
Identifying barriers to entry – by reference to outcomes measured by concentration – requires conceptual rigor. Indeed, conceptual clarity is critical not only to competition law proceedings, but also in helping guide policymakers to focus information-collection efforts, including those during market inquiries, which are now a common policy tool in South Africa.
 
III. Entry Barriers in the Digital Sphere
The focus of South African competition policy on entry barriers of various forms is particularly evident in the approach taken toward issues in the digital sphere. Here, policy concerns again reflect those of the US, UK, Europe, and elsewhere. One of the main challenges is how to tailor digital competition policy to the broader entry barrier issues relevant to South Africa.
Digital platforms and their offerings tend to develop more slowly or, at least, differently in developing countries. Many South African markets based on digital products or services may not yet be at a consolidation stage. Also, South Africa has seen the emergence of several successful local platforms, which have developed into large players in their respective markets. This is contrary to the dominance of well-known US platforms in other jurisdictions.
One implication is that it is particularly important to understand competition in these markets from an economics perspective. A principal challenge is to avoid a form-based approach, which would merely categorize particular businesses as digital platforms and make automatic inferences about the viability of entry and expansion in markets in which these platforms operate5. Generalizations about barriers to entry, including an overemphasis on market tipping due to network effects (which theoretically favor incumbents and limit entry), may not necessarily align with the empirical reality.
A proper definition of the relevant market as well as an empirical evaluation of the type and dynamic nature of network effects in the market remains critical to assessing possibilities for entry6. Indeed, market tipping and the possibilities for new entry and expansion can vary greatly by geographic region or product market7. This suggests that wide-ranging inquiries, including the on-going market inquiry into online intermediation platforms in South Africa, face considerable obstacles.
Understanding the relevant network effects and their implications for entry requires detailed analysis, including of market outcomes at a fairly disaggregated level. Such a requirement suggests that a market inquiry that seeks to ultimately impose remedies on a broad class of business organizations (for example, online intermediation platforms) must tread carefully. The arguments presented here suggest that a more modest, yet critical, aim of market inquiries must be the establishment and maintenance of relevant databases concerning how large platforms, and their rivals (not limited to platforms), operate and perform over time.
 
IV. Conclusion
Competition policy seeking to foster entry – including entry by designated groups such as firms owned by HDIs in South Africa – raises key analytical challenges. Indeed, an analysis of entry barriers requires both clarity of concepts – such as different types of concentration – and an assessment of competition based on empirical evidence. It is critical, both to legal certainty and to policy dialogue, that a competition policy concerned with addressing entry barriers remain grounded in context-specific economic analysis.

How is platform competition different from regular competition? The first part of this article reviews recent findings from theoretical platform economics. It describes two novel ways in which more competition among platforms has been found to be potentially harmful. It then discusses results on two potential antidotes: multi-homing and interoperability. The second part of the article raises two issues facing the governance of platform industries and argues that they deserve further attention. The first is a distinction between standard network effects and “spillovers,” and the second is on the challenges of regulating firms that are, by their nature, outliers.

I. INTRODUCTION
In textbook economics, a standard lesson is that monopoly is inefficient and adding competitors improves the situation by lowering prices and providing consumers with more choices. In industries with network effects, which are a key feature of platform intermediaries, it has long been recognized that it is not so obvious whether competition has such a positive effect. After all, unlike the fictional world of “perfect competition,” in which the presence of many suppliers leads to zero markups and maximization of total surplus, when network effects are present, there are obvious benefits to market concentration. For example, when hailing a ride using your smartphone, you would probably prefer having all potential drivers in your area appear on a single app (e.g....

Breaking up American “Big Tech” companies has in recent years been a topic of much discussion by policymakers and legislators across the political spectrum. Arguments for and against breakup offer various justifications and considerations, but less-discussed potential national security risks lurk within the larger debate — including that breaking up Big Tech could leave American intellectual property, data, technology, and know-how up for grabs by strategic competitors. The interagency U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) was created to protect against this kind of national security risk, but it has its limitations, particularly in terms of resourcing and the inherent opacity of venture capital and private investment.  Given these limitations, policymakers who pursue the path of a Big Tech breakup should be aware of this risk and be prepared to address it; CFIUS and other national security authorities will need to be appropriately resourced and staffed.

356,"June 19, 2022",Why I Think Congress Should Not Enact the American Innovation and Choice Online Act,"

By A. Douglas Melamed1
 
I thought antitrust law was working pretty well when I was in the Justice Department during the Clinton Administration.  Both the Department and the Federal Trade Commission won significant merger and nonmerger cases, including of course the monopolization case against Microsoft, that established important precedents and moved the law in a more aggressive direction.
In the years since then, I have come to believe that antitrust law has become too conservative and needs to be recalibrated to be more aggressive.  It needs to do a better job taking account of modern economic learning and to be concerned about false negatives, as well as false positives.  I have written a number of articles explaining that view,2 and I have testified to that effect before Congress.3  I have also suggested that special competition rules might be appropriate for the largest tech platforms.4
Nevertheless, I believe that Congress should not enact the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) in its present form.  I summarize below what I see as the three most problematic aspects of the bill.
 
I. What Does “Harm to Competition” Mean?
There has been a consensus for several decades that antitrust law is about preventing harm to competition in order to enhance economic welfare.  Preventing harm to competition does not mean protecting individual firms from the rough and tumble of marketplace competition as competing firms try to best their rivals by providing better products and services.  It means prohibiting anticompetitive conduct that creates or maintains market power.  By preventing increased market power as a result of anticompetitive conduct, antitrust law increases output, which benefits workers and results in lower prices that benefit consumers, especially those least able to pay higher prices.
AICOA pays at least lip service to the importance of harm to competition.  Sections 3(a)(1)-(3) of the bill prohibit self-preferencing and discrimination by the platforms, which can be harmful in some circumstances.  The prohibitions imposed by those Sections apply only where plaintiff shows that the conduct “would materially harm competition.”  The covered platforms can avoid violating the other prohibitions of the bill (Sections 3(a)(4)-(10)) if they can show that the conduct at issue “has not resulted in and would not result in material harm to competition” (Section 3(b)(2)).
That language might mean that there can be no violation of the bill unless there is the kind of harm to competition with which the antitrust laws have long been concerned, but that is far from clear.  In the first place, the statutory language is patently ambiguous because “would” is conditional and the bill says nothing about the contemplated conditions.  More important, while the language suggests an antitrust-type concern about competition, the bill does not include the normal antitrust language (e.g., “competition in the market as a whole,” “market power”) that gives meaning to the idea of harm to competition, nor does it say that the imprecise language it does use is to be construed as that language is construed by the antitrust laws.
Plaintiffs will no doubt argue, and courts might agree, that Congress did not intend to incorporate existing antitrust concepts and that “harm to competition” means any reduction in competition by, for example, causing a weak and insignificant rival to exit from an intensely competitive market.  Plaintiffs will argue that Congress could have specified that the bill incorporates the antitrust notion of injury to competition but that Congress chose not to do that, and they will emphasize that the whole point of the bill was to supplement the antitrust laws with stronger prohibitions.
The bill could be very harmful if it is construed to require, not increased market power, but simply harm to rivals.  The U.S. has in the past tried laws that insulate weak firms from competition provided by more efficient firms.  The results have been increased costs, reduced output, and harm to consumers and suppliers.
 
II. The Bill Would Prohibit Welfare-Enhancing Conduct, Even if the “Harm to Competition” Language Were Construed to Mean Increased Market Power
The antitrust laws do not punish firms that succeed by welfare-enhancing competition on the merits, even if they gain market power by doing so.  Those laws prohibit only anticompetitive conduct.  AICOA, by contrast, would prohibit conduct that is not anticompetitive.  The bill could, therefore, reduce economic welfare, even if the “harm to competition” language is construed to mean increased market power.
For example, Section 3(a)(6) prohibits the covered platforms from using “nonpublic data that are obtained from or generated on the covered platform by the activities of a business . . .  to offer, or support the offering of, the products or services of the covered platform operator that compete or would compete with products or services offered by business users on the covered platform.”  In other words, the bill would prohibit Amazon from using Company A’s data to build better products or services that compete with Company B; and it would bar Google from using data about Company C to improve the targeting and value of ads sold in competition with Company D.  Notably, it would prohibit the use of such data even if Companies A and C in the examples above agreed to sell the data to the platform, without being coerced by threats or otherwise, simply because they expected to benefit from the sale.  In these examples, everybody is harmed except maybe Companies B and D.
The bill does provide some affirmative defenses to otherwise prohibited conduct, but those defenses are narrow and do not encompass all welfare-enhancing benefits. For example, Section 3(a)(8) restricts uninstalling software and changing default settings. The conduct prohibited by that section can be justified only if shown to be necessary for the “functioning of the platform” or to prevent transfer of data to China or a “foreign adversary;” that conduct evidently cannot be justified even if it is necessary to develop new, complementary products.  The other conduct prohibited by the bill is justifiable if it is necessary to “maintain or substantially enhance the core functionality of the platform” (Section 3(b)(1)(C)), but not if it substantially enhances other features of the platform or other products or services.  And does “core functionality” mean core functionality today, so that the platform cannot evolve by adding or changing core functionality?  The narrowness of the justifications ensures that the bill, if enacted, will deter and likely prohibit a wide range of efficient and welfare-enhancing conduct.
Sections (3)(a)(1)-(3) could undermine economic welfare for an additional reason.  Those sections would prohibit the covered platforms from preferencing their own products, but the broad language of the bill glosses over important ambiguities. Do the prohibitions on self-preferencing mean that the platforms cannot enable their products and services to take advantage of their joint scale and scope economies?  Do they mean that the platforms cannot preinstall their new products and services, even if users want them preinstalled?  Do they mean that the platforms have to preinstall all alternatives in addition to their own preinstalled products and services, even if doing so makes the platform more cumbersome or the products and services less accessible and less valuable to users?
Economists have long understood that innovation is far more important for economic welfare than static efficiency.5  Yet AIOCA is likely to impair innovation by the platforms.  As noted above, the bill would not permit conduct to be justified even if it is necessary to enable development of valuable new products and services, and it might inhibit or prevent the evolution and improvement of the platforms themselves.  In addition, Section 3(a)(4) prohibits the covered platforms from, among other things, unreasonably delaying third party access to platform features that are available to the platform’s own products, except where necessary to prevent cybersecurity risk.  Does that mean that a platform cannot introduce its own complementary products or features (e.g., voice recognition, mapping and GPS, camera, etc.) until it has enabled all other providers of similar or competing products or features to access the platform?  One might think that others who are later in line for the technical reviews and assistance necessary for that access can reasonably be expected to obtain access later; but does Section 3(a)(4) mean that the platform cannot disclose to one of its own complementary product units technical specifications relevant to that access until it is ready to disclose them to everyone, and that it cannot even disclose competitively sensitive, tentative specifications to its own unit in order to draw upon the latter’s expertise in optimizing the platform’s suitability for the complementary product or service?
AIOCA will prohibit welfare-enhancing conduct by the covered platforms.  It will also prohibit anticompetitive conduct by the platforms, although the benefits of that are unclear because at least some, maybe most, of the anticompetitive conduct that the bill would prohibit violates existing antitrust laws.  Supporters of the bill say that it will promote innovation by making it easier for smaller firms that use the platforms to flourish.  That is an interesting conjecture, and there is undoubtedly some truth to it.  It is possible that efficient, welfare-enhancing conduct by the platforms regarding their businesses in complementary markets is so harmful to other actual and potential firms in those markets that it is harmful to welfare overall.  But there have been no hearings on the bill, and Congress has made no other investigation or findings that would support a conclusion that the costs of restricting efficient, innovative conduct by the platforms will be less than the benefits from insulating rivals in complementary markets from the conduct that the bill would prohibit.6
 
III. Content Moderation
According to newspaper reports, Senator Cruz, Congressman Buck, and other Republicans are saying that the AICOA will be a useful tool against content moderation or, as they think of it, liberal bias on the digital platforms.  Senator Klobuchar and other Democrats have said that the bill is about commercial practices, not content moderation.  In support of their position, the Democrats point in particular to language in the bill that limits the protected Business User category to persons that use the platforms for “advertising, sale, or provision of products or services” (Section 2(a)(2)(A)).
There are three problems with the Democrats’ position on this issue.  First, if Republican supporters of the bill say that it is intended to help reign in content moderation, that will be part of the legislative history and might affect judicial interpretations of the bill.  Second, two of the prohibitions set forth in the bill – Section 3(b)(5), which prohibits conditioning access to the platform on use of other products or services, and Section 3(b)(8), which prohibits restrictions on uninstalling preinstalled software or changing default settings — are not limited by the definition of Business User.  With AI advances, one can imagine platforms conditioning access to the platform on use of, or restricting uninstalling or changing the default settings on, truth filters.  The bill would block that.
Third, and most important, content moderation might be thought appropriate for certain types of Business Users.  Consider, for example, a cake shop that advertises on the platform that it does not serve LGBTQ persons and includes in the advertising false statements about them.  Or a PAC that advertises the sale of MAGA hats, the profits from which will be used to fund efforts to overturn the stolen 2020 presidential election.  Or a third-party app or service that disseminates false information. The platform will defend its refusal to run those ads or enable those apps or services on the ground that it is using neutral criteria based on truth and is not discriminating, but how should counsel advise the platform if she expects that the plaintiff will be able to find hundreds of false ads, or false statements disseminated by other apps or services, that slipped through the truth filters over many months in support of an argument that the criteria are not being neutrally applied?  The plaintiff will have a tough time winning such cases, but given the number of potential enforcers of the new law (including states like Florida and Texas), the litigation risk might nevertheless have a real deterrent effect on content moderation.
The misinformation and bias issues on social media and other platforms are very important.  They should not be confounded by a he-said, she-said debate about the reach of legislation intended, at least by the Democrats, for other purposes.
 
IV. Conclusion
There are many hard issues raised by current antitrust controversies and the digital platforms.  New legislation might be appropriate.  Sound legislation requires a clear, factually-based understanding of the problems the legislation is seeking to address and of the costs and benefits of the solutions.  AICOA is not yet such a bill.

357,"June 16, 2022","Meta, Alphabet & Twitter To Take On Fake News As EU Watchdog Closes In","


Meta, Alphabet, Twitter and Microsoft agreed on Thursday to take a tougher line against disinformation under an updated EU code of practice that could hit them with hefty fines if they fail to do so.
More than 30 signatories including advertising bodies have committed to the updated Code of Practice on disinformation, the European Commission said.
The signatories agree to do more to tackle deep fakes, fake accounts and political advertising, while non-compliance can lead to fines as much as 6% of a company’s global turnover, the EU executive said, confirming a Reuters report last week.
The companies, which include TikTok and Amazon’s live streaming e-sports platform Twitch, have six months to comply with their pledges and will have to present a progress report at the beginning of 2023.
“The new code is a testimony that Europe has learned its lessons and that we are not naive any longer,” Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova told a news conference.
She said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic and Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union accelerated the EU’s crackdown on fake news.

358,"June 15, 2022",US Senate Passes Bill Allowing AGs To Pick Location Of Where Antitrust Suits Are Heard,"


On Tuesday the US Senate passed legislation to allow state attorneys general to pick the location where their federal antitrust suits are heard, reported Bloomberg.  When first announced Alphabet’s Google had opposed the bill.
The chamber passed the measure by unanimous consent. An amendment removed a provision that would have applied the measure retroactively to a 2020 antitrust suit filed by Texas and 14 other states and territories against the operator of the world’s largest search engine. 
The bill, which has widespread bipartisan backing, now requires a House floor vote. If enacted, the legislation would give states the power to decide where antitrust trials are held, with companies not allowed to challenge those decisions. The federal government already has the same right
The measure grew out of a 16-month investigation by a House antitrust panel into the power of giant technology platforms. It represents a key step by US lawmakers to curb the monopoly power of internet giants in the nearly 30 years since the worldwide web was made available for commercial use — with the exception of a measure to protect online privacy for children in 1998. It’s part of a package of antitrust bills designed to rein in Big Tech that Congress is pushing to turn into law before the August recess.
Other bills, which are expected to be voted on as soon as next week, would bar large technology platforms like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms from favoring their own products over those of smaller rivals who use their platforms. A second proposal would open up distribution of apps on mobile devices, forcing Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. to allow alternate app stores and payment methods.

359,"June 15, 2022",Why Tech Regulators Need to Think Like Google,"
As many of the world’s largest companies are platform-based technology companies, there has been a growing push worldwide to regulate these companies to address issues arising from economic, political and communications power. At the same time, their distinctive platform business models raise new challenges to regulators, such as what industries they are in, what problems connect to which regulatory authority, and who has jurisdictional authority and regulatory capacity. The paper argues that regulators increasingly need to “think like Google”: they need to be able to adopt holistic strategies that can apply across industry silos and different regulatory responsibilities. There is also a need to empower the notion of regulation in the public interest, to challenge the ideational power of tech companies that they are superior stewards of public good to government agencies.

I. The Challenge of Platform Business Models
The 2020s have been a period where the policy spotlight has been thrown upon the power of Big Tech. The reasons are not surprising. Platform-based technology companies experienced phenomenal growth during the 2010s and early 2020s, to become the world’s largest companies and most valuable brands.
According to Kantar BrandZ, the seven most valuable brands in 2021 were platform-based technology companies (in order): Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, Facebook, and Alibaba.[2] They sit alongside a slew of other tech-base...

360,"June 14, 2022",EU’s Disinformation Code Will Force Big Tech To Tackle Fake News,"


Facebook, Twitter and TikTok are among the signatories of a new version of the EU’s anti-disinformation code that could be published as early as next Thursday and would force companies to share more data about how they tackle disinformation, according to a confidential report seen by the Financial Times. 
The EU’s anti-disinformation code is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in the power of Big Tech companies, and it is a prelude of what is probably coming with the recently approved Digital Services Act (DSA). Most of the large tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, TikTok and Microsoft, will join the EU’s code. While this code isn’t new — it was first introduced in 2018 as a voluntary code — the concessions made by the tech companies are key to understanding the impact it could have. 
First, companies will need to disclose how they are removing, blocking or curbing harmful content in advertising and in the promotion of content. Second, online platforms will have to develop tools and partnerships with fact-checkers to tackle “harmful disinformation,” and in some cases that may include taking down information. Third, big tech companies will also be forced to provide a country-by-country breakdown of their efforts, rather than providing global or Europe-wide data. 
“To respond to disinformation effectively, there is a need for country and language-specific data,” said Vera Jourova, EU’s vice-president for values and transparency in charge of the code. “We know disinformation is different in every country, and the big platforms will now have to provide meaningful data that would allow us to understand better the situation on the country level.”
The companies that sign the code will have six months to implement their measures. 
Digital Services Act 
The EU’s anti-disinformation code may lay the foundation for the content moderation rules that will be imposed through the DSA, a piece of legislation that will force Big Tech to monitor their platforms and remove illegal content. While this code is voluntary, it will be closely linked to the DSA as this legislation foresees the creation of codes of conduct to inform companies how to comply with the new content moderation rules.  
The DSA does not establish in the law how companies should identify and remove illegal content, and it explains that it will provide further guidance in secondary legislation or through codes of conduct. Thus, the updated EU disinformation code may be key to know what Big Tech would have to do to comply with the DSA and avoid hefty fines (up to 6% of global turnover).

361,"June 13, 2022",The Digital Markets Act: The Path to Overregulation,"

By Dr. Aurelien Portuese1
 
“The best antidote to the disruptive power of innovation is overregulation,” once wrote Tim Wu, now the White House’s adviser on competition policy. Paradoxically, a long-time “anti-monopoly evangelist” Tim Wu has recently admitted that “Europe has been interested in promoting competition within its own economy. We are thinking about the same thing ourselves.” This European inspiration for U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration has a name: the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”). But this European regulation is on a collision course with innovation, and looms in the hazards of overregulation.
 
I. Introduction: Overregulation By the DMA ­– An Inevitable Choice
On March 24, 2022, the European Union’s institutions have reached a political agreement on the DMA. Such agreement is both unsurprising and unfortunate. Unsurprising because all institutions of the European Union have agreed, from the first proposal of the DMA by the European Commission in December 2020, on the contours of the new rules about digital competition; institutional discussions have only increased, not decreased, the regulatory burden imposed on the targeted companies. Case in point: The European Parliament approved in December 2021 an earlier version of the DMA with 642 votes in favor, 8 against, and 46 abstentions–the overwhelming support for the DMA unsurprisingly will soon lead to its final adoption. The agreement is also unfortunate since the possible unintended consequences of the DMA have been widely documented over the last two years. These unintended consequences include fewer services from digital ecosystems, greater cybersecurity risks, poorer quality of data privacy because of data combination requirements, and also consumer harm generated out of prohibitions to offer services that may benefit consumers. And yet, European lawmakers have consistently ignored them as frivolous and unfounded critiques, despite the inevitability of the DMA’s unintended consequences.
As the European institutions are now heading toward the final vote of the DMA by the European Parliament and the Council, nothing can stop the DMA from being adopted. The European Commission’s Vice-President, Margrethe Vestager, expects the DMA to be fully applicable in October 2022. The European Commission is already encouraging the targeted companies to comply with this forthcoming regulation.
To paraphrase Tim Wu, the DMA will become the best antidote to the disruptive power of innovation: the DMA is undoubtedly an illustration of overregulation. Two provisions of the DMA, among many others, illustrate its over-regulatory reach, hence generating detrimental consequences on innovations essential for digital technologies that are critically lacking for European technology (“tech”) companies. The DMA lays down the grounds for breaking up and breaking into the platforms, thereby disregarding legitimate innovation arguments and property rights considerations.
 
II. Overregulation By the DMA: Breakups for Non-compliance
First, there is one provision of the future DMA that commentators overlook, and yet, it is paradoxically the most stringent provision of the regulation: Article 16 of the DMA. Contrary to the European lawmakers’ assertions, the DMA may lead to the breakup of tech companies. Indeed, the French Digital Minister Cedric O used former Federal Communications Commission Chair Tom Wheeler’s slogan when he publicly presented the DMA on March 24, 2022. In reference to regulating tech giants, referred to as “digital gatekeepers,” he said: “don’t break them up, break them open.” Despite this call against breaking up tech platforms, the DMA lays down the condition for such breakups–or “structural remedies” in antitrust parlance–to materialize.
Article 16 states that whenever the European Commission considers that a digital gatekeeper “has engaged in systematic non-compliance,” the Commission may decide to “impose on such gatekeeper any behavioural or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to ensure compliance with this Regulation.” “Systematic non-compliance” in Article 16.2 means “at least three non-compliance decisions” issued “within a period of five years” by the Commission regarding obligations laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of the Regulation. Such “systematic non-compliance” may lead to structural remedies against the gatekeeper “where there is no equally effective behavioural remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome for the gatekeeper concerned than the structural remedy” (Article 16.2).
Two sections of the DMA demonstrate that the threat of breakups is much more probable than what European lawmakers admit when hoping to reassure their American counterparts. First, violations of the DMA’s obligations can indeed occur unconsciously. Article 5 contains broad obligations hitting at the heart of the gatekeepers’ business models and intellectual property rights: The DMA obliges them to question their diversification strategies and give rivals access to their patented technologies. Article 6 obligations are purportedly “susceptible of being further specified”: In other words, Article 6 obligations are designed to be broad and indeterminate. Consequently, because of the indeterminacy of the DMA’s obligations, violations of the generalized obligations of Articles 5 and 6 may occur more often than gatekeepers can envisage.
Second, the three “non-compliance decisions,” or violations, do not have to occur successively, but they can be concomitant. This means that a gatekeeper can be subject to three simultaneous investigations for three different violations and receive in the course of a few months three decisions of non-compliance. Furthermore, these three violations can take place regarding the same product. For example, today, LinkedIn profiles and Outlook are bundled together so that users can click on email recipients to discover their social media profiles. By combining data from Outlook with data from LinkedIn, Microsoft may breach Article 5(a) of the DMA,2 Article 6(a),3 and Article 6(d)4 of the DMA: the wrath of the DMA’s obligations and prohibitions may come all at once as the European Commission may issue three simultaneous non-compliance decisions, thereby putting Microsoft into a position of “systematic non-compliance.” Among hundreds of other similar examples, this example demonstrates that a possible breakup is only a few months away after the DMA is finally adopted.
Third, that Article 16.2 does not alone provide sufficient guardrails. Article 16.2 states that “the Commission may only impose structural remedies pursuant to paragraph 1 either where there is no equally effective behavioral remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome for the gatekeeper concerned than the structural remedy.” Consequently, Article 16.2 provides for two situations when structural remedies can be imposed: when there is a lack of available behavioral remedy, or when behavioral remedies are excessively burdensome. Since there are always some sorts of behavioral remedies available, the first theoretical situation is purely rhetorical. The second situation, however, is more interesting as it reveals the lawmakers’ true perception of breakups. That is, behavioral remedies can sometimes be more cumbersome than structural remedies. In other words, breakups can be a more a proportionate solution than companies’ behavioral commitments.
This approach turns antitrust on its head, as structural remedies have historically been considered the solution of last resort, including by European regulators. Behavioral remedies are more proportionate than the highly controversial structural remedies: forcing firms to commit to certain behaviors remains less intrusive than breaking them up. But Article 16.2 reverses this commonsensical logic—breaking up companies becomes less disproportionate than regulating them. The European Commission can easily invoke the alleged proportionality now attached to breakups: Constant micro-managing companies can be said to be more cumbersome for regulators than a one-time company breakup.
For example, should a search engine rank in a “discriminatory” manner its search results, promoting its adjacent services rather than third-party services? Would it not be less “burdensome” to break up the company between its search engine function and its adjacent service, rather than for European Commission’s enforcers to check every update of the algorithm frequently? Indeed, would it not be easier to unbundle Google Shopping from Google search rather than requiring Google search to actively promote rivals of Google Shopping for “fairness” reasons? Breakups may appear more attractive to European enforcers regarding the administrability of the remedies. Moreover, it can be argued that it would be less “cumbersome” for the company to divest its adjacent services than to be subject to weekly or daily regulatory control of its algorithm’s update to ensure a lack of “discrimination.” Article 16.2’s guardrails are either purely rhetorical or wholly ineffective in preventing excessive use of structural remedies. The bottom line is: breakups are looming.
A legal analysis of Article 16 demonstrates that the likelihood of breakups is, contrary to European lawmakers’ vain reassurance, much higher than one can think. Paradoxically, breakups following the adoption of the DMA appear overlooked in the current discussion. This neglect underestimates the risks of overregulation that the DMA threatens concerning the preservation of innovation incentives and the preservation of property rights.
  
III. Overregulation By the DMA: “Break-ins” for Proprietary Assets
Furthermore, not only does the DMA seek to break up tech platforms, but European lawmakers also want to break into these tech platforms by way of the DMA. Indeed, Articles 5 and 6 of the DMA lay down a wide range of obligations and prohibitions applicable to the targeted digital gatekeepers. These rules intend to create “fairness” in the way gatekeepers interact with trading partners and “contestability” in the markets within which these gatekeepers operate. These obligations allow for break-ins by business users and competitors: They purportedly enable businesses to enter the operating systems of gatekeepers. As economists note about the DMA’s obligations, it is unclear whether the benefits of the ex-ante obligations will outweigh their costs. The break-ins provided in Articles 5 and 6 are considerable regarding the implications for innovation and regulatory overreach as they allow rivals to unfairly extract rents through the DMA’s obligations.
For example, nondiscriminatory rules suggest algorithmic accountability, which means the enforcers would constantly micromanage the gatekeepers’ algorithmic formulas to ascertain the absence of “unfair” or “discriminatory” treatments of business users. Algorithm-driven companies may “self-prefer” their products to offer consumers and business users synergies across various services. For instance, Google may place Google Meet in Gmail to provide consumers with an alternative, easily accessible video-conferencing program. Also, Amazon may promote products using its delivery services as these services will enable the company to optimize delivery times for consumers. Additionally, “self-preferencing” can reveal consumer preferences, as illustrated by the fact that consumers generally prefer private label products (i.e., generic products) because of brand loyalty and lower prices. For these reasons, the European Commission’s own experts concluded that self-preferencing practices are “not abusive per se, but [should be] subject to an effects test.” And yet, against its own experts’ advice but also against general economic knowledge recognizing the desirability of self-preferencing, the DMA prohibits “self-preferencing” per se.
Article 6(d) of the DMA bans self-preferencing by gatekeepers with no justification available. The version of the DMA approved by the European Parliament on December 15, 2021 indeed states that gatekeepers have to “not treat more favourably in ranking or other settings, services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself or by any third party belonging to the same undertaking compared to similar services or products of third-party and apply transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions to such third-party services or products.” Such an aggressive stance on the platforms’ business models has one objective: to break into the platform and unbundle complementary products and services that the platform has introduced as a result of innovation.
The inevitable consequence would be for the targeted platforms to refrain from introducing new products and services because of the risks of engaging in “self-preferencing,” irrespective of likely lost or foregone consumer benefits. Targeted platforms may no longer engage in fierce competition through innovation since the European Commission enforcers may eventually assess their ability to innovate and challenge other industries’ incumbents as anticompetitive. One example would be for digital gatekeepers to compete less with financial institutions since their ability to innovate in terms of financial payments (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Facebook Pay, etc.) may be perceived as “self-preferencing” despite lower fees and the greater choice these innovative services offer to consumers and business users. In other words, the DMA breaks into tech platforms with the likely consequence of ossifying markets with entrenched positions–i.e., the opposite result of the DMA’s stated objectives.
Another illustration of the DMA’s intent to break into the platforms and dictate alternative business models is provided with Article 11.1b, voted on by the European Parliament on December 15, 2021. This article states that “[t]he gatekeeper shall not engage in any behaviour discouraging interoperability by using technical protection measures, discriminatory terms of service, subjecting application programming interfaces to copyright or providing misleading information.” In conjunction with article 11.1a, this article means that gatekeepers must not discourage maximal interoperability even in services which are not the “core platform services” identified by the DMA. In other words, gatekeepers, at all times and for all services, have to ensure interoperability of their services with any business users’ services and devices irrespective of considerations related to intellectual property rights (i.e., copyright) or “technical protection measures” (i.e., cybersecurity). To illustrate, this “anti-circumvention” requirement may lead Amazon, for example, to interoperate its cloud services with any domestic or foreign cloud provider, and Amazon cloud services could not impose technical protection measures designed to prevent data leakages, nor could it impose confidential requirements related to the intellectual property rights ascribed to its cloud technology. The unintended consequences for end-users appear blatant—cybersecurity threats and lack of data protection. Additionally, the unintended consequences for the platform’s innovation will eventually arise at the expense of high-quality business users and all end-users (i.e., investment deterrence on the technology because of constant neglect of intellectual property rights may undermine consumer and business users’ experience).
This anti-circumvention provision is further detailed in Recital 32 of the latest version of the DMA adopted on December 15, 2021. This recital states that the DMA’s obligations
“should apply to any behaviour by a gatekeeper, irrespective of its form and irrespective of whether it is of a contractual, commercial, technical or any other nature, insofar as it could, in practice, have an equivalent object or effect to the practices that are prohibited under this Regulation. Such behaviour includes the design used by the gatekeeper, the presentation of end-user choices in a non-neutral manner, or using the structure, function, or manner of operation of a user interface or a part thereof to subvert or impair user autonomy, decision-making, or choice.”
This “neutrality” would lead gatekeepers to offer products and services in a way where they not only disfavor their own products, but also where they actively promote their rivals’ products and services at the expense of the gatekeepers’ incentives to innovate and compete.
The mere likelihood that a practice of the gatekeeper could lead consumers to choose the gatekeeper’s services will be subject to prohibition under this anti-circumvention clause. For instance, any sign-in suggestions (e.g., Apple, Google, or Facebook sign-ins suggestions) may be prohibited as they are “technical” practices that may “impair” consumers’ “choice” in a “non-neutral manner”; even suggestions among a few competing sign-in alternatives may still appear to be non-neutral since other email providers are discriminated against and excluded from the sign-in suggestions. In other words, if Google suggests that consumers sign in with Google accounts, Apple accounts, or Facebook accounts, companies such as Twitter, Alibaba, or many other rivals may complain that these choices are non-neutral since their names do not appear in the suggestions. Given the impossibility of defining “neutrality,” Google may become incentivized to no longer propose its sign-in solutions at the expense of product innovation and possibly consumer preferences.
The DMA intends to break into the way gatekeepers interact with business users and end users, irrespective of intellectual property rights considerations and irrespective of the ways consumers benefit from digital ecosystems so that gatekeepers are subject to “non-discriminatory” requirements that enforcers define, determine, and implement without predictability for these platforms. Such uncertainty as to whether new products and services can be considered as violating the numerous prohibitions and obligations of the DMA will irremediably lead gatekeepers to lower the pace of introducing new products and services in their ecosystems at the expense of the disruptive innovation which has characterized the digital economy. Ideally, European lawmakers want, through the DMA, to treat gatekeepers as public utilities, subjecting them to neutrality requirements— much like the General Court of the European Union has recently considered that Google should be treated as an “essential facility.”
To be sure, European lawmakers have added to possible breakups of digital gatekeepers a range of prohibitions and obligations which will effectively lead enforcers to break into the platform’s ecosystem, business model and, ultimately, property rights. Treating innovative companies as public utilities is not without consequences for either innovation incentives or consumer benefits.
  
IV. Conclusion: Overregulation By the DMA – Does it Whither Innovation? 
Breakups and break-ins are both highly controversial, and yet they are the legal force at the heart of the DMA. The populist “big-is-bad” has its comeback, as breakups aim at shrinking large-scale enterprises. In contrast, break-ins aim at sharing critical assets legitimately created to redistribute power from large companies to (not so) small ones. Both objectives undermine the fundamental protection of intellectual property rights. Thus, they annihilate the incentives for innovation at the potential expense of consumers and only in the name of following a populist stance against large platforms.
The regulatory pattern of overregulation is undeniable: the DMA adds one layer of stringent regulation atop national regulations without removing regulatory barriers to innovation. Indeed, the premise for the DMA was initially that national regulatory barriers burden European tech companies to compete and thrive: The European institutions had to complete the Digital Single Market. In the traditional narrative of the European Commission regarding the completion of the internal market, such completion would only take place by 1) removing national regulatory barriers and 2) adopting a European-wide regulation harmonizing national rules with the benefit of scale. The DMA was supposed to solve the so-called “fragmentation” of the Digital Single Market due to numerous national regulatory obstacles.
Has such fragmentation of the Digital Single Market been solved with the DMA proposal? Not at all. Contrary to the initial and laudable objective of the DMA, which was the completion of the Digital Single Market through the non-fragmentation of digital rules across Member States, the DMA does not even try to address such fragmentation. This insincere objective is highly problematic for two reasons.
First, from a legal perspective, the DMA lacks the legal basis necessary for its adoption. In other words, it does not achieve the purpose which justifies its proposal and adoption. The DMA has Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis, which enables the EU to adopt “measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.” That is, the EU can legislate under Article 114 TFEU only for harmonization purposes. The proposed rule must reduce the regulatory fragmentation within the EU.
But the DMA does nothing to mitigate such regulatory fragmentation. Adding an EU-wide rule and letting Member States adopt their own rules paradoxically increases regulatory fragmentation. Such legal inconsistency–i.e., the legal basis’s objective of reduced fragmentation with the realized objective of increased fragmentation–has led prominent legal scholars to conclude that the DMA may be illegal under European treaties.
Second, from an economic perspective, it is well-known that digital companies can thrive and compete only if they reap off the scale economies inherent to the network effects at play in the digital economy: absent scale, tech platforms are bound to fail, struggle, and ultimately be outcompeted by larger-scale enterprises better equipped for the innovation-driven economy we live in. Consequently, European tech companies will move to the United States to scale-up given the size of the American market and the size of the market for venture capital. There is a consensus that only scale can save the European digital economy. Thus, national regulatory barriers need to be removed.
And yet, the DMA does nothing to help European companies compete in the digital economy, contrary to what European lawmakers might wishfully think that the DMA pursues. In other words, the DMA may very well overregulate and harm a few American tech platforms, altogether harming these platforms’ business partners and millions of consumers. But ironically, the DMA does not help European companies to thrive, since the main obstacle for these companies remains unchanged and could worsen with the DMA–namely, the regulatory fragmentation of the Digital Single Market.
These unfortunate outcomes arising from the DMA proposal and its soon adoption lead to one conclusion: overregulation harms innovation. As a case of overregulation, the DMA will irremediably reduce innovation. The disruptive power of innovation— a force of change and progress—is subdued when a regulation like the DMA adopts a precautionary, risk-averse approach to innovative companies and unleashes radical solutions such as breakups and “break-ins.” In a time of greatly needed transatlantic cooperation, the adoption of the DMA will have lasting consequences on the regulatory divergence of tech platforms between the European Union and the United States.

2 Article 5(a) states that digital gatekeepers must “refrain from combining and cross-using personal data sourced from these core platform services with personal data from any other services offered by the gatekeeper or with personal data from third-party services, and from signing in end users to other services of the gatekeeper in order to combine personal data, unless the end-user has been presented with the specific choice in an explicit and clear manner, and has provided consent in the sense of Regulation (EU) 2016/679…”

362,"June 12, 2022",Regulators Warn Tech Giants More Antitrust Enforcement Coming,"


The Federal Trade Commission is keeping a close eye on Big Tech as the industry expands into newer technologies such as artificial intelligence and the metaverse.
In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said regulators risk “fighting yesterday’s war” if they fail to comprehend how tech giants might take advantage of societal technology shifts to strengthen their own position, in ways that may violate antitrust laws.
The message is a warning to the tech industry as companies ranging from Facebook-parent Meta (FB) to Microsoft (MSFT) have announced big investments in virtual reality tech, and as AI-powered smart speakers have become ubiquitous (and have already inspired some competitive complaints).
“Dominant incumbent platforms are threatened at moments of technological transition,” Khan said. “I think we are now similarly seeing lots of technological transition, via VR and AR contexts, in the cloud, with certain types of voice assistant technologies.”
The remarks highlight how expansively the FTC views its mission as Khan seeks to reshape the US government’s approach to antitrust. Khan is among the tech industry’s fiercest critics, having helped lead a 16-month congressional investigation of the sector and spurred a national debate over Amazon’s economic dominance with a Yale Law Journal paper highlighting the company’s impact. Last year, President Joe Biden surprised many by not only nominating Khan to be an FTC commissioner, but to lead the agency.

Oracle has received final regulatory clearance for its pending $28.3 billion purchase of the healthcare data company Cerner. The deal is expected to close Monday.
The final step in the regulatory process was approval from the European Commission, which has now been received, the company said.
Oracle announced the deal, its biggest ever, in December last year. It will give it access to a trove of data and could attract more healthcare clients to its cloud platform. 
Cerner, a hospital facility management software-maker, produces high-end  health information technology services, devices, and hardware that rely on complex troves of patient data to help navigate various aspects of the US healthcare system, including availability and coverage of medical professionals to help people get the best coverage available. 
Cerner’s data can help Oracle train and improve the software maker’s artificial intelligence-based cloud services. The company, whose software traditionally ran in its customers’ data centers, has started shifting its service to cloud computing providers.
Tech giants such as Microsoft have ramped up investments in the healthcare sector, spurred by demand for cloud-based solutions during the pandemic.

Broadcom will buy VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022, the companies announced on Thursday.
The deal would be one of the largest technology acquisitions of all time, behind Microsoft’s pending $69 billion deal to purchase Activision Blizzard and Dell’s $67 billion purchase of EMC in 2016.
Broadcom’s purchase of VMware will help the company diversify away from its core business of designing and selling semiconductors into enterprise software, which can have larger margins. VMware’s products are used by enterprises to more efficiently run their own servers as well as cloud servers.
Broadcom is the most acquisitive semiconductor company and has strategically used mergers to fuel its growth in recent years. It previously purchased CA Technologies in 2018 for $18.9 billion and Symantec in 2019 for $10.7 billion.
The company has been a frequent target of antitrust scrutiny, incluiding complaints of forcing exclusivity agreements and questioning other attempted acquisitions. 
But Broadcom had not made a large acquisition since 2019. In March, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company had the “capacity to do a good-sized acquisition.”
Broadcom planned to purchase Qualcomm in 2018 for $117 billion before the deal was hampered by then-President Donald Trump, who cited national security concerns.

In our data-driven society, privacy as a fundamental right should be recognized and upheld. We must adopt strong legal and technological protections that preserve our autonomy. Legally speaking we must establish a comprehensive federal scheme that recognizes privacy as a fundamental right. Technologically speaking, solutions that are architecturally developed from the individual privacy point of view should be deployed. These trust frameworks will need to mesh with new laws that support privacy as a fundamental right. New types of decentralized/blockchain identity systems are coming online and evolving which support privacy rights and restore the balance of power between the individual and service provider. These systems are disruptive, potentially very profitable, and will impact status quo business models. Tensions between the old and new will have to be resolved. With legal and technological means working together, we can protect our right to be left alone. Privacy is possible in the digital age.

I. INTRODUCTION: PRIVACY RIGHTS IN OUR DATA-DRIVEN ECONOMY
What does privacy as a fundamental right mean? How does that right fare in a data-driven society? How can we protect privacy through both legal and technological measures? Answers to these questions will define how we will be able to live our lives as they are increasingly intertwined with, and influenced by, existing and emerging technologies.

Software maker Oracle is set to gain unconditional EU antitrust clearance for its $28.3 billion acquisition of US healthcare IT company Cerne, reported Reuters. 
Oracle announced the deal, its biggest ever, in December last year. It will give it access to a trove of data and could attract more healthcare clients to its cloud platform. 
Cerner, a hospital facility management software-maker, produces high-end  health information technology services, devices, and hardware that rely on complex troves of patient data to help navigate various aspects of the US healthcare system, including availability and coverage of medical professionals to help people get the best coverage available. 
Cerner’s data can help Oracle train and improve the software maker’s artificial intelligence-based cloud services. The company, whose software traditionally ran in its customers’ data centers, has started shifting its service to cloud computing providers.
Tech giants such as Microsoft have ramped up investments in the healthcare sector, spurred by demand for cloud-based solutions during the pandemic.

Microsoft’s recent acquisitions of video game companies like Bethesda and Activision Blizzard has sent the entire industry into a frenzy – with companies like Sony pulling out its wallet to acquire the Halo and Destiny developer Bungie.
Now, in the latest development, a report by news website Puck reveals EA is actively pursuing a sale or merger with an even bigger company. According to the report (via Kotaku), the Battlefield and FIFA maker has supposedly already held talks with companies like Disney, Apple and Amazon.
It’s also apparently been in negotiations with NBCUniversal about a potential merger, but the two parties could not come to an agreement. Both parties declined to comment, and EA said it did not respond to rumours and speculation.
Comcast CEO Brian Roberts reportedly proposed the merger, and if it had gone ahead, it would have seen Roberts remain in control, with the current EA CEO Andrew Wilson as head of the new mega-business.
EA has supposedly been “persistent in pursuing a sale” and is only more eager after Microsoft sealed the deal with Activision Blizzard. It would also like an arrangement that sees Wilson remain as chief executive. And although it’s believed no deals are currently in the works, it’s reportedly still keen to make an acquisition or merger happen.

The American Antitrust Institute (AAI) has announced it will award Senator Richard Blumenthal the 2022 Alfred E. Kahn Award for Antitrust Achievement. The award will be presented at AAI’s 23rd Annual Policy Conference on June 15, 2022, at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. Senator Blumenthal will deliver keynote remarks at the event.
AAI President Diana Moss stated “We are delighted to grant this award to Senator Blumenthal. His career-long work and commitment to fair competition has had demonstrable, positive impact on our markets, consumers, and workers. The Senator is a model for how the legislative branch can play a vital role in shaping strong antitrust enforcement and coherent competition policy.”
Among other committee assignments, Senator Blumenthal is a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation, and chairs the Consumer Protection Subcommittee. As former Attorney General for the state of Connecticut, where he played a leading role among the states that sued Microsoft in 1998, and in serving in the Senate for over a decade, Senator Blumenthal is a strong proponent of vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.
For decades, Senator Blumenthal has worked to strengthen US antitrust law to limit harmful conduct by dominant firms, to prevent illegal mergers, and to ensure that the antitrust laws protect consumers and workers that are harmed by anticompetitive consolidation and conduct.
As a long-standing member of the Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, Senator Blumenthal has been an integral part, as a sponsor and co-sponsor, of numerous legislative proposals to strengthen and modernize antitrust law and competition policy and to draw attention to anticompetitive practices and mergers. This Congress, for example, Senator Blumenthal led the introduction of the Open App Markets Act, which would create clear, enforceable rules to protect competition and con

London Mayor Sadiq Khan is meeting with Silicon Valley technology leaders as part of a trade mission and U.S. tour to boost London’s tourism and technology industries.
He will be joined on his San Francisco area visit by 11 London-based founders of women-led tech firms eyeing investment and expansion opportunities in the U.S., according to a press release on Tuesday (May 10).
Khan will speak with the heads of Google, LinkedIn and others and will visit the Silicon Valley headquarters of global innovation platform Plug and Play, which is opening its first U.K. offices in both London and Warwickshire.
Facebook, Google, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Snap and Stripe are all expanding their office space and workforce in London, per the release.
The visit comes as new research commissioned by London & Partners — a company that promotes the City of London — showed that record global investments for London tech companies came from the U.S. over the past five years.
London and the Bay Area were the top two hubs for FinTech, the study showed, receiving more capital than all other global cities, including New York and Singapore.
From 2017 to 2021, London attracted 251 new tech investment projects from the U.S., creating almost 9,000 new jobs. Singapore had 154 tech projects, Bangalore had 121, Dublin had 121, and Paris had 115 tech projects.

The Federal Trade Commission finally has the power to move forward with its progressive enforcement and policy agenda after the Senate confirmed President Joe Biden’s nominee to the fifth commissioner seat on Wednesday.
The Senate voted to confirm Alvaro Bedoya 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.
The vote breaks a deadlock between the two Democratic and two Republican commissioners on the FTC, which is chaired by progressive antitrust academic Lina Khan, paving the way to move forward with its most ambitious agenda items. That could include an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, which the agency has reportedly probed. It could also include rulemaking on digital privacy and a narrower view of which mergers to approve, as the agency reviews major deals including Microsoft’s planned purchase of game maker Activision Blizzard.
Related: Alvaro Bedoya Nomination Hits Republican Roadblock
The vote comes months after Biden first nominated Bedoya in September. The founding director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law faced dogged criticism from Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee over his past tweets, including a retweet comparing the 2016 Republican National Convention to a white supremacist rally, and a tweet where he called Immigration and Customs Enforcement “An out-of-control domestic surveillance agency that peers into all our lives.”
As a result, the committee deadlocked twice on the question of whether to recommend his nomination to the full Senate.
At the beginning of Khan’s term as chair, the commission had a full slate of five, including three Democrats — the max allowed from any one party at one time. But since former FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra was confirmed to a new role leading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency has consisted of just two commissioners from each party.

The US Federal Trade Commission has opened a probe into Sony’s purchase of Halo and Destiny developer Bungie. Sony announced the purchase of Bungie earlier this year soon after tech giant and home console rival Microsoft purchase Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion.
At the time, Sony’s purchase of Bungie seemed like a tit-for-tat acquisition, although Bungie is a much smaller company with a final price tag of just $3.6 billion. 
Sources speaking to The Information revealed the FTC’s probe is not about the size of the acquisition, but it could represent a more aggressive stance from the regulator against mergers in big tech.
Soon after Microsoft announced its purchase of Activision Blizzard, Bloomberg reported the FTC and US Justice Department will investigate the merger to ensure consumer protections are upheld. At the time, FTC chairwoman Lina Khan issued stern remarks against corporate consolidation, noting it could “inflict a host of harms, from higher prices and lower wages to diminished opportunity, reduced innovation, and less resiliency.”

Christian Ahlborn, former global head of antitrust at Linklaters, is leaving this summer to join Covington & Burling’s Brussels office as a partner, as large law firms gear up to advise clients on new EU rules governing competitive digital markets.
London-based Ahlborn had co-led Linklaters’ technology sector team, and has worked at the firm for nearly 30 years. He has helped to guide Linklaters clients including Microsoft Corp, Unilever Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc.
Last month, EU countries and lawmakers reached a deal on landmark rules that could curb the power of major technology companies. The Digital Markets Act’s digital “gatekeeper” rules are designed to prohibit companies from favoring their own services over those of rivals.
EU antitrust leaders are also preparing to consider new ways to streamline existing competition rules that have imposed billions of euros in fines against technology companies.
Johan Ysewyn, co-chair of Covington’s global antitrust practice, said there’s a demand now for antitrust and competition lawyers. He attributed some of the hiring to a growing need for compliance advice, more investigations in the digital sector and increasingly labor-intensive legal work.
“The merger and competition investigations have become more data-intensive and document-driven, which of course requires larger teams,” he said.
Another former Linklaters antitrust leader, Jonas Koponen, jumped in March to Cooley’s office in Brussels, where the EU’s competition office is headquartered. In March, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton added former Linklaters antitrust partner Isabel Rooms in Brussels.

374,"April 21, 2022",Facebook v. Bundeskartellamt – May European Competition Agencies Apply the GDPR?,"
The relationship between privacy and competition law is complex and contentious. May or should competition agencies consider business conduct’s negative impact on privacy when this effect was the consequence of a restriction or absence of competition? This contribution critically assesses the issues at stake in Case C-252/21 Facebook Inc. and Others v. Bundeskartellamt. It argues that competition agencies should be allowed to consider the legality of business conduct under the GDPR when applying competition law. In the age of data-based business models, it is unhelpful to look at competition and privacy issues in isolation. Judicious regulation of digital platforms requires an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
Privacy and competition law have long been considered separate areas of law, guided by different objectives and enforced by different agencies. Competition law aims to protect competition, and privacy law aims to protect the personal information of individuals. In the age of data-driven business models, however, where consumers receive free services in exchange for their data, the dividing lines have become blurred. If a digital platform restricts competition by foreclosing competitors or acquiring a competitive threat, and is consequently able to degrade its privacy standards, is this a relevant form of harm within the meaning of competition law? If a dominant platform uses its near monopoly position to...

Veteran antitrust lawyer Steven Holley, formerly co-head of the competition group at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and who helped to defend Microsoft Corp at trial in the 1990s iconic US monopoly litigation, has joined hedge fund Select Equity Group in New York.
Holley started his new role at Select Equity Group as an executive vice president this month, according to his LinkedIn biography. He departed 875-lawyer Sullivan & Cromwell on March 31, after a career there of more than 35 years.

376,"April 14, 2022",Blackstone & Benetton Bid For Italy’s Atlantia For €54B,"


Italy’s Benetton family, one of the richest and most influential business dynasties in Europe, and US investment fund Blackstone have proposed a 58 billion euro ($63 billion) buyout offer for Atlantia to take it private and stave off rival interest for the airport and motorway operator.
Highlighting the appeal of the infrastructure sector, the deal would be this year’s second-biggest M&A transaction globally after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The company, which manages around 3,000 km of Italy’s motorway network, operates some of the country’s most profitable – and congested – stretches of road.
Alessandro Benetton, chairman of the family holding company Edizione since January, said one of the aims was to preserve the integrity of Atlantia and its Italian identity, adding they had found in Blackstone a long-term co-investor and partner.
The bid heralds a new phase for Atlantia which is selling its domestic motorway unit to draw a line under a political dispute sparked by a deadly bridge collapse in 2018. 
The Ponte Morandi bridge, in the Italian city of Genoa, made international headlines in August 2018 after a spectacular collapse that cost the lives of over 40 people and flattened dozens of homes. The tragedy sparked criminal investigations against the operator, leading to the arrest of Atlantia’s CEO, Giovanni Castellucci.
The sale, which will cut Atlantia’s end-2021 debt of 38.6 billion euros, will bring 8 billion euros into its coffers. Net of debt the offer values the group at 19 billion euros.
“The gargantuan Benetton and Blackstone-led Atlantia deal redefines how investors will think about infrastructure investments due to its sheer size alone,” said Wylie Fernyhough, senior private equity analyst at PitchBook.
The Benettons and Blackstone said on Thursday they would offer 23 euros per share, a premium of 24.4% to the share price on April 5, before speculation about the offer fuelled gains.

377,"April 12, 2022","The Decline, Fall, and Renewal of U.S. Leadership in Antitrust Law and Policy","
The United States has lost its world leadership in antitrust, evidenced by its narrow conception of market power and its abuse.  This essay pinpoints exactly where the U.S. has fallen behind and suggests how it can regain footing, this time not as hegemon but sharing the reins with sister jurisdictions.

By Eleanor M. Fox[1]
 
I. Introduction
The United States was the pioneer in antitrust law. By and through the 1960s and most of the 1970s, it developed a law that was harsh on price-fixing, harsh on powerful firms’ exclusionary practices, and harsh on mergers that consolidated power. It was admired world over as the leader in competition law and policy.
Post-World War II, U.S. antitrust was exported to Germany and Japan as the economic law of democracy. In the late 1950s, to anchor peace in Europe, six European nations formed the European Economic Community (later to grow to 28 nations and then to contract to 27), drawing from the U.S. Sherman Act as well as from the German law against restraints.
Over the next many years, scores of nations adopted competition law, taking lessons from both the U.S. and the EU. But by early in the new millennium, the bloom was off the U.S. anti-monopoly rose.
U.S. monopoly law shrank in its reach while public concerns about monopolies grew. People came to fear that very big business – epitomized by Big Tech – was taking control of their lives; that the market system works for the elites, not for “the people”; that the...

Global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright has hired a Covington & Burling antitrust partner who has represented Microsoft Corp, Walt Disney Co and Facebook in multi-billion dollar deals, reported Reuters. 
Miranda Cole said the size of Norton Rose Fulbright’s antitrust practice was a draw. The firm said it has more than 150 antitrust and competition lawyers across 20 countries.
At Covington, Cole represented Microsoft as the tech giant executed its biggest gaming acquisition at the time in 2020 — the $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media. ZeniMax owns multiple video game studios that make and publish games in the Doom, Fallout and The Elder Scrolls series.
Cole represented Walt Disney Co in its $71 billion acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s film and television assets, bringing the “X-Men,” “Avatar” and “Simpsons” franchises under its banner.
She also represented Facebook in its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram and its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp.
Cole said that given the UK’s exit from the European Union, law firms will need teams who can cover both the EU and UK competition authorities in parallel.

380,"April 7, 2022",Senate Confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson For Supreme Court,"
The United States Senate confirmed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman to serve on the top US court.
The 53-47 final vote tally showed bipartisan support for Jackson, with three Republicans joining all their Democrat counterparts to elevate the 51-year-old federal judge to a lifetime appointment.
In February, while introducing  Jackson at the White House, Biden declared “I believe it’s time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation.” The landmark appointment is important beyond its effects on the US legal and political landscape, with strong cultural and social significance at a moment of hightened polarization. 
Jackson joined the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in June 2021 after seven years as a trial judge on the DC federal court. Before taking the bench, Jackson served as an assistant federal public defender, a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission, a lawyer in private practice at several firms, and a law clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose big shoes she has been nominated to fill.
While much has been talked about regarding her historic nomination, it is hard to determine where Jackson might fall on issues related to antitrust. She was reassigned from a class-action lawsuit targeting Facebook, Google and Alphabet last June after being elevated to the D.C. Circuit, while the remaining antitrust cases she faced on the district court rarely delved into substantive issues. Most opinions issued by Jackson on this subject dealt with procedural or jurisdictional matters. 
At least one antitrust hawk is already a fan, however. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s head of antitrust and an outspoken skeptic of market concentration in the tech industry has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. 
Kanter is leading several Justice Department competition cases against Big Tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. “Ketanji is a person of tremendous character and intellect,” Kanter stated, adding that he “could not imagine a better selection.”
While Jackson does not have a strong antitrust background in either private practice or on the bench, her predecessor and former boss, Stephen G. Breyer, has left an indelible mark on antitrust case law in the United States. One of Breyer’s best known antitrust opinions was for the majority in the court’s landmark 2013 ruling in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis. That case stemmed from the FTC’s challenge of agreements ending patent litigation over the testosterone drug AndroGel that enforcers said unfairly delayed the entry of cheaper, more accessible generic versions of the drug.

Her nomination by President Joe Biden received bipartisan support from the Senate Judiciary committee earlier this year.
Vidal will have more power over patent decisions than previous PTO heads, following a US Supreme Court ruling last year that gave the director authority to review patent-eligibility rulings from the office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board.
Previous PTO director Andrei Iancu was known for policies seen as favoring patent owners compared to Obama’s PTO director Michelle Lee, and an internal policy during his tenure reduced the number of patents that the board invalidated.

383,"April 1, 2022",The EU’s Antitrust Lessons for America,"
By: Zach Meyers (Project Syndicate)
US corporate giants often criticize the European Commission’s aggressive competition policy, claiming that it protects inefficient European firms. Meanwhile, they applaud America’s laissez-faire antitrust policies, which regard market dominance as a reward for success and have aided the development of today’s US megafirms, especially in the tech sector.
With US President Joe Biden’s administration seeking to boost competition in order to reduce what it views as excessive corporate consolidation, this may be about to change. But the risk is that, rather than tweaking an antitrust regime that has mostly served America well, Biden may go too far in reforming it. US big business may therefore find that, in the long run, the European Union’s competition policy ends up being more predictable and reasonable than America’s.
Consider how the EU and US authorities currently regulate anti-competitive conduct by dominant firms. The European Commission, already tough, is getting even stricter – but there are checks and balances to prevent it from going too far.
For example, the Commission is increasingly concerned about large tech firms leveraging their most-used services to support less-used ones – as, for example, Microsoft does when it uses Windows to promote its search engine, Bing. But, although these practices can give big firms huge advantages over smaller competitors, they are not necessarily anti-competitive. While Bing has a small market share, it is the only meaningful challenger to Google’s near-monopoly in online search. Microsoft’s practices boost competition in this domain and should thus be welcomed, not banned…

Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.
Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet unit Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Intel and imposed billions of euros in fines.
The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks’ manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.
The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said. “I’m announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,” Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.
“It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly ‘fit for the digital age’,” she said.
Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.

The Chinese competition authority went through a major restructuring in November 2021. The Anti-Monopoly Bureau under the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) was expanded to three separate bureaus to cover respectively conduct investigation, merger review and competition policy, which together constitute the new independent State Anti-Monopoly Bureau (“SAMB”) within SAMR. Looking back on the merger review cases during the past few years (2018-2022), there are some notable new trends: (1) SAMR appears to be more likely to find competition concerns in vertical and conglomerate mergers than competition authorities in other major jurisdictions; (2) FRAND supply commitments to Chinese customers have become common in most conduct remedy cases; (3) SAMR has embraced a new behavioral remedy of helping a third party to enter the market; and (4) SAMR is less willing to allow automatic sunset clauses after an initial remedy term and instead often requires parties to apply at some certain points in the future for and justify termination of the remedy conditions based on changed market conditions.

Chinese antitrust laws remain an effective legal weapon against SEP abuses. Unlike in the U.S. and E.U. where antitrust laws are fading away at least in SEP/FRAND disputes, Chinese antitrust laws remain strong and active. They are effective tools against SEP abuses, in parallel with FRAND obligations. The Chinese courts and antitrust enforcement have shown their willingness to enforce antitrust laws in FRAND disputes, and recent competition rules provide additional angles to address new rising disputes.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Standard-setting organizations (“SSOs”) have long played a critical role in the advancement of some of the most important technology sectors, particularly that of the information and communication sector. When people still need different chargers for different electrical standards, a cell phone applying Wi-Fi and telecommunication standards will work all the same across the globe. With such great convenience comes grave danger of monopoly, and standard setting has been the focus of international authorities and courts for the past few decades. With China’s enormous market, the Chinese FRAND and antitrust enforcement is critical to any SEP owners’ licensing activities.
Over the years, major international antitrust authorities and respective national courts have taken different positions regarding the antitrust issue involving standards and Standard-Essential Patents (“SEPs”). Among them, ...

387,"March 28, 2022",EU Sees Deal On Big Tech Rules Policing Content Coming In April,"


A deal between EU countries and the European Parliament that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be finally clinched next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.
EU lawmakers and national governments are now thrashing out the details, with debates remaining over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.
“There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we’re lucky, it may be possible,” Vestager told Reuters in an interview.
Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting big tech like Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.
The DMA sets out a list of do’s and don’ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation. Vestager has said there would be no extensions, as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.
“Well, actually I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,” she said.

388,"March 28, 2022",No Antitrust Concerns Over Cloud Computing Yet: Vestager,"


Cloud computing, in which Amazon and Microsoft are the biggest players followed by Alphabet’s Google, doesn’t pose competition concerns yet because of Europe’s Gaia-X initiative, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Cloud computing services have seen demand soar, driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.
They have become a big driver of growth at the big tech companies, with AWS generating 13% of Amazon’s revenue last year and 74% of its operating income while Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of its overall sales.
The market power of the big companies has sparked unease at smaller rivals in recent years, with German software provider NextCloud, France’s OVHcloud and two other companies filing complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices to Vestager.
“No, so far we’ve had no concerns,” Vestager told Reutersin an interview when asked if she was worried about companies potentially abusing their dominance.
She said Gaia-X, a project to create secure and efficient cloud data that seeks to reduce the EU bloc’s dependence on Silicon Valley giants, would boost competition.
“This is not something that we are engaged in, but I basically see it as pro-competitive when you have someone to show potential customers that there are more than two giants where you can place your business,” she said.

389,"March 25, 2022",EU Lawmakers Agree On New Rules To Take On Big Tech,"
The new European Digital Markets Act which aims to rein in Big Tech may enter into force by the end of the year after the EU institutions reached an agreement on Thursday on the final text of the bill. 
While most of the debate has focused on the definition of gatekeepers — Big Tech firms that meet certain size and revenue thresholds (i.e. Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft) — little attention has been paid to the concept of “emerging gatekeepers.”
Yet this concept may gain relevance as the digital space evolves and companies’ presence in Europe grows. This subcategory of gatekeepers may be the perfect solution for regulators to monitor the market and impose gradual obligations on companies as they become more important in their core platform services. 
But first, what is a gatekeeper? According to the DMA, a provider of a core platform service shall be a gatekeeper if it meets three conditions. It must have significant impact on the internal market, defined by an annual turnover of at least €7.5 billion within the European Union (EU) in the past three years or a market valuation of at least €75 billion. It must also serve as an important gateway for business users, which is met if the company has 45 million monthly end users and at least 10,000 business users established in the EU. Lastly, it must enjoy an entrenched and durable position in its operations or will enjoy such position in the future, quantified as 45 million monthly end users for at least three years. 
The last prong of this trident, “will enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the near future,” is rather vague, but it would allow the European Commission to follow companies that are growing fast and impose measures before that position becomes more permanent. The Commission may use this concept as a traffic light to modulate the obligations a company should face when it is on track to become a gatekeeper. 
The original draft of the DMA doesn’t contain a specific definition of “emerging gatekeeper,” but the introduction provides a good understanding of the purpose of this term. 
“For gatekeepers that have been designated by the Commission as likely to enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the near future, the Commission should only impose those obligations that are necessary and appropriate to prevent that the gatekeeper concerned achieves an entrenched and durable position in its operations. With respect to such emerging gatekeepers, the Commission should take into account that this status is in principle of a temporary nature, and it should therefore be decided at a given moment whether such a provider of core platform services should be subjected to the full set of gatekeeper obligations because it has acquired an entrenched and durable position, or conditions for designation are ultimately not met and therefore all previously imposed obligations should be waived.” 
Therefore, the Commission seems to have an important tool to avoid companies circumventing the rules if they don’t fully meet the quantitative criteria set in the law. For instance, if a company doesn’t meet the users thresholds but it is controlling a core platform service, may be subject to some of the gatekeeper obligations.  
According to a press release from the Council, the latest agreement will include in the text of the law a new category of “emerging gatekeeper,” and it may offer more information about when a company may have this status, rather than leaving this definition completely at the discretion of the European Commission.  
The real question is, who may be an “emerging gatekeeper”? For instance, companies that are competing with Big Tech but are not yet at the same level, like TikTok, whose revenue and user base don’t meet the gatekeeper criteria — or Booking.com, which may just be near the limit to qualify as gatekeeper.

Over the past several decades, tech companies have innovated to provide great products to consumers for free. While most people are happy about this, politicians seem not to be. Driven by the perception that tech needs fixing, in the U.S., Europe, and recently Asia, politicians have begun proposing disruptive antitrust legislation targeting tech companies. Many of these proposals seek, in some form, to limit “self-preferencing” by tech companies on digital platforms. Others seek to constrain tech companies with online platforms from merging with or acquiring other online products and services. These proposals threaten the business models that have made these great products free to consumers, and risk harming developers by increasing fragmentation and raising the cost of capital.

Legislators across the world have been struck by the urge to dictate how online marketplaces are run. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), which proposes to regulate everything from how online services can conduct rankings to what services they must make interoperable. In 2021, both houses of the U.S. Congress followed suit with a barrage of legislative proposals, some based on the DMA and others adding new restrictions and requirements.
Regulators in Asia show signs of following suit. In August 2021, South Korea’s Nationa...

391,"March 23, 2022",Revising the Competition Law Rulebook for Digital Markets in Europe: An Update,"

By Kris Van Hove, Argyrios Papaefthymiou, and Margot Vogels1
 
I. Introduction
The present article provides an update of the ongoing process taking place in Europe that is reshaping competition law to bring it up to speed with the digital era. It follows on from a previous CPI Europe article published in October 2020 on the same subject.2 That article set the scene by: (i) identifying the perceived shortcomings of competition law enforcement in the digital sector in Europe; and (ii) discussing the various approaches being considered to tackle them. Since the publication of this first article, various legislative initiatives have been launched that have turned the reflective discourse into concrete action. For instance, in December 2020, the European Commission (“Commission”) published its Proposal for a Digital Markets Act3 (“DMA Proposal”). This proposal seeks to ensure fair and open digital markets by imposing stringent requirements on so-called “gatekeeper” platforms. The inter-institutional deliberations on this key piece of EU legislation are now in their final stretch, with adoption expected sometime in April of this year.
In short, we now have tangible regulatory reforms in the open, at the level of both the EU and national jurisdictions, as well as a flurry of recent enforcement action and judicial developments in “digital antitrust.” It is therefore time to take stock of the concrete regulatory approaches presently being considered to tackle competition law concerns in the tech sector, as well as of the recent developments in the enforcement of “classic” competition law relating to these same concerns. From the “mosaic” of these different yet parallel workstreams, the hope is to shed further light on the precise extent to which a material need for new rules specific to the digital sector actually arises, as well as to assess the adequacy of the approaches that are currently on the table to target the perceived concerns.
  
II. Self-Preferencing and Interoperability
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Self-preferencing can be defined as a practice engaged in by a platform operator that gives preferential treatment to this operator’s products and services when they compete with products and services of other entities using the platform. This type of practice has featured prominently from the outset of the ongoing debate on digital competition policy. Despite continuous controversy among policymakers, practitioners, and academics on the merits of a “self-preferencing” theory of harm, this type of conduct is vigorously scrutinized by competition authorities in Europe and is the behavior most  closely associated with competition concerns attributed to the practices of Big Tech companies.
For instance, the Commission’s engagement with self-preferencing nowadays spans from antitrust enforcement to sector inquiries.4 But self-preferencing is also targeted as particularly pernicious behavior under newly proposed as well as existing sector-specific regulation for Big Tech. First, under the DMA Proposal, gatekeepers5 would be prohibited from ranking their own products and services more favorably than those of third parties.6 The DMA Proposal would also create interoperability obligations.7 These obligations are often presented as potential remedies to self-preferencing practices, when the latter are implemented via “closed systems” that indirectly foreclose competitors on one or more levels of the supply chain.
Second, self-preferencing rules have also recently been enacted (e.g. in Germany) or are under consideration (e.g. in Italy) in various national jurisdictions across Europe.8 In Germany and Italy, competition authorities could prohibit an undertaking of paramount significance for competition from treating the offers of competitors differently from its own offers when providing access to supply and sales markets. Finally, in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) Digital Markets Unit (“DMU”) would be able to impose pro-competitive interventions (or “PCIs”), in the form of “consumer choice and defaults intervention,” on undertakings designated as having “strategic market status” (“SMS”), which is defined as a “substantial, entrenched market power in at least one digital activity, providing the undertaking with a strategic position.”9 These PCIs could be used to address concerns relating to the architecture of a service which influences the consumer’s decision-making.10
B. Enforcement and Judicial Developments in the Fight against Self-preferencing: Luxembourg finally Weighs In
Beyond the legislative and policy initiatives that target self-preferencing with novel tools, the self-preferencing theory of harm is also making headway in the conventional track of abuse of dominance enforcement.
The much-awaited General Court judgment in Case T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission (Google Shopping), issued on 10 November 2021,11 is indisputably the most important recent case law development in the ongoing process of delineating the exact contours of the self-preferencing theory of harm. The case centered on the question of whether Google had abused its dominant position in the market for online general search services to favor its own comparison shopping services over competing services.
The General Court’s judgment is, of course, still subject to appeal before the European Court of Justice. This said, the importance of the judgment cannot be overstated: the very validity of self-preferencing as a self-standing antitrust theory of harm – let alone the particulars of its application in individual factual scenarios – has been the subject of controversy. Critical opinions have invariably been expressed among EU competition law commentators, from the view that self-preferencing is merely a natural – if not intended and efficiency-enhancing – outcome of vertical integration (so that sanctioning self-preferencing would be tantamount to sanctioning vertical integration itself), to the view that, even if some antitrust harm may be identified in what is dubbed “self-preferencing,” this could nevertheless easily fit within existing theories of harm, such as a refusal to supply an indispensable input/a refusal to access an “essential facility.”
The General Court takes a rather straightforward position in the debate on the validity of self-preferencing as a self-standing category of abusive conduct, viewing self-preferencing as, in effect, one of various possible manifestations of “abusive leveraging.” In doing so, the Court has rejected Google’s argumentation to the effect that the conduct at issue should have been examined by the Commission through the prism of the “refusal to supply” theory of harm. The Court did not see, in the conduct at issue, the key constituent elements of a refusal to supply warranting the application of the Bronner12 criteria, namely: (i) an express refusal following a request or otherwise expression of the wish to access the infrastructure at issue, and (ii) the exclusionary effect being principally predicated on this refusal, and not on a separate practice (such as an independent “leveraging abuse”). According to the Court, EU case law indicates that the Bronner criteria do not necessarily apply when assessing the potential abusive nature of conduct beyond the set confines of a refusal to supply, such as the supply of services to competitors on disadvantageous terms.
The most tangible consequence of the Court’s reasoning is that the analysis of whether or not Google’s general search results page is, in fact, an “essential facility” – to which Google could be mandated to provide access subject to the fulfilment of the Bronner criteria (elimination of competition if access is not provided, and indispensability of the “infrastructure” for other market players to be able to compete) – is not a necessary component of the legal test to determine the potential abusive nature of the conduct. In fact, although the Court views Google’s general search results as having “characteristics akin to those of an essential facility […], inasmuch as there is currently no actual or potential substitute available that would enable it to be replaced in an economically viable manner on the market,” it finds that the Commission was not required to establish that the Bronner criteria were satisfied. The Court reasoned that the Commission had identified a form of abusive leveraging that amounted to “‘active’ behavior in the form of positive acts of discrimination in the treatment of the results of Google’s comparison shopping service, which are promoted within its general results pages, and the results of competing comparison shopping services, which are prone to being demoted.”13
In a way, Google got the “worst of both worlds”. Its general search engine is considered “essential enough” to mandate increased scrutiny of any possibly disadvantageous treatment; yet the conduct at issue was not considered a classic refusal to supply, so that the Bronner criteria – which place a rather high threshold to establish a refusal to supply – were not applicable.
In an also very interesting (if somewhat nebulous) refrain, the Court noted that Google, in favoring its own comparison shopping services and simultaneously demoting competing services, engaged in conduct that entailed “a certain form of abnormality.”14 The Court made this finding based on the rationale that the ability to showcase results from multiple and diverse sources is an inherent element of a general search engine’s business model. In conjunction with the rather bold statement that a general principle of equal treatment in EU law is applicable in the context of Article 102 TFEU, the Court concluded that the practice by which Google favored its own comparison shopping service over competing  services amounted to a self-standing form of abusive conduct. That conduct consisted in the abusive leveraging of Google’s dominant position in the market for online general search results to provide less favorable treatment to certain search results, based on the origin of the results, that is, based on whether the results originated from Google’s own comparison shopping service or from a rival comparison shopping service. In this context, little relief or legal certainty is derived from the Court’s phrasing that “certain differences in treatment may be considered contrary to Article 102 TFEU when what is at issue are favoring practices established by operators in a dominant position in the internet sector.”15 Although this seems to imply that not all differences in treatment will be considered abusive in breach of Article 102 TFEU, the Court’s judgment provides little in terms of clarity as to where the line might be drawn in this respect.
The Google Shopping judgment unarguably represents a pivotal moment in the broader ongoing discourse on the review of competition law norms as applied to digital markets. The notion of self-preferencing has now been recognized by the EU judiciary (subject to reaffirmation by the Court of Justice) as an independent, self-standing category of abusive conduct, and thus not subject to the specific conditions of the refusal to supply / essential facilities doctrine (i.e. the Bronner test).
What is more, as the General Court pointedly noted in Google Shopping:
“[I]t is for the national courts and authorities to apply Article 102 TFEU uniformly and in accordance with the case-law of the Courts of the European Union, since divergences between the courts and authorities of the Member States as to its application would be liable to place in jeopardy the unity of the EU legal order and to undermine legal certainty.”16
To appreciate the potential impact of this comment, one only needs to consider the number of ongoing antitrust investigations and court cases within the EU at the national level, which revolve around practices whereby a vertically integrated undertaking is providing some form of favorable treatment to a proprietary product / service as compared to the equivalent product / service provided through that undertaking (e.g. a digital platform) by third parties. The necessary deference of national competition authorities and courts towards the approach of EU courts means that, if the General Court’s position is upheld by the Court of Justice, a series of infringement decisions from national authorities can be expected, if not a further proliferation of antitrust complaints against digital “gatekeepers” for similar practices.
C. Takeaways: Unlawfulness of Self-preferencing Becoming a fait accompli
Reading through the rundown of recent intense enforcement action on the basis of the self-preferencing theory of harm, one might reasonably wonder whether an ex ante approach in this respect (as most clearly reflected in the DMA) is truly necessary and/or proportional to the perceived competitive concerns associated with the practices falling within the ambit of self-preferencing. Both the Commission and EU national competition authorities (“NCAs”) as well as the CMA seem to be more than adequately stepping up to the challenge of reviewing and sanctioning this type of practice with ex post enforcement of classic antitrust rules regarding abuse of dominance.
Relatively more critical voices may argue that the Commission is trying, through the DMA, to circumvent the procedural safeguards laid out by EU competition law (notably in Regulation No. 1/2003)17, taking a horizontal stance that practices falling within the broader “self-preferencing” category are presumptively anti-competitive. Such a stance is economically dubious. Self-preferencing may, at least in a multitude of possible manifestations, be viewed as a perfectly valid outcome of vertical integration (without which, in fact, the incentives of firms to vertically integrate, with the corollary efficiencies that may come with such integration, may not arise in the first place).18 In this context, the establishment of what seems an awful lot like a legal presumption that self-preferencing is inherently anti-competitive (thereby also placing the burden on companies that implement practices that may be construed as such, to prove that these practices do not restrict competition), may be considered a step too far, in the direction of dictating to companies what business model they should adopt, in order to accommodate their rivals. That, of course, is not in line with the prime directive of competition law, which is to uphold competition on the merits.
 
III. Data-related Practices
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Data is indisputably acquiring an ever-increasing status of importance within the broader competitive process. This trend is even more prevalent in the realm of digital platforms, whose intensive use generates vast amounts of data, including both personal data (which remain relatively constant over time) and dynamic data (which relate to interactions with content and other users).
Illustrating the pressing nature of the competition concerns arising from data-related practices, the DMA Proposal would impose a comparatively large number of data­-sharing obligations aimed at loosening the tight grip that gatekeepers allegedly exert on user data. Primarily, gatekeepers would have to refrain from using, in competition with business users, non-public data generated by the activities of business users on the gatekeeper’s core platform services.19] Moreover, gatekeepers would have to grant a business user effective, real-time access to data provided for, or generated in the context of, the use of the gatekeeper’s core platform services by that business user and the end user engaged with the products or services provided by the business user.20 To allow for easier switching between platforms’ services, the DMA Proposal creates a data portability right for business users (in addition to end users) regarding the data generated through the activities of those users.21 Finally, in a provision designed to address one of the sources of their market power, gatekeepers would be prohibited from combining personal data sourced from their core platform services with personal data from any other services, unless the end user has provided consent.22
Similar rules have been enacted (e.g. in Germany) or are under consideration (e.g. in Italy) at national level.23 For its part, the UK DMU would be able to impose PCIs that should ensure greater end-user control over the end user’s data and that mandate third-party access to data. Additionally, the DMU would be able to oblige SMS undertakings to separate data silos.24
B. Data-related Theories of Harm take Center Stage
Competition authorities in the EU are taking their cue from policy makers, increasingly placing data-related concerns at the epicenter of antitrust enforcement actions. The tempo in this area has been set by the German Facebook case, relating to the social network giant’s data collection practices, and more specifically its combination / integration of data from different sources (e.g. the Facebook Like and Share button functionalities along with the – also Facebook/Meta-owned – WhatsApp and Instagram apps and third-party websites), without the explicit consent of Facebook users to the processing of such combined data. With breach of relevant privacy laws (notably the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) being at the core of the theory of harm proposed by the Bundeskartellamt, the case’s development into a saga was anything but surprising: on appeal, the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf halted the implementation of the NCA’s decision via interim proceedings (after Facebook had applied for suspension of the decision’s execution); the Federal Supreme Court (“Bundesgerichtshof”) went on to reinstate the decision’s immediate implementation; and, in the main proceedings on appeal, the Düsseldorf Court decided in March 2021 to refer seven questions to the Court of Justice, mainly revolving around the interpretation of the GDPR, particularly in the context of (i) the German NCA’s competence to establish breaches of the privacy regulation, and (ii) the manner in, and weight with, which GDPR infringements may play into an antitrust law assessment.25 Facebook is also facing a £ 2.3 billion data-related antitrust class action claim before the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal, on behalf of approximately 44 million UK consumers, for an alleged abuse of dominance in the form of unlawful exploitation of consumers’ personal data.26
Competition authorities in other EU jurisdictions are also increasingly following suit with their own investigations into Big Tech’s data-related practices. On 26 November 2021, the AGCM announced the imposition of € 10 million in fines on both Apple and Google for breach of the Italian Consumer Code, in relation to practices involving the collection of data from consumers and the insufficient compliance with the related obligation to adequately inform consumers of said data collection and obtain their prior informed consent.27 Both companies have announced that they will be appealing the Italian authority’s decision. Especially in the case of Apple, this decision probably strikes a particularly sensitive chord, given the company’s proverbial refrain of a privacy-focused comparative advantage vis-à-vis its competitors, ostensibly thanks to its closed-system architecture.
In a similar vein as the AGCM’s infringement decision on Apple’s and Google’s data collection practices, the French data privacy authority (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés or “CNIL”) announced on 6 January 2022 fines of € 60 million and € 150 million on Facebook and Google respectively, for indirectly restricting users’ freedom to reject cookies. The CNIL took issue in particular with the discrepancy between, on the one hand, the ease of accepting cookies on the two companies’ French websites, requiring the push of a single button, and on the other hand, the relatively more complex process of rejecting cookies, which required that a user go through a number of prompts to reach the intended rejection. The CNIL found that this practice was in breach of the French Data Protection Act.
C. Takeaways: Consumer Protection, Privacy and Competition Law Continue to Find Common Ground in Data-related Antitrust Considerations 
The enforcement record on data-related practices so far does not always have competition law as its legal basis. We are increasingly seeing infringement decisions against GAFAM companies with regard to data-related practices on the basis of national consumer protection and data privacy legislation. However, in light of the increasing invocation of data-related language by competition authorities to substantiate competitive harm (most characteristic example in this respect being the German Facebook case), these cases, and their adjudication at the appeal level, are likely to influence the evolution of thinking on data-related theories of harm in the competition law space in the near future. This is even more so given that we are now in anticipation of the opinion of the Court of Justice – in its capacity as the highest authority on the interpretation of EU law – on questions that go directly at the core of the privacy/antitrust nexus.
  
IV. Retail Most-Favored-Nation (“MFN”) Clauses
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Most-favored-nation (“MFN”) clauses are traditionally divided into two categories:
(i.) “narrow” MFNs, which provide that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website (but can do so on other platforms); and
(ii.) “wide” MFNs, which provide that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website or on any other platform.
In particular, MFNs imposed by providers of online intermediation services, such as marketplaces or price comparison tools, and relating to the conditions under which business users offer goods or services to end users, are commonly referred to as “retail MFNs.” From a competition policy perspective, wide retail MFNs are generally considered more problematic than narrow retail MFNs. At its core, the differentiation traces back to the idea that MFNs may have certain efficiency benefits due to the prevention of free-riding behavior: a provider of online intermediation services will often undertake significant investments (in e.g. advertising and marketing), which would be undermined if, once informed by the intermediation services, the consumer then proceeds to make a final purchase on the seller’s own website because the latter charges a lower price. Although this rationale might, exceptionally, justify a narrow retail MFN, wide retail MFNs are generally considered too disproportionately restrictive to benefit from an efficiency exemption.
The Commission’s draft revised Vertical Block Exemption Regulation28 (“Draft Revised VBER”) excludes wide retail MFNs in favor of online intermediation services from the benefit of the safe harbor. Wide MFNs require a buyer of online intermediation services not to offer, sell or resell goods or services to end users (final consumers or other undertakings) under more favorable conditions using competing online intermediation services.29 As a result of the proposed change, the legality of wide retail MFNs in favor of online intermediation services would be subject to a self-assessment.
The UK may well take a slightly stricter stance on what the CMA prefers to call parity obligations. Unlike the Commission, the CMA has recommended that wide retail MFNs should be viewed as hardcore restrictions regardless of whether they apply to online or offline intermediation services.30
Gatekeepers, for their part, will not have to think twice about concluding wide MFNs in respect of their online intermediation services. According to the Commission, MFNs between gatekeepers and their business users deter the latter from using alternative online intermediation channels, which in turn limits inter-platform contestability, and therefore choice for end users. For this reason, the DMA Proposal will outright ban wide MFNs concluded with the business users of online intermediation services.31 The European Parliament even considers that this prohibition should extend to narrow MFNs.32
B. German Federal Supreme Court Leads the Way against MFNs
The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) might be sympathetic to the idea of a rigidly harsh stance against MFNs. On 18 May 2021, the Court confirmed a 2015 decision of the Bundeskartellamt which found that the online hotel reservation platform operator Booking.com had infringed competition law by imposing narrow MFN clauses.33 Through the narrow retail MFNs at issue, Booking.com obtained a commitment from hotel owners operating through its platform to refrain from providing on their own websites lower prices or otherwise better terms than the ones offered on the platform. The German NCA found these clauses to constitute an anti-competitive vertical restraint, in breach of Article 101(1) TFEU and Section 1 of the German Competition Act.
The Bundesgerichtshof disagreed with the OLG Düsseldorf’s key premise that there was a significant free-riding problem that could best be addressed via the narrow retail MFNs. The German Supreme Court highlighted that the main prerequisite for an ancillary restraint to be exempted from the prohibition of Article 101(1) TFEU is that the restraint must be objectively necessary and indispensable for implementing the main activity covered by the agreement, which it did not consider to be the case for the narrow retail MFNs at issue. The Court seemed to consider that the narrow retail MFN was not a fundamental prerequisite for the existence of the distribution agreement itself, as the Bundeskartellamt had viewed it. In the Court’s view, the fact alone that, according to evidence from the Bundeskartellamt’s investigation, Booking.com had not only retained, but actually consolidated its market position after it stopped implementing the clauses at issue, was enough to reject the notion that the clauses were objectively necessary and therefore not an ancillary restraint.
C. Takeaways: Pressure Mounts against Price Parity Clauses of all Shapes and Sizes
The German Federal Supreme Court’s decision in Booking.com has marked the first time that MFNs have been adjudicated at the highest judicial rank within an EU jurisdiction. What is more, the ruling dispels the commonly held view that narrow price parity clauses are “safer” from a competition law perspective than wide MFNs (whereby the supplier – in the Booking.com context, the hotel owner – would be precluded from providing better terms anywhere else, i.e. not only on its own website, but through any other platforms). The key premise behind this differentiation has always been the “free-rider” line of argumentation (which ostensibly might provide some merit to the conditional lawfulness of narrow MFNs). Yet, this reasoning has now been dealt a serious blow by the German Federal Supreme Court. With no case law available in this respect at the highest EU level (i.e. the European Court of Justice), this judgment by the German Federal Supreme Court is the “next best thing”, and is therefore likely to provide the necessary impetus to NCAs in other EU jurisdictions to pursue narrow price parity clauses in a more vigorous manner, at least to the extent that they fall outside the safe harbor of the Verticals Block Exemption Regulation.
In any event, the regulatory mélange of stricter and relatively looser approaches to MFNs in Europe, may inevitably nudge companies to take the safer option of refraining from the implementation of such clauses altogether. This is unfortunate given the efforts the Commission is undertaking to clarify its position with respect to the legality of MFNs in the Draft Revised VBER and the draft revised Vertical Guidelines (“Draft Revised VGL”) 34. More clarity from the European Court of Justice in this respect would be most welcome.
 
V. Online Sales Restrictions
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
As a general rule, every distributor must be allowed to sell its products and services over the internet. From a competition law perspective, vertical competition rules assimilate making products and services available online to passive sales, while the use of certain promotional and advertisement strategies over the internet is considered to constitute active sales.35 Furthermore, while restrictions of active sales are generally permissible under certain conditions, restrictions of passive sales are not.36 Accordingly, under the Draft Revised VBER and Draft Revised VGL, restrictions on certain methods of selling or advertising online will be block exempted, as long as they do not amount to an effective ban on online sales.37 As a matter of fact, the Commission proposes to broaden the range of online sales practices which would be block exempted, including some that are currently considered hardcore restrictions. Similarly, the CMA has already indicated in its final Recommendations for a UK Order replacing the retained Vertical Agreements Block Exemption Regulation that it is inclined to treat as active sales certain categories of online sales which are currently assimilated to passive sales.38
Another major change in the Commission’s approach to online restrictions relates to dual pricing: under the revised draft rules, a supplier may validly charge a hybrid buyer different wholesale prices for products to be resold online and those to be resold offline, so long as this difference reflects differences in the costs incurred in each sales channel at retail level and does not have the object of preventing online sales.39
The Commission, however, takes a stricter stance on restrictions on the use of specific advertising channels, such as price comparison websites and advertising on search engines. While a supplier could validly prohibit the use of one specific price comparison tool or search engine without losing the benefit of the block exemption, for example to protect its brand or fight against counterfeiting,40 a ban on using all most widely used advertising services could amount to preventing the use of the internet and, if so, would therefore not be block exempted.41 Likewise, a ban on the use of the suppliers’ trademarks or brand names for bidding to be referenced in online search advertising services would effectively prevent the buyer from selling over the internet and is for that reason considered problematic.42
Finally, the Commission is also stricter as far as online intermediation service providers are concerned. Under the Draft Revised VBER, the Commission categorizes online intermediation services as suppliers. Accordingly, the Draft Revised VGL clarify that online intermediation services cannot in principle qualify as “genuine agents” for the purposes of Article 101 TFEU.
B. The Italian Apple/Amazon Case: Platform Bans in the Spotlight 
In an interesting development in antitrust enforcement against online sales restrictions, Italy’s AGCM imposed in late 2021 fines of € 58.6 million and € 114.7 million on Amazon and Apple respectively, for an Article 101 TFEU infringement related to the distribution of Apple products via Amazon Marketplace.43 The Italian NCA’s decision centers around the fact that Apple allowed Amazon itself and a limited number of resellers to distribute Apple-branded and Beats-branded products (Beats being an Apple subsidiary) over Amazon Marketplace. Amazon was thus in fact acting as a hybrid platform, in that it provided intermediation services to Apple resellers, while also acting as an Apple reseller itself. The AGCM noted that the selection process for distributors was arbitrary, without any consideration for objective, qualitative criteria. The Italian NCA thus considered the relevant agreements to be in breach of Article 101 TFEU, as they restricted intra-brand competition by unjustifiably discriminating in favor of a select few resellers.
This case presents a particular novelty in terms of the competition law assessment of platform bans. Such bans are not considered hardcore restrictions of competition under the EU case law in Coty44 and may therefore benefit from the safe harbor of the VBER. Yet, the AGCM in this case considered that the limitations on distribution at issue constituted restrictions of competition by object, given that – according to the authority – the relevant agreements had as their object to hinder the access to Amazon Marketplace of undertakings that were lawfully authorized to resell Apple’s products. The Italian NCA made this finding even though the resellers at issue were still allowed to sell on online platforms / marketplaces in general, except for Amazon.it. The AGCM also identified a cross-border element to the restriction at issue, as it found that the selection process discriminated based on the reseller’s country of establishment, in fact favoring resellers without significant export activities (thus, in effect, favoring Italian resellers). The cross-border restriction element may have accentuated the discriminatory nature of the restriction in the NCA’s view, thus leading to the finding of a “by-object” restriction. Finally, the Italian NCA also conducted a separate effects analysis and found that the online sales restrictions concerned amounted to restrictions by effect that could not be exempted. In any event, the parties are reportedly appealing the AGCM’s decision and it will be interesting to see what the Italian courts will have to say on these aspects of the NCA’s findings.
C. Takeaways: Revised Vertical Rules set to Provide some Clarity on Platform Sales Restrictions 
The Commission’s and the CMA’s revision of their respective rulebooks on vertical restraints is expected to provide much-needed clarity on previously grey areas. Key principles that have arisen from European competition authorities’ decisional practice as well case law are now set for crystallization into black-letter law (e.g. platform bans explicitly qualified as non-hardcore restrictions, inasmuch as they do not span into restrictions on the use of online search engines or price comparison tools, which could prevent the effective use of the internet for making sales).
Of course, the revised EU regulatory package on vertical restraints will not alleviate all of the ambiguities that existed under the previous regime (as the AGCM’s decision in Apple/Amazon attests). Therefore, competition authorities and courts in Europe will continue to be tasked with streamlining the interpretation and application of these rules. Having said this, with specific, targeted guidance on the books on all of the hallmark practices that have raised competition law concerns in e-commerce (e.g. marketplace restrictions, price comparison website restrictions, MFNs), the scramble of European competition authorities over the past decade to try to fit novel issues arising from the online reality into an increasingly outdated framework of analysis is hopefully nearing some conclusion.
 
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Beyond any policy and legal aspects / criticisms of the novel regulatory approaches to digital-specific antitrust in Europe, this piece has provided an overview of the current landscape in classic antitrust enforcement against tech companies’ practices in Europe. As may be deduced from this exposition, enforcement in Europe seems to be robust and rife with new investigations propping up across the region seemingly on a daily basis, by the Commission as well as the EU NCAs and the CMA. While one should not downplay the increasingly complex nature of antitrust enforcement in the digital sector, it is nevertheless a reality that cases dealing with novel questions may take a while to conclude, sparking the unavoidable criticisms regarding the risk of locking in anti-competitive effects until it is too late for any remedies to deliver their intended results. Nevertheless, some optimism may be in order: with classic theories of harm being tested and adapted for the digital economy, European competition authorities seem to be familiarizing themselves with the characteristics of the tech space, and enabling themselves to scrutinize more swiftly the commercial practices implemented in the digital sector.
These trends are intended to generate positive outcomes for consumers in the near future. Given the central role that digital services play in everyday life nowadays, underenforcement of competition law in the digital space is certainly a risk worth serious consideration. However, at the same time, tech companies are facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape in Europe; and notably, this may, sooner rather than later, affect companies beyond the small GAFAM circle. One important factor in this may be the Commission’s ability to impose certain DMA obligations to providers of core platform services which do not yet enjoy an entrenched and durable position in their operations, but may soon enjoy such a position.45 Additionally, in data-related cases, several NCAs have started relying on sectoral regulatory obligations as standards of conduct in abuse of dominance cases. In light of this ongoing trend, commentators have warned against the possibility that competition authorities or courts may transpose the obligations of the DMA to “dominant non-gatekeepers” through traditional abuse of dominance provisions. The rationale would be that, if data-related regulatory instruments, such as the GDPR, can be used as “benchmarks” for abuse of dominance assessments (see German Facebook case), the DMA could also serve as a similar benchmark for an abuse of dominance assessment by a dominant non-gatekeeper.46
In turn, this could lead to a chilling effect, dampening innovation due to a competition law framework that interferes excessively in digital companies’ business models: why innovate if equal access to the fruits of one’s labour would have to be provided to rivals? So, it is not beyond imagination that any near-term benefits for consumers may be offset by long-term welfare losses, due to missing out on efficiency- and welfare-enhancing practices in the tech space. This is so in particular given that a number of the DMA’s blacklisted practices, such as self-preferencing, do have an efficiency dimension. Indeed, it is hard not to marvel at the concept of the DMA itself, bearing a strong “per se prohibitions” mindset (without the possibility for justification) that is rather foreign in most European competition law regimes (and in fact, is entirely foreign – in principle – to abuse of dominance assessments).47
A lot may depend on whether, in their effort to safeguard consumers’ interests in the digital economy, competition authorities in Europe (including the Commission) overshoot by underestimating classic supply and demand forces. How all of this will play out remains to be seen. With the DMA still being fleshed out, one thing is for certain: no boredom in sight for the digital antitrust afficionados.

4 In terms of antitrust enforcement, the Commission has ongoing investigations or proceedings against all GAFAM companies on grounds that seem to reflect self-preferencing concerns, including of course the Google Shopping saga but also in the Amazon Marketplace (AT.40462), Amazon Buy Box (AT.40703), Facebook leveraging (AT.40484), and Apple – App Store Practices (music streaming) investigations. The Commission has also launched an investigation into allegations that Microsoft has been force-installing Teams in the Office suite and preventing its uninstallation (EU questions Microsoft rivals over Teams integration in Office, Reuters (8 October 2021), available at https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-questions-microsoft-rivals-over-teams-integration-office-2021-10-08/). In terms of sector inquiries, the Commission has found in its recently published final report on its sector inquiry into consumer IoT that practices potentially amounting to self-preferencing are present in this space. See Final Report – Sector inquiry into consumer Internet of Things, 20 January 2022, SWD(2022) 10 final.
5 Under the current draft of the “gatekeeper” definition, the term may apply to undertakings that (i) have a significant impact on the internal market, (ii) operate a core platform service which serves as an important gateway for business users to reach end users, and (iii) enjoy an entrenched and durable position in their operations (or can be expected to enjoy such a position in the future).  In respect of each of these conditions, the Commission has chosen to create presumptions of satisfaction on the basis of specific quantitative thresholds.

37 For instance, taking the view that online marketplaces like Amazon represent only one method of selling online, the Commission considers in the Draft Revised VGL that direct or indirect online marketplace bans should be block exempted irrespective of the distribution system in place and regardless of whether the contract product is considered a luxury product (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(a)). Similarly, setting quality standards for selling online and requiring that the buyer operates brick-and-mortar shops to be admitted in the supplier’s selective distribution system should also be block exempted (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(b)). Following the same line of reasoning, a supplier could validly require a buyer to sell at least a certain absolute amount of the contract goods or services offline (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(c)).

The European Commission is aiming to clinch a fast-tracked deal with EU lawmakers and countries to establish new rules that will help rein in the influence and power of the so-called ‘Tech Giants’ of Google, Amazon , Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Wednesday. 
Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the Digital Markets Act more than a year ago with a list of dos and don’ts for US tech giants, said there has been good progress in negotiations involving all EU member states, as well as representatives from industry organizations and the companies themselves. 
“We are now aiming to reach political agreement by the fourth trilogue by the end of March. If we manage that, that will be legislation with almost the speed of lightning,” she told a European Parliament hearing.
Talks are due to resume on March 24, giving EU lawmakers only a handful of days to talk out any remaining objections or adjustments. 
Issues that need to be ironed out include the list of obligations for online gatekeepers – companies that control data and access to their platforms – and the level of turnover that defines which companies will be covered by the DMA, people close to the matter said.

EU has invested a lot of efforts into creating a human-centric legislative framework for artificial intelligence, as part of its economy’s digital and green transitions. This piece aims to shed light on the main features and the evolution of the proposal for the EU AI Act, as well as critically assess some shortcomings that still need to be addressed. It also concentrates on the new regulatory mechanisms adopted by the proposed regulation as an answer for the dynamic nature of technologies and their effect on society. By concentrating on the regulatory sandboxes and standardization the column aims to explore them in the context of the AI Act and critically evaluate the pros and cons of these tools for the ultimate purpose of balancing innovation and regulation in a manner that fully and effectively protect EU fundamental rights and public interest.

I. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE AI ACT AND ITS EVOLUTION 
The EU’s ambition to regulate artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems has been clearly demonstrated in recent years. The first significant action in that direction was the establishment of the High-Level Expert Group on AI (“HLEG”) in 2018 which paved the way for the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to declare the planned adoption of an AI legal instrument as a top priority in her policy agenda.[2] In February 2020, the Commission published a White Paper on AI, presenting different policy options ...

394,"March 14, 2022","Toward a Non-Dispositive, Human-First Agenda for Public Sector AI","
The current era of artificial intelligence (“AI”) has engendered profound industrial transformation. Firms from social media to consumer finance are inextricably integrating AI into their core operations. Meanwhile, regulators and civil society grow increasingly wary of what they perceive as unaccountable algorithms deciding what media the public should see, what products they should be offered, and what contractual terms they deserve. And as governments begin to look toward AI to better serve citizens, such concerns translate readily — and often in intensified form — to the public sector. Governmental entities that focus on relentless automation, skilled workforce replacement, and metric optimization in their AI development agendas risk producing the same unaccountable outcomes as those already observed in the wild. But the public sector is not bound by the same imperatives driving private-sector AI development. Governmental entities have the option to adopt a non-dispositive, human-first AI agenda. This agenda is deliberate in scope but no less ambitious than those of private-sector AI pioneers. It recognizes the simultaneous limitations of standalone “black-box” AI and the incredible potential of AI technology to empower humans. It does not champion the deployment of closed-loop AI systems in dispositional contexts. But neither does it cabin AI’s role to mere toy problems. Rather, this agenda calls for the measured integration of AI capabilities into human-d...

395,"March 14, 2022","AI Ethics, Regulation & Firm Implications","
As the widespread application of artificial intelligence permeates an increasing number of businesses, ethical issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and transparency have gained increased attention, raising renewed calls for policy and regulatory changes to address the potential consequences of AI systems and products. In this article, we build on original research to outline distinct approaches to AI governance and regulation and discuss the implications for firms and their managers in terms of adopting AI and ethical practices going forward. We examine how manager perception of AI ethics increases with the potential of AI-related regulation but at the cost of AI diffusion. Such trade-offs are likely to be associated with industry specific characteristics, which holds implications for how new and intended AI regulations could affect varying industries differently. Overall, we recommend that businesses embrace new managerial standards and practices that detail AI liability under varying circumstances, even before it is regulatory prescribed. Stronger internal audits, as well as third-party examinations, would provide more information for managers, reduce managerial uncertainty, and aid the development of AI products and services that are subject to higher ethical as well as legal, and policy standards.

396,"March 10, 2022",TikTok Nears Data Deal With Oracle,"


TikTok is nearing a deal with Oracle to store its US users’ information and prevent access to TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deal represents an attempt by TikTok to address concerns raised by US national security panel over data integrity on the popular short video app, reported Reuters.
The agreement would come a year and a half after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China’s communist government.That order was not enforced after Joe Biden succeeded Donald Trump as US President last year, but CFIUS has continued to harbor concerns over data security at TikTok that ByteDance is now hoping to address, the sources said.
It is not clear whether CFIUS will find that TikTok’s partnership with Oracle will resolve the national security issues it has identified, the sources said. A spokesperson for the US Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
TikTok came under fire from the Donald Trump administration in 2020 after the then-president called for the app to be banned from all US app stores unless sold to a local company. TikTok had previously been in talks with both Oracle and Microsoft for such a deal.

397,"February 24, 2022",30 US Lawmakers Want EU To Change Digital Markets Act,"


A bipartisan group of 30 lawmakers sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to talk to EU leaders and persuade them to change the proposed Digital Markets Act (DMA), as in their view, it “unfairly” targets US tech companies.
According to CNBC, the group, led by Representatives Suzan DelBene and Darin LaHood, wrote in their letter that they “are greatly concerned that EU’s proposed approach to promoting competition among digital platforms unfairly targets American workers by deeming certain U.S. technology companies as ‘gatekeepers’ based on deliberately discriminatory and subjective thresholds.” 
Related: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – An Ex Ante Landmark
The DMA aims at tackling competition concerns with digital platforms. The proposed law establishes a list of activities that Big Tech companies must do or must refrain from doing, including self-preferencing of products in their own platforms, or opening up App stores. Similar laws have been introduced in the U.S. — the Open App Markets Act and the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — and both bills have passed the Senate Committees and are now on their way to the senate for a vote.  
The DMA was approved by the EU Parliament back in December, but due to the complexities of the EU legislative system, it still needs to be ratified by the 27 member states. This ratification process may still last for a few months; it is expected to be fully ratified by summer, but during this time there is still a possibility of introducing amendments to the text. Nonetheless, given the agreement between all the EU institutions and member states, it is unlikely that a last-minute proposal could succeed because it would mean that the text would be back to the EU Parliament to get a new vote and new approval.
The main issue raised by US lawmakers is that the DMA is targeting U.S. Big Tech companies in everything but name. “As European leaders have made clear, the DMA as currently drafted is driven not by concerns regarding appropriate market share, but by a desire to restrict American companies’ access in Europe in order to prop up European companies,” they wrote.
The DMA is not targeting only US companies, as it includes all the digital platforms that meet certain criteria in terms of revenue and users. However, given the presence of US companies in Europe and the smaller market share of other companies, the law will most likely affect Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple first. Additionally, other European companies such as Booking.com or Spotify are likely to fall under the scope of the DMA.
This letter comes the same day that the European Commission presented a new law, the Data Act, which may compel US companies to share more data with EU companies and consumers. The proposed law won´t limit the capacity of US firms to collect data from the web and from connected devices, but it will empower consumers by giving them the possibility to access and share their data with third parties much easier.

398,"February 22, 2022",EU Has Lost 3 Top Antitrust Investigators To Law Firms,"


According to a report from POLITICO, The European Commission is starting the next round of its intensifying face-off with Big Tech with a handicap.
Three top competition officials, who helped lead high-profile probes into Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have over the past year left to join law firms that act for the tech giants.
The timing could hardly be worse, as the regulator is about to get broad new powers and responsibilities to ramp up the crackdown on anticompetitive behavior by online platforms.
Vestager has three ongoing antitrust cases into Apple, two into Amazon, one into Facebook and one into Google. That number is likely to increase drastically when the Digital Markets Act (DMA) enters into force. The DMA, which will impose strict limits on the behavior of “gatekeeper” platforms, is in the final stages of negotiations.Related: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – an Ex Ante Landmark
But Brussels can no longer count on the 80 years of combined experience of Carles Esteva Mosso, Cecilio Madero Villarejo and Nicholas Banasevic. The three heavyweights have been key to the EU competition regime for the past two decades, reported POLITICO.Madero and Banasevic teamed up in the late 1990s on the landmark Microsoft case and later formed the driving force in three Google cases that ended with over €8 billion in fines for the search giant.
Esteva Mosso led the Commission’s competition review of mergers and acquisitions between 2014 and 2019, including Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 and Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.
While the cases they worked on are criticized for not having sufficiently restrained Big Tech’s dominance, they have first-hand experience in confronting these firms and the tactics of their lawyers.

US Bipartisan lawmakers are worried about how Apple runs its App Store and currently the tech giant is defending against legislation that would loosen its supremacy, The Wall Street Journal writes.
According to PYMNTS, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 20-2 this month on legislation that could erode fees Apple collects on digital app revenues. This all happened in spite of calls to senators and Apple’s warnings that this would be detrimental to privacy and security.
The bill is backed by a loose alliance of Apple’s rivals like Epic Games and Microsoft. It will offer a middle ground for lawmakers who want to curb big tech power but can’t reach a consensus for regulating social media.
The report says the Senate leaders’ focus on Apple marks a shift from the strategy employed previously by Congress, which had been focused on Amazon’s treatment of retailers, Google’s ad business control, and other such issues.
“For a long time, Apple floated above the fray in Washington,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co, adding that the company has now “been pulled down into the muck.”
The app store bill is just one front in the war Apple is waging against rivals challenging its control of the app economy — and access to the over one billion users of its devices.
Earlier this month, Apple was fined 5 million euros by Dutch antitrust regulators because of an order to open up app payments for dating services.

400,"February 21, 2022",Innovation: A Bridge to the New Brandeisians?,"

By Richard J. Gilbert* & A. Douglas Melamed**
 
The push to reform antitrust law by more aggressive enforcement strategies and perhaps new legislation has been dominated by self-professed “New Brandeisians,” who have a far-reaching populist agenda.  They have in many ways overshadowed more centrist reform advocates.  But there is one aspect of centrist reform proposals, an increased focus on innovation, that could partly bridge the gap between New Brandeisians and centrist reform advocates.
  
I. Introduction
The New Brandeisians have taken antitrust enforcement by storm with beachheads at the Federal Trade Commission (Lina Khan) and the White House (Tim Wu). The movement is both a reflection of broader populist sentiments and a backlash to perceived weaknesses in antitrust enforcement dominated by ideas often associated with the Chicago School.1 The New Brandeisians fault recent past antitrust enforcement for:

Reliance on the consumer welfare standard to evaluate conduct and mergers;2
Discounting concerns about monopoly’s caustic influences on politics and social justice;3
The use of price as a main determinant of consumer welfare to the exclusion of long run effects and social indicia such as inequality and worker welfare;4 and
Excessive faith in the ability of markets to correct the abuse of market power, leading to systemic underenforcement.5

The rise of the New Brandeisians follows the emergence of “post-Chicago” antitrust economics, which challenges many defendant-friendly presumptions of the Chicago School.6 These presumptions include: the one-monopoly rent theory, which falsely presumes that firms cannot increase their profits by using vertical restraints such as tying and bundling to extend their monopoly power into adjacent markets; the related presumption that vertical mergers are unlikely to harm consumers; and the beliefs that predatory pricing is unlikely to be a profitable strategy and that prices above short-run average cost are necessarily pro-competitive.
Post-Chicago economics also challenges the Chicago School’s faith in the ability of markets to correct abuses of market power.7 In doing so, it takes aim at the error-cost approach to antitrust enforcement that favors forbearance versus intervention for conduct whose anticompetitive effects cannot be established with a high degree of certainty. In this respect, supporters of the Post-Chicago School of antitrust enforcement share common ground with the New Brandeisians.
Members of the New Brandeis movement diverge from adherents of the Post-Chicago School in important respects. The Post-Chicago School does not condemn monopoly power per se, but only monopoly power that is acquired or maintained by anticompetitive means. The New Brandeisians believe that antitrust enforcement should condemn economic power even if it is not accompanied by conduct that raises prices or reduces output or innovation, because they view economic power and inequality as an existential threat to democracy and social justice. Another distinction is the Post-Chicago School’s support for the consumer welfare standard. The New Brandeisians argue that the U.S. antitrust laws had their origins in broader concerns about economic power and inequality, and do not specify the promotion of consumer welfare or any kind of solely economic welfare as their objective.8
The criticism that the consumer welfare standard addresses solely short-run effects on prices paid by consumers is mistaken. The consumer welfare standard is about promoting economic welfare by prohibiting anticompetitive conduct or mergers that harm the competitive process by diminishing the competitive constraints imposed by rivals.9 It is applicable to conduct and mergers that increase market power in that way and that therefore harm or are likely to harm trading partners.10 The trading partners can be intermediaries that might or might not pass harms onto final consumers, and they can be suppliers that are concerned about monopsony power of their customers. Examples include conduct by producers of television programming that harms distributors of such programming and a merger of hospitals that suppresses wages paid for nurses. And the harm contemplated by the standard is not limited to short-term price effects but can include effects on innovation and product quality.
The New Brandeisians propose “harm to the competitive process” as an alternative to the consumer welfare standard.11 But the consumer welfare standard itself, as implemented, addresses harm to the competitive process and defines what that harm entails. The New Brandeisians do not define what they mean by “harm to the competitive process” other than to assert that it means something more than the harm defined by the consumer welfare standard. Under the consumer welfare standard, conduct should be challenged only if it harms the competitive process by diminishing the competitive efficacy of rivals and in that way creates or increases market power of one or more firms. In other words, under the consumer welfare standard, harm to the competitive process means the creation, increase, or maintenance of market power. We share the view of most antitrust scholars that this focus has allowed the consumer welfare standard to serve a useful role in antitrust enforcement.12 To replace consumer welfare with an ill-defined standard such as “protection of the competitive process” risks enforcement decisions that are arbitrary and unpredictable and that benefit neither consumers nor the economy more generally.13
Where we find ourselves on the same page as the New Brandeisians is the belief that antitrust enforcement can productively be somewhat more aggressive than it has been in recent years. The New Brandeisians say that antitrust has been too lax because it is too focused on economics and overlooks ills from economic power that include economic inequality and abuse of political power. We agree that antitrust has been too lax, but we would not abandon the exclusive focus on economic welfare; instead, we would bring antitrust’s focus on economic welfare in line with current economic learning. That includes a less permissive approach to mergers and conduct by dominant firms that impairs the ability of rivals to compete.14
 
II. Antitrust and Innovation
One important aspect of current economic learning that has had little impact on antitrust doctrine and judicial decisions concerns the effect of market power on innovation. Antitrust enforcement can prudently be made materially more aggressive by focusing explicitly on innovation. The focus on innovation can take the law partway toward the goals of the New Brandeis movement without abandoning the consumer welfare standard.
Innovation is hugely important for economic welfare, and it has long been appreciated that innovation effects are within the ambit of antitrust enforcement.15 The Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission often allege innovation harms from mergers,16 and they have also done so for single firm conduct.17 Nonetheless, innovation effects rarely determine the outcomes of merger or monopolization challenges. There appear to be two reasons for the limited influence of innovation concerns in antitrust enforcement.
The first is the legacy of Joseph Schumpeter, whose writings are often cited for the proposition  that monopoly power can promote innovation by providing a more stable platform for investment and increasing the profits from discoveries. More recent economic learning challenges this notion. Competition promotes innovation for several reasons. First, having more firms engaged in research and development (R&D) typically makes it more likely that at least one firm will develop a successful innovation.18 Second, in a more competitive market firms have greater incentives to profit from innovations that take sales from their rivals. Third, firms with monopoly power have a disincentive to invest to create innovations that would cannibalize profits from their existing products. This is the replacement effect first described by Kenneth Arrow:19 When an innovation is expected to be commercialized in a market for an existing product of the potential innovator, the prospect that the innovation would cause the firms to lose profits on the existing product suppresses the firm’s incentive to innovate.
In addition to purely economic reasons why competition promotes innovation, there are organizational and behavioral explanations to favor competition over monopoly for innovation. Established firms develop organizational structures that are specialized to deliver their existing products; such structures create switching costs for these firms to adapt to new products.20 Moreover, established firms respond to customer preferences for their existing products and sometimes discount the potential return from entirely new products.21 For these reasons, it is not surprising that new entrants are the source of many disruptive innovations. Examples include electric vehicles, the smartphone, digital photography, ride-hailing services, mapping, photolithography, and mRNA vaccines.
A second explanation for the limited influence of innovation concerns in antitrust enforcement is the belief that proving an antitrust violation requires proving harm to specific trading partners from the suppression or delay of innovation. But this explanation is also flawed. Proving a violation of the antitrust laws does not require identifying the specific consumers or trading partners that might be harmed by monopoly conduct or an estimate of the magnitude of harm.  More important, it does not even require identifying the particular way in which trading partners will be harmed. Instead, antitrust law is based on the fact that conduct that leads to the acquisition or maintenance of market power can be presumed to harm trading partners unless that conduct provides an offsetting efficiency benefit.22 The presumption that increased seller market power results in higher prices or lower quality, and increased buyer market power results in lower prices paid to suppliers, is supported by ample economic evidence.
While the analysis is more difficult, economic evidence as a whole also supports a presumption that monopoly power suppresses innovation, particularly for innovations that are expected to be monetized in markets in which the innovator has existing products that would be put at risk by the innovation. Moreover, recent evidence also shows that mergers can be presumed under some circumstances to suppress innovation incentives in industries characterized by substantial investment in R&D and innovation, which we call “high-technology industries.” The application  of these presumptions in individual cases can be challenged with contrary evidence.
Defendants often cite innovation as a defense to the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power that might otherwise violate the antitrust laws. Profits that a firm can earn from a new technology provide the economic incentive to innovate and support a Schumpeterian argument that successful innovators should be permitted to exploit their innovations with few constraints imposed by antitrust enforcement. Innovation, however, is a continuous process. Innovations build on prior innovations, and conduct by a monopolist that discourages rivalry discourages the incentive and ability for other firms to make new innovations.23 While monopoly power can promote innovation in some circumstances, it is more often antithetical to innovation, and particularly for the disruptive innovations that can transform industries and society.
Consequently, innovation concerns should have a more prominent role in antitrust enforcement for the modern economy. Before describing this role in more detail, it is important to emphasize that the consumer welfare standard is broad enough to encompass non-price effects such as product quality and innovation. The consumer welfare standard is applicable to all the margins along which firms may compete, including product quality and innovation.24 What is necessary to apply the consumer welfare standard to innovation is a basis for concluding that the creation or maintenance of market power is likely to reduce innovation, similar to the causal relationship between creation or maintenance of market power and price effects.25 The connection with innovation effects has been overlooked for most of the history of the antitrust laws because the connection has not been well-appreciated. Recent scholarship has demonstrated these causal effects.
 
III. Section 2 Enforcement for Innovation
Unlike the New Brandeisians, we believe that penalizing monopolies that are a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident would chill entrepreneurship and, in some cases, prevent the emergence of efficient industry structures. Although we acknowledge concerns expressed by the New Brandeisians about the corrosive influence of economic power for democracy and social justice, these concerns are better addressed with policies targeted to the institutions that enable them, such as limitations on permitted lobbying activities, more progressive taxation, better educational opportunities, and worker protections.
We do, however, believe that antitrust enforcement can properly be more aggressive with respect to market power that is acquired or maintained by anticompetitive means. One approach is to pay more attention to innovation effects in enforcement decisions for high-technology industries.
Consider the following example, based on a detailed analysis by Ilya Segal & Michael Whinston.26 A firm has a monopoly for a type of switch used to route internet traffic, for which there is no close substitute. The firm has exclusive dealing contracts with a significant fraction of the wholesalers that sell switches to installers. The firm has argued that the exclusivity will create certain distribution efficiencies that will result in lower prices or at least make higher prices in the near future unlikely. Although the contracts are potentially anticompetitive, they survive a rule of reason analysis focused solely on short-run price effects. How might the result change if a court also considered innovation effects?
The firm’s exclusive dealing contracts would reduce the profit that a competing innovator could earn, relative to a market with no exclusive dealing. This would reduce the incentive for new entrants to innovate in the market for switches, without regard to the number of potential innovators. Moreover, if the contracts increase the profits that the incumbent earns from its existing products, they will reduce even the incumbent’s incentive to innovate due to the replacement effect.27 The net effect is a significant reduction in innovation incentives. The likely harm from reduced innovation incentives can support a conclusion that the incumbent’s exclusive dealing arrangements are anticompetitive, even if they would escape antitrust liability if the court focused solely on short-term effects. The presumption that the contracts will harm innovation could be rebutted if the defendant can demonstrate that the exclusive contracts will increase the defendant’s incentive to innovate by, for example, increasing appropriability of benefits from investments in R&D.
This is but one example. More generally, evidence supports the following presumptions:
. . . [P]roof that the conduct at issue either creates or maintains the defendant’s monopoly power in the R&D market and does not reduce its share or market power in the [related or “coincident”] product market, or that the conduct creates or maintains the defendant’s monopoly power in the product market when it has monopoly power in the R&D market, should be sufficient to establish a rebuttable presumption of harm to innovation. A weaker presumption of reduced innovation can be based on proof that the conduct at issue creates or maintains the defendant’s monopoly power in the product market even if the defendant does not have monopoly power in the R&D market. . . . For non-coincident market innovation [i.e., where the innovator does not have profits at risk in the related product market], a rebuttable presumption of harm to competition would require evidence of the creation or maintenance of monopoly power in an R&D market from alleged anticompetitive conduct. . . .28
 
IV. Merger Enforcement for Innovation
Since the turn of the century, antitrust authorities have added harms to innovation to their arsenal of anticompetitive allegations when they challenge mergers in high-technology industries. However, over the same period, there has been no demonstrable increase in merger enforcement. If anything, agencies have been reluctant to challenge mergers in rapidly evolving industries. The Federal Trade Commission did not challenge Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram29 and conditioned its decision not to challenge Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp only on a commitment to maintain WhatsApp’s privacy policies.30 The European Commission reviewed, but did not oppose, Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp because it concluded that WhatsApp was not a close competitor of Facebook in a market for social networking services and had no plans to compete with Facebook absent the merger.31
The question we address is whether analysis of innovation effects would support more stringent enforcement for mergers in high-technology markets. One school of thought answers this question solidly in the affirmative. Their argument is that a merger internalizes to both merging parties the costs that one of the parties would incur as a result of innovation by the other and would therefore reduce the incentives for either party to invest in R&D, just as mergers of firms that sell differentiated products internalize the costs that would result if one of the merging parties reduced price and thus create economic pressure for higher prices.32
The analogy between “upward pricing pressure” and “downward innovation pressure” from a merger fails under some circumstances. A merger can increase innovation incentives if it enables each party to benefit from innovations made by the other or if it expands demand for products by which the merging parties’ would monetize their innovations.  And a merger can increase the ability of the merging parties to innovate if it accelerates the discovery of a new product or production process by, for example, combining complementary R&D assets.33
Thus, it is not possible to sign the effects of every merger on innovation incentives. It is likely, however, that a merger reduces innovation incentives if: (i) only a few firms compete to make an innovation; (ii) at least one of the merging firms earns profits from selling an existing product that would be jeopardized by innovation; and (iii) technological spillovers, or other complementarities that enable the merging parties to obtain benefits that they could not obtain as standalone entities, are not large.
With regard to the first condition, if there are few firms engaged in relevant R&D, the adverse effect on the incentive to innovate from the merging parties’ internalization of business stealing is likely larger than any appropriation benefit from higher prices or increased output that would cause consolidation to increase innovation incentives. With regard to the second condition, a merger would suppress incentives to innovate by increasing the profits at risk from the innovation if the merging parties supply existing products that are substitutes for each other and the innovation would jeopardize profits from both products. A merger would also suppress the merging parties’ incentives to innovate compared to their pre-merger incentives even if only one firm supplies a product at risk from innovation. Although the merger would not increase the profit at risk in this case, the replacement effect would suppress both parties’ post-merger innovation incentives, whereas pre-merger only one party would experience a replacement effect.
These conditions, when satisfied for mergers that do not have significant benefits from technological spillovers or complementarities, support antitrust intervention even when static price or quality effects cannot be confidently predicted and therefore provide an additional basis for intervention in otherwise close cases.34
The above discussion relates to horizontal mergers. What about vertical mergers in high-technology industries? The short answer is that innovation effects are more complicated and would require analysis of potentially offsetting incentives. Suppose, for example, that most batteries for electric vehicles require a chemical that is supplied by a monopolist. The chemical monopolist proposes to merge with a battery manufacturer. The vertical merger might have efficiency justifications such as the elimination of double marginalization for the essential chemical, which would result in lower prices charged by the battery manufacturer. What about innovation effects? The merged company would have an incentive to raise the cost of its rival battery manufacturers by charging a price for the chemical that is higher than the profit-maximizing price for a standalone chemical monopolist. The higher price would lower the profits for battery innovations that require the chemical and therefore lower the incentive for non-integrated firms to invest in R&D for innovations that require the chemical. This suppression of innovation might be partially offset by an increased incentive for non-integrated firms to invest in R&D for batteries that do not require the monopolized chemical. Furthermore, the elimination of double marginalization can increase the merged firm’s profit from — and therefore incentive to invest in — technologies that employ the chemical. However, vertical integration also would reduce the merged firm’s incentive to invest in a technology that does not require the monopolized chemical by increasing the firm’s profits from its existing batteries and therefore increasing the replacement effect.
 
V. Conclusions
Members of the New Brandeis movement believe that antitrust enforcement has let us down because it focuses on consumer welfare and not broader societal ills from monopoly. We believe that the consumer welfare standard — which does not focus solely on short-term price effects — has been a useful guidepost for antitrust enforcement, and we oppose efforts to abandon it. Where we agree with the New Brandeisians is that antitrust enforcement has been too weak, largely because many courts appear to have accepted the idea that the costs of too-aggressive enforcement are greater than the costs of too-weak enforcement. Encouraging courts to include innovation concerns in their reviews of unilateral conduct and mergers in high-technology industries could alter this calculus in favor of more aggressive antitrust enforcement. In this respect it is a movement toward the New Brandeisians, although not a bridge that connects their movement to the views of those who support more traditional, economically-focused antitrust enforcement. It might be an especially important movement toward the New Brandeisians because small or new entities are often the source of disruptive innovation in high-technology industries, and innovation-focused antitrust enforcement would be particularly sensitive to conduct or mergers that limit competition from these entities.

The US Federal Trade Commission may look at pursuing “creative approaches” to the antitrust review, which could lead to a longer timeline, according to a CTFN report, which cited a source. Take-Two is said to be confident that it’s on path to get all necessary regulatory approvals.
The Zynga deal seemed to usher in a spate of deals in the video game sector including Microsoft’s planned almost $70B purchase of Activision and Sony’s deal to acquire ‘Halo’/’Destiny’ developer Bungie in $3.6B deal.
Take-Two management is said to believe that a review might be easier than others in the gaming industry since its focused on the crowded mobile gaming space rather than console games or virtual reality, according to the CTFN report.

Landmark EU rules aimed at curbing the power of US tech giants could be agreed between lawmakers and EU countries as soon as April, a key lawmaker leading the talks said on Tuesday.
Known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the rules proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager just over a year ago set out a list of dos and don’ts for online gatekeepers, companies that control data and access to their platforms, reinforced by fines of up to 10% of global turnover.

403,"February 10, 2022",Economic Issues in Assessing Potential and Nascent Competition,"
Potential and nascent competition have seen renewed interest from academics, antitrust practitioners, and United States enforcement agencies in recent years. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) focused on issues of potential competition during its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century in 2018, as did the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) during its 2020 Competition Meetings. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and FTC’s recent request for information on merger enforcement included questions related to potential and nascent competition. Importantly, both potential competition and nascent competition describe competition that does not currently exist. The DOJ and the FTC’s concerns about potential or nascent competition arise because firms’ strategies (e.g., pricing or investment decisions) are informed by their expectations about competition in the future. During the last 25 years, the FTC consistently challenged transactions and agreements over concerns related to the elimination of future competition. Given the increased scrutiny on potential or nascent competition in antitrust matters, it is critical to understand the economic rationale that underpins the but-for world when evaluating such competition. In this article, the authors highlight some of these challenges, describe some illustrative examples, and discuss how these challenges may vary across dif...

404,"February 10, 2022",Potential Competition Mergers: Lessons from Outside the Box,"
The puzzle of potential competition mergers is not theoretical but empirical — verifying that the firm not in the market is a likely significant competitor and that very few others are.  It may help to look at potential competition in other antitrust contexts.  From collusion, “reverse payment” pharmaceutical cases work only because regulation and legislation identify a unique potential generic competitor.  From abuse of dominance, the U.S. Microsoft case suggests low requirements for establishing that Netscape was a potential competitor to Windows, but in practice the case became equivalent in evidence and outcome to one about excluding actual competitors in browsers.  We conclude by looking at the relevance of empirical methods for assessing competitive risk in mergers, shifting the burden of proof, adding objectives beside “consumer welfare,” and, perhaps most important, focusing on how U.S. merger law specifies illegality when competition “may,” not “will,” be substantially reduced.

By Tim Brennan[1]
 
In principle, potential competition mergers are not puzzling. Understanding how a merger between an ongoing firm and a supplier not yet in the market could reduce competition in the future is neither difficult nor requiring the latest advances in industrial organization theory or even Chicago School economics. Courts have recognized a potential competition doctrine going back to at least 1964.[2]

405,"February 10, 2022",Making the Potential Competition Doctrine Great Again,"
Antitrust enforcement efforts against “big-tech” have been hobbled by the destruction of the “potential competition doctrine.” This post describes how the Supreme Court made the doctrine ineffective after creating the doctrine.  It then describes how the antitrust enforcement agencies handcuffed themselves further in the development of the doctrine through their merger guidelines. As currently formulated, the potential competition doctrine makes merger enforcement by tech companies impotent. The paper uses Facebook’s Instagram acquisition as an example. It then offers a proposal on how to fix the doctrine to render potential competition a meaningful tool in antitrust enforcement.

I. INTRODUCTION
Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook (Meta), and Microsoft (“Big Tech”) dominate the American technology sector.[2] All of these companies exercise considerable market power through various strategic practices. A growing chorus of commentators have argued that Big Tech’s dominance has been advanced and maintained by hundreds of acquisitions of smaller start-up firms, many below the Hart-Scott-Rodino thresholds.[3] Some of these firms, had they remained independent, might have quickly scaled, or entered into alliances, and challenged the Big Tech firms.[4] To prevent this from occurring, Big Tech stopped these potential competitors in the cradle by establishing “kill zones” where the potential challengers are ei...

406,"February 10, 2022",Discriminatory Antitrust in the Realm of Potential and Nascent Competition,"
One of the most important topics in antitrust is how to analyze potential and nascent acquisitions by the largest digital platforms. Notably, there have been calls to implement “discriminatory antitrust” policies where one set of rules applies to big tech while another set of rules applies to everyone else. However, less attention seems to be paid to the actual empirical evidence. To that end, this article reviews a recent FTC report on big tech acquisitions and finds little to raise alarms. Second, the article examines several recent acquisitions by Spotify, an important technology company that sits outside of the “big tech” classification. If Spotify’s recent series of acquisitions can reasonably be considered procompetitive, then why is the same not true (or even possible) for Apple and Amazon within the same product space? Finally, the article summarizes the findings of several recent studies that examined a series of big tech acquisitions. Taken as a whole, these studies indicate insufficient evidence to conclude a systematic concern that large digital technology companies are engaging in anticompetitive acquisitions of potential and nascent competitors.

407,"February 10, 2022",Potential Competition as Process and Structure,"
Before the development of formal price theory in the early twentieth century, which included the invention of the theory of “perfect” competition, economists held an understanding of competition as active striving, leading to economic growth rather than to “optimality” in any static sense.  In the twentieth century, Joseph Schumpeter would be a lonely voice reiterating and amplifying the conception of competition as a dynamic process.  If competition is active and dynamic, the important form of competition is potential competition, often from sources we cannot easily foresee.  If competition is active and dynamic, the market structure we observe today, or even the market structure we imagine will prevail in the future, is a poor guide to antitrust policy.  We should focus instead on impediments, especially legal impediments, to entry, experiment, and contract.  In this light, recent proposals to impose on Internet platforms “structural separations” defined in terms of existing technological boundaries are likely to restrict not enhance potential competition – just as such separations did in the twentieth century.  Moreover, proposals to restrict platforms from diversifying, including through acquisition, are likely to mute the powerful potential competition that the large platforms represent to each other.

The Metaverse, voice assistants, smart automated vehicles, wearables, there are a number of visions of the future, but more important than which, if any, of these comes to pass, is what these different visions of the future have in common. Which is the understanding that controlling what is, in-effect, the next-generation operating system, will deliver an incredibly powerful gatekeeper role that will allow the extraction of huge rents. There is particular scope for harm to potential competition from self-preferencing by these gatekeepers. This short paper sets out the exclusionary concerns and distinguishes those from exploitative concerns that I argue may nevertheless distort and restrict competition by creating a hold-up problem. I explore how these concerns might apply in the Metaverse and other emerging technologies, and argue that applying the type of self-preferencing and interoperability rules that are currently under consideration to these emerging markets will protect potential competition, provide helpful certainty for investors, and help to build an innovative but more decentralized next generation of technologies.

Cloud services providers such as Amazon and Microsoft and other data processing service providers must set up safeguards against illegal data transfers to non-EU governments, according to the European Commission’s Data Act to be published this month.
The proposed rule, seen by Reuters, sets out rights and obligations on the use of EU data such as smart machinery and consumer goods, and is part of a raft of legislations aimed at reining in US tech giants and helping the bloc meet its green and digital objectives.
EU concerns about data transfers have been growing ever since former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 of mass US surveillance.
Europe’s top court in 2020 scrapped a transatlantic data transfer deal known as the Privacy Shield and relied on by thousands of companies for services ranging from cloud infrastructure to payroll and finance because of similar concerns.

The United Kingdom’s competition watchdog has issued a warning to UK challenger bank Monzo over a breach of retail banking regulations under the Retail Banking Market Investigation Order 2017, reported PYMNTS.
In a Monday, January 31 letter, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) wrote the neobank didn’t honor a requirement of the order because it failed to publish the monthly minimum charge (MMC) for personal current accounts in its Fee Information document. The breach occurred during a two-year period, from October 25, 2018, to November 19, 2021.
According to the CMA, the measure is a key element of reforms made following the Market Investigation and is “designed to make it easier for consumers to be aware of the charges they may be liable to pay and compare this information easily against other [personal current account (PCA)] providers.”
By not properly communicating that information, the CMA stated it is “concerned” that the bank’s PCA customers may have missed the MMC — currently £15.50 (about US$21) — “since it was not displayed each time information on Monzo Bank’s fees and charges for exceeding a pre-agreed credit limit was disclosed.”
The regulator added, “The CMA is also concerned that Monzo Bank’s Internal Audit Report failed to identify that Monzo Bank’s Fee Information document was non-compliant with the order.”
Colin Garland, director of Remedies, Business and Financial Analysis at the CMA, who signed the letter, noted that Monzo Bank has since taken steps to end the breach and to comply the order by updating its fee information in November and strengthening “its product governance to improve awareness of all regulatory obligations.”
The challenger bank had also ensured that terms and conditions, including the Fee Information document, were changed to align with Monzo Bank’s full governance process while expanding the size of its risk management and compliance teams.
“Given the action already being taken by Monzo Bank, the CMA does not consider it appropriate to take further formal enforcement action in relation to this breach at present,” Garland wrote in the letter on behalf of the CMA, adding that it will monitor the bank’s future compliance “closely” moving forward.

In recent years, digital platforms like Facebook, Apple iOS and the Amazon Marketplace have grown so big that they have attracted a lot of scrutiny by regulators in regards to their market power. The recent European Digital Markets Act focuses exactly on the market power of these digital platforms by defining a set of criteria for qualifying such platforms as so-called “gatekeepers.” For some analysts and commentators such gatekeeping is reminiscent of the gatekeeping exercised by more traditional utility infrastructures and that, we should, therefore apply similar policies to regulate digital platforms. In this short article, I will discuss where earlier regulation applies to, but also where it becomes highly problematic for, digital platforms. I will conclude with some recommendations going forward.

I. INTRODUCTION
Platforms are based on open innovation and the realization that no internal R&D can ever match innovation that happens outside a firm’s boundaries. Physical product platforms such as airplanes, cars and computer hardware have been around for many decades, enabling different complementors and their supply chains to contribute components and collectively develop stronger value propositions across broader ecosystems. By developing products on a platform (e.g. the Windows-Intel platform), complementors benefit from innovation spillovers, economies of scale and scope while also mitigating some of the risks of innovating...

In this article, we bring the discussion of potential interconnection regulation for digital platforms. By reviewing the lessons from the U.S. telecommunication industry and the distinctive features of digital platforms, the article explores the new challenges of interconnection regulation for digital platforms. With varying degrees of network effects across platform types and market segments and different levels of interconnection preferred by platforms and consumers, a single threshold of regulatory intervention may not serve the purpose of improving consumer welfare and economic efficiency. Given the more innovative business nature and dynamic competition faced by digital platforms, the costs on innovation incentives and consumers’ long-term well-being should be given full consideration when deciding whether and how to establish an interconnection regulation regime for digital platforms.

The rapid growth in digital platforms and information technology are greatly affecting how consumers discover and purchase products, making online markets the most attractive advertising media for firms. The business model of most digital platforms where online ad is sold is that of a two-sided market, where one group has preferences regarding the number of users in the other group. This positive cross-side network effect endows dominant platforms with huge comparative advantages and this “winner takes all” tendency raises antitrust concerns.

415,"January 25, 2022",Defining the Market & Assessing Competition Dynamics in the Digital Platform Industry,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Defining the Market & Assessing Competition Dynamics in the Digital Platform Industry. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Ki Jong LEE:
Hello, I am Professor Ki Jong Lee of Sookmyung Women’s University. My heartfelt thanks to Competition Policy International for inviting me to today’s session, which I view is rather timely and important.
Today’s topic is an in-depth analysis of market definitions and competitive dynamics in the digital platform industry. As you are all well aware, most digital platforms have a history of expanding their businesses into multiple markets. This has to do with the fact that once a digital platform secures its customer base or data in one market, it can enter another market easily by utilizing such existing customer bases or data. This is a pro-competitive aspect because it accelerates the platform’s entry to the market. Of course, there are anti-competitive sides, too. In particular, when the platforms are vertically-related, it is said that this could lead to anti-competition. And a platform, upon entering multiple markets, can provide a series of products with enhanced complementarities; in other words, a product ecosystem. This product ecosystem increases efficiency and improves consumer experience. This is also a pro-competitive aspect.
On the other hand, if a platform, while providing its product ecosystem, also plays a gatekeeper role, there could be concern regarding anti-competitive actions. Due to this duality of platforms, we must undoubtedly pursue a balanced approach. However, there is an obstacle to this endeavor. Just as I said, the actions of a platform affect not only a single market, but also multiple ones. However, the methodology to analyze such a cross-market effect has yet to be sufficiently developed. It is because the traditional methodology focuses only on the inside of a relevant market.
Therefore, personally, I have been suggesting a new methodology, which is that if one market affects another relevant market, such a market should be defined as a secondary relevant market. In that way, a court will be obliged to look into the interactions between the two markets, and the parties will be able to freely prove both pro-competitive and anti-competitive elements that exist in this secondary relevant market.
However, today, I will not go into more details about my suggestion. My suggestion is simply a stepping stone to enter today’s discussion. Today’s program has been devised to ask two questions of the best experts in their respective fields.
Firstly, what kinds of challenges has the advent of digital platforms brought to the traditional competition analysis methodology?
Secondly, how can we cope with these challenges?
In order to answer these questions, CPI has assembled a distinguished group of panelists.
Let me introduce today’s speakers. First, Professor Dae-Sik Hong of Sogang Law School. Prof. Hong is the director of the ICT Law and Economy Institute, Sogang University, with many research projects involving the digital platform industry under his belt.
Next, Prof. Sang-Seung Yi of Department of Economics, Seoul National University. Prof. Yi has published numerous papers on competition analysis in competition law. He has also offered his expert opinions in numerous classic cases concerning competition law.
Thirdly, Professor Hak-Soo Ko of Seoul National University School of Law. Prof. Ko specializes in Law and Economics, data privacy, and artificial intelligence law while providing expert advice to the Korean government and many public institutions.
Last but not least, President and CEO Bruce Gustafson of the Developers Alliance. President Gustafson has been the leading advocate for the global developer workforce and the companies that depend on them. He is also the founder of the Loquitur Group, a consulting firm.
Today’s session will be largely divided into three parts. The first part is an overview of overall issues.
First of all, I will ask each speaker to take about 5 minutes to explain what kind of challenges these digital platforms impose on the traditional competition analysis approaches. Then, the second part will be about discussing market definitions among individual issues.
And in the third part we’ll be discussing how to analyze the competitive dynamics in the digital platform industry.
Now we’ll begin the first part. As you will have time to talk about specific issues later, in this first part, please give us an overall picture of what’s going on.
On my screen, since Prof. Dae-Sik Hong is positioned farthest on the left, I’d like to ask Prof. Hong first. What kind of challenges do you think the digital platform industry poses to traditional competition analysis?


Dae-Sik HONG:
Hello, I am Prof. Dae-Sik Hong of Sogang University. Considering many panelists here are native Korean speakers and as I am not so fluent in English yet, please allow me to proceed in Korean. I ask for the other panelists’ and Mr. Gustafson’s understanding. If any meaning gets a bit lost during interpreting, I will make up for it later on. Thank you for the opportunity.
As I understand that the overview should conclude within 5 minutes, I will try to be succinct. Later on, I will be discussing specific issues with this case that was sanctioned by the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Prior to that, I would like to point out that because the KFTC holds an important position on the world map of competition law implementation and handles many important cases, the commission faces the same, common challenges that other countries’ authorities struggle with.
Since South Korea’s fair trade law has differences as well as similarities as compared to such laws of the U.S. or Europe, problem solutions cannot be identical, either. Having said that, for now, I will address how regulations are enforced concerning the abuse of market dominance. EU has already enforced its regulations against Google. I understand that even an interim judgment has been made and regulations are being enforced against very large BigTech companies in another digital economy.
The KFTC also has been enforcing its regulations in a similar manner, albeit slightly lagging behind. However, Korea’s market situation is a little different from those of the U.S. and Europe. For example, there is the Google Shopping case, the first one among all Google cases, which KFTC failed to sanction. It was because Google is not number one in South Korea’s search market when it comes to the market share, the most significant indicator. Therefore, following this logic, South Korean authority targeted Naver, the country’s leading search engine.
What these cases tell us is this; we do advocate changes in competition law analyses based on certain features of the digital economy and we are keenly aware that there are issues. Still, from the enforcement authority’s viewpoint, their tendency is to conduct regulatory enforcement in the same old, path-dependent manner instead of developing a new framework or new methods of proof.
That’s what I want to say.
Such an attitude is also detected in EU’s Google cases. Let’s take a look at the current cases that KFTC is handling. Throughout their processes and in their written resolutions, it is clear that KFTC well understands the characteristics of the digital economy and digital platforms. However, although analyzing previous markets and their characteristics is laudable, I doubt if they have become truly progressive in such areas as analysis tools, analysis results, used indices or proofs, and the degree of verification.
Consequentially, aren’t results derived in the same way as we have practiced in the other economy, i.e. the traditional one, the non-platform economy? KFTC acknowledges there are hidden obstacles against deriving such results. For example, as I will tell you later, there are difficulties in figuring out relevant markets, identifying market dominance positions, and evaluating agreements among competitors. In order to overcome such difficulties, KFTC asserts that they need to apply new methods as follows; defining markets more narrowly; or rather dismissing counter-evidence; or, for example, highly valuing the interaction or correlation between the two sides of a given platform market. However, in reality, these methods are not considered.
Also, as for evaluating agreements among competitors, results of such restriction may not be visible. In such instances, KFTC’s analyses would either state that potential results are sufficient or overemphasize yet-to-be-realized threats. All these might be inevitable choices because competition authorities find it difficult to reach a proper conclusion by inserting the existing frameworks into the platform economy. Notwithstanding, I believe that the authority, being on the forefront of regulatory enforcement, should do more research and develop their analysis tools in order to operate within a persuasive regulation framework that everyone accepts.
Yes, let me finish my first part here. Thank you.

LEE:
Thank you. It seems that Prof. Hong is quite interested in Google Android cases. He has compared the Android cases of Europe with those of South Korea, citing the differences in market positions of Android between Europe and Korea; such differences also need to be considered; though the Korea Fair Trade Commission has in-depth understanding of the digital industry, it is desirable for KFTC to develop a new methodology more proactively.
Next speaker visible on my screen is President Bruce Gustafson. President Gustafson, please answer the same question.


Bruce GUSTAFSON:
Thank you very much, Professor Lee. I’m a little outclassed by the panel here today. Three professors, it’s very intimidating. I am more horizontally integrated. My background is in engineering, business and law, as opposed to sort of vertically into the legal profession.
The Android case is very interesting. I should sort of start my remarks by saying that the Developers Alliance was an intervener in the European courts on behalf of Google in that case and one of our primary commentaries was about characterizing the market and how the European Commission had kind of, we believe, made errors in that space.
But I’m going to talk about four items today. So first off, I’m going to talk a little about digital platforms, which I think have real world analogies, but are different from ecosystems, and ecosystems is really where I think we need to focus.
Number two, those differences will impact competition analysis.
Number three, ecosystems, I think, compete as ecosystems as well as market participants in many cases. I think that’s significant.
And then number four, I think there are policy implications for competition law reform, based on what we have learned so far. My personal viewpoint, I guess, is based on my participation in the industry, alongside those of my members. We have been involved in litigation and I certainly talk to policy makers all the time on how policy can evolve to anticipate the digital market, and it’s sort of different dynamics versus the real world. And so my focus has been, are the current laws adequate? How should they change? And, are some of the options being contemplated by policy makers appropriate, or are they missing some of the nuance?
So first off, platforms versus ecosystems. I think one way to look at digital platforms, facilitating transactions between multiple markets, I think there are some real world analogs that we can kind of talk to. Certainly, you can look at the Amex case and others to be able to see how those markets are characterized.
An ecosystem, rather than just connecting multiple markets, to my mind, creates a stable market by facilitating one way transactions in a market where incentives and the rents are complex and are not necessarily in balance. So markets that would not necessarily form spontaneously without some steward who is driving them. Analogs outside of the digital space would include open source projects, where there has to be sort of somebody who leads and brings the parties together. Standards organizations, where we have competing objectives, and yet they need to come together, sort of in one harmonious group.
Ecosystems then, I would submit, have some attributes that are maybe more analogous to a vertically integrated firm in that they have internal markets as well as outward facing markets. So for each element, an ecosystem owner has to sort of create a market. They have to encourage participants to come in and join, or they have to, as a vertically integrated firm, well, they would have to build those contracts somehow facilitate their action to create a complete system that produces a product for consumers. I think that stewardship role is key.
If you look at a vertically integrated company, there is no obligation for the independent elements inside to be profitable, to behave in sort of any particular manner, and I think when you sort of externalize that in an ecosystem model, it gets a little more challenging.
Android is an excellent case in point. So the role that Google plays is both as a participant in that market, but also as a steward of the overall ecosystem, to make sure that the various parties are able to benefit from the transactions that are sort of being incurred inside the market. So when we talk about competition analysis, a participant in an ecosystem, just like inside an integrated company, could operate below cost in one market and be overcompensated in some other portion of the ecosystem, such that they come out whole. I think that dynamic highly complicates the analysis of the overall marketplace, if the behavior was independent of the ecosystem, it may be seen as anti-competitive. Further, where ecosystems touch non-ecosystem markets or where the stewards compete themselves inside the ecosystem, I think we end up in a very complex space.
I’ll use app developers, who we represent, as an example. An application developer is not directly compensated, typically, for their work, or often is not. They rely on advertising as a monetization mechanism. The advertising ecosystem is part of the larger Android ecosystem. App developers do not produce phones. They don’t produce operating systems, that’s handled by other parties, but nobody buys phones without apps. So there is a web of interactions and inter-reliance that sort of makes the system work.
In the EU Android case, the Commission did a poor job, I think, of identifying those various markets and the activities in each. The context does matter, and we stepped in as representing developers to say that the impact on them, the system on them, was overlooked.
Third, ecosystems compete as ecosystems as well as markets. I think one of the characteristics of the big ecosystem players is they have a competence in bringing market participants together. They have the digital tools, they know how to manage the complexity. And so you will often see the biggest competition with a platform company or a large ecosystem company is another ecosystem company entering into their market, a lot of their competencies overlap.
And so in looking at marketplaces, I think, ecosystem as a whole, is a market or a market function.
I’ll conclude with my thoughts on sort of the policy implications of this and when I talk with policy makers, this is what I try to highlight. Reaching into an ecosystem and trying to identify market failures or characterized behavior is difficult, especially if you only look at one segment of an ecosystem, the market inside an ecosystem. I would submit that there has been more success to date in regulating the inputs and the market externalities that go along with an ecosystem. So regulating privacy or copyright or patents or content is a very effective way to shift the incentives within the ecosystem. And I think that’s sometimes the most direct way to get at behaviors or promote behaviors that are positive for the marketplace as opposed to potentially dangerous.
So, I will leave it with that. Thank you very much.
 
LEE:
Thank you.
President Gustafson also seems most interested in Android cases. According to President Gustafson, this ecosystem itself forms an autonomous order through stewardship; without such an operating system, it is impossible to do revenue-generating business amongst the system’s participants; and when such an ecosystem exists, the market itself becomes very complicated. In short, President Gustafson thinks that though there are separate product markets, there is room for an ecosystem itself to be able to function as another market. So, all these complicated dynamics should be taken into account, which is lacking at the moment. If a given ecosystem is regulated, such regulations for other areas beyond competition law would be quite effective, as he said.
Thank you for your overview, President Gustafson.
Next, I’d like to ask Prof. Ko for his own general overview. Thank you.
 

Haksoo KO:
I’ll make three brief points, perhaps with a broader perspective.
First is about data. I mean, everyone nowadays says data is important. Having access to data or having possession of data is significant and everybody talks about it, but at the same time, it’s very, very difficult to make the assessment as to how data makes an impact on competition dynamics. So it’s, in that sense, it’s a very early stage to have come up with a coherent theory about data’s impact on competition or competition dynamics. That’s the first point.
The second point is related to the data. One major role these days that people talk about data is that, data has a tremendous impact on artificial intelligence; developing a model of artificial intelligence. And if a company has much more data than others, then they can come up with a better AI model or AI algorithm. And in that sense, they are given a competitive advantage. But there, again, having data may possibly be a necessary condition, or even- it may not even be a necessary condition, and combined with data, there may well be many other factors that are required to have a competitive edge. So again, at this stage, talking about data and an AI-related competitive edge, that’s an area that’s very underdeveloped, and we are still a long way to go in terms of understanding how data and AI modeling work together.
The third point is more about platforms. A platform could serve many different functions, and one of the functions that a platform could possibly serve, would be as your gateway, Gateway meaning providing a connection between a platform and their consumers. So large platforms can possibly serve as your gateway between these two; between a service provider and consumers. So for example, there are many platforms, but just as an example in Korea, there’s a service provider named Kakao. Everybody in Korea would know this name and Kakao is basically a messenger app, so people use Kakao for sending and receiving messages. But, at the same time, as a big platform, Kakao serves as a conduit between, on the one hand, consumers or users, and on the other hand, various types of service providers. And here, the service providers include not just private business entities, but also public institutions and even government agencies. And if you live in Korea, you would get messages from government agencies through Kakao, and moreover through Kakao, consumers these days can make a financial payment or do money transfers. And this means that Kakao serves as a main gateway for some types of financial transactions. So overall, some platforms function as a gateway, as we saw through Kakao. But other platforms do not serve as a gateway. And even if some platforms serve as gateways, at this point, it’s really not clear whether they show a significant anti-competitive impact. So there are many scenarios possible in terms of market dynamics. So again, in this area of seeing a platform as a gateway, the analysis is still at an early stage, I would say.
And I’ll stop there. Thank you.

LEE:
Prof. Ko has neatly summarized three points. The first point was that we hardly know either how influential data are or how to analyze data, i.e., the influence of data.
Secondly, data have become the critical key to developing artificial intelligence.
Thirdly, there are platforms who play the role of a gateway and we need to pay attention to such a role. For example, South Korea’s Kakao plays a gateway role in our financial services; from business people and consumers to the government or public institutions, many access financial services through Kakao.
Prof. Ko adeptly pointed out these three issues.
Prof. Sang-Seung Yi, you are next. Please give us your general overview.


Sang-Seung YI:
Yes. I’m in broad agreement with the other panelists that there are many challenges in assessing the competitive effects of the digital platform industry. Market definition, assessing dominance and evaluating potential anti-competitive effects, and balancing them against pro competitive effects.
So first, on the market definition, on the consumer side, we all know that the services are often provided for free. The platform operator typically monetizes his services by selling advertisements. So, on the consumer side, assuming that you defined two separate markets, one cannot apply the common technique of defining the relevant market, that is the SSNIP test, because increasing the price by 5% or 10% has no meaning when the starting price is zero.
So the SSNDQ test, the small, but significant non-transitory decrease in quality test has been proposed as an alternative, as a conceptual framework. I agree that the SSNDQ test makes intuitive sense, but it is really difficult to operationalize the SSNDQ test because often, the data is not available.
And also as many panelists said, the platform operators, or ecosystems, provide many, many different services. And also the services evolve all the time. So it is really hard to come up with a single measure of quality.
Just for one example, think about targeted advertisements. I personally prefer to see targeted advertisement that suits my needs instead of seeing random ads, but people differ in their tastes. So some people may say that, are they surveilling me? Or are they looking at my online behavior? So people have different preferences, so it is hard to come up with a single measure of quality and also, the appeal of the SSNIP test for defining the relevant market is simplistic. You only need the price to increase 5 or 10%, and then how many consumers will switch from your service to the potential competitors. That’s the only information you need, in addition to the margin. But even if you assume that you come up with a single measure of quality, then if you reduce 5% or 10% the quality, you have to come up with the cost reduction. How much cost is reduced when you reduce quality. So it is very difficult to apply the SSNDQ test.
Second, about assessing market dominance. Because these platforms provide multiple services, which evolve continuously and often rapidly, it is difficult to identify who the competitors are and what their strengths are. I think these difficulties arose in the recent advocacy’s lawsuit against Facebook, where the trial judge dismissed, or granted Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case precisely on these grounds. That is, what are the so-called personal social service networks.
In the FTC’s original complaint, the judge pointed that out. In the amended complaint, the FTC now has identified Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe; only four, excluding all other services, which at least some aspects of the personal social network services are provided.
And also, calculating market share is difficult because, precisely for this reason, that is, think about YouTube. Now they have some features of the social networks services, like commenting and so on, following. So then how much time do people spend on YouTube, on the personal social network service? It is really difficult to come up with reliable measures.
And third, on assessing the potential competitive effects, I think there is broad agreement that potential competition and nascent competition should receive far more weight in competitive assessment of the digital platform industry. But again, it is easier said than done. That is, the FTC is currently, in 2020 and 2021, challenging Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. But the natural question is, the FTC looked at all the documents that Facebook submitted on the second request about the internal documents and so on. At that time, the agency approved them, but then it changed and now challenges the acquisitions as an anti-competitive scheme in violation of section two. But then, the FTC has currently been silent on why, what, for what reason did it change its mind. So these are some of the difficulties, and I do not have the answer yet, so I think we should discuss it more.
Thank you.

LEE:
First, Prof. Yi addressed the fact that in market definitions it is hard to apply the SSNIP test, which is based on the traditional pricing, to the digital platform markets. However, he continued that the SSNDQ test does not work well, either as an alternative. He said that, in fact, there are considerable difficulties in implementing the SSNDQ test.
Also, in evaluating market dominance, it is hard to figure out who competes against whom in the digital platform industry. For example, social media and YouTube can be in a competitive relationship, and YouTube also could play a role in social media, said Prof. Yi.
He also pointed out the importance of evaluating potential competitors in the digital platform market, mentioning the KFTC’s recent re-review of business consolidations that it had already approved in the past.
Now we have heard everybody’s overview. Though this first part is essential for today’s discussion, it seems that we went over the originally allocated time. Therefore, I am afraid that we need to spend less time on the remaining two parts.
The second part is about discussing the market definition in detail. I am very sorry but please try to spend only about 2 to 3 minutes per speaker.
Prof. Sang-Seung Yi, since you just spoke about the market definition in such detail, it would be great if you could continue on further.

YI:
Sure, given the time shortage, let me just say that there are two common approaches, one is defining two markets that are interrelated.
Secondly, is defining a single market based on the difference, whether the platform can be characterized as a transaction platform or non-transaction platform. I think this approach makes sense, but instead of spending too much time and energy on the precise boundary of the relevant market, I think we all agree that we should begin with the competitive assessment, that is, we should keep in mind the first principle that we define a market for the purpose of assessing the competitive effects of conduct at issue.
So let me stop here. We can come back to, I think, to the Google case on this issue, but later.

LEE:
Thank you.
Earlier, Prof. Dae-Sik Hong pointed out the problem of defining a market too narrowly in the market definition. Prof. Hong, please speak a little more about the market definition.

HONG:
Sure. Since the time is of essence, I will address a specific case. It is the Google Android case in South Korea. Although it is similar to the Google Android cases in EU, I shall explain it briefly for the overseas audience who are not familiar with this case.
The EU cases involve, firstly, tying of search apps, secondly, certain payments requiring pre-installation of search apps, and thirdly, the anti-fragmentation agreement.
Korea’s case was focused on that third issue, the anti-fragmentation agreement. It was because there was no visible exclusion of competition in Korea even though both the first and second cases of EU were applied to Korea. As the result, the KFTC couldn’t challenge it.
The third case had to do with Google’s imposing its anti-fragmentation condition while package-licensing its own apps pursuant to the MADA, i.e. mobile application distribution agreement. KFTC only took issue with the third case, whose issue was about how to define the market.
In reality, the ecosystem competition is between Apple’s ecosystem and Google’s own. Apple wasn’t investigated as it adopts a closed setting, with no licensing offer. Thus, KFTC said that it had only targeted the ecosystem that offers licensing. As the result, Google’s market share or influence ended up looming large. In this case, everything from the market definition to how to define a market was drawn quite narrowly, which in turn influenced the next analysis.
Another issue arose, which was that, in South Korea, not only smartphones but also other mobile devices became issues. Those devices such as mobile watches, smart watches, smart TVs, and smart speakers also need an OS in the end. Yes, those devices do form a new market.
When South Korea’s OEM manufacturers first developed such products, they utilized Android because it is an open source software. Another related issue was some apps’ claiming difficulty in manufacturing due to lack of coordination with Google. Then, KFTC launched the concept of “other smart device OS market”, saying that Google impeded innovation in such a market.
The question I have about the market definition is this excessive broadness of the “innovation market”, a concept that the KFTC came up with, while defining the mobile OS market narrowly. Other mobile devices refer to such items as watches, TVs, speakers, etc. After all, each of these devices forms a separate ecosystem, however, the KFTC bundled them together, designating the cluster as “other mobile devices”, and then introduced an OS market specific to the cluster.
This constantly fluctuating definition of a market size from narrow to wide by the KFTC seems too unprincipled in my opinion.

LEE:
Prof. Hong is understandably most focused on South Korea’s Google Android case. He’s expressed his frustration regarding the KFTC’s market definition, which changes from too narrow to too wide depending on a case.
In particular, considering Google’s ecosystem is competing against Apple’s ecosystem, he stated how lacking it was that this reality was not factored in the decision.
President Gustafson also addressed ecosystem’s market and ecosystem’s competition earlier. President Gustafson, do you have anything else to add to the competition within an ecosystem?

GUSTAFSON:
I will be very brief.
I think that at a fundamental level, companies know what markets they compete in, and they know who their competitors are. And so for a court to sort of second guess what the participants already know is always a surprise to me when the answers can be determined. But the reality is in an ecosystem, there will be more than two sides to a market. There will be more than one participant. They will overlap. And when it comes time to sort of define how markets are, whether they’re competitive or not, I think you have to look at the impact one market to another behavior in one market, how it affects another market within the ecosystem, or you’re going to get sort of a faulty answer because of the trade offs between the various components.

LEE:
Yes, thank you for your succinct remark.
In fact, President Gustafson already addressed this issue sufficiently; within this ecosystem are quite diverse players as well as multiple competitive relations. However, such diversity is yet to be reflected in competition law enforcement, as he added. Perhaps he could elaborate more later on while addressing competition analysis.
Prof. Hak-Soo Ko, we are discussing market definition. How should we solve the market definition issue in the digital industry?

KO:
Well, that’s a very challenging and difficult question, and I’ll give a couple of examples, which is beyond the competition law perspective, but more from a regulatory jurisdiction viewpoint, I would say.
The first case is the Kakao that I mentioned already. Kakao is the dominant messenger app in Korea and a few other countries. And I was told each DAU, daily active user, the number of DAU is 50 million, that is close to the whole population of the entire country of Korea.
So basically, pretty much everyone in Korea uses Kakao service on a daily basis every time, I mean every day, constantly. So in that sense, Kakao is essential if you live in Korea. And Kakao, obviously as a messenger service, people use the service as a messenger or social media in a broad sense. But as I mentioned, Kakao is being used for purposes of making payments and money transfers. So in that simplified sense, Kakao serves as a messenger app, plus serves as a financial conduit for financial transaction service.
So if you simplify that way, Kakao serves two main different functions. Well, in actuality, there are many other functions that Kakao provides, but depending on how you distinguish, or if you want to categorize Kakao’s services, at least partially, as providing financial services, you’re now subject to, you should, well, at least theoretically, be subject to a whole new set of regulations coming from the financial industry. And financial industry in itself is a very heavily regulated industry. And if you categorize it as the messenger service, then the whole different set of regulations should be in place. So depending on how you categorize your service, you’re in a totally different ball game.
The second example is sbout the my-data scheme. My-data is coming from what’s called, right to data portability. Data portability was enacted, perhaps, first in the EU, under the GDPR, and in Korea, credit information act, which governs financial data introduced the scheme of data portability, and colloquially it’s called “my data.” And my data means different financial services companies can ask their customers to request transferring customers’ data from one platform to another platform. And there are currently dozens of financial institutions that are involved in this scheme, which is still in the very early stages, but depending on how the market dynamics work out, there may well be a significant impact at least within the financial industry. And the problem of delineating the different types of players is out there. And the main difficulty is distinguishing between the traditional market institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, insurance companies, and that’s one group.
And the other group is a new commerce into the financial market. So-called FinTech companies, or BigTech companies. And the question is, is it worthwhile distinguishing between these two groups of companies? And even within FinTech and BigTech companies, is it meaningful to distinguish between these two groups? I mean, FinTech tends to specialize and they tend not to have too many different business lines. And as opposed to that, BigTech companies tend to be large and tend to provide whole different sets of diverse services, and depending on how you view the whole market dynamics, you can come up with different types of ways of delineating market players, and this is an open question and for now it’s still challenging and hard to make an assessment.

LEE:
Prof. Ko spoke about platforms’ activities beyond the market boundaries. For example, Kakao not only plays a messenger role but also offer multiple services including financial one. There is even a system where a user’s data could move from this platform to that platform.
He also asked how we could easily distinguish FinTech from BigTech or vice versa. After all they have a lot in common. Therefore, I think that Prof. Ko pointed out that the dynamics of the digital platform industry makes it harder to lump together businesses within its narrow relevant market and then analyze them.
Regarding discussing relevant markets, I think we should stop here. It is because the panelists appear more interested in competition analysis within a relevant market than such a market itself.
Well, in what order would you like to go? Earlier, I felt bad that I gave too little time time to Prof. Sang-Seung Yi. Since Prof. Yi said, “let’s focus more on competition analysis than on market definition”, I would like to offer him a little more time.
Prof. Yi, please proceed.

YI:
Well, actually I think it’s more productive to focus on an actual case as Prof. Hong mentioned, the Google case.
Let me first disclose that I was the testifying economics expert on behalf of Google before the KFTC, so I’m not a neutral observer, but let me try to update the international audience what the KFTC’s case is about, and what’s the difference between the KFTC’s and EC’s case. So as professor Hong explained, the EC challenged Google’s entire business model on Android, consisting of a web of contracts.
First, the anti-fragmentation agreements, where a smartphone maker agrees that if a smartphone maker installs Google apps, then the maker promises that it will not fragment the Android system by modifying the open source code in an incompatible way.
That is, apps that operate on the compatible devices, whether they are Google apps or non-Google apps, like Kakao, they should work smoothly on all devices.
The second is the distribution agreements where the EC characterizes as time, that is, if he installed one Google app, then you have to install all others, or the certain apps that Google designates.
Third is the revenue sharing agreement, which Google entered into smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, and also all the network operators where by exclusively pre-installing Google search on the mobile phones, then they get a cut of Google’s search revenue on those devices.
Now, the important, I think, point is that the EC’s theory of harm is that, through all these agreements, Google tried to maintain and solidify its dominance on the general search.
It happens that in 2011, Naver and Daum, Daum is the predecessor to Kakao, they filed a complaint before the KFTC challenging these agreements. That is, by pre-installing the, especially the Mada, pre-installing the Google search, Google is trying to extend its dominance from desktop to mobile. The problem was, the story that I heard was that Google lamented that the most searched word on the mobile Google search engine was “Naver.” They wanted to download Naver app because that’s what they wanted to use. And also on the desktop, the Naver share is about 80%. So in 2013, KFTC dismissed the complaint.
Now fast forward to 2021, this fact did not deter the KFTC from challenging the AFA, anti-fragmentation agreements. And what’s remarkable is that the EC only looked at smart devices, like smart phones and tablets, but the KFTC extended them into all smart devices, including smart watches, smart speakers, smart TVs, as Professor Hong mentioned, based on the innovation market theory, but it’s quite, as Professor Hong said, quite vague, so I really look forward to what the court is going to say on the KFTC’s ruling.

LEE:
Our Prof. Yi also appears most interested in the Google case. Well, as the topic is on the table, let me ask Prof. Dae-Sik Hong some more questions as Prof. Hong earlier wanted to discuss the same Google case a little more.
Please understand that I am unable to summarize what Prof. Yi said. It is because we are pressed for time. We ask you to understand our situation.
Dear panelists, please keep your speech short from now on.
Prof. Hong, please go ahead.

HONG:
As Prof. Yi shared his involvement in South Korea’s Google case, I think I should address mine as well. The omission was due to my unfamiliarity with the protocol here. In fact, neither am I an objective observer in this case as I had also submitted my expert report on behalf of Google in the Google Android case. It’s news to me that Prof. Yi provided economic analysis for the case. We appeared to have been unaware of each other’s work… until today.
As someone who was asked to provide a legal opinion on the case, I am not qualified to discuss the case’s factual grounds. That is why I said that the KFTC should make a decision based on certain legal principles and standards.
I’d like to make a few points regarding the KFTC’s decisions; first, in that specific case related to mobile OS licensing, KFTC came to its decision by applying the traditional market foreclosure theory. In the past, the foreclosure theory was typically applied when there was evidence that either a competitor had been ousted from the market or their competitiveness was greatly reduced. However, no such evidence was presented in this case. So, what KFTC brought up was other similar cases raised by the EU. However, KFTC mentioned Amazon’s Fire OS and Alibaba’s Aliyun OS as evidence of market foreclosure… yes, they are indeed Android forks, saying that neither could enter the Korean market properly due to the entry barriers set up by Google Android against its potential competitors.
Some parts in KFTC’s theory make sense, but it is doubtful if Amazon or Alibaba ever tried to enter South Korea’s digital market. After all, South Korea’s ecosystem is Android’s in addition to Apple’s. Within the Android ecosystem, Korean OEM manufacturers such as Samsung were able to pass compatibility tests by making variants based on what Google had provided. That way, Samsung Electronics was able to make their own devices and then inserted their own app market into such devices.
Also, Samsung develops their own apps. In that aspect, you can say that South Korea sees competition among those compatible Android variants. Nonetheless, KFTC excluded the fact in its ruling, saying that there are no such factors that suppress competition amongst such variants. In a way, the ruling by KFTC didn’t sufficiently reflect what people really felt. Even though KFTC only saw certain Android forks, and Mr. Gustafson is with us here, the reason that Google emphasizes compatibility is because from app developers’ point of view, a multiple-fork ecosystem is like a nightmare.
Why? You have to redesign an app to fit the new fork continuously. In that aspect, multiple compatible versions of Android OS do offer clear benefits. However, such an upside was not considered in the KFTC’s ruling, which I find somewhat problematic.
And in the other smart device OS market where KFTC had raised an issue of innovation market, its ruling turned out even more hypothetical. Even though those other smart devices such as watches, TVs, etc. have not seen their own OS markets sufficiently formed, KFTC’s approach is that Google completely blocked emergence of such markets. Therefore, Google impeded innovation, says KFTC.
Speaking of innovation in this context, let’s talk about what’s happened to Microsoft. When regular consumers largely transitioned from PC to mobile devices, MS OS could no longer assert its power in mobile markets because their PC OS’s strengths didn’t transition to mobile devices.
This is a good example of new, utterly disruptive innovation. However, the KFTC views that such disruptive innovation is unthinkable in new mobile devices such as smart watches; only Android variants are possible; blocking development of Android variants is harming innovation. These are how they approach, and I doubt how this attitude could fit in with any concept of innovation.

LEE:
Thank you. Both Prof. Yi and Prof. Hong addressed the Google Android case. I guess that President Gustafson may have something to add to the discussion.
Please be succinct.

GUSTAFSON:
Certainly, thank you.
Apparently, we were all involved in one way or another.
So our testimony in the European Android case was quite clear that, from the developer point of view, fragmented operating systems drive up costs and complicate the market for developers. Operating systems compete with each other, we’ll use Apple and Google as examples for a developer community that is capable of making third party apps. And developers will develop for the platform that is the most profitable for them. And that fragmentation is a factor in that decision. And so, certainly, there is a strong market reason why an operating system would seek to limit fragmentation because of its value in another portion of the ecosystem.
I will make a couple of comments just in response to Professor Ko and Professor Yi. So on data, data portability, data ownership, our view is a little more nuanced from my common law colleagues. We view rights and data as more of a bundle of sticks. There are joint rights by many of the people that are involved in the value chain; the person who collects the data, people who process data, the people who produce the data. And so I think there’s a much more sophisticated discussion will need to take place there before we define a legal framework that is operable.
And then finally on sort of my stewardship comment, there is a cost to an ecosystem to support a brand, and in the consumer’s mind when they are interacting with an ecosystem and all of the participants in it, it is that brand that is foremost in their mind, and so that is a service that is rendered unto the ecosystem, in addition to sort of bringing the parties together. And so what is sometimes termed as a gatekeeper role, I think is also important to protect the general brand value of all of the participants that are in the ecosystem. So we do a service when we make sure that bad actors cannot enter the system when we make sure that there’s a certain quality level. And so that role, likewise, can be a bit of a policeman role. It can be seen as negative, and certainly is painted that way by policymakers, but I think it’s necessary for the ecosystem to function, so that has to be reflected in law somewhere.

LEE:
Though today’s topics are market definition and competition analysis in digital platforms, this session’s focus is specifically on South Korea throughout the entire CPI series. Understandably that our panelists have zeroed in on the in-country Google Android case.
Prof. Ko, you are not directly involved in the Google case, are you?
Prof. Ko, I will be grateful if you have anything else to add to the Google case, or if you can suggest a new direction that competition analysis of digital platform markets should take.

KO:
Yeah, I’d like to make a short concluding remark: I was not involved in the Google case. I feel isolated here, just a joke.
Well, I don’t intend to talk about the Google case, but, and rather than saying there’s a direction for the future, I would say we are currently at a loss as to what the future directions should be. I mean, everyone knows large platforms tend to show a network effect and I mean, network effects naturally would point toward a less of competition. I mean, theoretically, that’s what the textbook says.
What’s unclear is what is really taking place in the marketplace. I mean, some of the large platforms tend to become bigger in Korea, in the US, in the EU, wherever, but that’s not a universal phenomenon in every market segment. So in some markets, some of the platforms are becoming dominant players, but in some other market segments, there’s a very fierce, very dynamic competition going on. And also, platforms, particularly in the past couple of years, some of the platforms are trying to go into the markets that have been dominated by other competitors. So in that general sense, there’s been a tremendous market pressure to go into other fields and become a meaningful competitor.
So in Korea, for instance, there’s a large bit of competition. For example, in the e-commerce market or in the messaging service market or in the food delivery market, in many different markets, there’s a lot of competitive pressure and not dominated by a single player, but several large players that are competing against each other very fiercely. So we’ll have to see what happens in these markets.

LEE:
Thank you.
Due to the network external effect of a digital platform any growth of a large platform is indeed a competition-threatening factor. However, as we can see in the South Korean market, a large number of new entries are made in various markets such as delivery apps, messaging apps, etc. competing ferociously amongst themselves, as Prof. Ko said.
Subsequently, as he observed, it would be interesting to see how these two contradicting forces would interact with each other and what kind of result would come out of it.
Naturally, with our time, we couldn’t expect to come up with a solution in competition analysis of the digital platform market. Nonetheless, I believe that through today’s discourse we were able to find some clues for a future direction.
I wish all the panelists greater accomplishments and contributions in this area in the future.
I wish we had more time, but today’s discussion has reached its end point.
Dear panelists and online viewers, have a wonderful weekend, thank you. ",Microsoft
416,"January 25, 2022",Mergers & Acquisitions in the Digital Economy: Striking the Right Balance,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Mergers & Acquisitions in the Digital Economy: Striking the Right Balance. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to Australia.

Kirsten WEBB:
Well, hello everybody and welcome to this panel session. Today we’re going to be discussing the fascinating topic of mergers and acquisitions in the digital economy, which is a topic which is much discussed, of course, at the moment, but our focus is going to be on striking the right balance.
The panelists we have here today, to introduce, we have Chris Berg, who’s a senior research fellow at RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub. We have John Yun, associate professor of law and director of economic education with the Global Antitrust Institute. We have Sean Ennis, professor of competition policy at Norwich Business School at the University of East Anglia, and we have Rob Nicholls, associate professor at the University of New South Wales. And I’m Kirsten Web, a partner at Clayton Utz and I’m the moderator for today’s session.
So welcome everybody. We might start off with a broad question, which is an obvious question, given our topic, which is, does there need to be a re-balance of mergers analysis in the digital economy? I might ask each panelist to give a very short reaction to that question, and then we’ll dig deeper into some of the issues that are raised by that question. So in alphabetical order, we might start with Chris. What do you think, Chris?


Chris BERG:
Thank you so much for having me. Look, I think it’s absolutely a necessity that we rebalance the way we think about competition in this space. I come at from a very particular place, which is the study of blockchain and the crypto economy.
What we find uniformly across policy areas is that many of the assumptions that we’ve applied to traditional industrial era economic organization just don’t apply, don’t make sense in the crypto and blockchain space. I think that replicates across the economy as well, as we move from the sort of factory organization of the economy to these platform network de-hierarchical organizations that we’re now seeing. I think that necessitates a fairly deep rethinking, not necessarily of competition policy, but of the way we structure our thinking about what looks like anti-competitive conduct and what looks like, even things like consumer protection.

WEBB:
Thanks very much Chris. John, what’s your perspective?


John YUN:
Thank you, Kirsten and thank you for having me here.
It’s a complicated question, and obviously, we’re looking for short responses here. So to properly address it, we need to really look at two questions, one of which is where we are and where we think we need to be and whether there’s a difference between those two. I think there’s a lot of policy debates about that, but I’m of the view that I like where we are. I do think modern antitrust and its evidence-based approach and the goal of economic efficiency is something that has been very good for antitrust. Doesn’t mean that the enforcement along that objective is perfect. No, it certainly doesn’t mean that. But at the very least, I think the objective is right.
So then the question is, is that enforcement getting there? Does the digital sector present unique challenges that we need to incorporate and are we deviating from what we consider to be good enforcement? That to me is a harder question. I think the evidence is still sort of being developed.
I looked at a series of paper coming out of Europe by Lantham and Lamech, and there’s a lot of good papers out there, and their conclusion is it’s really hard. They say it could be anti-competitive, it could be pro-competitive. We just don’t know. The evidence is really mixed, and it’s case by case. To me, that’s the conclusion that I think makes a lot of sense here. So, absent extraordinary evidence, I tend to think that, well, we are headed in the right way. I think generally speaking, merger analysis is in a good place.

WEBB:
Thanks, thanks very much, John. Sean, what’s your perspective?


Sean ENNIS:
Oh, this is really a hard question. If you were to back up and say, “Have there been mergers that seem to have been problematic?” I think a lot of people would say yes. But if you go a little bit further and say, “What percentage of mergers have been problematic?” If, let’s say there’ve been 400 mergers and people tend to talk about between five and 10 as being problematic, that’s a really small percentage of the total. I think some agencies have upped their game in this area and so, to me, that shows that there is some ability, at least for the agencies, to change the way they act without necessarily having a fundamental rethink of the broad system. So, maybe I’m in the camp that remains to be convinced, but could be convinced.

WEBB:
Thanks, Sean. And Rob?


Rob NICHOLLS:
I think, ultimately it’s the consumer welfare issue, the driver. Why efficient markets? Because that leads to great outcomes from a consumer welfare perspective. So, is there a problem? Is there something that’s going wrong at the moment that means we should have the sort of regulatory angst that we’re seeing across the world from different regulators? Now, I’m not quite sure that we’ve got to that stage yet. Just like Sean, I’m willing to be convinced, but I’m certainly not going to be convinced if it suddenly looks like a very targeted approach to mergers analysis, which has that “not invented here” aspect to it.

WEBB:
Well, thank you very much for those short answers to a very big question.
We’ve got a range of interesting perspectives on our panel this morning. Let’s dig a little bit deeper into your thoughts on some of the issues that underlie the brief comments that have just been made. The first question, I suppose, is is merger analysis—or Chris who’s looking at most broadly, I think competition analysis in the broadest sense—something different to analysis of traditional industries? What should merger analysis in the digital economy look like, do we all think?
So let’s put that out there for discussion or, Chris, if you want to go broad, competition regulations in the digital world. Maybe if we start with something a little bit concrete.
John, would you like to kick off by discussing the CMA’s move to block Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy with horizontal and vertical theories of harm? Having a look at that, and more broadly, what factors do you think agencies and courts should be considering here?

YUN:
That’s a great question. So let me caveat my thoughts by saying the CMA, they obviously have evidence that is not public and that we’re not privy to, and so they might have very, very good reasons that we’re not seeing for bringing it, and so my comments are with that caveat. After spending time at the FTC, often, the non-public stuff is very important.
So with that being said, for their theory of harm to really work on a horizontal level, let me start there and then move to the vertical, they need a couple of key factors. I think the main thing they need is that Giphy needs to represent some differentiated product from others that are similarly situated.
How do you identify that? I think there’s a couple of ways that you can do that. One of which is, let’s look at their history and their product development. So Giphy, I looked it up, there are about an eight-year-old company, and so they’ve been around a while. One of the things I think the CMA should be looking for, and if they haven’t, it’s useful, is that have they differentiated their product in a way that’s different from what they’ve developed previously? Because an eight year old company isn’t quite nascent and potential anymore. They’re a fairly established company. I would like to see some evidence that they are moving and pivoting into an area that Facebook is competing in. I think that would be really important.
The second thing I’d like to see is how differentiated is Giphy from other sort of GIF type companies that offer a similar product? I think that’s really critical. Are they at a growth rate, the different types of consumers are they closely aligned with Facebook users more than others? I think that’s really the kind of stuff that I want to see, rather than, “Oh, they’re something that Facebook uses and they could potentially become a competitor.” I think we need that seed of competition that could potentially grow, and maybe there is that. I think that would be an important thing that I’d like to see. Very briefly for the vertical theory where they could foreclose the GIF input into others. I think if this were relied on, it would worry me more, because if, for example, an upstart, a Tik-Tok or Snap uses the GIF inputs that Giphy provides, and it’s been a very important driver for some of their features and functionalities that compete with Facebook, and then now there’s a potential for foreclosure, I’d be worried.
So I think that type of stuff would be a lot more viable than the horizontal potential stuff. I think you need to see more evidence. Not that it’s not viable, but I think it’s a harder sell based off of GIPHY’s history, at least publicly.

WEBB:
Thanks very much John.
Did anyone else have any comments on the horizontal and vertical theories and factors that you think might be taken into account in merger analysis here?
Maybe we’ll move to a related question or a more specific or a subset of that broader question, which is, killer acquisitions, and John was questioning whether a company that’s been established for eight years represents nascent competition. Killer acquisitions. Rob, would you like to have a bit of a discussion about the effect of merger regulation or merger analysis which tries to identify mergers that might stifle emerging competition and what effect that might have more broadly, for example, on innovation?

NICHOLLS:
I think one of the key issues for potential innovators—I work in a business school, so I’ve got bunches of students who are the potential entrepreneurs of, well actually, next week rather than next year. A lot of them have ambitions, which are pretty much like this: we will set up a business, we will establish it, prove its success, sell to Google, live with the restraint of trade that Google imposes and use that as the seed funding for the business that we really wanted to get into.
So if you get into a merger’s analysis that says every potential acquisition by the GAFAM or some list of businesses has to be reviewed in a particular way, then there’s a risk. There’s a risk of stifling innovation in that, that exit process is no longer available and it’s less not being able to exit the first time, it’s not being able to go on to the next innovation that’s risky.
I think there needs to be a balance. I think that issue of nascent competition is really difficult to define in a way that can be appropriately enforced by mass competition regulators, and to have a rule, which is “I’ll know it when I see it” is entirely inappropriate because it takes away predictability from businesses, it takes away the potential for innovation.
Actually, I think some of the acquisition of Giphy is really, well, it’s that angst I mentioned earlier on; how did we let Facebook acquire Instagram? Well, because Instagram had 13 people working for them, and actually 13 exhausted people who were really just looking to have a mechanism to patch up their servers to continue providing the service to their users.
So, there is a risk of if merger, there’s a shift to merger analysis that says, “Well, actually we require the onus of proof on the acquirer to be such that there is no possibility that there will be a reduction in competition, let alone a significant or substantial reduction in competition.” That risk is that there will be an ecosystem of innovation which is stifled. I don’t think that that risk is, that risk needs to be at least appropriately considered before you start saying, “Well, we don’t have fit-for-purpose merger regulation.”
I think killer acquisition’s is a particular issue and if you say, “It’s only the GAFAM’s that we worry about for killer acquisitions”, that’s even worse. If you really need a theory of harm for killer acquisitions, that actually can be translated from a theory of harm to regulatory guidance, which is not going to stifle innovation in the digital economy, and to be frank, innovation in the digital economy is where the vast majority of innovation is occurring. The risk is really high.

BERG:
Can I just elaborate or expand and support Rob’s point for a moment there? Because I think that’s really important. That exit to a large competitor, to a dominant player in the market, is built into the capital structure of the original innovators themselves. A large part of the venture capital model is built around that, that ultimately in five, 10 years, we will flip so that we can return funds to our liquidity providers as well. When we’re thinking about regulating it, if we’re going to regulate that exit, we’re also going to be starting to implicitly regulate the entry.
Now we’ve seen over the course of decades that it’s increasingly difficult to go the other direction to go to an initial public offering, for all sorts of complex regulatory reasons, and so the exit to a large competitor looks like a lot easier and more attractive path for a lot of young innovators. Just to reiterate Rob’s point, just thinking about what this looks like from the beginning of the innovation process is really important because these are fixed lifecycle firms, fixed lifecycle startups very often.

ENNIS:
Can I just jump in? I agree with John’s point that there’s a backwards logic to this so that if you change the end game you’re going to change the start of the whole process as well. It’s a little bit unclear how they would finish out, though. I’m not convinced that it’s always healthy to have the sellout to the very big competitor versus going to the market and getting the price as the end objective. I think some venture capitalists are kind of concerned actually about the current situation, because they have so few exit options as it is in the way that things seem to be going. But if you were to look for some criteria that a competition authority might use for evaluating nascent competition, it could be related to the price being paid for the acquired entity compared to its revenues or compared to its size of its labor force. I think if you use those criteria, you will end up with most of the mergers that people have talked about as potentially problematic coming out as having at least a yellow blinking light. So maybe there is a way, Rob, to have such a criteria. I’m not suggesting those ones necessarily, but those might be ones to consider.

NICHOLLS:
I agree. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen yet a concrete proposal that actually says, “Well, we think that there might be a potential problem if acquisition prices N times revenue.” Because it won’t be N times earnings, because earnings will almost certainly be zero, but at above N times revenue, then we should be thinking about it. But even then, coming up with a, well, why is N N and not N minus one or N plus one? So that isn’t a solution. It needs to be a much clearer solution, which says, “We’ve come to this. We’ve come to it rationally, and why have we come to it?”
The other issue, I think, Sean, is you’re dead right. It’s an optionality issue. There’s no requirement to sell out to a big company and an IPO as Chris pointed out has difficulties, but it’s an option. It’s the removal of the option that’s the risk.

WEBB:
Chris, you’re nodding. Do you have any ideas as to how to identify with a greater level of certainty, which of these sorts of acquisitions might be problematic?

BERG:
No, and I’m really concerned that if we try to head down that way, we’re going to basically be restructuring the venture market at the beginning. I spend a lot of time working with companies at the very start of their venture process when they’re getting the initial evaluations, when they’re getting the seed or even angel investing, and any of the proposals that we could put up and we could devise right now, would inherently mean that they trade at a discount because we’re just writing off or we’re at least, we’re making quite risky, one of the basic exit strategies. So I’m deeply concerned about that and particularly because if you think about some of the tech acquisitions that haven’t come to the attention of competition regulators in recent years, there aren’t revenues, there’s certainly not profits. Often, these are just acquisitions to buy a team.
For example, I’m thinking of the acquisition of Keybase, the secure chat app by Zoom. Zoom purchased them at the start of the pandemic in order to basically buy their encryption skillset. There was no revenue, in fact there was nothing that we could have looked at to have some objective function that would be valuable from a policy analysis perspective, but that is a perfectly justified exit strategy and that would have returned to the investors of Keybase exactly what they were looking for. Now, I’m a bit disappointed because I really liked Keybase, but having said that, I’m very concerned about the changing of the capital structure of the industry sort of really strange and backhanded way through competition policy.

WEBB:
Thanks Chris. John, you were nodding. Have you got any ideas as to how to grapple with this question?

YUN:
I don’t, but I do want to affirm Rob and Chris’s point and also raise a statistic I find interesting.
I recently read that of all the exits in the US from startups and venture capital firms, big tech represents 4% of that. To me, 4% is significant. It’s still important and I agree that the ex-ante and ex-post influence each other in terms of the exit strategy and the valuation, and I’m a firm believer of that. But it also puts it in perspective, and saying that big tech is not the one buying up all these companies.
There’s this perception that startups are really just getting gobbled up. It’s really a relatively small percent. That doesn’t mean it’s not significant and important, but I think that statistic is quite helpful, and I think both points can be right where the exit strategy influences the ex-ante valuation. I also think that perhaps it could be overstated how much big tech is gobbling up these small startups. I think there’s a vibrant activity out there that doesn’t involve big tech.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, John. As a lawyer, I’m going to ask now a principles based question, which is, I think back to you, John, actually. Which is in the discussion that we’ve just had, we’ve referred to potential competition and nascent competition.
John, do you think there’s a legal and economic difference between those two concepts?

YUN:
I do, and I’m going to argue that it’s important. In the US, potential competition is a doctrine that arose out of the 1960s and 70s in a series of Supreme Court cases. I don’t want to bore the audience with a walkthrough of case history, but very basically, these involved products such as natural gas and beer.
Beer in the 1970s was different from today. I don’t mean to suggest these are the same things. I know craft and differentiation is very important today, but back then, these were very basic products. What the court was wrestling with is whether a firm who hasn’t quite entered a geographic market or a product space, but is thinking of entering, exerts some competitive influence either currently or very soon in a way that it’s disciplining the market.
So a merger between a potential competitor and an actual competitor can result in some harm to consumers. It’s a very viable theory. It’s a well-developed doctrine. The problem is, is that it represented a very high burden of what it meant to be a potential competitor. Many people have been upset about this, and I think rightly so, but I think it’s appropriate for potential competition cases that are very basic commodities and products.
Now let’s move to nascent competition. This is a doctrine that came out in the 1990s, I think for the first time by the DOJ with their Microsoft case. Very briefly that case was involving the operating system of Microsoft and the threat that Netscape as a web browser posed, not for Internet Explorer, but for Microsoft’s operating system Windows in of itself, in that it could develop functionalities and overlaps that could chip away at the monopoly power that Microsoft had over the OS system market.
That actually has come true to a way, right? Because look at Chrome and Chromebook. The functionality of web browsers has influenced the market for operating systems in a meaningful way. The point being is that nascent competition represents, often, a product that is differentiated technologically, but could develop in such a way that it could represent a threat to an incumbent in the future. It generally isn’t a product that’s not in the market or anything. It could be in the market, or it could be in an adjacent market, but it’s really about product development and innovation in a certain manner.
So why does that matter? I think to me, that burden should be lower. We shouldn’t be using the potential competition cases to inform us about nascent competition cases, because then you’re going to require on the plaintiffs, these arguments that we need to see documents at the entry would have occurred. We need to see firm commitments. We need to see business plans. You see this in certain cases: FTC vs Steris. FTC brought this as a potential competition case, when to me it’s really a nascent competition case.
Long story short, I think these are two separate doctrines, and I think the problem that agencies and courts are having right now in the US is they’re using a very high standard of potential competition to inform nascent competition cases, when I think these are quite different.

WEBB:
Everyone’s nodding. Anyone want to add to that? Rob, you want to speak?

NICHOLLS:
I actually want to go off on a deviation, which John mentioned craft beer as being distinct.
Craft beer actually looks like the sort of innovation that you see in the digital economy. In countries like Australia, where that potential competition doctrine isn’t nearly as strong, craft beer is just another beer in the market for beer. Now, talk to any beer drinkers, and they would entirely disagree with that analysis, but it leads to that issue of if you’re going to have a doctrine, if you’re going to have an enforcement approach, you need to be very clear as to how it works and you need to be able to have it be more general than just, “Oh, it’s this part of the digital economy that we’re really worried about.”
Potential competition could arise in the financial services sectors, as Chris’s experience shows. It could potentially arise in the pharma sector. So saying that mergers analysis needs to be specific to the digital economy, I think is problematic. I think that I’m just jumping on an example that John gave to actually make that point.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Rob. Chris, you were nodding vigorously then.

BERG:
Only to fully support everything Rob said.

WEBB:
Well, Chris, while you have the floor, so to speak, we have been talking about the issues that have been raised by some of the high profile big tech mergers that everybody knows about.
But there are some interesting measures in the crypto space, I understand, not having any expertise in that space myself. Would you like to talk about whether, or start off a discussion about whether token mergers raise any antitrust concerns, and if so, what are those concerns and how could that be addressed?

BERG:
Look, it’s a really interesting issue. In the crypto economy, we’ve got a lot of parallel institutions and a lot of assets that look kind of like traditional assets, like shares and various things, but also function in a very different way and imply different governance rights and participation by the community over the nature of the firm or protocol or application or what have you. We’ve got these decentralized networks. The key thing to understand about these crypto and blockchain technologies is that, for the most part, if they are correctly decentralized, if they are properly decentralized, then there isn’t a single agency, there isn’t a single mind that makes decisions about what to do with the protocol or project. There isn’t a management, there isn’t a hierarchy that makes decisions about, well, we’re going to go in this direction or we’re going to go in that direction. It is, in an ideal state, developed by the community. The community tends to both own and use these protocols themselves.
With all that, it looks often a lot like companies, and we’ve got instances of planned mergers and acquisitions by different projects. There’s a project called the Fei protocol, that is proposing to merge with the Rari protocol and proposing to do a sort of token swap, and we won’t get into the details about that, but it’s the users and governors of these two protocols who are debating and trying to decide this.
This creates some really interesting problems just to look at it from a traditional mergers acquisition space. Now, competition regulators haven’t gone into this yet, because, A, it is very difficult. And B, it is pretty marginal of course to the rest of the economy. My prediction is that it’s going to get more and more important and interesting, but the key thing that I think is interesting from our perspective is when we’re blurring the boundaries between who owns the firm and who uses the firm’s products.
If a community decides to merge with another community, even if that might materially harm the competitive landscape of the crypto economy. Well, does that raise competition concerns? I don’t have an answer to that. I’m not sure that you can have an answer to that because the presumptions are so different from the traditional sort of crypto economy, but it is a really interesting thing to think about, and I suspect it’s going to become more and more significant as time goes by and more people are being onboarded into cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Chris. Has anyone else thought of that? Yeah, Rob has, of course.

NICHOLLS:
Sorry, I don’t want to monopolize things.
I think one of the key issues that flows from that is the issue of gun jumping. So, in traditional mergers analysis, one of the issues is unless and until your merger is cleared, you can’t operate as if the merger has occurred. Actually, if you’ve got two communities which are owners and users that are negotiating a potential merger, actually that negotiation is, for example, going to get to adjustments in rates between the exchange values of the tokens. In effect, even those discussions create some of the effects of the merger.
How do you deal with gun jumping is sensible policy. We’ve used it traditionally in mergers and mergers analysis. I think it starts to raise some really difficult issues that look sectorally specific. That takes away from my argument, “No, no, all this needs to be across all,” but I think we do need to start to recognize that once you start to get into these, the complexities, let alone the complexity of the merger analysis itself, then there are going to be issues that flow from the traditional way of dealing with mergers, such as the prohibition on gun jumping once the negotiation process is in place.

BERG:
It’s an interesting point because it would be very difficult to prevent those sorts of discussions, and if you wanted to prevent them, who would you be preventing from those occurring?
The question always becomes in these crypto and blockchain conversations is it’s all well and good to say, “Yes, this regulation applies in this place.” And we can make all sorts of arguments or you might need a license to do something, or you might be prevented from doing something else. It’s very hard to figure out how to enforce it, though, not least because you can’t necessarily identify who has been driving these things, but also because once they’ve been done, so once the merger has been effected between these two protocols, if it is, it’s unwindable. You can’t un-unwindable. You can’t roll it back. We see this across the crypto economy, just as a digression, a lot of people have argued that certain products on the blockchain should require various types of financial services license, in Australia particularly. That’s all well and good, but what if you were to withdraw a license for failure to comply with its terms? Well, what would you do? The thing’s still on the internet; can’t be taken down. It does create this field does create a whole lot of interesting regulatory challenges.

WEBB:
Well, on that note, we might move to our second topic, which is having acknowledged that there are a range of regulatory challenges in theories of harm or in competition policy or underlying analysis, let’s move to whether we think that different rules are needed or are justified for tech businesses or for particular parts of the digital economy, or overall. We might go to Sean to open up this topic.
Sean, do you think it’s just to have a different merger standard only for big tech or only for particular participants in the digital economy?

ENNIS:
I think that it’s commonly accepted in some countries that you might have a different standard for abuse of dominance based on size. I definitely understand the argument. But for mergers, I’m a little more concerned, to be honest, because I think it’s absolutely possible to come up with some economic indicia that would distinguish one group of firms from another. It might be the GAFAM center, it might be GAFAM plus, but you could come up with the indicia. You could have a policy rationale that these are the ones that you really care about, but I’m not sure you get the right treatment, and in particular, a just treatment and a fair treatment if some companies are singled out in merger analysis.
When you have smaller ones who are doing substantively the same type of deal from all the, in terms of gaining, perhaps gaining similar, if you could measure market power precisely, let’s say they were gaining the same amount of market power as the GAFAM plus, why should the GAFAM plus deal be stopped and the others not be stopped? I’m at a loss to figure out what the difference should be. Maybe that’s because I was raised working on a lot of smaller merger cases in which a lot of the concern was to set a standard that would apply to a broader set of merger cases, and so you wanted to establish the principles that would be generally applicable. I think this is moving away from having generally applicable principles, and that’s a concern for me.

WEBB:
John, what do you think? I think there are explicit calls in the US to bifurcate antitrust into two rules, for big and for everybody else. What do you think about this?

YUN:
Yeah, there are calls and you know, my position, I really couldn’t say it any better than what Sean just said. I call it discriminatory antitrust, that may be a little provocative, but we do engage in some of that, right?
If you have market power, or in Europe, abuse of dominance, that means there’s sort of a different set of presumptions and burdens placed on you, and that’s perfectly fine. That’s a market-based approach to analyzing firm behavior. We use a different lens if you have market power relative to if you don’t and that makes a lot of sense.
I think the bigger concern, however, is when you use discriminatory antitrust, not based off of market-based reasons, but size or identity. I think there you run into some issues, and as Sean said, you could have a firm that’s a medium-sized tech company that is the market leader in a certain area engaging in acquisition that would be under a rule of reason, but then you would have a Google or a Facebook who could be a distant second or third and looking to catch up to the incumbent who’s leading the market and that would be certainly a more scrutinized, if not outright banned, and they would have to vertically integrate in order to compete in an effective way. I think that’s really becoming more regulatory than enforcement of antitrust laws. I think that worries me and if we move in that direction, we need a good evidence that that regulatory approach would lead to better outcomes. I don’t think we’re there yet.

BERG:
Sorry, to jump in. Sort of taking that approach also just badly over politicizes the antitrust process, because Sean was talking about GAFAM plus. Here we have, I know it’s not your phrase, Sean, we’ve got a selection of companies and we can just add different ones at a given time. If you are the marginal company. If you are, say, IBM, wanting to stay out of that list of targeted firms, you’re going to invest a lot of funds in influencing the political process and people are going to invest a lot of funds bringing you into that political process as well.
I think it does exactly what we don’t want from antitrust policy, which is re-politicize it; take it away from this base level of analytics that we’ve been talking about here today and push it entirely into the political process. Very dangerous, as I see it.

WEBB:
Rob, what so you think?

NICHOLLS:
I agree and I think it’s that important distinction that yes, if there is abuse of market power or issues which are associated with market power, those are completely different from the mergers analyses.
For example, you might have, let’s take a traditional business, you might have pipeline operator which has pretty much a monopoly in one state. A pipeline operator which has pretty much a monopoly in another state. If the two merge, well, there is no lessening of competition, certainly no substantial lessening of competition, but you wouldn’t prevent the merger just because they’re two big pipeline companies. I think you need to think very carefully about saying, “Well GAFAM is different or GAFAM plus is different.” That politicization, which Chris worried about, I think one of the worries is that the plus bit turns out to be, “Yeah, well you’re a plus if you’re a US domiciled multinational and you’re not plus if you’re a European domiciled multinational,” and that becomes problematic in the analysis of mergers on a global basis.

WEBB:
Well, I think everybody’s agreed that having specific merger rules that apply to entities just because of their size is problematic for the range of reasons we’ve discussed. Everybody’s in favor of a more market-based analysis. That’s been referenced through most people’s responses to the market dominance or abuse or misuse of market power regimes that exist anywhere in the world.
What do you think about a notion that you have different merger rules for someone who has market power?

NICHOLLS:
You could potentially have a reverse onus of proof, but the risk, so that is you have to show that the merger will not lessen competition to whatever threshold your jurisdiction requires. The problem is that that has the effect of slowing down merger processes in a dynamic environment.
The risk is that unless the enforcement, the actual mergers analysis by the competition authority, is very efficient, that the mergers themselves will never occur, and the economic benefits and the consumer welfare benefits will never flow because the signal is, “Ah, well, you’re big, so we’re going to really look hard at you and we’ll spend months and months and months doing it, so please don’t bother,” which is the effective signal that comes from this. I think we’ve seen in other jurisdictions, perhaps the issue that says, well, if there is a sensitive sector, then potentially there is an expectation that merger clearance flows in a different way. But if you’re going to take that sort of approach and have exceptions from a normal or usual process, are the resources to the competition regulator to ensure that that process is expedited, or at least follows a timeline which cannot be, does not have clock stops from the regulator’s side, but might have clock stops from the merger parties’ side.

WEBB:
Anyone else have a view? Sean has a view.

ENNIS:
Yeah, I think there have been some proposals to both flip the standard of proof and reduce checks and balances on the competition authority, and I think if you put those two together, that’s a very dangerous combination, because effectively you might end up with the administrative authorities, the prosecutors, having both a stronger ability to stop deals and less control over themselves to make sure that they were acting in a reasoned way.
I’m really concerned by that type of development. I wouldn’t want to see that, because I think that administrative authorities tend to try to push the line when they can. They may feel like if given this kind of liberty, they might just push the line too far. It might be that there’s a low risk with pushing it too far. That might be the argument they would use. But I think it’s really important to have a backstop that’s demanding accountability from the authorities at all times when they do act and so that must be maintained if there is any change in the standards.

WEBB:
John, what do you think?

YUN:
No, I don’t have anything to add. It’s a terrific response, I’m just listening now.

WEBB:
Well, looking at this from a different perspective, we’ve referred to GAFAM, of course, because everybody does. But let’s take a look at Spotify as an example of the issues, I suppose, that we’ve been tossing around. Tell us what you think about whether or not Spotify should face the same standards of scrutiny, having embarked on a number of acquisitions as we’ve been discussing as a possibility for Facebook and Google, et cetera. What do you think about that?

YUN:
I think Spotify is a really good example of the dangers of what we’ve been sort of discussing in terms of having a different set of rules based simply on the identity of a firm.
I just did some looking into Spotify and they’re a very big company. They’re not part of the elite of the big tech companies, but they are the clear number one leader, in streaming music subscription services which is a big market and Apple, Amazon, and Google are certainly big players, but they’re playing catch up. I looked at Spotify’s acquisitions over the past couple of years, and it was eye-opening how many they’ve made. Just to give you a broad list, it’s Findaway, Podz, Betty Labs, Ringer, Megaphone, Anchor, Gimlet, Cutler.
I would read their actual press releases, and Spotify was very unabashed at saying, “Look, we’re buying this to jumpstart our entry into podcasting, our entry into audio books, we want to be the premier destination for everything audio in the digital economy.” They have a very strong ambition, and good for them.
It actually has worked. Statistically, they were behind Apple and Podcast, but after these acquisitions and obviously other investments they’ve made, they are now, according to Spotify, so this could be in dispute, they are the number one destination for podcasting globally, currently. Here we have acquisitions that have allowed Spotify to compete with Apple in an adjacent market, but some could recast this. What if this was Apple instead of Spotify? I think our lens would be totally different. I think the public pressure would be completely different on the agencies and the courts and our perception of these acquisitions as quote, “Good,” for consumers would be very different.
That’s my concern. Here we’re swapping the identity of a firm simply for actual market-based analysis. I think to me, Spotify is a good example of a very important company, that’s a market leader, that’s using acquisitions in a way that many would accept as pro-competitive, but then we drop those principles when we switch out the identity and I think that’s what worries me rather than, than having a market-based sort of fact-based approach to these types of deals.

BERG:
It does worry me sometimes in the mergers and acquisitions arguments that we don’t fully recognize that these mergers can be extremely pro-competitive, because of course they are taking not just off Apple, but Spotify is moving into audio books. Audio books has been dominated by Amazon, and it’s Audible thing, and it’s actually very pro-consumer as well. If you look at the shape of the podcasting industry, as it was when it was dominated by Apple, it was actually very difficult to sort of expand audiences outside the Apple ecosystem. It was very directed at one particular side of the cell phone markets of the iOS of the OS market and so forth. This has actually massively and quite radically transformed podcasting.
I used to be a podcaster so I’m really, really engaged in this, and I’m super pleased that as both a consumer and producer of podcasts, things are just more accessible, and I think that’s going to happen for audio books as well. That’s an unambiguously, pro-consumer merger story and unambiguously pro-competitive merger story.

WEBB:
All right, just before we move from the topic of whether we need different rules for different types of tech businesses, we’ve spoken a lot about the different merger rules, but, Chris, frontier technologies, do you think that there are different rules necessary to address any potential antitrust problems that might arise in frontier technologies?

BERG:
Look, thank you for indulging me, I’d like to talk about blockchains and cryptocurrency again. Again, I think a lot of things operate in a different, in a lot of different dynamics, but there are some interesting examples of what we’re talking about a lot is digital infrastructure and shared digital infrastructure across multiple firms.
For a lot of the use cases that we think are most exciting about blockchain, say tracking products across a supply chain, it’s very important that you get, if not the whole industry on board a shared piece of infrastructure, certainly a large part of that industry. So a lot matters about, well, we’ve built the shared infrastructure and we’re all going to sign up and we’re all going to use this standard or this smart contract platform, or what have you. How are we going to govern that smart contract platform? Who are the participants in governance going to be?
We’ve seen a number of really substantial infrastructure plays by for example, IBM. There’s shipping; the shipping company Maersk coming together and building out a trade lens product that they’re trying to onboard everybody onto. They’ve found that very difficult because it’s been seen as a sort of pro-Maersk play within the shipping industry. At the same time, if we’re going to get the gains that we’re going to have to standardize. We’re going to have to share infrastructure.
I predict in the next couple of years, that’s going to come really to the forefront of competition and analysis. Certainly anti-competitive behaviors. Some competitors might be working through the governance of these networks to keep out some of their competitors as well. Really interesting area, a lot’s going to ride on what constitutes shared governance, what constitutes genuinely decentralized. But I think everybody in this call’s going to have to tackle this issue sooner than you think.

WEBB:
Yeah, well, that sounds like a huge topic. Rob, go.

NICHOLLS:
No, I was just going to say, Chris says shared governance, somebody else says cartel conduct. It’s a very difficult issue to deal with.

WEBB:
We might move away from that topic, which we obviously would need years to talk about, back to merger analysis and remedies, and the sort of enterprises we’ve been discussing operate across boundaries, of course, there’s, and we all come from specific national regimes, which have some similarities and have some differences.
What do we think about the notion that we might need some kind of global approach; some kind of realignment that might be driven by who? We might start with, we might start with Rob and then move to everybody else to see what they think about it. A non-national based approach to merger analysis or, Chris, broader analysis of these sorts of enterprises.

NICHOLLS:
I think there’s the potential for having a globally coordinated approach. Even though, as you say, Kirsten, that you’ve got jurisdictionally specific legislation, there is the underlying rationale for why there needs to be a merger analysis and merger control is broadly common, at least amongst the OECD countries and almost all countries which have some form of competition law or antitrust laws. So the potential is there. One approach might be to use the leverage of the OECD, but I think the risk of using the OECD is who it excludes, rather than that the OECD isn’t the right place to do it. The OECD’s competition analysis, their support of competition regulators is great. But it is a formal international organization.
I actually think that the more likely way in which you’ll get at least de facto standardization, even if it’s not a formalized standardization, is through organized, I was going to say organizations like the International Competition Network, but there is no organization like the ICN, so I think the ICN has the potential for doing it. The issue there is the ICN can’t make rules. It can’t, but it can get to an approach where actually, if you look at most of the people, most of the competition authorities that engage in dawn raids, you’ll see that actually the learnings that they have, have been shared through the ICN, more than they have through the OECD or any other body. So, if there’s going to be a level of harmonization, having an informal body such as the ICN, seems to me a preferable approach. It will allow jurisdictionally specific legislative changes, if they’re required, without having the, “Well, we’re not going to do it because, just because the OECD says it’s a good idea.” So that actually sounds much more like a blockchain approach. The consensus that you can get through the ICN has the potential for leading to much more efficient outcomes, because the economic rationale can be agreed, but on an informal basis.

WEBB:
Sean, what do you think?

ENNIS:
Yeah, this is a tough question to come. Just for you to know it before I answer, I worked at the OECD for a long number of years, so I’ve thought about this from that perspective, also. Just quickly for Rob, the OECD has bodies associated with it that don’t have exactly the same members as the OECD and the OECD competition committee has an association status, which is equivalent to membership of that committee. So, there are ways that it can work. There are ways that WTO could potentially do something that’s very different from its current process as well.
I think if you really want to have a guarantee of consistency, you do need something more than promises of cooperation. You need an enforcement mechanism that would somehow have laws and procedures that were uniform everywhere. That would be a suggestion that you might want to have some global powers.
On the other hand, I think if you look at digital markets, in particular, there may, there is an argument that remedies can be much more easily customized to particular geographic areas in the digital space than for other types of products. Just as one example, it’s not a merger example, but if you want to disenroll from a service that you’ve signed up to, that’s being provided over the internet, if you’re in California, you can do that often, much more easily than elsewhere.
One of the reasons is that there is a specific law in California that makes the companies have a better process of disenrollment, and that’s the type of thing to think about on the national side. Another one is that if you have national remedies, you don’t move the whole world towards one specific outcome, which might not actually be the best one. You have much more opportunity for experimentation and discovery among regulators before you move, and then perhaps some evidence gathering, before you move to perhaps a common view of what the best outcome is.

WEBB:
John, what do you think?

YUN:
This actually reminds me of when I was growing up in Savannah, Georgia. My science teacher said, “Oh, you better get ready, we’re moving away from this Crown English system to the metric system. It’s going to be outdated and we need to harmonize and science has been held back by this dual system.” Well, here we are today, we’re still in pounds and feet and inches and all that and we seem to be getting by and certainly language is another thing.
I know those are quite different, but, ultimately I do think there is value in having different differentiated jurisdictions trying to get at the right answer. I know there are problems as well, but I think a lot of learning can be developed from each sort of system that’s out there.
I do think that there are problems with harmonization because if you’re a company, they’re not so excited about the marketplace of ideas and all these different rules. It might be intellectually stimulating, but as a practical matter, getting a deal through across all these jurisdictions, or defending a practice in multiple jurisdictions is exhausting and it’s costly and it’s resource intensive.
So, initiatives that Rob and Sean mentioned, the OECD, ICN, I think those are important. How important should they be? Those are obviously different questions. But I do like those initiatives, I do like the sharing of ideas. I do think that there is some sympathy that we should have towards moving to some harmonization. I don’t know how, I haven’t thought about that problem deeply, but I’m certainly open to the thought that we do need better harmonization.

BERG:
Also the politics of this is quite difficult, so it’s interesting viewing this from an Australian perspective. In Australia, there’s a move, certainly on some sides of politics, to assert a sovereign control over the large tech giants. So there’s this drive and we got this from the requirement that Google fund newspapers and Facebook fund news outlets and so forth, but more generally there’s this idea that for things that affect Australians, we should be able to have Australian public policy makers make those choices.
Now that’s all well and good and that sounds really wonderful if you’re an Australian policymaker and maybe it sounds great as an Australian consumer, but often it looks almost comical in practice. I’m thinking particularly of the ACCC, Australia’s competition policy regulator, trying to impose its supervision over Google’s acquisition of Fitbit.
Fitbit, an American company, Google or Alphabet, an American company, and the ACCC was trying to hold it up and check that it was okay under Australian law before it went through. This has got a very much sort of a “we warn the czar” type vibe to it in Australia, and it just really emphasizes to me how in these globalized markets…
Yes, it might not be possible to harmonize competition policy, and we might not want that as intellectuals interested in seeing discovery and innovation in this space, but at the same time, it looks kind of silly in practice if all these sovereign nations are trying to impose their own individual sovereign regulatory frameworks over tech mergers.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Chris. Well, we only have a couple of minutes left. We could continue this conversation for a really long time, obviously.
I’d like to invite each of our panelists to make some, whatever closing remarks they’d like to make. Might go back to alphabetical, but reverse, so might start with you, Rob.

NICHOLLS:
I think the key message that I have is the one that I’ve made before. It’s really important in any changes to merger control which are looking to be sector specific within the digital economy relating to a small number of businesses within that digital economy, to be certain that any changes don’t stifle innovation. Innovation in the digital economy is the driver of innovation and the driver of productivity in national economies.

WEBB:
Sean?

ENNIS:
I would just say that I think a lot of tools do exist for competition authorities to deal with digital deals. There’s a question of how large one has to be as a country in order to successfully address some of the international deals and to not to be ignored. But I think there’s a lot of opportunity for behavioral remedies that could be reasonable on a national level. The tools are there. They can look at in a very fact specific way at deals. I think some of the deals people talk about were ones that one might’ve been concerned about at the time with the right facts. Just what matters for me is having the appropriate process and a fair ability of both firms and make sure the regulators or competition authorities get the right information and have an opportunity to input before there’s any final decision.

WEBB:
John?

YUN:
My final theme is really that we need to be focused on dynamic incentives rather than static ones. I think this harkens on what Rob said in that innovation is the key driver of wealth in societies. This view that we need to look for short run gains, which I think we often fall into a trap of, and it gets heavily regulatory. It gets to be breaking up companies and various things like that. We need to really look into the dynamic incentive effects of these various policies, and I think that will drive us into the right direction.

WEBB:
And Chris, the final word.

BERG:
Completely agree with all that’s been said. The only thing I would add is that we’re innovating at such a rapid pace, not just on the types of things that we do in the digital economy, but also in the way that we organize economic exchange. We know this. We have now spent the better part of a decade or more understanding and being involved in the gig economy. These restructures of corporate organizations. Looking at the technologies that are coming through and the technologies that we’re going to be considering over the next decade or so, that restructuring of economic organization is just going to become more and more evident and more and more significant, and it’s going to force, I think, a rethink of what do we mean by consumer harm, what do we mean by market dominance when we look at it from a regulatory perspective.

WEBB:
Thanks very much.
Well, thank you all for such an interesting discussion. We’re going to have to leave it there, we’ve reached our hour. A whole lot of interesting ideas and thoughts that can be further developed. A discussion that could go on for a very long time, but we’re going to call it a day now. So thank you very much to each of our panelists.

417,"January 18, 2022",Is Loss of Privacy the Price that Consumers Pay for Otherwise Free Online Services?,"
One of the consumer harms from monopoly online platforms commentators point to is the loss of privacy. That is, privacy is a dimension over which platforms complete, and lack of competition has generated low levels of privacy. However, some view serious difficulties in bringing actions when the anticompetitive effect relate to quality instead of price. Thus, some commentators have argued that loss of privacy should be thought of as a price that consumers pay for otherwise free services. Here I argue that the difficulties in analyzing competition over quality are likely easier to overcome than most think. I show that at the profit-maximizing level of privacy consumers will generally prefer more privacy to less even with the worse advertising matches that would result. I also show in the merger context how to quantify the anticompetitive effects in quality without the need to specifically measure quality.

I. INTRODUCTION
The intersection of online privacy policy and antitrust enforcement has received significant attention recently. Commentators approach the subject from at least three different angles. For some, concerns over privacy should play no part in the enforcement of competition laws. For those commentators, if anything, privacy concerns are primarily consumer protection problem rather than the purview of competition laws.2
Another group of commentators see privacy as a potential concern of competition laws but see privacy as a dim...

The dynamics of competition in data-powered ecosystems are motivated by user-related network effects and centered around users. Incumbent platforms thus have incentives to build strategies to protect their market, aimed at shielding their user base from contestability by rivals. This includes users from related markets, which may serve as an entry point to the core market of the ecosystem, especially when related markets are data rich. Fostering contestability in ecosystems protected by data-driven network effects and switching costs is intrinsically linked to data portability and interoperability.

This note discusses recent developments at the Brazilian Antitrust Authority – CADE – on handling digital markets and platform cases. It provides a brief view of official reports and jurisprudence, also bringing the perspective for the coming years. Despite the absence of institutional changes directed to digital markets, CADE undertook extensive efforts to properly assess such mergers and abuse of dominance cases. The results are visible and important given Brazil’s position as a developing economy. Considering the BRICS countries, CADE is an early adopter of the concepts and evolution is visible. On the other hand, abuse of dominance case analysis is still in earlier steps and divided in its legal standard. When discussing digital platform antitrust there are many global challenges with no simple answers. CADE is up to the task, with transparency and engagement with the antitrust community.

Following the successful launch of its London office last year, Van Bael & Bellis adds to the leadership of its expanding EU/UK competition team with the appointment of partner Porter Elliott as co-head of the firm’s competition law practice. 
Porter will work alongside senior partner Andrzej Kmiecik, appointed head of practice in 2019, in managing the growing team.
Porter joined Van Bael & Bellis in 1997 and was made partner in 2005. He advises on all aspects of competition law and is one of the firm’s most experienced merger control lawyers, having advised on more than 100 transactions over the past 25 years.
During his career, Porter has been involved in some of the most notable deals in the market, including Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype and the successful opposition to the proposed joint venture between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, both of which were recognized by Global Competition Review with matter of the year awards. He has assisted clients such as Boeing and Motorola on numerous acquisitions and acted as co-counsel for Halliburton in the EU merger control filing and review of its US$34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes, one of the largest and most complex transactions ever to be subject to an EU merger control proceeding. More recently, Porter advised Fincantieri on its proposed acquisition of rival shipbuilder Chantiers de l’Atlantique, one of the major EU Phase II merger reviews of 2020. He was also involved in Take-Two’s proposed acquisition of video game publisher Codemasters.

421,"January 5, 2022",Sen. Warren & Rep. Jayapal Want Google To Stop Asking For DOJ’s Kanter Recusal,"


Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapa told Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday, January 5, to stop trying to “bully” Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter into recusal, they shared with CNBC.
“Google should focus on complying with antitrust law rather than attempting to rig the system with these unseemly tactics,” the lawmakers wrote.
Following Kanter’s confirmation in the Senate in November, Google requested the DOJ review whether he should be recused from cases and investigations involving its business. Google cited Kanter’s prior work for its rivals like Yelp in antitrust matters involving its business, and pointed to previous statements about Google’s alleged dominance to argue he’d already made up his mind on its liability.Related: Google Seeks Recusal From Kantner Over Yelp & Microsoft Cases
Kanter has not committed to recusing himself from matters involving Google, but told lawmakers ahead of his confirmation that he would consult DOJ ethics officials about whether he should do so. A recusal would bar Kanter from involvement in the department’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Google and likely any future investigations, though responsibility would fall to his deputies.
Warren and Jayapal wrote that Google’s argument “distorts federal ethics requirements, improperly claiming that because Mr. Kanter has worked to enforce antitrust law against Google in the past, he cannot do so on behalf of the federal government now.”They wrote that under federal ethics law and regulations, recusal is required when a person has a financial interest involving certain parties, worked for an employer or client in the past two years that is a party in a particular matter, or would be deemed potentially impartial by a reasonable person with the relevant facts.
The Democrats said that since Kanter has not represented Google or the US, the two parties that would be named in any federal lawsuit against Google, that should not be a basis for his recusal.

422,"January 4, 2022",Breaking Up Firms,"
By John Kwoka & Tommaso Valletti1
 
I. Introduction
Many features of antitrust policy continue to reflect strongly held priors rather than good economics and evidence. For a recent example of this, one need look no further than the question of whether policy should view breaking up consummated mergers and dominant firms as a legitimate tool. We are routinely told that corporate breakups are impossible, or too costly and difficult, or counterproductive, and certainly unwise for competition agencies even to consider.
One might expect these arguments to be followed by examples of breakups that proved these points, that is, where breakups were unworkable or disastrous and ex post generally seen as unwise efforts by competition authorities. Paradoxically, the most common references in these discussions are to antitrust cases such as Standard Oil and AT&T. These are truly odd citations because both are considered successful breakups — not perfect, to be sure, but hardly the disasters that breakup opponents forewarn.
Moreover, the historical record includes many other examples of successful breakups by competition agencies. Some of these have been dominant firms, while others have involved consummated mergers. Regulators, too, in various countries have broken up hundreds of firms in major industries, including telecom, electricity, and rail, among others. Beyond that, each year companies themselves initiate almost as many divestitures as they do mergers, further demonstrating the feasibility of breakups. Notably, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and Toshiba have recently announced their plans to break up or spin off major units, following Exelon, Pfizer, and others earlier this year.
Breakups are, in short, not infeasible, not uncommon, and certainly not doomed to failure. To be clear, we are not advocating that any particular firm be broken up, let alone all firms that are large or have certain characteristics. Rather, we argue that competition agencies should view breakups as a viable and useful policy option under certain circumstances.
In this note we will explain the relevant framework for determining the right circumstances for a breakup to be an effective tool. We then evaluate breakups’ actual use in several different settings — the AT&T case among others as relevant examples — and draw from these experiences some lessons and principles that should guide their future use.
 
II. Designing Policy Toward Consummated Mergers and Dominant Firms
Although there has been considerable discussion about breaking up both dominant firms as well as consummated mergers, our discussion begins with the latter. One reason is that a focus on mergers highlights several key analytical issues raised by breakups as a policy tool. These include ex ante vs. ex post policy actions, prediction accuracy, and costs. A second reason is that a great deal of the tech companies’ size has in fact resulted from their merger activity. The five major tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft — have collectively acquired more than 1,000 companies over the past twenty years,2 and many of the competitive concerns surrounding these companies stem from conduct related to these acquisitions. We shall return to the issue of breaking up dominant firms later, but for now, we study merger breakups.
 A. Consummated Mergers
Merger enforcement has almost always been an exercise in prediction. The competition agency, alerted to a merger of some consequence, uses various quantitative and qualitative tools to predict the likely competitive effects of the merger if consummated. But evidence indicates that economic predictions of the outcomes of mergers are too often incorrect, erring systematically toward permissiveness.3 The reasons for the error rate lie with the limitations of economic analysis, which applies theoretical and empirical understanding to each new merger that may well differ from models or past experiences. The reasons for the systematic error favoring “clearance” (approval) of mergers are caution on the part of the competition agency together with a high judicial standard of proof that a merger is likely to be anticompetitive before prohibiting it.
But if ex ante predictions suffer from these unavoidable flaws and limitations, good policy design requires consideration of ex post intervention into those approved mergers that prove to be anticompetitive. Otherwise, erroneously permissive ex ante predictions amount to a permanent license to harm competition. Keys to any ex post policy are the incremental gains in information from observation of post-merger conduct and the relative costs associated with ex post policy action. In most cases, the incremental gains in information are self-evident. At some point, the merged firm will act in a manner that either confirms the original competitive concerns or makes clear that approval was the appropriate policy. This determination can be facilitated by a requirement that approved mergers file basic information on the key variables of concern with the competition agency for a reasonable period after the merger.
The other factor to be considered is the incremental cost of any ex post breakup. Some assert that challenge and prohibition to a proposed merger typically imposes few costs relative to breakup of a consummated merger, which is routinely said or at least implied to be prohibitive, and by itself a reason to avoid breaking up merged firms. There is scant evidence on this question, but what exists does not support that view. One of the few systematic investigations was completed by Bain & Company.4 It studied some forty self-initiated breakups and found one-time breakup costs averaging about 1 percent of revenues, mostly incurred in the year of the breakup and involving administrative expenses. Perhaps more to the point, Turnstall offers an insider’s account of the massive, court-mandated AT&T spinoff of its long-distance operation and breakup of its local service into seven geographical divisions.5 He concludes, “divestiture was accomplished in minimal time, with the least possible impact of the corporation’s constituencies, and with no major disruption in the nation’s telephone service.”6
These studies and experiences underscore two important points. First and foremost, though breakups do have costs, they obviously can be successfully managed. One database of U.S. enforcement actions against consummated mergers reports 41 post-closing divestitures since 2006.7 While most divestitures were completed shortly after consummation and perhaps therefore involved little additional cost, eleven occurred at least three years after closing and more likely after at least some integration. Second, as illustrated by the AT&T breakup, divestiture is facilitated by the existence of natural “fault lines” between a company’s stages and divisions. Mergers often leave similar fault lines between the merging entities. These represent obvious starting points for a competition agency to consider the scope of post-merger divestitures and breakups.
The Bain study focused on breakups that firms themselves decided to undertake. Although some issues are therefore different, these experiences make clear that breakups are entirely feasible and not prohibitively costly. Indeed, one study found a total of 1611 self-initiated breakups by Fortune 100 companies in the 1990s, a number more than two-thirds the number of acquisitions by these same companies during the same period.8
 B. Dominant Firms
Dominant firms that engage in anticompetitive actions raise issues that are in part similar and in part different from those above. As noted earlier, the major tech companies are in no small part constructs built up from large numbers of mergers and acquisitions, and many of the competitive concerns they raise are the result of these acquisitions. These competitive concerns involve matters such as self-preferencing, display bias, and misuse of competitive information. These could in principle be addressed by undoing the mergers using the same method as described above. That method involves identifying the fault lines between the businesses and uncoupling the pieces along those lines.9
Competition agencies have been reluctant to attempt to break up such firms. They have been wary of difficulties and hazards of doing so and of the consequences if a breakup proves unsuccessful. Some caution is appropriate, of course; in industries subject to tipping such as the tech industry, ex ante policy is all the more important in order to preserve any emerging competition. That said, optimal policy design makes clear why strict avoidance of breakups is both unwise and unnecessary. One reason already described is that there are many precedents and examples of successful breakups, while systematic contrary examples are rare. The other reason is that the alternatives commonly proposed to address anticompetitive activity by the dominant tech companies have proven themselves generally ineffective.
What are those alternatives? The basic alternative is a “rules and remedies” approach. This approach does not involve breakup or divestiture, or any structural change to the dominant company. Rather, it imposes rules on the company to prevent it from engaging in the specific anticompetitive conduct at issue. For example, it may instruct the firm to avoid biasing search results in its favor or require it to disclose information necessary to allow for viable competition. This approach, of course, is essentially the same as so-called conduct or behavioral remedies for anticompetitive mergers, with much the same rationale: if the specific offensive conduct can be prevented, structural reform is not necessary.
The problem with “rules and remedies” is that considerable experience now reveals the inherent flaws in this approach, and evidence makes clear its ineffectiveness. The fundamental problems are that (1) these rules and remedies instruct the firm to act against its own interests, that is, ordering it to engage in conduct that reduces its profit; (2) consequently, the firm is incentivized to seek to avoid, evade, or otherwise minimize the effect of the rule; and (3) the firm has advantages compared to the agency overseeing the remedy in terms of informational asymmetries, technology management, and pretextual advantages in succeeding in defeating the restraint.
Two examples serve to illustrate the point. The U.S. government settled its case against Microsoft with a conduct or behavioral remedy that sought to make it stop certain practices and to provide outside firms with certain protocols that would allow them to compete. With respect to the latter, the company immediately claimed it could not comply in the initial three-year time frame, then that it could not do so within five years. Each time, the court “blinked,” unable to assess the merits of Microsoft’s excuses, and extended the deadline for compliance. The necessary protocols were finally provided, albeit in not quite complete form, nearly a decade after the issues were decided and order put in place — and long after they were important for competition.10
In the EU, Google has long been under orders from the European Commission to open up its shopping site and, separately, to untie Google applications and services, such as its Play Store, distributed on Android devices with other Google applications such as its search engine.11 It has repeatedly delayed or undermined compliance, despite billions of euros in fines. As asserted above, these types of orders or remedies generally are ineffective since they basically instruct the firm to act against its own interest—indeed, to weaken its own creation. Such mandates are fundamentally at odds with the incentives of the company, so the company will predictably minimize or evade the intended constraint. And the information, technology, and tools to do so are very much in their hands.12
Faced with these factors, regulatory agencies have often employed structural changes to resolve otherwise intractable competitive problems. Dozens of electricity companies in the United States have undergone both vertical and horizontal breakups. In other countries, dozens of telecoms, hundreds of electricity companies, as well as railroads and other integrated infrastructure companies have been broken up. Regulators often first attempt to address the problems with rules and remedies, only to discover — for the reasons we have described — the futility of those efforts.
In light of this considerable experience and evidence demonstrating the lack of a viable alternative, we conclude that where the essential competitive problem with a company is its structure — in the sense that its anticompetitive behavior flows inexorably from that structure and is otherwise difficult if not impossible to prevent — it follows that the necessary solution likely lies in altering that structure. Efforts to address the competitive problems with these companies through rules and remedies is a deeply flawed strategy, one that may sound appealing because it avoids confronting the hard reality of a breakup, but one that has not worked and does not work. We have run that experiment and know how it comes out.
To be sure, the same structural remedy is probably not the solution for the core platform monopoly that lies at the heart of many tech companies. Fragmenting a platform natural monopoly will not likely produce competing platforms. Unless there is substantial differentiation among the resulting pieces (which can in fact happen), those pieces of the original platform will likely coalesce as network economies and tipping drive reconsolidation. Other measures instead of, or together with, a breakup are likely needed in this case.
 
III. Recommendations and Conclusions
The above analysis makes clear that firm breakups are quite realistic and, indeed, not unusual. In the case of consummated mergers, they represent an essential complement to ex ante policy based on inherently imperfect predictions. In the case of dominant tech companies, breakups address a crucial source of their growth and competitively problematic behavior. Experience with breakups of consummated mergers reveals a record of considerable success, whereas efforts to find alternatives to breakups in both cases — mergers and tech company conduct — have regularly failed.
In this setting breakups represent a viable and effective tool for competition agencies — not an entirely novel one, nor one that should be used automatically, but certainly not one to be avoided due to alleged but unsubstantiated concerns over costs or ineffectiveness.

Key to Facebook’s growth, for example, has been its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram and perhaps now Oculus. Google’s dominance in digital advertising has in large part been the result of its acquiring DoubleClick, AdMob and other elements of the ad stack, with new extensions such as Fitbit. Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have acquired numerous complementary, upstart or nascent competitors.

423,"December 22, 2021",Digital M&A: A Flat World or a Region-Specific Issue?,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Digital M&A: A Flat World or a Region-Specific Issue?. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Luke WOODWARD:
Well, welcome and good day to Dynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward in the Asia Pacific Region. This is the fourth session in this program. There’s been three prior sessions covering developments across India, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia—and I’m sure I’m missing some places—which have had fantastic panelists and moderators on them.
Today we’re going to focus more into developments in Australia, and we’ve got a great lineup for that, and I’ll introduce them in a moment. Our particular focus today will be around developments and the administration of the merger regime in Australia, and some policy reform initiatives that have been put on the table by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Over the course of today, I think we should explore a range of kind of critical issues that are not just critical in Australia, but that we are seeing play out around the world.
Firstly, what are the sources of concern here in terms of digital transactions? Are digital platforms serial acquirers in a way that increases or entrenches market power? Are there examples of acquisitions which should not have been allowed to proceed? Are digital sector specific merger rules necessary or justified? And we’ll come back to some specific proposals from the ACCC. In that regard, are there good learnings from international proposals? And we’ll have the benefit to get some comparative assessment here, particularly from Joel, in particular, thinking about the UK proposals for bespoke merger control for acquisitions by digital platforms, and what may be the unintended consequences of strict merger controls on innovation. We’ll have the ability to get some real insight into the impact and the importance of innovation within a holistic competition assessment.
So let me introduce myself. I’m Luke Woodward, I’m a competition partner at Gilbert & Tobin in Australia. Then to our panelists, and we’ve got a great panel to explore these issues.
Firstly, if I could just introduce Tom Leuner. Tom is the Executive General Manager for Mergers, Exemptions and Digital. So he’s in exactly the right spot for this discussion. Tom there’s been no issue in kind of merger regulation control and policy development in this country in the last 20 years that Tom has been centrally involved in, but more important and particularly relevant to this discussion is that the ACCC and Tom are very well connected with the international policy debate around mergers. So I think we’ll get both very Australian specific reflections from Tom that will then connect into kind of where the broader debate is going.
Our next panelist is Jacqui Downes. Jacqui Downes is a Senior Competition Partner from Allens Linklater in Sydney, and she’s the national head of their practice in Australia. Jacqui has extensive experience in Competition Law, but particular experience in media and digital markets that I think allows her to bring a deep insight to this issue. And Jacqui will be able to give us, and to the broader audience, a perspective on policy developments and practical administration in Australia.
Then we welcome Joel Bamford. Joel, I think has just recently joined Fingleton Associates, but maybe a week or so ago, Joel was basically the head of mergers at the CMA where he was not just responsible for the case oversight, but actually policy initiatives as well. We’ll really particularly be turning to Joel to get some kind of comparative assessments of developments here in Australia.
And then lastly, and definitely not least, is Professor David Teece from the Haas Business School at Berkeley. I think we’ll turn to David in this discussion to really make sure that we’re thinking about these issues in the right way, that we’re carefully thinking about what’s important, particularly the challenges around driving innovation into the policy discussions as a central part of the discussion, not just as some hopeful outworking from competition policy, but a critical part to actually the analysis, and that will draw very much on David’s work in the 1990s and earlier in relation to the dynamic capabilities of firms and dynamic competition. And, David, there’s probably no time, I think, in the evolution of competition policy, where that work and those insights is probably more important.
I think we’ve got an excellent panel today. I thought it would be useful, just given the breadth of the audience, to maybe just set a little bit of the scene of what’s going on here in Australia in terms of just overview of competition law, administration, and policy development. So it’s a big question, but I’m going to pass over to you, Jacqui, to just set the scene and then we’ll dive in to some of the merger specific issues. So, Jacqui, if I could just pass to you.


Jacqueline DOWNES:
Thanks very much, Luke. And thank you for inviting me to speak at this webinar.
Australia has been at the forefront right at the very beginning of development in competition law and policy looking at digital issues. This started way back in 2017, when the ACCC kicked off a two year digital platform inquiry, a very broad ranging examination of the issues that are facing digital platforms in terms of competition law, and in particular, the impact on media in Australia. This was really one of the first start regulators globally to start a real in-depth look at these issues and certainly kick-started a wave of investigations and inquiries by regulators all around the world over the last four years.
The original report, the Digital Platform Report, or the DPI report, focused on the fact that digital search engines and social media platforms, as digital content aggregators, as well having a media and advertising markets. The report made a series of recommendations for reform, some of which have already been enacted, including the introduction of the news media bargaining code, really the world’s first, which has been largely successful. Even though it’s technically doesn’t apply to any of the platforms yet, the threat of that media bargaining code has been successful in achieving some fairly negotiated commercial agreements between the digital platforms and a number of news media businesses. Other proposals that were put forward at the time are in the process of further consultation, including amendments to privacy laws. The final report did introduce, or recommend, a number of other measures that haven’t yet been introduced, and these include changes to the merger laws to incorporate additional merger factors that target nascent acquisitions and advanced notification requirements by digital platforms. This has now been wrapped up in the merger proposals that the ACCC, the more broad-ranging merger proposals we’ll come to that the ACCC has recently announced.
Following that initial two year inquiry, the government directed the ACCC to undertake a broader five-year inquiry into digital markets, with reports delivered every six months. And this allows the ACCC to do a bit more of a deep dive into various segments of digital platforms. And there’ve been three interim reports in the digital platform service inquiry. First, there was one in relation to online private messaging services, search engines, and social media. The second was into app marketplaces, and the third in web browsers and search engines, including the effectiveness of choice screens. And the ACCC is due to deliver its forth interim report on online retail marketplaces in March next year.
The ACCC was also directed, following its initial inquiry, to take a targeted inquiry into digital advertising services, or ad tech. The final report in this inquiry was handed down in September, 2021, with the ACCC, again, making findings that digital platforms had market power, and that various measures would be needed to address market power issues in relation to those digital platforms, particularly in relation to issues around data and self-preferencing.
The ACCC has now announced that it will be conducting a much broader review of whether there’s a need for specific digital platform regulation throughout the course of next year. So each of the reports sets out a range of findings regarding market power and the conduct of various digital platforms and the resulting competition and consumer issues. It stated that these issues have been broadly similar in nature.
Other than the media bargaining code, I think the ACCC’s view is that many of these issues around self-preferencing, tying and bundling strategies, and strong network effects are broad across a range of platforms, a range of issues, including app stores and ad tech, use of social media, choice screens. The ACCC has indicated that this broader regulation may be necessary.
In terms of mergers, Rod Sims has also recently kicked off the debate and as part of the broader suite of merger reform,. He also proposed to introduce a digital platform-specific regime, and restated the recommendations that he made back in 2019 to introduce new merger factors, to address acquisitions of nascent competitors, and a mandatory notification regime. It’s also suggested, whilst there’s no data yet, there might be a specific test for our digital platforms in the acquisition of nascent competitors.
Outside of the ACCC inquiries, there’s also been a number of significant core proceedings commenced against digital platforms. One of the most significant cases here, as well as in the US, has been now brought by Epic Games against Apple, which will go to trial in 2022. In this case that the guidance it’s alleged that Apple misused its market power by removing the Epic’s app from the App Store after it offered consumers an alternative payment method. A number of other private litigations have been commenced against Facebook and Google as well, alleging misuse of market power. The ACCC has also taken action against Google and Facebook in relation to consumer law issues; for making false or misleading representations to consumers. So, you can see, it’s certainly been a very busy time in the digital platform space over the last four years. I’ll hand it back to you, Luke.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Jacqui.
I’m going to turn to you, Tom, just to give us a bit of an oversight of actually an overview of how mergers administration has been operating to date, and then we’ll talk really around some of those challenges and some of the transactions that you’ve been looking at, and then we’ll come back to kind of the policy reform space.
Just to note, I think that the Commission has actually looked at a number of digital transactions of some varying significance. Obviously there’s Google’s acquisition of Fitbit, that’s ongoing. There’s the media acquisition of the CRM supplier customer, that’s not been opposed. Salesforce’s acquisition of Slack Technologies, and Microsoft Corps’ acquisition of Neurons, also not opposed. And not wanting to put you on the spot, but presumably the Commission is considering, at least in some manner or other, Amazon’s acquisition of MGM Studios.
There’s kind of an active engagement with digital transactions. Tom, if I could just ask you how well do you think that’s going? How well do you think the ACCC can assess and analyze those transactions and the competition issues there? Do you think the issues you’ve been looking at are just global issues, or they’re Australia specific ones, or are there even kind of regional trends or issues that we should be thinking about? Over to you to, Tom.


Tom LEUNER:
Thank you, Luke. First of all, thank you to CPI for hosting this event. I should just say at the outset that any views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the ACCC.
The first point, and reflecting what you said, Luke, we are definitely looking at digital mergers much, much more closely than we ever used to. We did look at them from time to time and there was nothing stopping for us from looking at them more closely in the past, but we’ve certainly ramped up that focus on these matters and that mostly reflects the work during the digital platforms inquiry, which Jacqui mentioned before, which commenced in 2017 and finalized in 2019. That really highlighted the ACCC concerns about the passion of mergers over the years, and that we really needed to focus on these much more. These days we’re much more attuned to a variety of effects that might come about from a digital merger, so things like the impact of the acquisition of data and how that can cement positions of market power. We’re much more focused on network effects, the tipping of markets, but also just the fact that the future competitive constraint on a large digital platform or a large digital player that holds market power might be coming from someone who’s only in a related market at the moment and not necessarily competing with that player right now. This goes to the arguments about killer acquisitions, which I’m sure we’ve all heard a lot about.
The other effect that we’re really focusing on a lot is innovation; what is the impact of innovation on the market? Innovation by the target? Even innovation also by the acquirer. For example, you see the acquirer buying this business rather than innovating it. Now the problem with all of these issues is that they are extremely hard to predict. This isn’t like a market where you’ve got two manufacturers of widgets and you run your upwards pricing pressure model and determine the price impact and therefore determine whether there’s a substantial, less than in competition. The issues are much, much trickier, but I do feel like the ACCC has put itself in as best, as a good place as it can to analyze these issues, and partly it relates to that work on digital platforms that Jacqui took us through. We’ve got a large team now focused on digital platforms issues, and they’re producing those six monthly reports that Jacqui mentioned, and those staff embed themselves in the merger assessment team. And it’s not a fluke that the digital platforms branch is in the same division as the mergers branch at the ACCC. We work very closely together, and I think that connection really helps us analyze these digital issues. But the other really important factor that helps us analyze these deals is cooperation between agencies worldwide. Without that I think it would be a lot harder.
I’ve worked in merger regulation now on and off for around 20 years, and I’ve never seen cooperation between agencies to be as strong as it is now, but there’s also a much greater need for it right now. And that’s because, as we all know, these are very much global deals, and often the issues are common around the world. So we are often having weekly or even more frequent meetings between the merger assessment teams across the different jurisdictions. We have debates between the economists. We share data, we share documents, and I’ve seen, I’m not going to mention matters, but I’ve seen different regulators convince other regulators to adjust their approach. By all means, the ACCC has adjusted its approach in reaction to this coordination that happens between jurisdictions. So that’s a critical tool of the ACCC.
Luke, you asked about whether this is a local issue, regional issue, or global issue? Sometimes they’re local issues. Obviously, not every player is present in every market. There might be a situation where there’s a four to three merger around the world, but one of those players isn’t present in Australia, so in Australia, it’s a three to two merger.
I think we all know that in digital markets, the issues tend to be much more global. Although the ACCC works extremely closely with its peers in the regional area, it is worth highlighting that often the dynamics are quite different in some of our neighboring countries. So if you look at China, for example, the digital sector is entirely different to Australia. Even if you look at countries like Japan and South Korea, the dominant position of Google, isn’t the same as perhaps the position in Australia, so they might take a different approach on, for example, acquisitions by Google, because of that. So often some of the closest coordination can come with countries that are not necessarily in our region, but perhaps have a similar economy in a similar presence of the digital platforms. In particular, in recent years we’ve worked very closely with the UK, Europe, and US, and also New Zealand and other countries in our region as well.
Hopefully that gives you the snapshot you after, Luke, and back to you. Thanks.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Tom. It does, and it’s a really nice segue to come across to Joel.
And, Joel, to just get your kind of comparative assessment about some of those issues that Tom was talking about. And how, to the extent that you kind of see those resonating in your experiences at the CMA. Joel?


Joel BAMFORD:
Thanks, Luke. Excellent Tom. Thank you very much to the CPI for having me today.
I should clarify; I do still work with the CMA, and I look to for a few months, but I will be moving on. So while the opinions I express today, are my own rather than the CMA’s or Fingleton.
I think I wanted to pick up on a couple of points. The first is actually that Jacqui really nicely set out a journey that the ACCC has been on looking at how digital markets work, thinking about how you consider the different types of competition how that might occur. Then Tom talked through the merger space, and I think it’s fair to say we’ve been on a similar journey within the UK.
Back in March, 2019, we had a report from Jason Ferman called Unlocking Digital Competition. That was a report commissioned by our treasury, and it had a particular piece focusing on mergers. One of its points was around under enforcement in digital mergers, and also the types of theories of harm that you might look at. This speaks very much to what Tom has been talking about rather than that kind of narrow focus on current or kind of short-term future competition or a narrow focus on an individual market, actually looking further out into the future, thinking in the ways that digital markets interact in the way that market power can be used to essentially work within different markets and bring them together.
Following that, the CMA actually asked an economic consultancy, Leah, to do an ex post review of some of its digital mergers. Some are familiar to many commentators, things like Facebook, Instagram. And although that report didn’t focus on whether the answer that the CMA come with was correct, it did focus on the methods of investigation. Actually, it’s essentially the CMA being quite narrow in its focus, it had been narrow in the types of information the group requested. It’d be narrow in thinking about the different theories of harms and the way competition it might manifest itself in the future.
Then you go through a kind of a journey of cases, and these were cases which were done by the CMA, but also done by, for example, the USFTC or the USDOJ. We had the Illumina / PacBio, which is about DNA sequencing. The tech market. It’s got a very large incumbent and PacBio is a new company bringing in a very different technology, which the parties argue quite strongly didn’t compete, and were complements. It’s a familiar theme we hear in digital markets; we don’t compete with each other, we’re just complementary products, and actually we’re going to expand the use of those complementary products. We found a concern in that case, as did the FTC, and that started to evolutionize the thinking around internal documents and how companies think about their competitors and the other players in their market.
You move forward to April, 2020, and you look at Saber / Farelogix. Sabre is one of the big airline booking systems, there’s really kind of three players and Farelogix was this nascent competitor. It was coming in, it was offering something different, something new, and it was really kind of fragmenting the market into different, more innovative services. There we went to block that merger, the DOJ went to court and unfortunately lost, but we were appealed only on our jurisdiction, in the end, and not on our substantive analysis. So you came back to kind of research, both case research and general research.
You’ve got new cases coming through, and we’ve got a couple kind of outside of the merger-sphere we had our CMA’s digital advertising market study in June, 2020. We had a digital markets task force, which reported to the government on the way that you might think about digital regulation in December, 2020, and then this culminated from the mergers’ perspective and the task force putting through new policy ideas, which we’ll probably talk about later, but it also in the actual kind of day to day assessment of mergers relate to a new updated merger assessment guidelines being published in the UK in March, 2021. Those guidelines have a much stronger focus on dynamic competition, the loss of potential competition, and two-sided or multi-sided markets.
One of the points around there that I wanted to pick up is when we’re doing that assessment of dynamic competition, often people focus on the likelihood of entry, the likelihood of the event occurring, when it’s going to occur in the future. Just that end point. It’s really about, when are we going to get to that end point? What does that end point mean? One of the things we brought out in our merger assessment guidelines was the process of rivalry to get to the endpoint is just as important as the end point that you’re getting to. That rivalry along the way, that innovation, that kind of tit for tat, that driving each other to produce new products, is some of the most important competition that we can see in digital markets. Often, that kind of driving each other comes from those small firms that are bringing in something new that the big firms are fearing they’re seeing it as something that might come through later on. They might have much more wide ranging outcome, and so that competition is really driving the competition we see in those digital markets. The challenge we have with those, obviously, is uncertainty. Uncertainty on how that is going to relate to each other, and uncertainty on the final outcome.
The CMA has a two types of tests. Phase one, we look at a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition. And phase two, we looked at a balance of probabilities, more likely than not that the competition concern will occur. But, we’ve been very clear in our merger assessment guidelines that uncertainty doesn’t lead to clearance. We can’t just say, well, the world is uncertain. Therefore we must default to clearance. There’s always uncertainty about the outcome of an investment, the outcome of innovation efforts absent the merger, and including whether the investment is being made by merger firms would ultimately result in products or services being made available to customers. I come back to the outcome and the process to get to that outcome. But the uncertainty about the outcome of a dynamic competitive process, doesn’t preclude the CMA from assessing the impact of the merger on that dynamic process. A process of dynamic competition can increase the likelihood of new innovations or products being made available and therefore has economic value in the present, not just in the future.

WOODWARD:
Well, thank you very much, Joel. I think that’s going to tie in neatly into David.
But, David, if I could just frame that; I’ve been listening to Joel and to Tom, and I think the themes that are coming out of that are that transactions involving complementarity, potentially nascent, but not always nascent, uncertain overlap, and significant uncertainty. We get the theme of innovation. I’m not sure whether or not actually the innovation is driving the uncertainty, but that’s a kind of a critical part to that. So, I guess a two-part question, looking at the world as it is now, how well do you think the regulators are dealing with those issues and how do you think we should be thinking about those issues? David.


David TEECE:
I think the short answer is they’re not doing very well. The good news is they’re starting to look at these issues. The problem is they don’t have the right tools to look at the issues.
So let me back up. First of all, the fact that you’re talking about dynamic competition is a great delight to me because I’ve been saying for about 30 years that competition policy should focus primarily on dynamic competition, because it’s innovation which drives competition and most fiercest way, the rest of it is weak tea. But for 30 years, the agencies have been barking up the wrong tree and focusing on the wrong things, in my view. So, on one hand, I’m awfully delighted that now dynamic competition is coming front and center.
But, as Tom pointed out, once you get into this world of deep uncertainty, you have to recognize that things are very difficult to predict. And that’s being augmented by the fact that my profession, the economics profession, has been sitting on its hands for at least three decades around the concept of potential competition. Nothing has been written of any moment about potential competition for maybe even 50 years. We have Sylos Labini’s models of entry, conditions and so forth, but because we economists have turned a blind eye to the literature on capabilities, we don’t know anything. We can’t say much at all about potential competition. We’re just learning the language of business models, despite the fact there’s a literature out there that it’s almost three decades old on business models. So what I’m afraid of is the immense hubris that somehow rather, after sitting on one’s hands for 20 years, I got to come up to speed real fast and get it right in a world of deep uncertainty.
I’m fully in favor of focusing on these issues, and I think when you do focus on them, first of all, you have to recognize the following: these big tech companies compete like hell. The word monopoly gets thrown around, but the old notion of monopoly is that it’s an easy life. Well, I can pretty much assure you, it is not an easy life even if you’re a big tech firm, if you’re not very active in competing with each other, you’re going to lose the game. There’s no inexorable advantage anymore, and the quality of management and systems matters immensely.
First of all, we can’t even think about competition in the standard relevant market context, at least not easily. I think we need to be thinking in terms of ecosystem competition, and ecosystem to ecosystem competition, and we only have primitive understandings of these things. So we’re handicapped in that regard, but I do believe that progress is being made. I think that a lot more work has to be done before one can declare with any confidence that this more interventionist approach is going to do more good than it is going to do harm.
So that’s sort of my opening initial point here, which is great that we’re digging into this, but the problem is not as much with the law as I see it, and there’s great effort in Australia, I think, to change the law, but I’d change economics first. Change economics first. There’s a lot more flexibility inside the law than there is inside economic modeling right now, or at least traditional ways to think about things.
Also, it’s not just about platforms. Joel, I’m delighted that everyone is focusing on platforms, but most of them platforms tends to be blindsided or not paying sufficient attention to innovation. And it’s where economists go, because it’s something they know about. It’s not because it’s necessarily what they should be highlighting.
So in my view, we should school up, understand the innovation process, understand how organizations build capabilities. Only then will we be able to say whether blocking a merger, like with Giphy or even with Instagram or WhatsApp, it’s only then that we’ll be able to talk intelligently about those things. So I guess I’m not saying slow down, but I am saying be incredibly careful and be provisional about everything and put innovation first. When you put innovation first, the agencies have being saying, “Oh, innovation matters,” but they only see competition driving innovation, they don’t see the causation running the other way, which is innovation drives competition as assuredly, as competition drives innovation. So long as we have these half-assed approaches, we’re going to get it wrong, more likely than not. So that’s my deep concern.

WOODWARD:
Well, thanks very much, David. I think they’re important observations.
To move the discussion on now, I would like to turn to Tom to outline what the ACCC’s merger proposals are. I think there’s some significant challenges in the observations of David to thinking about merger administration and merger reform. So if in casting your remarks around your proposals, you think there’s an opportunity to kind of address some of the observations of David, please do so. Anyway, Tom, if you could just take us through what the ACCC is proposing in terms of merger reform. Over to you, Tom.

LEUNER:
Thank you, Luke.
What the ACCC has done is started to base on merger reform in Australia. Ultimately, the direction Australia takes on this will be up to the government and the treasury will advise the government as the policy agency, but we’ve put forward our own proposals, and those proposals relate to both process and the law. Currently we think both the process and the law and how the test is applied in the federal court are biased towards clearance. This is the problem we’re trying to fix.
Many of the audience might be aware that currently Australia’s merger approval system is entirely voluntary. There’s no obligation to notify the ACCC of any merger and any merger can proceed at any time. The only way the ACCC can stop that is to go to the federal court and seek an injunction. Although we’ve built up what we call the informal merger review over the years, it’s still in a sense voluntary, and people can proceed with the merger or threaten to proceed at any time.
We’re proposing a new system, which would be a formal, mandatory and suspensory notification system, so that parties would have to come to us with their merger proposals, and then we would assess them through a process that would be quite similar to various processes overseas. However, we are really keen to retain the benefits of what is currently called the pre-assessment system. You might be aware that over 90% of mergers in Australia are cleared through a pre-assessment approach at the moment, where we have a quick look at it, usually most just on the papers. Sometimes we make a few telephone calls, ask for a little bit of information. Usually within a matter of a couple of weeks, we clear those matters, and that applies to over 90% of them. We want to retain that benefit, that quick and efficient clearance system.
So for the mergers that are above the threshold under the new system, we would have a notification exemption process. You can apply for an exemption from having to notify. Now, the other key element of our proposals in relation to process are that appeals would be to the Australian Competition Tribunal. For those of you who are not aware, in Australia we have a tribunal that is made up of a judge, an economist, and a business person. We think they’re the best appeal body if the merger parties want to appeal a decision of the ACCC.
In summary, just some process, what we’re really doing is moving away from what is a very pure enforcement model for merger regulation where the ACCC has to dis-enforce that section of the act that says you can’t buy something if there’s a substantial lessening in competition towards an administrative decision making model. It would be quite a fundamental change to the Australian regime.
We’re also proposing changes to the merger test, and this is to deal with the challenges we’ve had with proving future events, to the required evidentiary standard before the federal court. Many of you will have heard about the court losses the ACCC has had on merger matters. One of the changes is that we’re proposing to define the word likely. At the moment, to be a breach it has to be a likely substantial lessening in competition, and we’re proposing to change or put in a definition for that so that it means a possibility that is not remote.
The other change we’re proposing is that there would be a deeming provision. So for acquisitions that entrench a position as substantial market power, they would be deemed to substantially less in competition. The thinking behind this is to try and bring the focus more towards the structural conditions for competition and take it away from having to prove the precise effects in terms of a substantial lessening of competition.
So there, at a higher level, are the main changes we’re proposing, and those would apply to all mergers if the ACCC got its way.
In relation to digital mergers, in essence, what we’ve done with digital mergers is say that we think there’s almost a bigger problem there that needs a separate solution, and we’ve pushed that issue into next year. We think there’s all kinds of issues that I mentioned before in relation to buying nascent competitors, the lack of notification of mergers and issues like this. Next year, we’re going to put out papers that put forward a potentially a new regime for merger tests in relation to digital mergers that might try and address these issues. There’ll be an issues paper around March, and then our concluded report with our recommendations in September next year.
This paper is part of and is tied into a broader look at the whole digital platform sector to assess where the new rules are required more broadly. As Jacqui mentioned at the start, the ACCC has been doing these six-monthly reports and did the ad tech report and the digital platforms inquiry a couple of years ago. Building on all of that work, where we have seen issues with market power and consumer harms as well, we’re going to assess whether we think new rules are needed to address those market power and consumer harm issues. We’re going to look at that merger idea, idea for digital specific merger rules in the context of that broader look at potential digital platform regulation.
I’ll just go quickly to David’s points before. I think, David, you were saying that it’s too early to sort of take a more interventionalist approach with mergers, but if we look at that decade from 2010 to 2020, the five main digital companies acquired over 500 companies during that period. Not a single one was opposed by an antitrust regulator, as I understand it. In my view, we actually need to move more quickly to really get our head around these issues and look at them closely. I can see there’s a range of views you can have, and maybe there’s this possibility of over enforcement, but my real concern is under enforcement. Thank you.

WOODWARD:
Thanks, Tom. I’m sure there’s something there for David to come back to, but Joel, I think again I’ll just pass to you to get your kind of comparative perspective from the same. I know the ACCC and CMA have been kind of working closely around merger reform issues. Over to you, Joel.

BAMFORD:
Thanks, Luke. I previously worked in New Zealand, and I’ve seen the Australian system up close and personal, shall we say, and Tom and I have discussed this over many years through the International Competition Network, which is a fantastic forum for the exchange of ideas in the way of doing things across agencies.
The UK system, it’s a voluntary administrative model, so it has the voluntary nature which Tom has discussed. But, when the CMA was born from the merger of two competition agencies into one, merged into a monopoly, the rules around the CMA’s ability to hold a company separate during the review were strengthened.
Those are enforceable ways. We fined Facebook last month, 50 million UK pounds for a breach of those rules during the Giphy case. They are there and they are particularly important in digital markets because we know the pace of change, and we know that when companies come together and all of the interactions and interweavings that occur, it becomes very difficult if you do have a concern at the end of a case to actually be able to unscramble the eggs. That regime for us, our interim measures, our initial enforcement orders, our interim orders, are very important, and they’re a strong corollary of having a voluntary system where companies are allowed to complete during investigation.
The other part of our processes is, as I said earlier, we have a phase one and a phase two, and they’re separate legal tests with separate decision makers.
The phase one is a decision maker such as myself, so a member of the staff team who would decide on whether there is a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition. If a concern is found, that case will be referred to an in-depth phase two investigation. That phase two will be decided by a panel of individuals who are independent of the CMA and independent of the government. They may have a competition law, competition economics, business, or other regulatory function background. There are generally somewhere between three to five individuals who make the decision at the end of the day, and they decide that on a balance of probabilities, or more likely than not, a test, as I discussed earlier.
We have an administrative model with different decision makers at phase one and phase two. So there’s a very strong set of independence for that phase two decision making body and that checks and balances and the lack of confirmation bias that you would get if you necessarily have the same individuals in that separation. We then have a Competition Appeals Tribunal, much to what Tom was talking about earlier. We can be appealed to those within four weeks of their final decision, but that appeal is on a judicial review standard; it’s not a full merit review. We’re not going back into court as such as you would do if you’d be in US or other agencies to go through all the details of the cases. Just whether the CMA was being flawed in a way it’s applied its process in the legal tests.
Again, we’ve had a number of appeals over the years. We’ve had cases where we have had parts of those cases were remitted to us. We’ve obviously had both successes as well, but that has been a strong counterpoint to the CMA in the last five years.
A couple of points I want to focus on. Luke, you’re very kind to forward me Gilbert & Tobin’s review of the ACCC’s piece that they’ve put forward. Having seen a number of the commentaries that came out at the time when Tom and Rob and others put forward the proposals, one of the key discussions, and I’ve seen this myself is in court cases, the reliance on business individuals’ testimony and the force of that testimony, and I have to say some of the things that I’ve read at least have been relatively concerning, and they’re concerning from an experience perspective.
The CMA has looked at a number of cases over the years. As you would expect, merging parties are highly incentivized to get their deal through. They’ve very good sets of advisors, as I’m sure they do in Australia. They put the strongest case that they can forward, as they should. But sometimes what we’ve heard around, for example, firms are flailing or failing, or just not going to succeed without this investment from this large incumbent or that idea that these are going to compete going forwards in that new innovation is going to come. That’s just fundamentally flawed. Some of those, I talked about two cases earlier and they actually quite nicely highlight this.
In Illumina / PacBio, PacBio was a small firm, and made a very strong case that without the purchase from Illumina, they would essentially go bust and they wouldn’t be able to develop. The acquisition price was 1.2 billion. That was back in, as I said, 2019, 2020. Their market cap right now is 4.7 billion. It seems a kind of a long way from a firm that’s essentially on its last leg.
The other point around that was, we had an interaction around what it would be, what would be the outcome if Illumina bought PacBio for the rest of the market? How would it affect others? We’ve talked about killer acquisitions, but there’s also a wealth of literature out on what is described as kills zones around firms and kills zones around technologies when they’re purchased by large incumbents.
In that case, there was a UK firm called Oxford Nanopore, which made strong representations on the merger. They too have thrived in the last couple of years, and their market cap is now at 5.8 billion. You can see that incredible growth within that market. We’re not talking here about platforms, and hopefully we’re not being half-assed in our approach, looking at the innovation that occurs here either, but we’ve seen the outcome there that actually by blocking that merger, we’ve seen the market thrive. This is a market which has been used extensively in the battle against COVID and that next generation sequencing that we’re seeing really come through.
The second one that I wanted to highlight was around Farelogix and Sabre. So at the time, and I’m going to use a couple of quotes here, it comes back to the idea of business people putting forward their precise views about what will happen in the future. We put forward that Farelogix was an innovator in a particular type of merchandising product, and that Sabre would need to respond to that innovation. And they would need to take that forward within the next five years. I’m going to quote from a piece of advocacy that came into us as a submission, and it said that, “The CMA expectation that absent transaction Sabre would develop a credible merchandising solution within the next three to five years and would become a uniquely strong competitor to Farelogix and Amadeus in merchandising is entirely fantastical and fundamentally flawed.”
That’s in February, 2020. After the deal was blocked, Farelogix was purchased by a private equity firm. They continue to thrive now. On an earnings call, the Sabre CEO, the same CEO that signed off that submission said the other piece of the innovation framework.
Again, this really does go into what we’re doing on the merchandising side. We’ll be able to share more with this, but this is essentially a Farelogix replacement and what was taking place there. We’ve gone from fundamentally flawed that entry could occur in three to five years to, and that was November, 2020, to within 12 months we are building a replacement because, unfortunately the Farelogix merger had been blocked. It’s just a highlight of some of those, shall we say, inconsistencies between the perception at the time and the outcome going forward. I think it means that, at least from my side, we really need to get into the evidence behind that. There’s been a huge concentration on valuation models, internal documents, and I think those are very probative in terms of your evidence based going forward, and the kind of advocacy based pieces from business testimony maybe have to be seen in a slightly different light.

WOODWARD:
Thanks, Joel. There’s quite a bit in that as well. There being just two things to kind of call out. I thought the decision-making framework in the CMA and the independence built in at different stages is quite interesting. I’ll just make one observation, which is that, in those difficult cases, when you’re in the facts, I just agree with you that’s a good policy basis to start sort of redesigning our merger regime.
I’ll leave you with one question: I think we all have kind of anecdotal experiences, but one needs to be a bit careful about policy reform would be an overall observation.
What I think I’ll do now is, Jacqui, I’ll just ask you to make some comments about the ACCC’s merger reform case and how well you think that’s made, and then, David, I’ll bring it back again to you to get some observations around this merger reform developments and whether we’re thinking about that also in the right way. So, Jacqui, if I could just go to you first.

DOWNES:
Thanks very much, Luke. I think it’s fair to say that I don’t believe the case for merger reform or the type of merger reform that the ACCC has put forward has been made out. I certainly appreciate some of the challenges in the digital platform context, and I’ll get to that in a moment, but in terms of the sort of broader issues of merger reform, which would apply to all businesses companies doing business in Australia and not just platforms, the Australian regime really does work well, and it has worked well for many, many years now.
The cases that Tom referred to the ACCC has lost in court have been a few in number, only half a dozen. By the ACCC’s own admission, many of those were at the margins in terms of, kind of testing the boundaries of the law, not clear cut cases which were blocked. The ACCC blocks a number of cases that don’t go anywhere near court. I feel I should say that the ACCC is a very vigorous enforcer and the Australian merger regime works well. The vast majority of mergers are notified to the ACCC. There may be a couple of anecdotal examples where that hasn’t happened or where mergers have completed prior to the ACCC finishing its review, but in the vast number of cases, parties are well aware that the ACCC is a vigorous enforcer. They do notify the ACCC and they do wait for the ACCC’s decision before pressing on with the merger. In those few cases, if that doesn’t happen, the ACCC does have powers to go to court and take injunctions and divestitures as well.
I also strongly believe that the court is the right place to properly test all the evidence, not the tribunal. Judges in our federal court are highly skilled in assessing evidence. Those concerns that Joel has raised as well as Tom around executives and what may or may not be believed, that can be put obviously to executives and judges are skilled at assessing evidence on both sides; the ACCC’s evidence and also the evidence of the merger parties.
In terms of the substantive test, our test is consistent with tests around the world; likely substantial lessening of competition. This has a long history of jurisprudence and is consistent with the overseas position. I have a strong concern about the change to the threshold for likely. I think this is way out of step with overseas approaches and really will tip the balance way in favor of blocking mergers and many mergers which should not be blocked in a healthy economy are likely to be blocked.
In terms of the sort of digital provisions, we haven’t seen a lot of the details yet as to what’s been proposed there. We know there’s some potential changes of merger factors, and I personally don’t have a particular concern about adding in some factors to make it clear that the court should consider the aggregation of data and the fact that this might be a nascent competitor. I think, though, if there are to be changes to the substantive tests for digital platforms, that causes more concern.
If all these merger reforms get up, there will then be three tests for mergers, which would make the Australian regime probably the most complicated regime in the world. There would be the substantial lessening of competition test, the deeming provision in the sort of digital platform test, a minefield for lawyers, but not so great for business and the economy.
And, Luke, in terms of David’s comments, if I can make a comment there, I thought I was going to disagree with David, but then it turns out, I think now we’re on the same page. Again, I think our merger processes are equipped to deal with digital platform reform, digital platform mergers. I accept that they raised complex questions and there are some evidentiary issues, but they are largely traditional questions around vertical, horizontal, conglomerate mergers, and I think the ACCC, and other regulators around the world today, have dealt with them very well.
I think some recent examples we’ve had in Australia with Salesforce and Slack acquisition, Measure and Customer, Microsoft and Nuance are examples. The ACCC took a hard look at some potential vertical and horizontal issues and cleared those mergers. And then we had other examples, for example, the Google Fitbit decision where the ACCC took a different view to the EU on the viability of undertakings, and also was looking at Meta Giphy, which is obviously being strongly opposed in the UK. I think there’s work to do, I agree. There’s education and learning to do and perhaps the economics can assist us, David, in understanding these mergers, but I don’t think it requires any change to the law.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Jacqui.
David, I’ll turn to you with the last word I think, but you should give us a full, a sort of the full perspective on those observations. Some things I think would be particularly interesting to hear from what we have is a proposal to clearly reform the merger regime to address issues around uncertainty, so we can expect that a reformed merger regime would be applying and leading to blocking more transactions than now. That seems to be the essence of the proposal.
Then we have a proposal, or at least contemplation, for a sectoral specific regime for the digital sector. I’d be interested in your observations overall about the need for that in light of kind of your comment, that the issue is not so much the law, but the economics. Also, if we are moving into a policy reform space, as Tom was rightly pointing out, this is the ACCC calling out these issues, but ultimately there’ll be Treasury and other people who are doing, will have to take these issues forward. If we’re moving into that policy reform space, what are the kind of the key things that you think we should be really paying attention in that policy reform space? So, David, if I could just pass it to you.

TEECE:
Oh, well, thank you. These are all very interesting and important comments.
Tom, to begin with your first observation that we let too many mergers through, so therefore we’re going to right the wrong by maybe being too strict going forward. That really doesn’t make any sense to me. We should obviously correct what the flaws are if they’re really flaws, but to go from pillar to post is not good economics, as far as I’m concerned.
I think the real criteria is that you mentioned that we’ve got to move quickly. There has to be at least some reasonable emerging consensus in the scholarly literature if you’re going to get good policy, otherwise you’re going to have a very ad hoc system that’s unlikely to be evidence-based and is unlikely to be palatable in the longer term and could hurt not just innovation in Australia, but innovation worldwide. So there are a knock-on effects there as well.
Now, Joel quite rightly pointed out that well. Sometimes companies put forward advocacy positions that are not well balanced, and I know that occurs and I think there should be some accountability for that. If a company has a reputation of coming forward and overclaiming and the evidence builds, then that should be a part of the reputational damage. You should raise the bar a little bit higher, at least informally, against such companies. So the remedy is not to assume that whatever the company claims or whatever it is put forward is not fundamentally correct.
But let’s not just dwell on this issue. The elephant in the room here is that the enforcement agencies need a reasonable theory of potential competition. If they’re going to assess whether a merger is going to essentially nip in the bud, a potential competitor. Let’s be honest. There is no theory of potential competition in economics that’s of any use, so what’s happening is agencies are, in an ad hoc fashion, pitching together doing their best. Well, that’s not good enough. I know that economics professionals let you down, but I think it does speak to the need to focus on a number of things that agencies haven’t focused on in the past.
One is organizational capabilities. There’s a field called organizational economics, so it’s not like it’s a huge leap to get from market analysis to organizational analysis. As part of organizational analysis, you’ve got to get really, really sharp around business models and the viability of business models. This is going to require that the agencies actually take on some of the skillset that a venture capitalist has.
Now, the very fact that I’m saying that speaks to the difficulties and also the uncertainties that are here, and it should lead to a dialing back in hubris, I think. That you can actually get this stuff right all the time. I’m willing to forgive mistakes, both type one and type two mistakes here, because of deep uncertainty. To aim for precision is going to lead to regulation on top of regulation and probably lead to actually harming innovation in competition.
My plea here is for a number of things. One, let’s focus on a different set of criteria rather than the consumer welfare criteria. Let’s, as a proxy, use the merger: will it likely enhance or detract from the innovation in the ecosystem because it’s the health of the ecosystem, and in the long run it’s going to deliver benefits to consumers. So point one is focus on ecosystems.
Point two, put innovation first.
Point three, take a longer term view.
Point four is build a robust understanding of organizational capabilities, because otherwise you do not bring any apparatus other than your intuition to the business of merger assessment, if the issue is, are you buying a potential competitor? The other thing I think to bear in mind is to recognize that this is international; the actions of any individual agency have implications elsewhere. We didn’t talk much about big data, but there is some benefit from aggregating data, and there’s actually benefits, not just the consumer, but it enables AI systems to be tuned and to be better. There are global implications to all of this. The Western democracies need to stay ahead in AI, otherwise, there are certain existential threats.
I think competition policy has to begin to connect to industrial policy, technology policy, certainly questions around privacy have to also be taken into account. You need a more holistic approach. Certainly, China has a holistic approach to this stuff. Australia doesn’t seem to. The United States doesn’t seem to. We’re at the point where, I think, we’ve got to look with a wider lens at these issues. If we don’t, then I’m afraid not just for innovation, I’m afraid for not just the loss of innovation, I’m afraid of the loss of even criteria and values of even greater weight.
That’s my plea. Put innovation first, but recognize that innovation is a primary driver of competition. Recognize also that these big tech companies are spending more and more every year on R&D. If you look at where innovation is taking place and where R&D is being spent, these large companies are the primary driver, at least in the United States, for the increases in research and development expenditures. I think we really have to take a macro perspective and a micro perspective at the same time, if we’re going to have a chance of improving things rather than hurting them.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, David. I think that’s a good place to leave this discussion for now. We know that it’s going to continue on next year, that it’s a critical discussion. I think to put it within that broader context, I think is important. We’re not just talking about one particular transaction being approved or blocked. We need to think about the broader implications of our overall merger reform system, and I know the ACCC is absolutely doing that. They are definitely right to put these issues on the table, but having a broader discussion around that and having kind of more reflection and thoughts from different perspectives, I think is going to get us to a better place.
I really think that it’s been a wonderful discussion. I’d like to thank you, Tom, for taking us through the ACCC thinking. And Joel for an excellent sort of comparative assessments. Some real insights to hear. And thank you very much, Jacqui. It’s always great to be in these fora with you and to get the depth of your insights in Australia.
I think we could probably all on this panel say, in particular to you, David, I think this has been, an environment in which critical insights that you put on to the public agenda 30 years ago. I really at the fore now, and it’s been great to get your perspective on that. So I’d like to thank you all, and I’d like to thank CPI and I’ll bring this live session to a close. Thank you.

424,"December 17, 2021",Privacy as a Parameter of Competition Assessment,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Privacy as a Parameter of Competition Assessment. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Samir GANDHI:
Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have you on this panel discussion. I think that, over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen tremendous growth in the digital sector, and its massive growth has played out across the world, including more developing jurisdictions, such as India. Along with the great growth, there has been a significant debate. That debate is the subject of our conversation today, which is the role of data privacy laws and its intersection with competition law, more specifically.
I’m mindful, of course, that we have a very illustrious panel, some of whom are not entirely focused on just antitrust or competition law, but are more practitioners of privacy and related issues, but I think this is going to make a compelling discussion even more interesting.
Competition regulators across the globe have identified the use of data as non-price competition factors and have indicated that data collected from users by an enterprise may be used to the competitive advantage by some other competitors. I think in India we’ve seen some of that play out within the competition authority, the Competition Commission of India, has noted in recent comments that network effects large results from large amounts of data which are collected, that allows companies to compete on a level that does not necessarily relate to pricing, and creates a system of winner-takes-all. This is from a recent CCI e-commerce market study.
Of course, our conversation today is far broader than just India. It includes various other jurisdictions, but given that that’s the jurisdiction I know and come from, and that it’s part of the topic today, I just take that as one example.
Today’s panel will discuss several factors surrounding privacy and competition law and the implications of using privacy as a parameter for competition assessment, which is a debate that is alive and kicking, for sure. But I think the contours of this debate are far from clear.
With that brief introduction, given our stellar panel of speakers, I don’t want to take more time on dwelling on the topic itself, and we’ll move very quickly to introduce our panelists.
We have Daniel Sokol, or Danny, as many of us know you, Danny. He’s a Professor of Law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, and an Affiliate Professor of Business at the Marshall School of Business. Danny serves as the faculty director for the Center for Transnational Law and Business, and the Co-Director for the USC Marshall Initiative on Digital Competition. Additionally, as if there wasn’t enough on his plate, Danny also, in a part-time capacity, serves as a Senior Advisor at White & Case.
Henri is the Vice President of French Competition Authority, who we are delighted to have on this panel. Henri was, in an earlier start, the former Adviser to the Deputy Director General for mergers at DG Comp at the European Commission. Both at DG Comp and in the private sector, Henri has dealt with pay-for-delay cases in the pharmaceutical case industry, conduct and merger cases in the energy industry, payment systems, IT, and so on and so forth. Once again, pleasure to have you on board, Henri.
Maureen Ohlhausen, of course, is our third panelist, who honestly requires no introduction, but joined Baker Botts after leading the FTC as Acting Chairperson and Commissioner. She has directed all aspects of the FTC’s antitrust work. Many years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Maureen at an ICN conference here in New Delhi, and I know her work includes merger review, conduct enforcement, and she’s steered all FTC Consumer Protection Enforcement, with a particular emphasis on privacy and technology issues. Maureen has received numerous awards, not surprisingly, including the FTC’s, Robert Pitofsky Lifetime Achievement Award. And in private practice, she heads the FTC practice group- in private practice- earlier, she’s headed the FTC practice group at a leading telecom firm representing and counseling telecoms and technology giants.
Rahul Matthan is our fourth speaker, and he’s part of the technology, media, and telecoms practice at a leading Indian platform, Trilegal. Rahul has advised on some of the largest TMT transactions in the country. He’s worked with companies across all sectors of the industry. From big telecom operators, to internet service providers, and manage data service providers, and advised on all sorts of matters, ranging from regulatory, to ongoing business issues. Rahul is a trusted advisor, and is also an esteemed alumni of the same university that I went to many years ago.
That is a quick and brief introduction to the panel, and without further ado of what we could potentially jump into, are a few questions.
We’ve decided as a panel to structure the conversation in a somewhat question / answer format, if that’s okay. So, without further ado, having introduced the panelists, I think what we’d like to do is to jump into our conversation and use our time productively. We’d like to model this conversation and keep it as open and fluid as possible.
Perhaps we’ll start with a question to our first panelist, Danny. Danny, welcome to the panel and thanks again for being on. Just to kickstart this entire conversation, I can think of no better person than you, and, Danny, there has been an active discussion about how, when, and whether companies should be using user data. How people can be empowered to make meaningful decisions about that data, and what laws and regulations? Should it be antitrust? Should be privacy? What laws and regulations should actually apply? There have been some suggestions that competition regulators should solve for violations of privacy. To what extent do you think that’s a viable solution? When do you think privacy can become a competition issue? Danny.


Daniel SOKOL:
I’ll start by stating the obvious, since I’m the first speaker, which is that competition law works when it involves competition issues. Sometimes privacy may work in tandem with competition, so that greater privacy leads to more competition and vice versa. Sometimes it’s neutral, sometimes the two may be at odds, but these are distinct areas.
As a law professor, let me just say this; if we say that, “Oh, these things are the same,” then you might as well tell me that torts and contracts are the same, and we should have a single, legal regime for that. And that’s not quite right. There are going to be areas that are distinctive to a particular doctrinal area, and there will be areas of overlap.
The question then becomes when should we be concerned about privacy? And it’s when it impacts the competition. When might we see that? We might see it in one of two potential ways. In one way, we might be using privacy perhaps as an excuse for anti-competitive activity. Of course, we would want competition authorities to intervene when that’s the case.
Similarly, it could be that overly strong privacy protection, going the opposite direction, may be entrenching incumbents. The answer with so much of competition law is that it depends on the facts. But to say that the two are the same, isn’t quite right. It’s really about thinking about the interaction when there’s going to be something specific on the competition side we can do. Actually, I think the authorities that have really understood this the best, recently in a joint 24, 25-page paper, was the UK’s CMA and ICO, where I probably could summarize it in one line, “Which is when there’s an intersection, both of us care.”
I think that’s probably the right approach.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Danny, that makes a lot of sense. I think for all of us lawyers, we at some point have to draw a line between two subjects, which clearly seem to intersect at so many different points. The answer, as they say, is truly blowing in the wind.
But, Maureen, if I can move on to you, how has competition law traditionally assessed privacy and personally identifiable data issues? How do you do that in just analysis? And what are the changes that you see that are being proposed to this somewhat traditional approach that has been taken thus far across different jurisdictions that you have experienced and worked on?


Maureen OHLHAUSEN:
As we look back at cases over time that involved personally identifiable or consumer level data, frequently merger cases, the assessment was, is this combination creating market power in some identifiable antitrust market, such as for consumer home records? The FTC had some cases that involved combinations of land records about whose house is whose. Things like titles, or consumer credit data. They then said, “Okay, does this cause an overlap that will give competitive concerns stemming from having market power after the combination?” and imposed remedies to address that.
So, the idea that competition law has never had to deal with these issues and that we need to change everything, just isn’t correct. I think one of the issues that has come to the fore, however, is this idea of, “Well, because we care about privacy, are we concerned that even apart from creating any sort of market power in an identifiable antitrust market, does a combination of data through a merger going to reduce privacy somehow?” Or on the conduct side, there’s concern that a company has, through its own organic actions and not necessarily through acquisitions, gained a lot of consumer level data, and somehow that has given it an advantage, and we want other competitors to have access to that data, so we’re going to have some sort of forced sharing of it.
I think those are some of the issues that are kind of coming to the fore now. One of the things that I think is very interesting is as you look at traditional antitrust analysis and say, “Well, does the combination of two data sets after a merger actually create an efficiency that allows the merged firm to then compete even better, or create new products, or something like that?” That seems to be a negative in today’s analysis, if it involves consumer data, where previously it would have been a positive.
The other thing that’s kind of being focused on, is what is the identifiable antitrust market? Frequently, it is the market for online targeted advertising. I think it would really be beneficial to say, “Well, how many players are actually in that market?” A lot. Has supply been going up in that market? I think it probably has. Have prices been going up? I don’t think they have.
I think those are the kind of questions that we need to ask to determine are these issues about access to, collection of, or use of consumer data, actually competitive issues?
You mentioned in my introduction my other hat as a consumer protection and privacy former enforcer and current practitioner, where I actually think, at least in the US, a lot of these concerns would be much better addressed by adopting a federal privacy law that laid out the groundwork. Rather than trying to kind of distort antitrust law to deal with what are essentially privacy concerns.
I wrote a paper called, “Competition and Privacy: Friends, Foes, or Frenemies?” because it does create some real tension between the values in antitrust, and the values that we’re trying to protect through privacy law.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Maureen. I think you’ve hit on several thought-provoking issues, including one that we should come to, which is, is it time for more ex ante kind of regulatory review by a separate standalone regulator?
In your case, you mentioned a federal privacy watchdog, or something of that nature. Not to say that one doesn’t exist, but perhaps that would help draw the lines, which we also heard Danny say are somewhat blurred today, and would kind of help to create some sort of a distinction between these two areas.
But I want to pick up on something else that you also mentioned, Maureen, and that’s this somewhat vexing question of efficiencies. Sometimes transactions which have privacy aspects to them could actually result in inefficiencies, and I guess that’s where I could perhaps turn to Rahul, given his role as a privacy lawyer.
Rahul, look, does the existence of healthy competition in and of itself show greater privacy protection to consumers and to end users? To pick up on Maureen’s thought regarding efficiencies, would greater privacy restrictions be efficiency enhancing? In other words, would it result in a greater consumer efficiency? Or efficiency to the market, and actually promote competition in the market? So, Rahul, over to you.


Rahul MATTHAN:
Samir, framed in that exact specific way, I think the simple answer is no. Because in and of itself, neither of those are going to be a yes. Picking up on what Danny said, and I think what Maureen elaborated on, is that you get a bunch of lawyers and you ask them a simple question, it’s never a yes or no, it’s always a maybe, it really depends on the circumstances.
If you say, “Does the existence of healthy competition in and of itself ensure greater privacy protection?” there are always circumstances where you will find that that is actually not the case. So if you are saying that if there is healthy competition, we will always have greater privacy, I will point to a number of sectors wherein the sectors themselves are extremely healthy, but privacy is not one of the factors on which they compete.
Just to pick up what Danny said, when that becomes an issue that you compete on, that’s when the existence of healthy competition is going to ensure that the market participants are going to fight with each other to become more privacy preserving, more privacy-enhancing.
So once again, let me just caveat in this room full of competition lawyers; I’m the one who doesn’t even understand the jargon and the lingo, and I’m going to comment on it as a privacy lawyer. And let me add another nuance to this: India does not even have state privacy laws. It does not have a federal privacy, and we don’t even have state privacy laws. We have no privacy legislation in this country, so after 20 years of doing this, I can keep asking myself, what are you doing being a privacy lawyer in a country without a privacy law?
But having said that, the nuances of privacy are now being picked up, as you yourself said in the introduction, by the competition regulator. In a sense, the solution for this situation is to have, as Danny mentioned, the two regulators that talk together and find a way in which the two competing interests can be addressed.
And just to pick up the second point on efficiencies, just the fact that there are greater privacy restrictions being imposed on the market, does not, once again, in and of itself, promote a competitive market. We have many examples of this.
Apple recently introduced this app-tracking transparency module. Which any privacy lawyer looks at it and says, “That’s a huge win for privacy,” because no longer can apps track your behavior and your actions without being transparent about what they are doing.
And yet, we know the implications that will have on the market, because Apple is a dominant operating system provider. There are these tensions between the steps to improve privacy and competition, and vice versa. I don’t think if it’s framed as you framed it, in and of itself that one is ever going to equal the other.

GANDHI:
Thanks for that, Rahul.
I’ve got to say that, despite your admitted shortcoming in understanding the jargon or lingo, I think you’ve made that point very soundly. I think that’s loud and clear. I think also that in jurisdictions such as India where you have a virtual spaghetti bowl of regulators, I think the point you made about regulators needing to speak with each other is absolutely imperative in being able to deliver better outcomes for the public at large.
Speaking of regulators, Henri, if I can bring you in right now, in the digital economy, we’ve often spoken of this. Would you consider access to data as being essential? Or in some sense, if we use competition terminology, an essential facility, and therefore find it necessary to impose access type obligations where everyone has somewhat equal access to this essential facility owned by companies that possess these vast volumes of consumer data? How would you look at that?


Henri PIFFAUT:
That’s a very interesting and good question. Access to data has been looked at essentially, at least in Europe and the Merger Control Review.
The question being asked, when there’s these big data-based companies, like Apple or Microsoft, which is acquiring a smaller rival in an adjacent market, the combination of the two data sets create a data set which is indispensable for others to compete, and not replicable, should there be a mandate to provide access to data? That question has a reason in the merger control, and in Europe, it has never led to the conclusion that the data set was not replicable, and therefore that the access should be provided.
The answer regarding the merger control has not been provided to your question. It’s true that taking the criteria that I’ve just mentioned, they look very much alike, and with the criteria you find it to be an essential facility doctrine in Europe, the so-called Bronner criteria, but, when you look at it from a kind of business or economic perspective, I would argue that access to data sets is a very different animal from the animals that you would find that the essential facility lab train.
Why? Because initially, at least in Europe, when it was developed, the doctrine looked at physical facilities, like a port or a network infrastructure for gas transportation, for instance, where if somebody has access, others do not have access. In other words, it was asset that would create rivals, whereas with data, if you have access to data, that’s not rivalrous. If I access it, you will be able to access it afterwards or at the same time. I have not exhausted the data sets. In that sense, economically speaking, it’s a very different animal from the old fashioned facilities with the label natural facilities.
There’s another difference, in that data sets are dynamic animals. Whereas a harbor is something which doesn’t move, or every 20 or 30 years you have to drag it and then do other works, et cetera, a data set is highly dynamic. It depends on the number of instances, which are not necessarily under the control of the backbone which possesses the data sets. At the same time, if you would provide access, in a way, it wouldn’t be really access, it would be interoperability, to one data set from another one, the very fact that you would provide interoperability would change both sets of data sets as well.
This is, again, kind of an amorphous animal which is very different from one that you would find in an essential facility doctrine. My short answer to you would be, no, it’s very dissimilar. But the doctrine as to how and when access should be provided or interoperability should be provided has not yet been fully blocked. You can find some interesting precedents into gathering and sharing of information by insurance companies to assess risk. At the same time, it’s also true, but there is a level of appropriation when you have credible data set to run a platform on, and it’s a technological innovation, which is underlying it. The provider providing access to that data set may diminish incentive to invest for other such platforms. But at the same time providing access might be very problematic as well, so there’s a fine balance to find, and the work for that has not been yet completed.

GANDHI:
Got it. Thank you for that, Henri. The fine balance is truly elusive, I think not just in Europe, but in other jurisdictions, including India.
I think that kind of is a nice segue to my next question, which is, if use the term appropriation, and perhaps, Rahul, given that you are the one true privacy lawyer, if I can say that amongst all of us, would you consider access data? I mean, just the very fact that you’re collecting excessive data, perhaps disproportionate, or stacking more than what you would necessarily need.
Of course, the debate on what constitutes excess data is in itself is a separate question, but would you consider excess data collection to be problematic from a privacy perspective? Some have suggested that such data collection could result in consumer exploitation, but again, going back to a recurring theme that we all brought up in the first part of this conversation, are we ignoring the potentially obvious, the immense benefits that data aggregation may yield for consumers? Rahul?

MATTHAN:
Excellent question. I think, even if you look at the traditional basis for privacy law, which harkens back to the FIPS in the US and eventually picked up by Europe, which then eventually evolved into GDPR, and that’s sort of what everyone bases privacy on. The way we protect privacy is by only collecting as much data as is necessary to serve a purpose, and by the very definition, anything in excess of that would violate privacy. If you collected data to an extreme level, that could even amount to exploitation.
If you look at privacy law, we have principles of purpose limitation, use limitation, data minimization, data retention restrictions, all geared at ensuring that behavior is guided towards collecting only as much information as is absolutely necessary and no more, and you’ll be punished if you do more than that. But as you said, this was perhaps useful and relevant in the FIPS era, and even during the database directive era in Europe, but once we had the big data moment in technology, we started seeing that there was value to be gained out of aggregate data. Vast amounts of data handled carefully in an ethical manner, could result in almost magical results.
We thought that computers could never beat humans at chess, but computers beat humans at chess. And then Gary Kasparov said we create a cyborg, human plus computer, and we will beat computers, and now they beat the cyborgs at chess. We thought that go would be an era we would never cross, but computers are beating humans at go without breaking a sweat.
But forget about that. Radiology. Today there is no radiologist who can compete with an AI driven radiologist. Why is all of this possible? Because of aggregated data. We’ve got vast amounts of data that have been able to train machines to do things that humans are not capable of doing.
In India, the example that I like to talk about in this context is financial data. Today India has maybe 300 million customers in financial services. We believe that an additional 300 million could be brought into the financial sector, but they don’t have the collateral that the current banking system requires them to show. It doesn’t mean that they are bad investments as far as loans are concerned, it just means they can’t prove it.
But, if you can use data, you can actually bring them into the system because you can analyze the history of their transactions. Based on that, you can say they’re good creditors. I mean, this is another 300 million people that can be brought into the financial services net only using data. You absolutely cannot ignore this.
Now, how do you enable this? Obviously, you’ve got to rethink the privacy principles of minimization, rethink the privacy principles of keeping things small, because we need this information to be able to train our analysis, and if you do this, we need to realize that there will be bad actors who will take this and misuse it, and that’s really what we’re concerned about. We’re not concerned about all the good uses of aggregated data, we’re concerned that there are some people who will misuse it, and it’s been done.
We know about Cambridge Analytica and what they did with the US elections, and we’ve seen this time and again. We’ve got to rethink the way we think about this minimization principle.
One of the things that I proposed as a solution was a sort of an accountability framework. I know that there are some senators in the US that came up with that sort of a model, an accountability framework. I know that Europe is thinking about accountability as a framework, which says that you need to establish a rights-based framework, and then punish for harms that are caused, regardless of the consent that you obtain, and things like that.
This is one solution. There are many other solutions that people are working on.
In India, we’re working on something along the lines of a techno-legal solution, where we actually get this aggregate data and put it into confidential clean rooms so that the data resides within the confidential clean room (CCR). Privacy is ensured, but artificial intelligence models can be run in those CCR environments so that you can just get the results. You can train the models without actually getting access to the private data. There aren’t many such solutions, and I strongly feel that we’ve got to start thinking along these lines in order to be able to unlock the value that aggregate data has without causing any of the harms.
That was a very long, non-competition related statement, but I’m just playing to my strengths. Sorry for that, Samir.

GANDHI:
Not at all, Rahul, and you’d be amazed at how these non-competition law issues, as you term it, are actually invaluable as far as this larger debate is concerned, because I think that’s the crux of today’s conversation that we have about, ostensively, two disciplines, if you can call it that, moving in tandem, or at least very closely in parallel, and there are multiple points of intersection.
Speaking of intersection, because I do hear, Rahul, from your comments as well, that there is this understanding, at least amongst privacy lawyers, this concept of almost utilitarian, which is that there could be a greater need in certain circumstances for data to be shared, and there are, therefore, in the competition world at least, efficiencies to be extracted which could lead to greater consumer benefit, so on and so forth.
Taking up or taking cue from that, perhaps I can move to Danny and ask, we’ve looked at privacy so far as being the dawn on price competition type of parameter in competition assessment, is there some sort of a merit in viewing privacy as a price parameter as well? Apart from the so-called exploitation, which could be a result, but there is also a price aspect to it. Is there something that we could explore further also as competition lawyers?

SOKOL:
If we think that the monetization of anything is possible, then there’s going to be some price related aspects. Part of it might be to step back and think about what are the business models of the people who are involved in data.
Lots of products generate data. All your apps, many of your smart devices, ISPs, you have data managers who have access to data, you have data aggregators. If you think about each of these different buckets of business models, including those who, just like us, are giving all kinds of data, it may not be big data.
I say this because we’re now in season 16 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” There’s a lot of data that we get, and not all of it is pro-competitive. The larger point is that we are able, across a number of areas of law, primarily contract, to figure out how much that data is worth. In some ways, it reminds us of IP discussion of what is the value of any kind of intangible good like IP, whether copyright, or trademark, or patent, but in some ways it’s different, because unlike IP, much of data is non-exclusive and non-rivalrous. I say much of, because there may be some unique data sets, for example, certain areas of digital health or upstream industrial data, where you just don’t have any kind of way of replicating it.
Could we give it some kind of financial value? Yes. Do we have a consistent set of metrics outside of arms-length business transactions across areas of law? The answer is no. We have certain confusion, let’s say, as to trying to figure out the value. That, I think, is going to become much clearer in the next few years across areas of laws as cases play out.
But, from a competition standpoint, we’ve had cases that I can simply describe as odd. The German FCO case against Facebook, for example, couldn’t be brought under European competition law, but because of the uniqueness of the German law could be brought there. But the idea that simply collecting data might somehow lead to competitive harm, again, so much of law is drawing analogies, whether it’s privacy law, contract law, or competition law. I’ll draw another one. If it’s simply about amassing something, we don’t have a law that says, it’s bad to amass cash, right? If you’re saying that we can monetize data, then we say, okay, if it’s priced, let’s just say it’s cash. We don’t, from a corporate governance standpoint, say that if you sit on too much cash, that somehow this is a competition abuse. And this gets to a larger point, at least in competition law. It’s not what you have, it’s what you do with it. That’s true, whether it’s data or any kind of other tool that you might have that is an input to some kind of outcome. That’s where I think competition law plays a particularly strong role.
Again, let me also note, in the United States, we don’t have exploitative abuse, so the German case couldn’t have come up in the US context, but the idea of some kind of exclusionary conduct, aha, now we have conduct. The conduct may have a basis with some kind of data, but where we’ve had those cases, we haven’t seen that.
We have a case involving the auto industry and data sharing, CDK, that went before the Seventh Circuit. A Section 1 case: no competition abuse. In much the way that Henri discussed, for example, that this is not quite the same as an essential facility, the court there was actually quite explicit: data is not an essential facility for competition purposes. There are other cases like this.
Samir, I think in short, what I would say is that this is an area where we’re going to see a lot more action across jurisdictions in the next few years, as we sort of work through these kinds of concepts.

GANDHI:
Thanks, Danny. That sounds ominous: lots more of action. As you said, there is some degree of confusion, right? Is simply collecting data a competition law issue when most of us have grown up at least thinking that it’s not. As you said, it’s not what you have, but what you do with it.
Perhaps, Henri, you’re the right person to direct this question to, assuming that this is really an issue. What is the typical kind of evidentiary standard that regulators would need to follow in order to enforce cases where privacy is asserted as a competition concern? If you reach a situation where competition regulators across the globe are using privacy as a parameter in their competitive assessment, do you see that happening? Is that something that you believe is imminent? And what do you think, if that were to become the case, would be the most viable remedy? What is it that a competition regulator can ultimately do about a situation like this, should it pan out? Henri?

PIFFAUT:
It’s a very wide question. Let me try to give a meaningful answer. I think to give an answer, first it is required to make a kind of taxonomy of the cases under antitrust rules that may involve privacy. When looking at the decisions of the cases that have been taken in Europe, to me there are four groups of antitrust cases that involve privacy. The first one is when the last platform, let’s say a dominant platform, when implementing a legal obligation in terms of privacy protection, we’ll have different options to do that, and we’ll choose one option, which would mean raising barriers to entry to a much higher degree than the other options available. So that’s one.
A second category of case is when actually the platform is already fulfilling its privacy legal obligations, but has decided to increase the protection. It’s where privacy becomes a parameter of competition. Beforehand, it was just a legal obligation, but now it becomes a parameter of competition. One instance would be the Apple ADT window that we just mentioned earlier in our discussion. That could lead to raising barriers to entry, or to self-preferencing issues, et cetera.
The third category is actually in a case where devising a remedy to a competitive harm would involve access to data, and that access to data may actually lead to privacy issues.
For instance, for all the infrastructure companies like Mobilier, the old monopolies in electricity or gas in France, there was an issue of how do you enable potential competitors to get into the market? They need access to the identity, and the addresses and telephone numbers of the customers of the old monopoly if they want to do so, but otherwise it’s privacy issues.
And the last category is the infamous German-Facebook case, where when you face a manifesting infringement of privacy laws, it could be labeled as an exploitative abuse. That’s not something which is absurd because I actually find that in an intersection of the IP law and competition law where manifestly, say fake patents, could be addressed in the competition law if it’s manifests. But in all of these, to go back to your question about the burden of proof, you will find different features in terms of burden of proof. In some instances, you need to interact with the privacy regulator, but we provide the Competition Authority with a kind of an assessment of what the issues are. To some of us, it’s obvious now for the Competition Authority to make some determination. It all very much depends on the category of case in which you are.
Now, to come to the second part of your question, let’s mention, by the way, there would be a case involving privacy at a global level. It all depends on what you call privacy. If it’s about the legal obligation, that may get a bit complicated, because all jurisdictions have different meanings, definitions, and obligations for privacy protection. If it’s about moving beyond and privacy as a parameter for competition, you may think of the Privacy Sandbox of Google, for instance. There, one ciykd imagine it can have cooperation on their mechanisms that exist for that kind of cooperation between the various competition authorities, because obviously from a business perspective, if there was a need for any remedy, such a remedy would need to be the same for across jurisdictions, otherwise the running of its business would get a bit complicated.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Henri, that is immensely useful. Just to pick up on that very last point, which I could not agree more with personally, which is remedies need to be consistent. In some sense, for these are multinational corporations which work across various jurisdictions to have a spaghetti bowl of remedies would perhaps not be as efficient an outcome as a one would want.
But I think moving over to you, Maureen, if you would continue in this vein of look of looking at what is it that we can do about situations when they arise? What are the kinds of remedies that a competition lawyer can look at? I guess we’ve spoken about this briefly in the past, but, if I can ask you, how do proposals regarding data portability forced obligations in some sense to share data? How do they comport? How do they sit with competition and privacy values? How do you accommodate all of this in literally the same sentence?

OHLHAUSEN:
In the extent some of the proposals particularly, in some of the privacy laws that are proposed legislation in the US would give consumers the right to port their data, to get it and import it to another user. I think, in that instance, you could see privacy law and competition law kind of in concert, in harmony. The consumer gets to decide and gets to exercise his or her market choice, and gets to decide whether he or she wants to share with someone else.
I think more concerns are raised when you have this forced sharing of personally identifiable data not subject to the consumer’s consent, the idea that I share my data with one player, but another player wants to get in the market, and therefore there is an obligation to just port that data over. That really puts privacy law and competition law in conflict.
That was my “frenemy,” or “foes and frenemies” part of my article.
One of the things that we’re seeing, and I have concerns in some of the proposals in the US law for some of the, particularly the big platform companies, is this idea that basically any business user, whoever that may be, it doesn’t really have to be a competitor, can ask for access, ask for the data, ask for interoperability of systems, with the idea that perhaps this will lead to more competition. They don’t have to justify it. It’s not up to them to justify the entity asking for access. The idea of some of these proposals is that maybe that’ll lead to more competition, but that really kind of flips the approach that we’ve had in the US to privacy and data security, which is to put the obligation on the holders of the data to say, “Who are you sharing it with? Why are you sharing it? Be sure you lock it down.” All the things that the FTC has said to many companies.
Some of these legislative proposals, what they do is actually kind of flip that, so that the entity holding the data is at big risk. If it says, “Well, I’m not sure you’re a reliable partner to share this data with. I’m not sure you’re a safe entity with whom to inter-operate,” under some of these proposals in the US, there is the provision that the company narrowly tailored to protect consumer privacy or security of their systems. They could say, “Well, I’m not going to share it,” but if they don’t get it right, if it’s not narrowly tailored enough, they have to kind of meet this higher burden. All the risk is on them. There are all these penalties that they may face, and kind of a huge hammer brought down on them.
We know the benefits through privacy regulation to consumers of making sure that their data isn’t shared as freely, and that we respect consumers’ choices, their sovereignty, and that data security is provided to them. We’ve kind of embraced those values through privacy law, and we’ve seen that throughout the world. We’re sort of moving away from that to reduce that to say, “Well we’re going to open this up, and let’s hope that it leads to more competition.” I think that really puts antitrust—if you can call these proposals antitrust, because they have much more of a regulatory bend to them than the traditional antitrust bend—that really puts our traditional notions of how you protect privacy and how you protect consumers’ data at odds with these ideas that forcing this and putting the whole obligation on the holder of the data to justify whether why they’re withholding it. This sort of puts those two things, I think, in a great tension. It’ll be, I think, in a very difficult position for those companies that would be subject to these proposals, should they pass.

GANDHI:
So, in serious “frenemy” territory, I’d say, Maureen.

OHLHAUSEN:
Yes.

GANDHI:
That’s absolutely intriguing, because I did want to pick up on, and get your thoughts on one further point, because you did say that some of these proposals have a regulatory bend to them, right? I want to just start on that. There is a significant conversation happening, perhaps in India as well.
Rahul, maybe you’d be in a better position to comment, but, Maureen, the conversation that I refer to really is, would we be better off? When I say we, I mean would the consumer, would the state, would consumer interests, which clearly lies at the heart of all of this, be better off by some form of predetermined, clear regulation, so ex ante regulation. Something which clearly says here are the key do’s and don’ts, mindful of the overlapping or the linkages between privacy and competition law. Let’s do this upfront. Let’s remove the uncertainty from the process because ex-post kind of conduct-based evaluations as competition regulators love to carry out, also lead to uncertainty. So, I guess this is the question that I wanted to bounce off each of each of our panelists: is ex ante privacy regulation with all, or some, of the various factors that each of you have pointed out the way to go, or the way to resolve this in a way such that there are at least certain outcomes which benefit the consumer? If there are roles for different agencies over there, how do you ensure that these agencies actually speak with each other to ensure that there is some sort of a uniformity and outcome?
Maureen, if I can start with you?

OHLHAUSEN:
Certainly, happy to start on this.
I think that having a generally applicable, in the US, federal privacy law that lays out the consumer rights and the corresponding obligations on the holders of data would really be a great contribution. First, of all, the legislation that I mentioned, the way it’s been drafted, only applies to a handful of companies. That creates some competitive distortions. If you have a generally applicable law, and one of the other things that I found as a privacy enforcer, it’s not necessarily the big companies that are causing the greatest privacy damage. Small companies have sometimes very sensitive data. Think about this; we brought the case against Ashley Madison, where when that data was released, there were reports of people committing suicide. I think having a generally applicable law so that companies know where the boundaries are and can plan accordingly.
I also think it’s very difficult to have this sort of, “Well is this allowed, not allowed?” Five years later we decide, “Oh no, the line should really be in a different place,” and you’re on the hook for something where when we made these decisions, and we had these in place, it wasn’t really law. It was more the practice, the expectation, or something like that look different.
I think having generally applicable, economy-wide, privacy law with clear enforcement tools. My recommendation would be that those enforcement tools go to the Federal Trade Commission. I think that would really be kind of the path forward here.
I think all the panelists have touched on this: where you draw the lines for privacy, because that will have an impact on innovation and competition. Any privacy law also needs to take that into account, because regulation that’s poorly done can have negative competitive impacts. You’re always going to have some trade-off, but you kind of want to make that trade-off as sensible as possible.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Maureen.
Henri, maybe I can check in on you on this one, mindful, of course, that you’re a competition regulator, but equally I think Maureen makes a pretty compelling point, which is ultimately interests are best served if there is some degree of certainty. So perhaps a clear regulation upfront is welcome. But naturally, they would be areas where this could have some sort of impact on innovation and competition, and that’s the slightly hairy line that we are talking about. Is that’s where we start to wonder, what’s the role of a competition regulator, even if there is an ex ante privacy law? Is it solvable by the regulators speaking with each other? Is it better solved, as I think Maureen tends to indicate, that perhaps have the competition regulator also be the one who enforces this ex ante privacy regulation? Maureen, I’m not sure if that’s what you meant by when you said that, “Give those paths to the FTC,” but Henri, your thoughts on this?

PIFFAUT:
So there’s clearly a need for communication. You know that the situation in Europe is a bit different from that in the US also. We have an ex ante regulation. I hate the word ex ante, but at least behavior obligations are pretty clear. What is perhaps a bit less clear, because it’s still a baby, it’s something like three years old and so the teeth are getting out, the implementation of privacy law in Europe is country-by-country. It’s a European regulation, but it’s country-by-country, and there’s a need to know who has jurisdiction, and then to make sure that the privacy regulators understand each other within Europe, and apply some of the rules, and put them in a consistent way.
Perhaps one other point is really important, privacy as understood in Europe is, in a way, a pro-competitive regulation. Why? Because it provides choice. Informed choice to consumers and to customers.
And second, into the GDPR, there is a provision for the portability of data, which, when implemented, could lead to decreasing the costs of switching our customers from one platform to the others.
To come back, there’s always friction. As I was saying, there’re four points of contacts, four categories of cases, that may involve both privacy and competition law. For that to be resolved, you need a lot of interaction and discussion, whether at the structural level, or at a more informal level between the regulators for competition and for privacy. In Europe, that has a horizontal element within a country, but there’s also a vertical element because there is also discussion that needs to be done between one country and the European Commission, or one country and another; one applying the privacy law and the other one competition law. It’s a little bit complicated to implement.

GANDHI:
Sounds familiar, honestly, Henri, complicated to implement.
I think, Rahul, moving over this very quickly, if I can get your thoughts. India as a country abounds in complications. When Henri was saying you have to be consistent, there’s a country-by-country approach, we’re obviously mindful of the various contradictions within the federal India as a board. How do you see this playing out within a jurisdiction such as India?

MATTHAN:
Just to make things slightly more complicated, maybe I can talk about what India is doing with regard to portability, and I mentioned briefly techno-legal approach.
India has built a framework called DEPA, Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture. Essentially, this is a technology layer on top of the consent-based privacy layer that Henri just spoke about. It allows us to do a lot of the things that I think Maureen was concerned about, which is, if you allow portability, you’re opening up a fire hose; competition is going to suck information. How do you protect user privacy? The DEPA architecture essentially implements portability with user consent, but in a micro-portability way.
When I spoke about financial benefits of portability in the Indian context, in the DEPA context, does, is it will allow a user to say, “Look, I’ve got information in my bank, but another lender wants this information. I, with my consent can allow that lender to take that information.” And so, in a sense it’s a marriage of the two. It improves competition because it allows new-to-bank customers. People with whom the user does not have an existing relationship can actually offer services to that user, improving competition. At the same time, it does not allow that person to misuse that information because all of the information passes with consent.
I think that as lawyers and as regulators, we tend to think that solutions lie in regulation, ex post or ex ante, but I spend so much time with technologists that I think that it is possible, particularly since ultimately we’re regulating tech companies, bringing regulation to a tech company is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. If you want to really regulate them, bring technology in to regulate the technology companies using the power of technology. I think India has done that neatly with the DEPA architecture.

GANDHI:
Thanks a ton for that, Rahul. I guess a final word, wrapping up comments, whichever way you look at it, given that we have probably overstayed our welcome with our hosts.
Danny, as an academic, perhaps you can give us an overview as well, regulation ex ante/ex post. Henri told us of his discomfort with the term ex ante to start with. Rahul has very kindly characterized this as being bringing a knife to a gunfight. How exactly do you see this? Is it time for us to regulate or ex ante? Or are our competition law tools adequate? Is the current status quo with both of these things running parallel adequate? Or do you see some sort of a need for change?

SOKOL:
Very quickly, the enforcement tools work effectively for purposes of enforcement. If there are issues of regulation, then we ask the basic questions: what is it we’re trying to regulate? How do we make sure that regulation is as least distortive as possible, but still reach the goals of competition that we want to have? There’s a lot of complexity here. Unlike a traditional utility in a static market, let’s say a provision of water utilities, here there are real dynamic effects, and we have to be very careful about making sure we calibrate properly. Is there a role for some area of regulation? Quite possibly, yes. What exactly that means in practice requires careful thought.

GANDHI:
On that happy note, careful thought and calibration is where we will leave the conversation. Thank you, once again.
I don’t think that I’m well-positioned to, nor do I need to, sum up anything or any of the comments that the speakers have made today, so I’m going to end here. We’re also out of time.
I need to thank all our panelists once again. This has been, at least for me, a tremendously informative and fun conversation. Maureen, Danny, Rahul, Henri, a big thank you from me, but also on behalf of the other panelists. If we did have a live body audience, this is the point in time where you would hear much applause. Thanks a ton again for your time, and have a good remainder of the day or a remainder of the evening, depending on where you are. Thanks again.

425,"December 6, 2021",What Should We Do About The Big Tech Monopolies?,"
In this essay, I pursue two paths. In the first, I revisit the beginnings of U.S. antitrust law to emphasize that that law has long had a policy of permitting firms to grow organically into dominant market positions. The Sherman Act created an anti-trust policy, not a broad anti-monopoly policy. And that remained true even as U.S. antitrust law moved in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act with The Federal Trade Commission Act and The Clayton Act. I then turn to the second path. The history described in the first section suggests that, by design, there are fundamental limits on how U.S. antitrust law can respond to firms that have achieved great, legitimate success. But firms can stray and that brings them within antitrust. Case settlements move faster than litigation and put on the table many of the tools that we associate with regulation, such as nondiscrimination obligations, access rights, and line-of-business restrictions.

By Randal C. Picker1
 
Sue them? Regulate them? Both? The rise of the big tech firms has created a moment of possible change in how those firms are regulated. You really do need a scorecard to keep track of the pending antitrust suits and investigations of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. (Microsoft, so far, seems to be mainly below the radar). The same is true of pending bills in the U.S. Congress. It is easier in Europe, where both the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are under consideration, though as soon as we turn to the member states possible responses grow quickly, where Germany has been an early mover. If we switch to Asia, South Korea has moved to regulate app stores. This is platform regulation organized around the gatekeeping positions of the big tech firms.
Antitrust and regulation are different approaches to possible controls over these firms. U.S. antitrust laws are organized around ideas of fault, market definition, and market power. Litigation in the U.S. is a slow path to change and the same is true in Europe. New laws offer the promise of a quick regime change, though the lessons of regulatory statutes like the Telecommunications Act of 1996 make clear that vague statutes can also lead to litigation timelines measured in decades over the language of new statutes.
In this essay, I pursue two paths. In the first, I revisit the beginnings of U.S. antitrust law to emphasize that that law has long had a policy of permitting firms to grow organically into dominant market positions. The Sherman Act created an anti-trust policy, not a broad anti-monopoly policy. And even as U.S. antitrust law moved in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act with The Federal Trade Commission Act and The Clayton Act, leading voices of that era — soon-to-be-Justice Louis Brandeis and soon-to-be-President Woodrow Wilson — made clear that even though they opposed the trusts, they were not opposed to firms that achieved their market positions though legitimate competition and organic growth.
I then turn to the second path. The history described in the first section suggests that, by design, there are fundamental limits on how U.S. antitrust law can respond to firms that have achieved great, legitimate success. But firms born through innovation do not necessarily always stay on the righteous path and that, appropriately and again by design, brings them within the grasp of antitrust. Case settlements can be powerful tools in part because they can move faster than full-tilt litigation with trials and appeals and in part because settlements put on the table many of the tools that we associate with regulation, such as nondiscrimination obligations, access rights, and line-of-business restrictions.
As that suggests, there is some overlap between how antitrust can operate and how new platform legislation is likely to be framed. The AT&T cases in the U.S. provide a useful touchstone here, as antitrust and legislation moved in parallel even as they pursued similar ends with many of the same instruments. Right now, in Europe, the momentum behind legislation there almost certainly reflects frustration over the inability of the competition policy authorities to achieve more on-the-ground competitive changes even as they have, so far at least, issued a series of fines and rulings against Google and in an earlier era against Microsoft. In the U.S., the public cases against, so far, Amazon, Facebook and Google are still quite young and possible legislation seems to have more momentum as both Republicans and Democrats express often different frustrations with the big tech firms. That said, the big tech firms have achieved their positions by providing products valued by the public and regulation, via antitrust or through new statutes, should ensure that the value of those products is not lost through new clumsy rules.
  
I. LEGITIMATE MONOPOLIES IN EARLY U.S. ANTITRUST LAW
The best place to start to understand what Senator Sherman hoped to accomplish is with the text of the legislation he introduced. On August 14, 1888, Sherman introduced S.3445 into the 1st Session of the Fiftieth Congress and the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. The title of the bill — “To declare unlawful trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and production” — gives a good sense of Sherman’s central goal. In the first session of the next Congress, Sherman once again introduced his bill, now as S.1. On March 18, 1890, Sherman introduced a revised version of the bill to navigate possible objections that had been raised regarding the constitutionality of the bill.1
But the core of Sherman’s approach had not changed between 1888 and 1890. Sherman was focused on joint activity, not single firm activity. His bill targeted “arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between two or more citizens or corporations.” Which of those were declared “to be against public policy, unlawful and void?” Those which were made with a view to, or which tended “to prevent full and free competition” relating to imports or in “articles of growth, production, or manufacture.” In addition to those limits, Sherman wanted to declare unlawful “arrangements, trusts or combinations between such citizens or corporations” “made with a view to or which tend to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles.” Sherman was looking to ban joint activity that interfered with competition, or which raised prices to consumers.
Sherman clearly was targeting the rise of the trusts, hence the characterization of this proposed bill as “anti-trust.” The trusts represented an effort by capitalists to bring competing enterprises together in a single great organization. Unsurprisingly, trusts had their defenders and Samuel Dodd, the lawyer for and brains behind the Standard Oil Trust, offered a spirited defense of trusts in the New York Daily Tribune on February 2, 1890. But Dodd was running against the popular tide.3
Sherman lost control of his bill in the Senate and on March 27, 1890, it was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. A week later, on April 2, 1890, Senator Edmunds came to the full Senate with an amended version of Sherman’s bill. The amendment struck all of Sherman’s language — really all — and the new language would become what we think of as the now-familiar language of the “Sherman” Act when it was enacted on July 2, 1890. And as is probably clear from the discussion so far, Sherman’s original bill did not use the word “monopoly” or “monopolize” and only pursued joint activities and not those by single firms.4
On April 8, 1890, the Senate turned to consider the Judiciary Committee draft. Sherman himself had exited the debate, saying that he would vote for the new draft deeming it “the best under all the circumstances that the Senate is prepared to give in this direction.” But even as the Senate was moving to vote, Senator Kenna raised a question about the meaning of the new language in Section 2. Kenna posed a hypothetical involving someone who “by his own skill and energy, by the propriety of his conduct generally, shall pursue his calling to in such a way as to monopolize a trade.” As Kenna continued to talk, he ran at the hypo again, focusing on someone “who happens by his skill and energy to command an innocent and legitimate monopoly of a business.” The proposed new statute would be a criminal statute and Kenna wanted to know if this behavior was a crime.5
Senator Edmunds who had brought the revised draft from the Judiciary Committee assured Senator Kenna that his hypos were outside the scope of Section 2: “Anybody who knows the meaning of the word ‘monopoly,’ as the courts apply it, would not apply it to such a person at all; and I am sure that my friend must understand that.” Edmunds would quickly take a second run at his answer: “It does not do anything of this kind, because in the case stated the gentlemen has not any monopoly at all. He has not bought off his adversaries. He has not got possession of all the horned cattle of the United States. He has not done anything but compete with his adversaries in trade if he had any, to furnish the commodity for the lowest price. So, I assure my friend that he need not be disturbed upon the subject.”6
The byplay on the floor of the Senate between the two senators gave a sense of what was excluded and included under the new language of Section 2. Legitimately obtained monopoly was outside of Section 2 and of course Section 1 only addressed joint activity and so would not cover single-entity monopoly. Monopolization required more, such as buying off adversaries or some other illegitimate business act.
Jump to the presidential election of 1912. The trusts had continued to be the subject of inquiry and possible legislation. And in its 1911 ruling in Standard Oil, the U.S. Supreme Court had resolved a key interpretative question regarding Section 1 of the Sherman Act in concluding that that section barred only unreasonable restraints of trade. Louis Brandeis, who would join the Supreme Court on June 1, 1916, was then a private lawyer in Boston but he was a central participant in the discussion about what to do about the trusts.7
Brandeis drew a clear line between the trusts — a tool that typically brought competing businesses together to limit competition — and what Brandeis sometimes termed “natural” monopoly. Those were firms that had achieved their position not through combination but rather through natural, organic, internal growth. Firms that had succeeded through legitimate competition in the marketplace. Brandeis was skeptical that the latter really existed, but he was clear about how more efficient firms should be treated: “There is nothing in our industrial history to indicate that there is any need whatever to limit the natural growth of a business to preserve competition. We may emphatically declare: ‘Give fair play to efficiency.’”8
Brandeis’s framing gives rise to an obvious question: if we were to focus on the large industrial enterprises of his era, what was the mix between the competition-limiting trusts and firms that had achieved their position through organic growth? I do not know the answer to that question, but even as Brandeis was speaking and writing, there was one prominent example of Brandeis’s so-called natural monopoly: the Aluminum Company of America. On May 19, 1912, The New York Times offered an update on five recent cases: The Powder Trust; The Standard Oil Trust; The Tobacco Trust; The Electric Lamp Trust; and what it termed The Aluminum Trust. Even as it described — almost certainly mistakenly — Alcoa as a trust, it explained why the government had not moved to dissolve the company: “That company is not a combination of former competitors but has obtained a practical monopoly of the business through its own growth, with valuable patents and almost complete control of known deposits of bauxite, the base of aluminum.” A business built on government patents to be sure but built on its own internal growth and success.9
Woodrow Wilson would win the 1912 presidential election. One of the issues that he campaigned on was the trust issue and he would subsequently publish a book of those speeches, framed in the overarching vision of what he called The New Freedom. In Chapter VIII of that book, Wilson addressed Monopoly, or Opportunity?. Even as Wilson highlighted the risks posed to society by the trusts, especially in his view the money trust or what he said really was the credit trust, Wilson repeatedly distinguished his views on the trusts from those of big businesses that grew organically through legitimate competition. Wilson announced that “I am for big business, and I am against the trusts.” Wilson did not fear big businesses: “I admit that any large corporation built up by the legitimate processes of business, by economy, by efficiency is natural; and I am not afraid of it, no matter how big it grows.” And Wilson closed the chapter by returning to those ideas: “I know, and every man in his heart knows, that the only way to enrich America is to make it possible for any man who has the brains to get into the game. I am not jealous of any business that has grown to that size. I am not jealous of any process of growth, no matter how huge the result, provided the result was indeed obtained by the processes of wholesome development, which are the processes of efficiency, of economy, of intelligence, and of invention.”10
  
II. THE INTERSECTION OF ANTITRUST AND PLATFORM REGULATION
There are a few takeaways from that brief look at the origins of U.S. antitrust law. It was, first and foremost, anti-trust law. The trusts were artificial combinations that limited competition and restoring that competition was the goal. And government-created monopolies bestowed by kings and queens were condemned. But there was no general condemnation of monopoly as such as is clear in the through line from the 1890 Senate floor debates over the draft bill to Brandeis and Wilson during the 1912 election. A firm could compete legitimately and grow to dominate its market. Size as such was not the issue, but how the firm behaved mattered for whether liability would be found.
That suggests that there was a core limit on what antitrust can do against firms that grew to dominate their markets. But, at the same time, successful firms could overstep and face antitrust suits, and while winning those suits would usually require a showing of fault, settlements can be powerful levers for changing market competition. Take one prominent example: the U.S. government’s settlements with AT&T in 1956 and 1982. Both of those were consensual settlements cut between AT&T and the U.S. government, and, given that, neither required a full-blown finding of fault. It was enough that a finding of fault was possible and that both sides saw a deal as the way forward to resolve the situation.
In both situations, it is worth paying attention to the timelines of the settlements. On January 15, 1949, the U.S. government brought an antitrust suit against AT&T seeking to split up AT&T and to force AT&T to license certain of its patents on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. Seven years later, on January 24, 1956, the government and AT&T settled the case. Seven years for a settled case. The 1956 AT&T final judgment had two core provisions both of which are of the sort that we often associate with platform regulation. The first was an access provision that opened AT&T’s patents on extremely favorable terms, while the second was a line-of-business restriction that boxed in AT&T in communications markets and excluded it from other markets, particularly the young computing market. Both of those provisions almost certainly had important consequences. The patents licensing regime boosted innovation, while barring AT&T from computing almost certainly made it easier for IBM to build up its market position.11
On November 21, 1974, the U.S. government once again brought an antitrust lawsuit seeking to break up the firm. As that suit continued to run, Congress considered new laws to address telecommunications competition. On October 7, 1981, by a 90-4 vote, the Senate approved a draft bill that would have resolved many of the pending competition issues and if the House of Representatives had move forward, it was likely the government would have dropped the pending lawsuit.12
But on January 8, 1982, the U.S. government and AT&T announced a settlement of the pending antitrust suit, this time one that would breakup AT&T. AT&T would eventually be split into eight large firms: AT&T proper as a long-distance company freed of most of the restrictions of the 1956 final judgment and seven regional Bell operating companies (“RBOCs”) providing local telephone service. The settlement created nondiscrimination obligations to boost long-distance competition while also imposing line-of-business restrictions on the RBOCs and much more limited ones on AT&T.13
The AT&T case frames the current situation with the big tech firms nicely. The U.S. government and the various states have antitrust suits pending against Amazon, Facebook and Google. There are private antitrust suits against Apple and rumors of a possible government suit against Apple. The European Commission has investigations pending against Amazon and Apple and ongoing appeals of decisions regarding Google. Full litigation of these cases will likely take years, though as the AT&T timeline makes clear, even settlements of cases may come slowly.
Just as was the case with AT&T, legislation is a natural alternative. In many ways, as was the case with AT&T, negotiated settlements and the likely legislative outcomes might run along similar lines. The pending bills in the U.S. Congress and their counterparts in Europe suggest the likely tools are the traditional tools that we use to regulate network industries, including a mix of nondiscrimination rules, access rules and business line restrictions. As I have argued elsewhere, getting this right is tricky and depending on how it is framed of course, legislation could be quite disruptive to the world that consumers currently live in.14
I have not gone through the pending antitrust cases with enough care to assess the merits of the claims against the big tech firms. But the positions of these firms — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google — reflect in many ways the type of innovation and efficiency that the framers of the Sherman Act and then subsequently Brandeis and Wilson believed should be free of antitrust liability. That of course is not to say that those firms have not violated the antitrust laws — again, I have not expressed a view on that here — but rather that there is core there that we should be sensitive to, whether changes are pursued through antitrust remedies, imposed or agreed, or through legislation.

Margrethe Vestager, EU competition and digital policy head, said the European Parliament and European Council had to move quickly to approve legislation regulating Big Tech because “it is best to get 80 percent now than 100 percent never,” per the Financial Times.
In recent weeks, the European Union has slapped hefty fines on some of the world’s largest technology companies while putting in place rules to limit how Big Tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft stifle competition with anticompetitive practices.

427,"November 16, 2021",The Compliance Program Crucible: The Art of the Internal Investigation,"
This paper explores the most difficult, challenging, and usually concluding portion of a corporate compliance program – the internal investigation. Unlike the other major components of the compliance program – training and audits – the internal investigation is triggered by a government investigation, whistleblower, or even rumor – it is not an action planned by the company. For that reason, the conduct of the investigation has no fixed agenda. It is truly art, not science. This paper sets out the basic steps that a company must take, providing illustrative situations from actual investigations that worked for me and my Internal Investigative Teams.

By Donald C. Klawiter[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION: THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION
A compliance program that meets the requirements set forth by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice is a complex mechanism composed of many moving parts. A program that is “well designed,” “applied earnestly and in good faith” and “works in practice” is much, much more than an annual lecture, a multiple-choice test, or even an audit.[2] Indeed, the full-scale internal investigation usually occurs only when a government investigation is rumored or initiated, or a whistleblower emerges within the company or the industry. Because of its scope, substantial cost and impact on the business, it is not something to be approached casually or handled internally. The investigation shoul...

428,"November 9, 2021",Competition and Regulation: Friends or Foes?1,"

By Christine Ryu-Naya, Jane Antonio & Santos Leyva Rubio2
 
A stellar panel of competition experts from around the world gathered to debate the relationship between competition enforcement and regulation earlier this week, exposing a variety of viewpoints on the topic.  The discussion was featured as part of a new competition forum sponsored by the Business at OECD (BIAC) Competition Committee – the voice of the business community at the OECD Competition Committee – and was co-sponsored by the International Bar Association Antitrust Section.  Building on the June 2021 discussion at the OECD Competition Committee’s WP2 roundtable on competition enforcement and regulatory alternatives and the upcoming December 2021 Competition Committee hearing on ex ante regulation and competition in digital markets, the lively discussion looked back at regulations past, and forward towards the digital market-focused future.
Panelists included OECD Competition Committee Chair Frédéric Jenny, who provided opening remarks, as well as U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Commissioner Christine Wilson, Japan Fair Trade Commission (“JFTC”) Commissioner Reiko Aoki, Chief Competition Economist for DG Competition Pierre Régibeau, and Deputy Chair of Enforcement at the Bank of England Philip Marsden. The program was moderated by BIAC Competition Committee Chair John Taladay.
An overview of BIAC’s work on the topic was provided by BIAC Competition Committee Vice Chair Michael Koch.  He observed the “healthy tension” between the two regimes and the recent shift in many governments towards a more interventionist approach to markets. Koch noted that BIAC believes that “confusing the objective of competition law by pursuing non-competition objectives can have the effect of undermining the credibility of competition enforcement” and referenced the group’s “lodestar,” the concern of businesses to ensure fairness, legal certainty, and predictability of enforcement. Koch’s remarks tied back to the BIAC Competition Committee’s recent comments to the June 2021 roundtable on competition enforcement and regulatory alternatives.
Professor Jenny provided opening remarks, walking attendees through a brief history of the interaction between competition and regulation. He noted that the OECD began raising concerns about the impact of regulations on growth in the 1990s, but that “the interface between competition and regulation has attracted renewed attention in the 2000s, and the perspective on the relationship between the two has changed.” Jenny attributed this change to three key elements: the 2008 financial crisis, which “taught us that competitive markets can fail” and that strict regulation of the financial market was a necessary complement to competition between financial institutions; the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, which “revealed the competition instrument was ineffective” to address unique concerns such as price-gouging and the necessity of competitor collaborations to bring about rapid innovation; and the rapid development of the digital sector, which has shown the difficulty authorities can have in using competition law instruments to monitor anticompetitive practices, leading to increased discussion about ex ante regulation.
Prof. Jenny observed that there are differences between regulation and competition law as instruments, even if they pertain to the same goals, and that it is not easy to take a side given potential trade-offs with each option. He elaborated that regulations are likely to be more general and may miss precise, case-by-case conduct assessment, but allow for intervention before harm is caused, while competition enforcement takes a narrower approach focused on consumer welfare, but may not be equally effective across sectors. Citing the importance of predictability as a recurring theme with BIAC, he noted that the administrative regulatory process is faster and less costly and gives a higher level of predictability than enforcement.
 
Can Regulation Foster Competition?
Following Prof. Jenny’s opening remarks, Taladay began the discussion by asking what experience with economic activity teaches us about the ability of regulation and competition to coexist. Dr. Régibeau began by explaining that “the regulatory experience we’ve had is not necessarily relevant to the situation we have now,” pointing out that past regulation has very rarely had the explicit goal of fostering competition. As an example, he discussed the rigorously regulated pharmaceutical sector as one in which the regulations may appear pro-competitive but were actually motivated by non-competition concerns (e.g. patient safety). Experience “tells us that regulation still needs antitrust quite a bit as a backup,” Régibeau said, but he cautioned that “heavy” regulation could become a barrier to entry.
Commissioner Wilson picked up the theme of the past by citing a Russian proverb: “If you dwell on the past you will lose an eye, but if you forget the past you will lose both eyes.” She expressed hope that others would reflect on past experiences with regulations, saying that “we can characterize our experiences in ways that cabin them and do it with a bit more experience this time.” Wilson stated that the antitrust laws in the United States took “decades” to grow into a system based on sound economic principles that have allowed antitrust to develop “for the better.” While noting that this development has not been perfect – citing her own repeated calls to the FTC to undertake retrospectives and studies to enhance enforcement of the antitrust laws – she lamented calls for a hands-on approach to regulating entire sectors of the economy. “In the United States, we’ve learned that this can turn out badly,” she said, listing the historical failures of airline regulation and the Civil Aeronautics Board, and railroad regulation and the Interstate Commerce Commission, citing a 2012 article by now-FTC Chair Lina Khan acknowledging this issue. Observing that there have been calls to use railroad regulation as a model for future regulations, Wilson concluded, “unfortunately, I believe that the proponents of increased regulation in the U.S. are ignoring our past mistakes.”
  
The Interaction of Competition Agencies and Regulation
Commissioner Aoki relayed the JFTC’s considerable experience in cooperating with other agencies to jointly develop guidance and build a relationship between enforcement and regulation. These cooperative efforts, she explained, have included informal information and staff exchanges, as well as membership in government advisory committees. She gave a specific example related to the telecommunications sector, where the JFTC conducted a joint market survey of mobile phones and formulated guidelines for promoting competition in the sector, working to clarify problematic practices under both the Anti-Monopoly Act and the Telecommunications Business Law. Aoki also shared that the JFTC has been one of three agencies that has worked to establish a body to address digital market issues and has shared staff, assisted in setting up headquarters and counsel management, and provided background materials; going forward, competition issues identified by the body will be referred to the JFTC.
Dr. Marsden, a former senior official at the UK CMA and OFT prior to joining the Bank of England, declared that “regulation tends to step in where there’s a market failure – but regulatory failure can happen too.” Picking up on Régibeau’s pharma example, Marsden pointed out that pharmaceutical firms can exploit loopholes and gaps in regulation and “like a geyser, prices shoot up.” In these cases, he said, regulators cannot do anything – and are often the main complainant to competition authorities asking for action. Marsden called U.S. criticism of UK and EU excessive pricing restrictions “amusing” given the United States’ lack of residual protection in antitrust for failure regulation, characterizing the regime as “less ‘in God we trust’ than ‘in regulation we trust’ than Europe.” Marsden then shifted to digital markets, which he said have highlighted the weaknesses of antitrust as “too slow, too limited, too late, too narrow,” and an example of a failure of antitrust necessitating ex ante regulation to assist the laws.
Wilson responded by noting that a “surgical” approach to regulation inevitably leads to loopholes, leading to eventual expansion. Discussing the recent calls for increased FTC rulemaking, she observed that the calls have been accompanied by backlash over the FTC’s authority to promulgate rules. She concluded that there is “a lot of risk in competition rulemaking,” predicting that this would be playing out in U.S. courts in the near term.
The next question asked the panelists to consider the extent to which it may be appropriate for a competition enforcer to design rules and make policy choices. Jenny’s succinct response was that “this is a role for legislators rather than for competition authorities,” noting however that competition authorities could serve a useful advisory role, if based on sound experience and analysis. Régibeau agreed, noting that the past few years have seen a tendency for legislators to avoid this responsibility and delegate to competition authorities (leading Taladay to observe that “no one wants to take the heat”).
  
Regulation in the Digital Sector
Discussion then turned to the question of ex ante regulation in the digital sector. Jenny criticized a rush to regulation as ignoring the basic question of why the competition laws may have failed to deal with competition issues in the digital sector, opining that competition authorities and economists should first work together to understand how competition works in the digital sector. This will indicate, Jenny argued, whether competition law can adapt to address this unique sector – and if not, what types of regulations are necessary. Jenny noted that with regard to the digital sector, it is largely competition on quality and innovation of services between ecosystems, while authorities have experience with competition on prices. Competition law needs a retooling, adapted to this new reality. Competition economists and authorities need to review how to use the same principles in this new environment to know if competition law can be used or needs to be fixed.
Régibeau echoed this call for preliminary work, saying, “we need to think much, much more deeply before we think ex ante regulation is going to get us out of the problems we have now.” The digital sector is large and diverse, he explained, which creates its own set of problems that need to be carefully weighed before regulations can be conceived. When Taladay questioned whether ex ante regulation should be clear enough to know the impacts, Régibeau observed, “It’s a little bizarre to find in proposed regulation aspects that are currently being investigated for the first time.”
Marsden presented a contrary view, arguing that “we’re not moving all that fast, actually.” “Walk before you run is good advice for a toddler,” he said, observing that Microsoft’s interoperability requirements are already nearly two decades old – “we’re already running” – and that regulators and competition authorities “need to speed up and leap ahead in enforcement.” Calling the current suite of regulation and antitrust initiatives “natural experiments,” Marsden drew an analogy to financial regulations, which he said were already implementing many of the rules that are seen as “new” in the digital markets context.
Marsden detailed the UK’s Open Banking regulations as an ex ante regime of data mobility and interoperability for financial platforms that was initially developed as part of a competition market remedy. “We proposed those remedies and the sky did not fall in,” he said, attributing this in part to a tight focus and clear principles, rules, and standards. These Open Banking regulations, Marsden argued, have led to the UK becoming a global leader in fintech. He suggested innovation should be a primary consideration in regulations, noting that allowing some entry or economic diversity could lead to the next Google, leveling-up innovation standards, and that “lazy oligopolists” who are “reasonably innovative” are likely to increase innovation if required to interoperate and provide data access to would-be challengers.
Aoki responded, calling Marsden’s use of banking as a success story “a bit deceptive” given its status as a well-established industry and the UK’s long history as one of the world’s best financial markets, and highlighting the potential harm regulation could have in the future: “What makes sense now may not make sense 10 years, even five years from now.” Aoki admitted that some new ideas could be harmful and should be kept out of the market, but that ex ante regulation requires the ability to predict what is harmful. She cited conversations with innovators who have deplored the limited list of permissible activities under proposed regulations and proffered that listing permissible conduct in digital markets can be overly restrictive, and would amount to enabling gatekeepers with another form of licensing.
Jenny responded to Marsden, specifically his views on promoting innovation. “Of course we want to have as many innovators as possible,” he said, but how do innovators succeed in the digital sector? He ticked off possible necessities – algorithms, a sizeable user base, and a successful business model – and asked how this could be achieved. Is it by prohibiting platforms from buying innovators with new products but no resources? Or by allowing these mergers? He concluded that he did not have the answer but repeated his call for more preliminary legwork before determining whether and what regulations would be appropriate.
The group next considered the Digital Market Act (DMA) with Jenny opining that the Act “expresses a lot of concern for the competitors in ecosystems” but leaves the benefit to consumers unclear. He drew an analogy to past consideration of vertical integration that did not consider intra-brand competition. Régibeau posited that there is room for ex ante regulation but that at this stage it should be reserved for conduct that is known to be harmful. Asking whether sufficient evidence exists to support the ban on practices covered by the DMA, he stated, “I fail to see why we should not systematically have the same standards for supporting this type of regulation” as required for enforcement efforts.
Marsden again drew an analogy to financial services, noting that much of what is required by the DMA, including interoperability and fair dealing, is already regularly required in financial markets. He gave the example of self-preferencing detection in options exchange platforms. Marsden did disagree with the DMA’s focus on breaking up data pools, noting that platforms merging data across business divisions can lead to benefits and that the best remedy to date has been interoperability requirements. He predicted that other countries would draw an analogy to financial services, particularly as financial regulations tend to focus most heavily on companies with systemic power, similar to the focus on gatekeepers. “What I hope for,” he concluded “is that we cannot leave this all to the courts,” noting efforts in the UK to “code for compliance” rather than prepare for infringement.
Finally, Taladay asked the panelists whether legislative approaches are the best path forward for antitrust reform. Wilson came out firmly skeptical of legislative change, calling American antitrust laws “broad and adaptable” and listing “significant concerns” with current reform proposals in Congress. These include proposals focusing on size rather than market power, proposals untethered from antitrust effects, an innovation-harming “competitor-first approach,” and proposals shifting the burden of proof that she called a defiance of due process coupled with civil penalties “that will encourage baseless lawsuits.” Wilson opined that legislative reform is unnecessary to address competition concerns surrounding Big Tech but may be necessary for other things, such as information asymmetries and Section 230.
 
Approaches to Regulation
The panel concluded with a question about the DMA’s current structure – with a focus on “gatekeepers” – and the appropriate balance between competition and regulation approaches given concerns about the use of per se rules, procedural fairness, and the scope of remedies. Régibeau flagged the trade-off between regulation and flexibility, while Aoki noted that immediately jumping into ex ante regulation is likely unnecessary. Suggesting the two should be more “friend” than “foe,” Marsden called for legislation with “very flexible enforcement tools,” such as compliance units engaged in regular dialogue with platforms and a complaints panel for speedy adjudication. Such features are “completely unheard of” in the “competition bubble,” he said, but without them a single approach is likely to miss things on its own.
The discussion will continue before the OECD Competition Committee on December 2 with a hearing on ex ante regulation and competition in digital markets. The session seeks to create an understanding of what ex ante proposals are on the table and the precise nature of the relationship between regulation and competition enforcement in digital markets. The hearing will also include discussion of issues related to ex ante regulation, including data privacy, consumer protection, the role of fairness, innovation, and economic concentration, and trade-offs with competition

429,"November 7, 2021",Startup Phhhoto Goes After Facebook With Alleging Anti-Competitive Practices,"


Defunct photo app startup Phhhoto filed an antitrust lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York against Facebook alleging the social media giant used anti-competitive tactics intended to pick off rivals, according to The New York Times on Friday (Nov. 5). Phhhoto is seeking unspecified monetary damages.
According to the lawsuit, Phhhoto’s founders allege that Facebook feigned interest in the app but instead launched their own product with similar features — Instagram. Phhhoto founders Champ Bennett, Omar Elsayed, and Russell Armand also claim that Facebook buried its content on Instagram.
Attorney Gary L. Reback is representing Phhhoto and told the Times that he hasn’t seen anti-competitive behavior like Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have exhibited since he convinced the Department of Justice to go after Microsoft in the 1990s.
Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company Meta, told the Times that the lawsuit has no merit and “we will defend ourselves vigorously.”
Founded in 2012 and rolling out its app in 2014, Phhhoto found early popularity from celebrities and was also favored by people using the app to edit photos and string them together in looping videos.
The suit alleges that Facebook strung the company along, dangling a deal that never surfaced. Instead, Phhhoto claims that Facebook ensured its content couldn’t be found and that Phhhoto users couldn’t connect with their friends on Instagram.

431,"October 28, 2021",A Reflection on China’s Merger Reviews – Key Messages from the Latest Five-Year Report and Insights from Economists,"
By Elizabeth Wang, Kun Huang, Sophie Yang & Aston Zhong1
 
Question 1: The Chinese competition authority just issued its 2020 annual report, which provides a review of antitrust enforcement in the last five years. What are the key takeaways on the caseload and processing times on merger transactions? 
In early September of 2021, China’s competition authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) issued a report (“SAMR 2020 Report”) summarizing its Anti-Monopoly Law enforcement activities during the period covering the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).2 From 2016 to 2020, SAMR concluded 2,147 merger reviews and completed 179 antitrust investigations, imposing fines totaling RMB 2.79 billion (or USD 413 million3). The SAMR 2020 Report also examined the competitive landscape and highlighted potential concerns in nine key industries (i.e. pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, automotive, construction materials, transportation, petrochemicals, steel, internet, and public services). Lastly, it provided updates on various legislations, including the amendment of the Anti-Monopoly Law, the introduction of amended regulations,4 and six guidelines covering multiple industries and topics (i.e. Automotive,5 IP,6 Platform Economy,7 Commitments,8 the Application of Leniency,9 and Compliance10). Below, we identify several trends observed in merger-related caseloads and processing times in China.
First, the number of transactions reviewed11 in China has continued to increase, and the number of unconditional clearances has remained high. As shown in Figure 1-1 below, the number of transactions has increased every year since China enacted the Anti-Monopoly Law in 2008, with the only exception being 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic did not slow the number of cases subject to SAMR’s review – a total of 473 mergers were reviewed in 2020, an all-time high. Mergers between domestic companies significantly increased in the past three years and surpassed the number of mergers involving foreign entities for the first time.12 At the same time, the unconditional approval rate remains high – 98 percent of cases were approved unconditionally, with only 48 cases approved with remedies and two cases blocked between 2008 and 2020, averaging four interventions each year.

Second, review time has decreased significantly over time in China. According to the SAMR 2020 Report, the average time from case acceptance to review completion is 24.2 days among all transactions reviewed by SAMR between 2016 and 2020, a significant improvement from 41.2 days between 2011 and 2015.14 There is also a reduction in the pre-notification period between the notification and acceptance dates. The average pre-notification period was 17.8 days between 2016 and 2020 compared to 40.8 days between 2011 and 2015.15 These reductions are partially due to the introduction of the simple case procedure in 2014 to handle transactions deemed less likely to result in competition issues (e.g. those involving parties with lower market shares or revenues in China and thus are eligible for an expedited review process).16 Between 2016 and 2020, over 70 percent of cases in China were reviewed under the simple case procedure.17

Third, on intervention cases, it still takes SAMR a substantial amount of time to conduct its reviews. Figure 1-3 shows the review time and trend line for complex cases where SAMR intervened from 2008 to 2020. Over time, the average review time for intervention cases has increased. For the 22 intervention cases from the last five years, the average review time was 276 days (excluding the pre-notification period before a case is officially accepted by SAMR). When SAMR decides to intervene in a transaction, the review will usually progress into the second or third phase. SAMR is mandated to reach a decision within 180 days after the case is accepted. However, when no resolution is reached within that period, the filing can be withdrawn and refiled, thus resulting in a longer review time. Between 2016 and 2020, 16 out of 22 intervention cases went through the “pull-and-refile” procedure to allow SAMR more time to review the case.

Question 2: There have been many high-profile semiconductor mergers in the last few years. Can you highlight the trends in China’s reviews of semiconductor transactions? Is China paying more attention to certain theories of harm for these transactions?
Semiconductors are essential components in many important industries such as communications, computing, transportation, and clean energy. The global semiconductor industry has recently experienced significant consolidation. In the last five years alone, there have been 72 merger reviews completed in China for semiconductor-related transactions.21 We observe three key trends in merger reviews in China in the semiconductor space.
First, semiconductor transactions are less likely to be reviewed under the simple case procedure in China. Between 2016 and 2020, only 25 percent of all transactions concluded by SAMR did not go through the simple case procedure,22 while this number is much higher (55 percent) for semiconductor transactions.23
Second, compared to other industries, a higher percentage of semiconductor transactions are cleared with remedies in China. Between 2016 and 2020, only 1 percent of all transactions concluded by SAMR were approved with remedies,24 while 8.3 percent (6 out of 72 deals) of semiconductor transactions were approved with remedies.25
Third, among intervention cases, semiconductor transactions have not experienced longer review times than non-semiconductor ones in the last five years. As shown in Figure 2-1 below, among the 22 intervention cases concluded by SAMR between 2016 and 2020, the average review period was 230 days for semiconductor transactions and 293 days for non-semiconductor ones.26
Figure 2-1: SAMR’s Review Periods for Intervention Cases, 2016-202027
Source: SAMR and MOFCOM decisions, summarized by Compass Lexecon28
SAMR identified the following key characteristics and areas of enforcement associated with the semiconductor industry: 1) accelerated industry consolidation and increasingly more transactions,
2) highly concentrated markets with high entry barriers, 3) large percentage of conglomerate mergers that exacerbate the risk of bundling and tying, and 4) consideration of future technological development and industry characteristics when defining relevant markets and evaluating remedies.29
Indeed, SAMR’s primary competitive concern in semiconductor cases has been about bundling and tying. These semiconductor transactions typically involve complementary products from neighboring markets, and SAMR often raised concerns regarding foreclosure of competition via anti-competitive bundling and tying or reduced interoperability. For example, in Infineon/Cypress (2020), SAMR found that the parties have a neighboring relationship in the automotive-grade MCU market and the automotive-grade NOR flash memory market. SAMR raised concerns that the merged party could reduce the interoperability between their own automotive-grade NOR flash memory and third-party MCUs, thus leveraging its market power in automotive-grade NOR flash memory onto the market of automotive-grade MCUs and excluding competition therein.30
Remedies to address concerns over anti-competitive bundling and tying in semiconductor transactions in China include various behavioral remedies, such as commitments to no tying or bundling practices, continued supply of relevant products and services, and guarantees of interoperability.31 For instance, in KLA/Orbotech (2019), one of the remedies was to prohibit parties from tying or bundling their process control equipment with semiconductor deposition and etching equipment or apply any unreasonable conditions in the Chinese market post-transaction.32 In NVIDIA/Mellanox (2020), one of the remedies was to maintain compatibility of NVIDIA’s GPU accelerators and Mellanox’s internet devices with competitors’ products;33
 
Question 3: China has been very active in its antitrust enforcement against mergers in the internet space. How does it compare to those in the United States and Europe? 
Recently, big tech companies’ acquisitions of small companies are under the spotlight in the United States and Europe. The key theory of harm is “killer acquisitions,” that is, big tech companies may pre-emptively eliminate future competition by acquiring nascent, disruptive competitors with transactions that typically do not meet the revenue-based merger control notification threshold. For example, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority blocked Sabre’s proposed takeover of Farelogix on the basis that the merger would eliminate a technology innovator in the travel industry and “could result in less innovation in their services.”34 The United States FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter recently described serial acquisitions of the small companies as a “Pac-Man strategy” and stated that “the collective impact of hundreds of smaller acquisitions can lead to a monopolistic behemoth.”35
SAMR has similarly recognized the potential negative consequences of killer acquisitions on innovation in the SAMR 2020 Report, stating that Chinese antitrust agencies may initiate investigations into mergers involving start-ups or emerging platforms even if they do not meet the notification threshold.36
Diverging from the United States and Europe, one of the key areas where Chinese merger review agencies have focused on is internet companies’ failures to notify mergers involving entities formed by the Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) structure. VIE refers to a corporate structure where the controlling party does not own shares of the operating entity but maintains control through a series of agreements.37 Although the VIE structure has been prevalent among internet companies, its legality and compliance with foreign investment rules are questionable in China.38 As a result, many mergers and acquisitions involving VIE-structured companies were not notified in China. In late 2020, SAMR issued inquiries of past mergers for many prominent internet companies, including Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, Baidu, ByteDance, and DiDi.39 China also published Antitrust Guidelines in the Field of Platform Economy (“Platform Guidelines”) in 2021, making it clear that mergers involving VIE structures are not immune to notifications.40 As of mid-October, in 2021, SAMR has fined 50 “fail-to-notify” transactions, most of which involved VIE-structured internet companies.41
In addition to enforcement on transactions involving VIE-structured companies, SAMR intervened in internet mergers based on competitive concerns. In July 2021, it blocked one merger and imposed remedies on another involving large digital platforms.42
While taking into account the unique characteristics of digital platforms, SAMR’s competitive analyses indicate that standard tools continue to play an important role for mergers involving large digital platforms. In particular,

High market shares remain a crucial indicator for SAMR’s finding of market power, while incorporating unique factors associated with digital platforms. For example, in the blocked merger between Douyu and Huya, SAMR considered revenue, active users, and live-streaming resources to measure the parties’ market shares and found that the proposed merger would lead to a combined share of 70 percent in the live gaming market.43
SAMR continues to apply the conventional theory of harm when analyzing the competitive effects of digital platform mergers. For example, the Tencent/China Music Corporation (“CMC”) transaction involved a horizontal combination of two online music broadcasting platforms. SAMR relied on diversion ratio analysis to conclude that Tencent’s QQ Music was a close competitor to CMC’s two music applications.44

Regarding remedies for mergers in the internet space, the Platform Guidelines identified a few data-related remedies to address competition concerns. For example, the parties could be asked to divest their data; open up their networks, data, or platform infrastructure; or modify their algorithms. As such, we may see some data-related remedies in China down the road on mergers involving digital platforms.
 
Question 4: The impact of M&A transactions on innovation has attracted a lot of attention globally in recent years. How does China analyze and address innovation concerns in its merger reviews? 
From August 2008 to September 2021, Chinese merger review agencies approved 50 transactions with remedies. In 17 (or 34 percent) of these 50 transactions, SAMR expressed innovation concerns and imposed remedies accordingly. Out of these 17 transactions, nine were approved in the last five years.45 The following are a few observations regarding SAMR’s approach to addressing innovation concerns based on the publicly available decisions on these 17 transactions.
Broadly speaking, SAMR considers theories of harm related to innovation in both horizontal and vertical mergers. In horizontal mergers, the combined firm could have less incentive to innovate due to the elimination of an existing or potential competitor, resulting in reduced R&D, impediments to technological progress, or delays of the introduction of new products by the merging parties (“horizontal innovation concerns”). These horizontal innovation concerns are reflected in some recent decisions including Danaher/GE Biopharma (2020),46 Bayer/Monsanto (2018),47 and Dow/DuPont (2017).48 In vertical mergers where one of the merging parties was the owner of a key upstream input or patent, the combined firm could have the incentive to foreclose rival firms or block rivals’ innovation by refusing to license relevant technologies or degrading interoperability, among other ways (“vertical innovation concerns”). These vertical innovation concerns are reflected in the recent decisions including KLA/Orbotech (2019),49 Broadcom/Brocade (2017),50 and Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent (2015).51
Among intervention cases where Chinese agencies have specifically identified innovation harm, almost all have involved industries with the following characteristics: 1) high-tech products or services, 2) high market concentration, and 3) high entry barriers. High-tech sectors often require intensive R&D investment as firms compete to introduce innovative products and services to the market. In evaluating market concentration, Chinese agencies often raise innovation concerns when the parties’ combined market shares exceed 40 percent or when the merged entity’s post-transaction share ranks the highest in the relevant market. Lastly, when evaluating entry barriers, Chinese agencies often consider factors such as rivals’ technical strength, industry expertise, financial strength, R&D capacity, and IPR portfolio, as well as user switching costs.
Chinese agencies have utilized structural, behavioral, or a combination of both remedies to address potential innovation harm in transactions. In transactions with horizontal innovation concerns, remedies in China include divestiture (e.g. Bayer/Monsanto (2018)52), hold-separate (e.g. ASE/Siliconware (2017)53), or continuation of R&D operations (e.g. UTC/Rockwell Collins (2018)54). These structural and behavioral remedies aim to preserve the parties’ incentives to maintain pre-transaction innovation levels. For transactions with vertical innovation concerns, behavioral remedies include mandatory licensing of certain assets (e.g. Microsoft/Nokia (2014)55), maintenance of interoperability with rival technologies (e.g. Broadcom/Brocade (2017)56), and FRAND commitments (e.g. KLA/Orbotech (2019)57). These behavioral remedies aim to guarantee rival’s access to crucial upstream technologies for innovation and downstream manufacturing.

Draft EU rules to curb the power of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet unit Google, and Facebook should also tackle providers of cloud computing services for possible anti-competitive practices, a study claimed on Tuesday, October 27.
The report comes amid concerns that some EU lawmakers who are reviewing the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may be lenient towards cloud computing companies.
Amazon’s Amazon Web Services was the leading provider in the second quarter, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, market research company Statista found. Others include IBMCloud, Alibaba Cloud, Salesforce, and Oracle.
Frederic Jenny, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Competition Committee, put together the study, in his personal capacity, for trade body Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE).

The new EU rules should also cover software licensing, the report stated, with respondents citing unfair terms imposed by some of the big software companies to access their cloud infrastructure.
“The DMA does say that cloud infrastructure can come within the ambit of the DMA but it is not obvious that all the suppliers are covered,” Jenny told Reuters in an interview.

“Break ‘em up with antitrust” is a popular and surging political drumbeat. This essay argues for a closer look at history and experience. They show that breakups of integrated single firm monopolies (which were not the product of mergers) have been rare and difficult. The essay takes a special look at the breakup of Ma Bell — a restructuring that needed to happen — recalling that even this rare success took a decade after the trial to implement.

By Eleanor M. Fox & Donald I. Baker1
         
I. INTRODUCTION
“Antitrust” had been a low-profile technical discipline for decades. But then came the rise of Big Tech/Big Data platforms, an explosion of public fear that the platforms are taking over our lives and minds, political campaigns highlighting their alleged predations, and the emergence of a popular narrative that goes like this:
The Big Tech firms are pervasive, abusive and dangerous; enemies of the people. They subvert democracy and the economy. They misuse our data, they gobble up rising stars, they sabotage firms that compete on their platforms, they wall-in their gardens and dig moats around their castles. They spread disinformation and nurture divisiveness. They are too big and powerful. Antitrust is the tried and trusted tool. Break ‘em up.2
We write this essay to push back on the myth-telling and to cast a clear eye on what is the problem and what are the questions that should inform any restructuring s...

434,"October 25, 2021","If Breaking Up Is the Answer, Then What Is the Question?","
Antitrust and policy circles are abuzz with calls against the power, monopoly and other, held by large firms. If one is worried about a firm being too large, then the solution seems obvious: break up the firm and surely that will solve the problem. Any attempt to break up large firms is likely to face many practical and legal challenges. In this article I ask whether breakup is the correct answer, even if these challenges can be overcome.

By Aviv Nevo1
 
In many policy circles big tech companies, usually meant to refer to Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, are viewed as having too much power.2 Despite such concerns, consumers continue to shop on Amazon, search using Google, connect with their friends using Facebook and Instagram, and purchase Apple devices and services. Consumers’ continued support of these companies could be an indication that the products and services offered by big tech have benefited consumers and are superior to alternatives, or they could be an indication that consumers are locked into choices and effectively denied alternative options and the benefits of healthy competition.
Critics of big tech clearly think it is the latter and have proposed solving the problem by making big tech somewhat smaller. This involves limiting future acquisitions as well as potentially breaking up existing business units. For example, some have called for separating Amazon the retailer from Amazon the marketplace, to undo Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram...

The current debate about antitrust divestitures has focused on how combining business units under the same corporate umbrella can allow digital platforms to favor their own services over those provided by third parties. To the extent that these debates have framed the issues in economic terms, they have overlooked the enduring importance of Conway’s Law and the Mirroring Hypothesis, which assert that a firm’s organizational structure must reflect the underlying technology of its products. These principles suggest that enforcement officials should not mandate the structural separation of an existing firm without taking into account the task interdependencies that determine the natural modular structure of a platform industry. Proper analysis of any proposed divestiture will also require antitrust law to shed the reluctance to engage in detailed balancing of technical considerations reflected in its technological tying precedents.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the most prominent issues in the current debates about antitrust law is the extent to which combining business units under the same corporate umbrella can allow big tech firms to favor their own services over those provided by third parties. These concerns about vertical exclusion have led to calls to deploy one of the least frequently used and most powerful remedies available to antitrust enforcement officials and require these companies to divest some of their subsidiaries.

On Monday PayPal said that is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time. This comes after several media last week reported on its talks to buy the digital pinboard site for as much as $45 billion.
According to Reuters, the latest development is a blow for Pinterest, which is currently grappling with the twin challenges of losing its co-founder Evan Sharp and a slowdown in user growth that has hampered its future prospects.
Related: Payments Giant PayPal In Talks To Buy Pinterest For $35B
Aided by a boost in digital payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, PayPal’s shares had risen over 35% in the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $320 billion, prior to the reports on its talks with Pinterest.
“An acquisition of Pinterest would introduce significant integration risk, notably in terms of culture and execution as running a platform primarily focused on driving user engagement and advertising would require PayPal to use muscles it isn’t accustomed to using,” said Tien-tsin Huang, a payments analyst at JP Morgan, in a note to clients.
Per Reuters, the Pinterest deal would have been the biggest acquisition of a social media company at the reported price, far surpassing Microsoft Corp’s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.
It would have also allowed PayPal capture more e-commerce growth, as more shoppers increasingly buy items they see on social media, often following “influencers” on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and even Pinterest.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the interview with Joshua Wright, Professor of Law at George Mason University, recorded on September 24, 2021.
This interview was done as part of the Antitrust Brainstorming Board created by CPI with the support of the CCIA.
Thank you, Prof. Wright, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
A video of the complete interview is available HERE.
 
Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Joshua WRIGHT:
I think the current antitrust framework largely does work for competition and consumers. The historical arc of antitrust is such that the current framework, usually we think about that as being encompassed by the consumer welfare standard. We took 70, 80 years of trial and error and getting a lot of things wrong to get here. While there are some tweaks in the system, no system is perfect. I think the U.S. system that we’ve adopted over that 70 or 80 years, until we adopted the Consumer Welfare Standard in the late seventies to current, largely works well by deterring anti-competitive behavior while still allowing consumers to benefit from competition that improves their lives.

Do you believe the vertical merger guidelines need to be changed?
WRIGHT:
Well, they’re largely gone now, right? Recently, with the vertical mergers being withdrawn at least by one agency, no doubt some changes are coming. But I’m happy to talk about what I think both about the guidelines that the FTC r...

438,"October 4, 2021",Supreme Court Denies Oracle Appeal Over Pentagon Cloud Contract,"


The US Supreme Court on Monday put an end to Oracle’s challenge to how the Pentagon awarded the government’s now-canceled $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract.
The justices declined to hear Oracle’s appeal of a lower court ruling that found that the Austin, Texas-based business software maker was not harmed by any errors made by the Pentagon in awarding the contract because the company would not have qualified for it in the first place.
The US Defense Department awarded the sole-source cloud computing procurement contract to Microsoft in 2019, but scrapped that deal in July, announcing a new contract that is expected to include Amazon, which also had been excluded from the prior one.
Oracle wanted the justices to hear the appeal despite the fact that the JEDI contract had been canceled because it said the flaws in that contract could recur as the government screens bidders for a new one.
The now-canceled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile.
Oracle sued in 2018 to protest the structure of the procurement and certain Pentagon employees’ conflicts of interest involving Amazon, which ultimately lost the JEDI award to Microsoft.
The Washington-based US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals involving government contracts, ruled against Oracle last year, saying that the company would not have had a substantial chance of securing the contract.
Like Oracle, Amazon had filed suit protesting the JEDI sole-source deal, arguing that then-President Donald Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from Amazon.

439,"October 4, 2021",Antitrust Chronicle® – PROTECTIONISM & ANTITRUST,"
Dear Readers,
In this CPI issue, we address a pressing antitrust question of political nature – how should nations address political concerns, if at all, through antitrust policy. We first look at the position in the U.S. & EU and then turn to look at Asia. In doing so, our contributing authors ask certain pertinent questions, such as what is the legal framework governing the current U.K. merger control regime insofar as public interest considerations are concerned, including its important interface with EU law? What is the extent to which public interest considerations can be invoked under foreign investment control rules in the United Kingdom and a number of other jurisdictions? Whether there is, or should be, a role for national interest considerations in the review of corporate acquisitions by foreign purchasers? How does the how the current EU merger control framework accommodate both competition and non-competition considerations and reconcile them with EU law principles of freedom of establishment and free movement of capital? How can the EU system learn from the U.S. in addressing non-competition related public interests on investment within a merger control timetable.
In context of the Asian jurisdictions, the contributing authors ask several pertinent questions such as if the Chinese authorities appear to have wielded the law against more foreign multinationals than local companies (in back drop of the Microsoft, Diamler, and Audi rulings). Similar conc...

Billions of people use Google because it’s the best, not because of deals the company made to stay competitive, Google’s lawyer said on Friday, wrapping up a week of testimony as the US tech giant fights a record US$5 billion antitrust fine. 
The European Commission hit Google with a €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine in 2018 for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet searching from 2011.
At issue are deals requiring phone makers to pre-install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser app together with Google Play, as well deals blocking some variants of Android.

“The reason why billions of people choose Google as their search tool every day is not because of an abuse of dominance. It’s because it’s the best,” lawyer Meredith Pickford told the EU’s General Court, the bloc’s second highest.
Pickford said the deals were far from being anti-competitive tools, rather they were to ensure Google stayed competitive.
“You can still compete hard and compete on the merits. Consumers aren’t stupid. If Bing or another search engine were better than Google, people would turn to it,” he said, referring to a rival Microsoft  search engine.

Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Michael CARRIER:
Consumer welfare is today’s Rorschach Test in antitrust law. Those who think that antitrust is going well, tend to like the consumer welfare approach. Those who sometimes have problems with how antitrust is being applied, have problems with the consumer welfare approach. But I think there is room for a third option, and that option is that antitrust is not working well for consumers today, but the consumer welfare test is not the reason why. Consumer welfare offers all sorts of benefits. Now, to be sure it’s not the clearest test in the world to apply. It’s been interpreted in different ways since it was introduced in the last century, but consumer welfare is helpful for putting the focus on economics, for putting the focus on what is good for consumers, and so there’s a lot to be said for the approach.
Now, the approach has not worked well, but that I’d say is a problem that as Doug Malamed and Nicolas Petit have said is more practical than conceptua...

Dear Readers,
This edition focuses on different issues and facets of the Chinese competition regime. Recently, the Chinese competition authorities have, under the Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”), imposed fines on several multinationals such as Qualcomm, Microsoft, and BMW. This has brought considerable attention to Chinese competition processes and structures.
The contributing authors in this edition look at different themes relating to the Chinese competition regime. One surveys the Chinese competition landscape, while another assesses the recent merger control rules and their efficacy, examines the process of conducting investigations d under the AML, looks at how AML incorporates elements of transparency, due process review and accountability & how it compares to its western counterparts. Yet another examines a recent judgment of the Chinese Supreme Court that may have far-reaching impact on the analysis involved in abuse of dominance cases, going forward and contrasts it with the position on the issue in Korea.
As always, thank you to our great panel of authors.
Sincerely,
CPI Team

443,"September 27, 2021",Competing for Free,"
A feature of many digital platforms is that they offer services to one side of the platform “for free.” In some instances, the business model requires the consumer to trade their data and attention in return for “free” services. We consider how providing consumers with a service that is ‘free’ can provide consumer benefits but also make it harder for potential rivals to contest that market, since it can be very difficult to undercut an incumbent selling goods for “free.” Price reductions below zero are sometimes possible, as shown by cashback and bundled offers, but can be more challenging when the payment is in data or attention. In addition, any move away from free, up or down, may require a significant additional transaction cost, which can be a significant barrier to consumer switching in certain situations.

By Dr. Helen Jenkins, Dave Jevons & Dr. Andrew Mell1

I. INTRODUCTION
Consumers have been offered a variety of services “for free” for a long time, however the rise of digital technologies which exhibit high fixed costs and low variable costs has increased the prevalence of “free” services, including free internet search; free email; free social networking; free microblogging; and free entertainment. Of course, in economic terms, a free lunch is very rare, and consumers are typically paying for these services through a form of barter with their attention and their data.2 This is not a new phenomenon: historically consumers have recei...

444,"September 27, 2021",Free as Air?,"
“Free” once had a simple meaning – something without constraint whatsoever, as in “free as air.” At times, some have suggested that antitrust enforcement should not target “free” services – but “free” is Protean in meaning. After all, “there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” “No-monetary-payment” is not the same thing as “free.” Making someone else pay is not “free.” Finally, receiving something in exchange for the alteration of one’s mind is not “free.” Firms, products and markets have changed; so too, must competition law. Recent cases against firms that provide users applications without monetary payment, such as Google and Facebook, suggest that competition law enforcers increasingly understand that “free” cannot be a get-out-of-antitrust enforcement card. These cases bear watching to gauge whether and how competition law can evolve as firms, products, and markets have done.

US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff presented data on Wednesday, September 15, on small acquisitions by five big technology companies, and the agency scrapped guidelines on vertical mergers which combine a company with a supplier, reported Reuters.
Following a study begun during the Trump administration, the FTC staff found that Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft together had 616 acquisitions from 2010 to 2019 that were above US$1 million but too small to be reported to antitrust agencies, among other findings.
Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, said looking at deals individually was inadequate. “I think of serial acquisitions as a Pac-Man strategy. Each individual merger viewed independently may not seem to have significant impact. But the collective impact of hundreds of smaller acquisitions, can lead to monopolistic behavior,” she said.
Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, called for a similar study on health care mergers.

The FTC sued Facebook last year, alleging the social media company broke antitrust law. It has asked a judge to undo Facebook’s deals for photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp although both were reviewed by the agency.
The FTC, which began holding open meetings after progressive Lina Khan became chair in June, also voted to withdraw Trump-era guidelines regarding vertical deals. Republicans Wilson and Noah Phillips opposed the decision.

446,"September 14, 2021",Antitrust Chronicle® – Bundling & Tying,"
Dear Readers,
Bundling and tying are classic antitrust abuses. Leveraging market power to force customers of “Product A” to purchase “Product B” is an archetypal competition law infringement.
Like most antitrust abuses, tying can take many forms. Aside from the standard paradigm of forcing a customer to purchase a product additional to the one in which the incumbent possesses market power, there can be more nuanced scenarios.
For example, questions have recently arisen as to whether “tying” analysis applies where a monopolist forces customers to purchase multiple units of the same product.
Further, there is the even more nuanced scenario of software bundling. The Microsoft cases of the 1990s (concerning the bundling of browsers and media players with a dominant operating system) have of late given way to cases involving tightly integrated software bundles sold by mobile “platform” providers, and the integration of specialized types of search results within online search platforms.
The above issues, concerning digital markets, also relate to the debate concerning the so-called “free” nature of various online products and services, and the question of how tying analysis can even apply in such a context.
In short, while “tying” and “bundling” are not new concepts, their application to new market contexts gives rise to no shortage of profound legal and economic questions that continue to shed light on their underlying basis. The cont...

447,"September 14, 2021",Sell/Buy Bundling,"
This note examines bundling where a firm sells content or a service and, in the process, buys the customer’s attention or data. For example, Google bundles search with ads. This kind of sell/buy bundle is prevalent in the digital economy. We develop a framework to address the question: When will the firm require customers to take a sell/buy bundle rather than allow them to buy the content without selling their attention? Under our assumptions, if the average customer’s value of content is large relative to the value of the ad and customer attention costs are relatively low, the profit-maximizing strategy for the firm is to price so that all customers take the bundle. We end by considering other reasons for sell/buy bundling that fall outside our economic model.

By Adam Brandenburger & Barry Nalebuff1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Newspapers and online platforms provide content to readers, and, in return, readers give their attention to advertisements. Sometimes, as in the case of newspapers, there is a net positive price charged to readers for the two transactions. Other times, as with Facebook or Google, the net price is zero.
The case of customers giving up data is similar. The firm provides content or a service and, in return, the customer provides personal data. In this note, we focus on bundles where the customer is selling their attention, but the results do not depend on the label we attach to what the customer is providing.
The sale of content supported by ads is a f...

448,"September 14, 2021",Tying of “Free Goods” in Digital Platform Markets,"
As dominant platforms offer related services and expand into adjacent markets, there are serious concerns for anticompetitive tying that may serve to extend their market power to other markets. In this article, I review recent theoretical developments in the leverage theory of tying in relation to digital platform markets where goods are often provided for “free.” With zero pricing, the monopolist of the primary good may be unable to appropriate a rival firm’s efficiencies through the pricing of the primary product and therefore have an incentive to resort to tying to foreclose the rival firm and expropriate any rents associated in the tied product market. I also briefly discuss practical issues that may pose challenges in putting theory into practice. In particular, given potential precompetitive and efficiency-enhancing effects of tying, a rule of reason approach that carefully balances pro- vs. anticompetitive effects would be advisable.

449,"September 14, 2021",Bundling Identical Products: An Economic Analysis,"
This article considers whether or not the bundling of two identical products is usefully treated as a tying arrangement. Following Prof. Williams’ article in this issue, I discuss three tying cases in which the defendants bundled two products that were arguably identical. Of the three, I focus on the EpiPen case. Bundling two identical products might appear to be a tying arrangement because the purchase of one product in the bundle is conditioned on the purchase of a second product, identical to the first. Notwithstanding this, I conclude that the bundling of two identical products is not usefully analyzed by tying analysis. Doing so adds no useful incremental economic insight as to the anti-competitive effects, if any, of this type of bundling arrangement.

By David S. Sibley1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Elsewhere in this issue, Professor Melanie Williams discusses the fact that there have been tying claims that have centered on the bundling of two products that are, arguably, identical. Judicial reactions to such claims have been inconsistent. In Paul v. Pulitzer and Metromedia v. MGM/UA, courts ruled that the products in question were identical and bundling them was not an illegal tie.
In EpiPen, however, the court was open to a different view2 in a motion to dismiss. EpiPen is a class action case filed against Mylan, the exclusive distributor of the EpiPen, the most widely used Epinephrine auto-injector device (“EAI”). Although EpiPens had been sold one at a time since ...

The Department of Justice (DOJ) will not shy away from enforcing antitrust laws against so-called “killer acquisitions,” where dominant firms buy start-ups before they can become competitive threats, according to a top Department official, reported CNBC.
Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who oversees the agency’s Antitrust Division, spoke at the Georgetown Law Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium Tuesday, September 14. There, she said acquisitions of nascent competitors “are one category of particularly concerning transactions because they undermine competition that can disrupt monopolies.”
President Biden’s leadership choices have already indicated a tough approach on alleged monopolies and illegal acquisitions. But this speech marks one of the first times Biden’s DOJ has publicly outlined its stance on antitrust enforcement.
Gupta pointed to the department’s case against Visa’s proposed acquisition of payments company Plaid as an example of the government’s work to halt transactions with nascent competitors. The two companies ultimately abandoned the merger after the government sought to block it.
“The department will not shy away from similar challenges in the future,” Gupta said, adding that the department should remain “careful not to discourage investment in new start-ups. But we should also remember that startups cannot thrive without a competitive economy.”
Gupta also called the Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google “a major priority.” In addition, she said she welcomes lawmakers’ efforts to provide new tools to enforcers to go after illegal monopolies and transactions.
“The bottom line is that we will not stand by and watch dominant digital platforms thwart competition,” Gupta said.
“Digital markets may involve new technologies, but the tactics of these digital platforms are nothing new. Buying would-be rivals. Boxing out firms who won’t be bought. Leveraging a monopoly position in one market to grow a position in another. The Department of Justice has dealt with these tactics from the likes of Standard Oil and Microsoft. We will do so again whenever the facts and the law demand action to protect the economy, no matter how powerful the violator.”
Biden nominated tech critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission, and his nominee to lead the Antitrust Division, Jonathan Kanter, was a favorite among progressives seeking greater enforcement of antitrust laws. Kanter still awaits Senate confirmation, but he would report to Gupta if confirmed.

Daniel CRANE:
Framework of course could mean a number of different things. If we mean the consumer welfare standard in particular, which is what lots of people mean by framework. To the extent that what antitrust policy is focused on is preventing acts that harm the competitive functioning of the market, then I think that’s actually the right framework. If the question is how has that standard been applied in fact, I think we could do a better job in some areas, particularly in horizontal mergers, which I know we’ll talk about. Then if by framework we’re including institutional arrangements, which is something I’ve long been interested in, then I think we could also do better in a number of ways. I think for example the federal agencies need more funding to do more work. I would prefer to see more public enforcement funded by Congress and less reliance on private enforcement, which I think often does not particularly serve the consumer or the...

I just think generally we need to be more aggressive in enforcing the current antitrust laws. I would say mostly in the area of looking at what we call vertical issues, lots of activities, both through mergers and non merger activities involve working with related markets, complimentary products and so on, and a lot of, not all of those activities, but in some cases, those activities can generate anti-competitive outcomes. I don’t think we’re aggressive enough in that area. The vertical merger guidelines that were revised over a year ago, move us to some extent in that direction, but I don’t think they’re aggressive enough.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will hold its next open meeting on September 15 to hear staff findings on deals that Big Tech firms like Facebook and Apple make which are sometimes too small to spark antitrust scrutiny, the agency said on Wednesday.
The agency began holding open meetings after Chair Lina Khan was sworn in June. Next week, the five commissioners will also consider whether to scrap guidelines put in place during the Trump administration regarding deals that combine a company with one of its suppliers.
The staff report will include Big Tech acquisitions from 2010 to 2019, some of which were not reported to antitrust enforcers because of their small size.
The Big Tech firms, which also include Alphabet’s Google and Amazon, have been under antitrust scrutiny for more than two years. The FTC has sued Facebook while the Justice Department sued Google. Others remain under investigation.
The agency had sent demands for information to five big tech firms, including Microsoft, in February 2020, stating that it wanted to probe whether any of the smaller deals resulted in harm to competition.
The three Democrats and two Republicans on the Commission will also vote on whether to issue a policy statement on privacy breaches by health apps and a process for accepting input on potential rules.

Which is to prohibit anti-competitive conduct that harms competition and thereby harms consumers and suppliers. The implementation of that conceptual framework, however, I think needs improvement because over time I think it has become too difficult for plaintiffs to prevail for two reasons, I think.
First, antitrust doctrine has been informed by an excessive trust in markets and an excessive distrust, I think, in governments. And that has manifest itself in a series of specific doctrines that are intended to reduce the risk of false positives, even at the expense of false negatives. And I think that’s going too far.

If by the current framework, we mean a system that’s based on economic analysis, empirics, really taking very case-specific information and essentially processing it in a way that judges can understand and rule on with the singular goal, that works. In that system, do we have areas that need to change? Always. Are there some areas where we should be pushing to make sure we have greater enforcement? Of course, but this has been long-standing in antitrust and for generations courts have accepted that antitrust works very much like common law, that over time you shift the analysis and you do so in a way that makes sense, but to make sure that we all understand how this has been very much a broad non-ideological way of looking at it, probably the best formulation of what antitrust does well and frankly, development of the rule of reason was done more than any other justice by John Paul Stevens.

Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and other Republican senators have proposed consolidating federal antitrust enforcement under the Department of Justice. While the stated justification for the proposal is enforcement efficiency, the more likely goal is to foreclose competition to the consumer welfare standard in federal antitrust policymaking. The recent appointment of Lina Khan to the FTC Chair position and President Biden’s July 9th Executive Order on Competition indicate that Neo-Brandeisian (“NB”) antitrust ideas are emerging as a competitive threat to the consumer welfare perspective, and Senator Lee’s proposals appear targeted at ending the threat before it gains a foothold in the antitrust marketplace of ideas. Because the current competition between consumer welfare and NB antitrust is beneficial to antitrust policy and American markets, Congress should reject these proposals.

Antitrust policy is entering a renaissance of new (and old) ideas that encourage more aggressive enforcement and shifts in legal standards that would remove obstacles for successful enforcement actions. The field is benefitting from robust debates and diverse perspectives, which are gaining audiences with practitioners, government enforcers, Congress, the courts, and most recently, the President of the United States. But not everyone is supportive of the debate and the prospect of reform. Recently, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), reintroduced his “One Agency Act” in the Sen...

459,"August 30, 2021",CPI Talks… With Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson,"
In this edition of CPI Talks we have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Doug Peterson, the 33rd and current Attorney General of the State of Nebraska.
Thank you, Mr. Peterson, for taking this time to talk to CPI.

1. Antitrust enforcement involves, by necessity, coordination between federal and State agencies. What, in your view, should be the approach to interagency cooperation in a contemporary context? How can States and Federal agencies better coordinate in the 21st Century?
Coordination between federal and state agencies is critical to ensure that we efficiently deploy our limited resources. Traditionally, there was an approach, particularly in smaller states, in which states followed the lead of our federal counterparts. There was very little appetite to independently investigate and litigate large antitrust cases — with a few notable exceptions, like Microsoft. That trend has been changing with recent actions against some large technology companies.
There is no single, ideal model of interagency cooperation. State enforcers, much like our federal counterparts, have a limited set of resources to tackle competition issues. As a result, our model for cooperation will depend upon how specific investigations or cases relate to state priorities.
Interagency cooperation can be broadly captured in two categories. There is the historical model of cooperation in which state enforcers join investigations and cases managed by federal enforcers. In this model, state enfor...

460,"August 29, 2021",Report: Google To Pay Apple $15B To Remain Default In Safari,"


Google could pay close to US$15 billion to Apple this year in order to retain its dominant search position on Apple products.
That report comes from the website Android Central, citing a new research note from Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. The US$15 billion figure comes from Apple’s public filings and analysis of Google’s traffic acquisition costs payments.
As reported here last year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in an antitrust suit that Google had paid Apple between US$8 billion and US$12 billion to hold the default search status on iPhones and other Apple devices.
The DOJ pointed to the deal to make its case of how Google uses its profits to sideline its rivals, and to show just how much search is worth.
According to Android Central, Sacconaghi suspects Google could pay more this year to prevent Microsoft from outbidding it. At the same time, the tech giant could revisit its strategy soon and try to renegotiate with Apple, as the payments could balloon to US$20 billion next year.
The report notes that there’s also a risk that regulators could block similar deals between Apple and Google, a move that could lead to a 4% to 5% impact on Apple’s gross profits. Apple has stated it supports Google because it is the most popular search engine, but notes users can easily change to different alternatives.

The US government on Wednesday said it would work with industry to hammer out new guidelines to improve the security of the technology supply chain, as President Joe Biden appealed to private sector executives to “raise the bar on cybersecurity.”
At White House meetings with Biden and members of his Cabinet, executives from Big Tech, the finance industry and infrastructure companies said they would do more about the growing threat of cyber attacks to the US economy, reported Reuters. 
“The federal government can’t meet this challenge alone,” Biden told the masked executives in the East Room, telling them, “You have the power, the capacity and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.”
After the meeting, the White House said the National Institute of Standards and Technology  would work with industry and other partners on new guidelines for building secure technology and assessing the security of technology, including open source software.
Microsoft, Google, Travelers, and Coalition, a cyber insurance provider, among others, committed to participating in the new NIST-led initiative.
Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the agenda for the Biden administration after a series of high-profile attacks on network management company SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N), the Colonial Pipeline company, meat processing company JBS and software firm Kaseya. The attacks hurt the United States far beyond just the companies hacked, affecting fuel and food supplies. read more
“We have a lot of work to do,” Biden said, citing both ransomware attacks and his push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold Russian-based cyber gangs responsible, and the need to fill nearly half a million public and private cybersecurity jobs.
The guest list included Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google’s parent Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai and IBM, Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.
After the meeting, Amazon said it would make its cybersecurity training available to the public for free, and it would give multi-factor authentication devices to some cloud computing customers, starting in October.

463,"August 25, 2021","The Relevant Antitrust Market in Digital Environments: Brazil, the EU, and the U.S.","

By Magali Eben* & Viktoria H.S.E. Robertson**
 I. Introduction
Digital markets, be it social media, online search or e-commerce, are becoming increasingly global. Although some regional and local players exist as well, it is striking how competition authorities around the globe are being confronted with similar or even identical antitrust questions concerning the same digital platforms – frequently the GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft). As one of the first steps in virtually every antitrust investigation, the delineation of a relevant antitrust market is particularly crucial, and this is also true in digital markets. In a recent working paper we discuss the application of market definition to digital markets from a comparative perspective, spanning Brazil, the European Union, and the United States.
 
II. Market Definition as the Basis of Competition Law: A Short Primer
Market definition is a core concept of competition law in Brazil, the European Union, and the United States. In all three jurisdictions, the main parameters of market definition are strikingly similar and market definition is understood to have both a quantitative and a qualitative side to it. In particular, antitrust authorities in all three jurisdictions have issued soft law guidance on delineating a relevant antitrust market – testament to the ongoing convergence on this important aspect of competition law.
Brazil
Market definition is a central feature of Brazilian competition law that is explicitly referenced in Article 36 of the Competition Act. That provision prohibits anti-competitive agreements and anti-competitive single firm conduct. As one possible infringement, the provision lists the control of a relevant product market. In addition, Article 36(3) of the Act defines what constitutes a dominant position, which is determined as a 20% share of the relevant market or more. Regular references to the relevant market concept under Brazilian law may partly be due to the fact that the current Competition Act dates from 2011 and is thus relatively young. Brazilian antitrust authority CADE (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica or Administrative Council for Economic Defense) has issued a number of soft law instruments that are directly relevant to market definition, such as its 1999 Resolution or its Horizontal Merger Guidelines of 2016. These Guidelines acknowledge alternative options for analyzing mergers that do not exclusively focus on market definition – for instance where multi-sided markets are concerned.
European Union
Under EU competition law, market definition is relied upon under Article 101 TFEU (anti-competitive agreements), Article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position), and merger control (Regulation 139/2004). In addition, the binding block exemption regulations issued by the European Commission (e.g., Vertical BER, R&D BER) and many soft law instruments (e.g., De Minimis Notice, Effect on Trade Notice) rely on market share thresholds that require the prior delineation of a relevant market. In its Market Definition Notice, the European Commission sets out how it intends to delineate a relevant antitrust market in its product and geographic dimensions. The delineation exercise is based on demand-side and supply-side interchangeability, something that also has the backing of the General Court and the Court of Justice. The Market Definition Notice operationalizes this interchangeability test through the SSNIP test (small but significant non-transitory increase in prices). The Commission is currently reviewing its Market Definition Notice against the background of digital markets, as it strives to better depict these for antitrust purposes.
United States
U.S. antitrust law relies on market definition under § 1 of the Sherman Act (anti-competitive agreements), § 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization and attempted monopolization) and § 7 of the Clayton Act (merger control). The relevant product market includes all products that are functionally interchangeable with each other, based on demand-side and supply-side substitutability. In their joint Horizontal Merger Guidelines of 2010, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission set out the hypothetical monopolist test that is nearly identical to the SSNIP test. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines attempt to de-emphasize the importance of market definition for merger control, stating that a merger review need not start with market definition. So far, however, the U.S. courts have not followed this view.
 
III. Market Definition for Digital Markets: The Decisional Practice of Brazil, the EU, and U.S.
Zero-price Services
Many digital services are offered for “free,” at least in the sense that users don’t have to hand over any money. Facebook doesn’t ask you for your bank details before you can see what your uncle has had for dinner, Google doesn’t require you to swipe your credit card in order to search for a restaurant for your date tonight, and Twitter doesn’t ask you to do a bank transfer every time you want to share a 280-character brilliant idea. These companies are not charities, but often generate revenue through multi-sided strategies: the users of the social network or the search engine may not be handing over cash, but they are paying attention to advertising or generating information for data-analytical products. The lack of a monetary exchange between users of these services and the undertakings offering them initially had far-reaching consequences for market definition. “Free” was a concept with an almost magical effect: it not only induced consumers to increased appreciation of a product (the so-called “zero-price effect”), but prompted competition authorities to believe that the undertakings could not be subjected to the provisions of competition law. The lack of price for certain (digital) services baffled authorities and courts, who initially showed a reluctance to intervene in the activities of the undertakings who supplied them, struggling to identify the “trade” relationship between the company and the users of its free service. A U.S. district court even went so far as to declare there was no market for search (Kinderstart v. Google). Luckily, this approach did not last. Competition authorities in all three jurisdictions now acknowledge that these companies do engage in economic activities – thus requiring the definition of a market. Such acknowledgement is evident from statements in both the European Commission and CADE’s Google decisions (Google Search (Shopping), Google Android, E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil).
Acknowledging the possibility of a market was evidently an important step, but there is still an important practical challenge to overcome: how to perform substitution analysis in the absence of monetary price. In all three jurisdictions, there have been attempts to adapt the SSNIP test. A U.S. court raised the possibility of imagining a price by considering whether consumers would switch if even “the most nominal of fees were charged” (Streamcast), but this is inappropriate since going from no price to any price at all would fundamentally change the way the consumer sees the product. Instead, real costs and consideration ought to be integrated in a revised quantitative test, such as the attention or data costs incurred by the users, or even the costs the other side incurs in the case of a two-sided platform (a possibility raised by FTC Staff in the U.S. (In the Matter of Google Inc.). The decisional practice on this remains sparse. Instead, quantitative tests are considered which focus on quality rather than price or costs, which is an option both the European Commission and CADE seem increasingly willing to explore. Quality-based substitution assessments have been mentioned in multiple cases (Facebook/WhatsApp, Microsoft/LinkedIn, Google Search (Shopping), E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil). The European Commission explicitly referred to a SSNDQ test (small but significant non-transitory decrease in quality) in Google Android, although there is still some lack of clarity on the correct parameters for such tests. The smaller number of investigations in the U.S. to date mean the willingness of U.S. antitrust authorities to adopt revised quantitative tests is not yet clear.
Where reimagined “SSNIP” tests are unavailable, authorities are likely to return to the more traditional qualitative approach. In the Google cases (Google Search (Shopping), E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil), the European Commission and CADE both considered the characteristics and functionalities of the services in their substitution analysis. The differentiation in the services involved may make it difficult to identify the most pertinent characteristics and functionalities, however, so that there is some contention on where to draw the line between different products and their substitutes. On the whole, it is clear that headway is being made. As more cases are brought in the EU, Brazil, and now the U.S., the variety of quantitative and qualitative tests which now exist will likely be further developed and perfected.
Multi-sided Platforms
The challenge of zero-price services often arises in the context of multi-sided platforms. A multi-sided platform caters to distinct groups of customers, who are brought together on the platform in a way which internalizes the indirect network effects between them. The number of markets to define when a platform has more than one side is probably the most common question in digital market definition. The existence of two or more distinct customer groups raises the query whether the platform operates on multiple markets (one for each “side”) or on a single platform market, and in any case whether and how to incorporate the relationship between the different groups. Considerable strides have been made in decisional practice, taking steps towards but not quite achieving a definite approach to market definition for digital, multi-sided, platforms.
The literature made a distinction between “transaction” and “non-transaction” platforms, which has inspired the decisional practice on multi-sided platforms both inside and outside digital markets. In transaction platforms, there is an observable transaction, a one-to-one interaction, between different sides of the platform. This is not present on a non-transaction platform, where interaction does not occur as a one-to-one transaction. Most of the decisions involving multi-sided market definition have concerned not digital services but payment cards, which are generally considered to be “transaction” platforms. The American Express judgment in the U.S. has by now become rather famous in antitrust circles, for the relatively simple but contentious answer given to market definition. This Supreme Court judgment came after a string of discussions on market definition in the lower courts. While the District Court had defined multiple but related levels (issuance, acquirer services, and the network level), the Second Circuit had contended that both sides (issuance for cardholders and acquiring for merchants) needed to be “collapsed” into a single market. The Supreme Court agreed with the Second Circuit, emphasizing the existence of a transaction product jointly consumed by both sides. Though this single-market-approach did not attract unanimous consensus, it fitted neatly into the transaction/non-transaction distinction whose simplicity renders it so appealing.
This decisional practice may inspire market definition for digital platforms, but only to the extent that digital services fit neatly in the transaction/non-transaction distinction. Moreover, the distinction may overlook the more nuanced approach which is present in the EU, and in Brazil in particular. The EU and Brazil have had their fair share of payment card cases, long before American Express. These decisions are characterized by more complexity, both in the business models under investigation and in the markets defined. Although the idea of a “joint” transaction product was not dismissed out-of-hand by the European Commission, the Commission was not convinced of its existence on the facts (MasterCard). The EU approach can be summarized as a recognition of the relevance of multi-sidedness to the economic analysis, and a willingness to define both markets for the whole platform as well as multiple one-sided markets where this is useful for the analysis (Cartes bancaires, Budapest Bank). Such a multi-layered approach also exists in Brazil, where CADE’s practice is noteworthy for its definition, in the same case, of both markets for a distinct side and a single market for the whole payment system, focusing its analysis on the relevant market most suited to its assessment (Visa-Visanet, Itaú/Credicard, Elo).
There have been cases specific to digital services in all three jurisdictions, with actual decisions being rendered in the EU and Brazil. The FTC investigated Google, but decided to close the investigation. Although there was no ultimate decision, the Staff and Economist Memoranda did give some insight into the market definition contemplated, namely the definition of three distinct but “interdependent” markets corresponding to the different sides of the Google search platform. A multiple markets-approach was also adopted by the EU in cases involving Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google (Facebook/WhatsApp, Microsoft/LinkedIn, Google Search (Shopping)). The rationale for defining distinct markets for each side was never fully set out, though the Google Search (Shopping) decision did describe the existence of the distinct sides on one platform an advantageous “strategy” by the company, which could be interpreted as an acknowledgement that the multi-sidedness is a commercial choice rather than that there is a joint product for which the participation of both sides is indispensable. In Brazil, CADE’s own Google investigation included reflections by Commissioners and the Department for Economic Studies on the transaction/non-transaction distinction. They seemed to more plainly consider the non-essential nature of the presence of both sides, and thus there was no joint product. Yet even in this case there was no definite statement that several markets had to be defined because Google’s search platform was a non-transaction market, let alone an overarching determination that the transaction/non-transaction distinction is conclusive in multi-sided market definitions. To truly come up with a framework for multi-sided market definition in digital markets, we will likely have to wait for more cases, preferably some involving a digital transaction platform, so that a comparison is possible between the decisional approach to digital non-transaction and digital transaction platforms.
Digital Ecosystems
Digital ecosystems, as the overarching building blocks of multi-sided digital platforms, are increasingly becoming a market force to reckon with and are also increasingly being looked at from the perspective of competition law and competition economics. They typically consist of an ecosystem orchestrator that brings together multiple actors and multiple products while maintaining maximum interoperability within the ecosystem. While the experience antitrust enforcers have gathered when taking zero-price services and multi-sided markets into account will be helpful in developing a useful approach to digital ecosystems, these types of commercial structures may also benefit from insights into cluster markets and aftermarkets.
As the European Commission’s Special Advisers’ Report on “Competition policy for the digital era” observed, companies are “draw[ing] consumers into more or less comprehensive ecosystems” which may need to be analyzed separately and/or alongside markets for specific products. Indeed, many digital platforms attract consumers because they offer multiple products in the same place: the convenience of a smartphone, a mobile operating system, a search app, an email service, a browser, a streaming service and a cloud service all in one place. The products that can be found in a digital ecosystem – such as online search, a mobile smart operating system, an app store, a photo storage software, a phone book, a browser, a messaging service, a document storage service, etc. – may often be complementary, but sometimes it is only the underlying technology or business model that links these digital services. Also, while the examples above relate to the software dimension of digital ecosystems, a digital ecosystem usually encompasses both hardware and software.
When defining cluster markets – such as in banking or in supermarkets – antitrust courts and authorities grouped together products that customers would usually expect from the same provider, even though the products themselves were not interchangeable (and not all clusters were made up of exactly the same products). In the U.S., cases included Philadelphia National Bank (commercial banking) or Grinnell (alarm systems); in the EU, they included Lombard Club and Carrefour; in Brazil, they included Banco Santander and Banco Nossa Caixa. Importantly, the cluster’s economic significance goes beyond the individual products or services that it groups together (United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust) – just like in digital ecosystems. However, digital ecosystems appear to go even beyond what the cluster market concept attempted to capture, through the focus on interoperability within the ecosystem and the capturing of customers that occurs thanks to this.
For digital ecosystems, it can be helpful to think of multiple layers of competition: at the ecosystem level, at the platform level, and on individual market sides. To understand these layers, market definition for aftermarkets can be a useful analogy: The question then centres on whether or not there is competition at the superior market level (for instance, see Eastman Kodak in the U.S. or EFIM in the EU). If one finds that there is no competition at the superior level, then customers at the inferior level may experience capture and lock-in despite the (seeming) possibility of competition – and thus the appearance of a broader market.
While the case law has already started to explore an appropriate methodology for taking zero-price services into account and for delineating multi-sided platforms, this area will require further antitrust attention in the near future – and can benefit from a cross-jurisdictional analysis of evolving issues.
 
IV. Conclusions
While market definition will remain a central tool for competition law, it can – and must – be adapted to the specific characteristics present in digital markets, as cases before antitrust authorities and courts in all three jurisdictions have already shown. Nevertheless, there still is considerable scope for more convergence on these questions. As these issues frequently are of a global nature, a global response in the shape of a more harmonized approach to market definition in digital markets is desirable. In this endeavor, it is crucial to embark on joint enforcement actions (wherever possible) and collaborative research in order to carve out possibilities for such convergence.

465,"August 22, 2021",The ACCC’s Continued Digital Inquiry: App Stores and Choice Screens,"

By Jacqueline Downes, Felicity McMahon, William Georgiou & Melissa Camp1
 
I. Introduction
This piece builds on our previous article2 covering the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (“ACCC”) examination of developments in digital platforms through its ongoing Digital Platforms Services Inquiry 2020-2025 (“DPSI”).3 The DPSI follows the ACCC’s original Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (“DPI Final Report”), released in July 2019.4 Under the terms of reference for the DPSI, the ACCC must provide the Treasurer with an interim report on the inquiry every six months until the inquiry concludes. A final report will be provided to the Treasurer by 31 March 2025.5 The services which the ACCC may hold inquiries in relation to include digital platform services, as well as digital advertising services and data services provided by digital platform service providers.6 The terms of reference define digital platform services as search engines, social media, online private messaging services, digital content aggregation platforms, media referral services, and electronic marketplaces.7
Our previous work considered the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its second DPSI interim report covering app stores (“App Stores Issues Paper”),8 relevant international antitrust cases, and the public submissions received in response to the App Store Issues Paper.
This article summarizes the key findings ultimately released by the ACCC in its second DPSI interim report on app stores (“App Stores Report”). It also considers the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its third DPSI interim report covering choice screens in search services and default browsers (“Choice Screen Issues Paper”)9 and the public submissions received so far in response to this issues paper.
The ACCC has also released the issues paper for its fourth DPSI interim report (to be released in 2022).10 As part of this issues paper the ACCC will examine competition and consumer law issues in online marketplaces that operate across product categories (e.g. eBay, Amazon, Catch, etc.).11 Competition issues the ACCC will investigate as part of this report include: what the most significant online marketplaces in Australia are, whether any of them are “must-haves” for third-party sellers, barriers to entry and expansion for online marketplaces, the extent that online marketplaces compete with third-party sellers supplying direct, and third-party seller multi-homing across marketplaces.12
The focus of the ACCC’s App Stores Report (released April 28, 2021) was on the distribution of mobile apps to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. The ACCC focused on the two key distribution channels for such apps (i.e. “app stores”) in Australia: Apple’s “App Store” for mobile devices running Apple’s operating system, “iOS”; and, Google’s “Play Store” for mobile devices running Google’s operating system, “Android.”
The ACCC’s decision to focus on these app stores for its second DPSI report is no doubt related to the growing international attention they have received, particularly as a result of proceedings brought by Epic Games against Apple and Google in the United States13 and the European Commission’s investigation of complaints against Apple from a number of complainants, including Spotify, an unidentified e-book distributor, and an unidentified audiobook distributor.14
The concerns expressed by app developers like Epic Games and Spotify in these disputes and regulatory investigations, and those expressed by app developers in submissions responding to the ACCC’s App Store Issues Paper relate to a variety of issues. A key concern is Apple and Google’s requirements that apps offering “digital goods and services” use only Apple or Google’s respective in-app purchase (“IAP”) systems and pay a 30 percent commission on every transaction. This article will focus on this concern.
 A. The ACCC’s Findings 
The ACCC made a number of important findings which appeared broadly consistent with concerns expressed by stakeholders.
   
Competition Assessment and Market Power
While the ACCC did not formally define the markets in which the App Store and Play Store participate, it concluded that Apple and Google each have “significant market power” in the supply of mobile operating systems and mobile app distribution in Australia.15 Interestingly, the ACCC did not use the phrase “substantial market power” in its findings, which is a threshold requirement for establishing whether a company has contravened Australia’s prohibition on misuses of market power.16 It is unclear why the ACCC avoided engaging the language of the statutory prohibition in its findings here, though it may be that the ACCC is exercising caution and not revealing its hand too soon.
The ACCC also considered that the two app stores were “effectively isolated” from competition.17 While the App Store and Play Store place some constraint on each other, the ACCC found that this constraint is limited, for example, by high user switching costs, the tendency of users to single-home, and because both app stores are “must haves” for app developers.18 The ACCC also recognized that there were no alternatives to the App Store for iOS devices and it did not consider alternative Android app stores as significant constraints on the Play Store (particularly given the Play Store’s pre-installation on Android devices).19
   
Terms and Conditions of Access to the App Stores
The ACCC found that Apple and Google were “gatekeepers” for their respective app stores, and as such they have the power to set, amend and enforce their app store terms and conditions on a “take it or leave it” basis.20 The ACCC considered that while some of these terms seek to promote and maintain the quality and safety of apps, there are also issues with their implementation.21 In particular, the ACCC noted that businesses whose products or services are not clearly defined within the terms set by digital platforms face risks and uncertainties which may lead to inefficient investment decisions and unduly restrict or prevent the emergence of alternative business models.22
The ACCC noted that the need to protect users and the stability, performance and integrity of Apple and Google’s respective operating systems did not negate the need for fair and reasonable terms and timely processes.23 It referred to broad concerns expressed by app developers that challenging an app review process (whereby Apple or Google approve new apps or app updates for distribution on their app stores) was like “navigating a black box,” and to the desire of app developers for transparent dispute resolution mechanisms.24
  
Mandatory IAP Requirements and 30 Percent Commissions
In announcing the release of the App Stores Report, ACCC Chair Rod Sims said “the ACCC is also concerned with restrictions imposed by Apple and Google which mean developers have no choice but to use Apple and Google’s own payment systems for any in-app purchases.”25 The requirement for apps to use Apple and Google’s mandatory IAP systems depends on whether the app is deemed to offer “digital goods and services” by Apple and Google. In this respect, the ACCC highlighted the “discretion exercised by both Apple and Google in how their terms and conditions are modified and applied.”26 This creates risk and uncertainty for businesses whose products or services are not clearly within the definitions set by Apple and Google.
The ACCC indicated that there were divergent views on the appropriateness of the level of the 30 percent commission charged by Apple and Google.27 However the ACCC ultimately concluded that “… it is highly likely that the commission rates are inflated by the market power that Apple and Google have…”28 The ACCC recognized that, irrespective of whether IAP fees were inflated, mandatory IAP requirements may impact downstream competition between apps that are subject to the requirement and apps that are not, including raising “… costs for their [Apple and Google’s] rivals.”29 However, the ACCC said that it was difficult to determine how inflated these commissions were, including because charges for the use of a mobile ecosystem are not directly cost-based and costs may be common to the range of ecosystem-wide services supplied (e.g. cost of developing and maintaining the mobile operating system).30
The ACCC did not ultimately recommend that Apple or Google be precluded from imposing the mandatory use of their IAP systems at this stage. It found that the benefits and risks of such action (e.g. the impact of Apple/Google imposing alternative fee structures in response) required further analysis and industry consultation.31 It did note, however, that removing mandatory IAP requirements would “allow app developers to offer consumers alternative methods to pay for goods and services, including potentially cheaper prices.”32
  
Search, Discovery, and Display of Apps
The ACCC found a number of instances where the systems for prioritization of apps in search and discovery rankings were unclear. In particular, the ACCC said that Apple and Google’s app stores appear to prioritize apps which offer in-app payments, presumably because Apple and Google gain commissions from the use of those apps.33 The ACCC also referred to studies by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times to suggest that Apple’s App Store search algorithm may have systematically ranked Apple’s own apps more favorably than competitors’.34 Finally, the ACCC found that users were unable to leave written reviews or rate first-party Apple apps on the App Store,35 which likely impacts these apps’ rankings in app store search results.
In relation to the display of apps, the ACCC noted that pre-installed apps tend to be placed in highly visible locations on iOS and Android device displays and may also be set as default apps. It said this can heighten barriers to entry and expansion in downstream app markets.36
  
Data
Finally, the ACCC expressed concerns that Apple and Google have the ability and incentive to use information gathered from apps to gain a competitive insight into rival apps’ businesses, in order to assist their own strategic or commercial decisions regarding app development.37
 B. The ACCC’s Recommendations
The ACCC did not at this stage propose any Government or regulatory intervention as it did with respect to the Media Bargaining Code of Conduct in the DPI Final Report.
Instead, the ACCC proposed six “potential measures” that could be implemented by Apple and Google in response to the concerns identified in the App Stores Report. The ACCC said that “regulation may be required” if Apple and Google fail to implement these potential measures.38 The ACCC also said that it would revisit app store-related concerns during the course of the five-year DPSI and would take into account steps taken by Apple and Google to address them.39
The potential measures for Apple and Google include:

Allowing developers to provide users with information about alternative payment options off-app to address inadequate payment option information and limitations on developers.40
Providing greater transparency about key algorithms and processes determining discoverability to enable app developers to adapt in a timely way – this will increase transparency and address the risk of self-preferencing in app discoverability and display.41
Providing consumers with an option to rate and write reviews on all apps, including first-party apps – this will enable third party apps to compete on their merits with first-party apps.42
Providing consumers with the ability to choose default apps and to change pre-installed apps that are not a core feature – this will “… promote more robust competition in downstream markets for apps.”43 The ACCC will also be exploring this issue with respect to default search engines and browsers through its next DPSI report (see Section III below).
Information collected by Apple and Google through their position as app store operators being ring-fenced from their other operations and decisions to minimize the risk the information being used to gain an unfair competitive advantage.44

The ACCC appears at this stage to be taking a “wait and see” approach to the issues it identified in the App Stores Report. Unlike the DPI Final Report, the ACCC has not yet proposed direct regulatory intervention in relation to app stores. The ACCC commented that it is “considering the broader issues that arise when digital platforms occupy critical gatekeeper roles and at the same time compete with those businesses that rely on access…”45 Further, the ACCC noted that it is considering international regulatory developments, including “[t]he UK and EC draft proposals, as well as the reports which lead to these proposals, highlight the similarity of the issues across a range of gatekeeper platforms and services, including app marketplaces. The ACCC will continue to explore the issues highlighted here in relation to app marketplaces as well as in other digital platform markets through the course of the DPSI.”46
  
II. The Forthcoming Third DPSI Report Regarding Choice Screens (due September 30, 2021)47
The focus of the ACCC’s forthcoming third interim DPSI report is on the supply of web browsers and general search services to users (“Browser and Search Report”). The Browser and Search Report will also focus on the effectiveness of choice screens in facilitating competition and increasing consumer choice. A choice screen is effectively a pop-up display which enables users of a device to select a default web browser or search service from some, or all available providers on the market.
The ACCC’s decision to focus on choice screens for web browser and search services for its third DPSI report relates to its recommendation in the original DPI Final Report that:48
Google should provide Australian users of Android devices with the same options being rolled out to existing Android users in Europe; that is, the ability to choose their default search engine and default internet browser from a number of options. If Google does not introduce similar options for Australian Android users by six months from the date of the Report, the ACCC will submit to the Government that it should consider compelling Google to offer this choice.
In its December 2019 response to the DPI Final Report, the Australian Government asked the ACCC to monitor the rollout of the default internet browser and search services choice screen in Europe and report back in 2021.49 Around two years have passed since the ACCC made its recommendation and Google has not yet introduced a similar choice screen option for its Australian users.
 A. The Issues Paper
To inform the Browser and Search Report, the ACCC released the “Choice Screen Issues Paper” seeking feedback from interested stakeholders to understand several key issues, including:

how pre-installation or default settings can impact competition and consumer choice in the supply of web browsers and search services;50
the effectiveness of the rollout of choice screens in Europe;51 and
whether there was another form of intervention that may be implemented together with, or instead of choice screens that may facilitate competition and improve consumer choice. Examples include: restrictions on search services acquiring default positions, a requirement for Google to share click and query data with third-party search services, and mandating that Google and Bing provide syndicated search results on fair and reasonable terms.52

The ACCC’s focus for this report is on desktop and mobile devices as these remain the primary way consumers access web browsers and search services.
A key aspect of the ACCC’s Choice Screen Issues Paper is requesting information on the position of international competition regulators.53 The ACCC is focusing on the European Commission’s Google Android decision in 2018 which resulted in Google committing to the rollout of a choice screen.54 This rollout has gone through various stages:

The initial choice screen announced by Google was to be included on all existing and new Android devices and provide users with a choice of five browsers and five search services.55
During the rollout, Google announced the choice screen would only be implemented on new Android devices, display four search services and no browsers. Additionally, search services would have to bid in an action for a place on the choice screen and pay a price to Google each time a user selects them from the choice screen.
Google has recently announced it will expand the choice screen to include more search services and make participation free for eligible providers.56

 B. The Submissions in Response 
The ACCC received a number of submissions in response to the Choice Screen Issues Paper.57 These are summarized according to key themes below.
  
Network Effects
A major theme of submissions is the role of scale in driving network effects in search services and web browsers, and how a choice screen may address those impacts.
Microsoft and Mozilla both argue that scale plays a large role in driving network effects across search services and web browsers, which may be further amplified by customer inertia or default settings.58 In particular, they argue that scale drives network effects in the following ways:

Search services: users are attracted to general search services with more users as the algorithms learn faster and generally provide better quality results. The scale of consumers then attracts advertisers as they generally receive a better return on their campaign investments as the algorithms are better at ad matching. The presence of advertisers then incentivizes browsers to set default general search services that monetize the best and share advertising revenue.59
Web browsers: developers are more likely to spend time and money developing websites that are compatible with the underlying code of a dominant web browser as it has the most user traffic. In turn, users are attracted to web browsers with the most compatible websites as they are less likely to break, load faster, and are more secure.60

However, Google submitted that the implementation of choice screens or any other regulatory measure is unnecessary as the popularity of its search engine and browser does not reflect a market failure, but rather the superior quality of its offering which makes it the preferred search service for most consumers.61
  
Choice Screen Efficacy
Google submitted that the European Commission’s decision on Google Android does not support the need for a choice screen in Australia. Google argued that a key element of the European Commission’s decision was that Android and iOS do not compete. This, it argues, contradicts previous statements made by the ACCC that Android does face competition from iOS in Australia. While the ACCC acknowledged a level of competition between Apple and Google to attract consumers to their respective mobile ecosystems, the ACCC also acknowledged that measures may be required to increase competition within their respective mobile ecosystems.62
In contrast, the majority of non-Google submissions agreed that choice screens can be a beneficial tool to facilitate competition.63 However, these submissions also considered that choice screens are unlikely to be effective on their own because the Australian markets for both search services and web browsers have arguably already reached their tipping point due to the network effects outlined above (see by comparison the Russian case study below).64
  
Russian Case Study on Scale and Choice Screen Efficacy
In the Choice Screens Issues Paper, the ACCC reiterated its conclusion in the DPI Final Report that offering a choice screen may address customer inertia and the effect of default settings as a barrier to expansion for search engine suppliers and internet browsers.65 To support this conclusion, the ACCC noted that Google had previously introduced a choice screen in Russia following a decision by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service that Google restricted competition through mandatory pre-installation and preferential placement on device home screens.66
A number of the submissions to the ACCC’s Choice Screen Issues Paper referenced the effective implementation of this choice screen in Russia.67 One submission pointed to a report by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority which evidenced the consistent growth in Russian search engine Yandex’s market share since the implementation of a choice screen, surpassing Google in January 2019.68 However, Microsoft noted that at the time the choice screen was implemented in Russia, Yandex had over 30 percent market share. This meant it was arguably not too far behind Google in scale, and had sufficient brand recognition among users, which made the choice screen approach more effective than it might be in other contexts where the market has already reached its tipping point.
  
Additional Design Features of Choice Screens
DuckDuckGo’s submission, while broadly supportive of the ACCC’s proposal to implement a choice screen, went further by proposing its own design.69 DuckDuckGo’s choice screen design increases the number of search services displayed on the choice screen and includes a short promotional pitch from the search service.70 DuckDuckGo used its choice screen design to research consumer switching and found 24 percent of consumers selected a Google alternative when presented with more options (compared to 3 percent of consumers that switched to a Google alternative under the current design).71 Ecosia supported DuckDuckGo’s design in its submission72 and stated that it considers DuckDuckGo’s design proposal to have been widely endorsed by alternative search providers and academics.73
Microsoft also included a number of features that it considers critical to making a choice screen effective. These include, among other things, presenting the choice screen on all new and existing devices, listing competitors in an objectively randomized order, and removing the option for users to dismiss the screen.74
  
Additional Regulatory Actions Beyond Choice Screens
A number of submissions put forward proposals for what further regulatory tools or actions they felt were required to facilitate competition between browsers and search engines. These include providing consumers with accessible information about their choices and offering them greater control over the selection of alternative browsers and search engines,75 introducing data portability and interoperability standards that promote web compatibility and address information asymmetries in data driven markets,76 and considering further intervention if a breach of Australian competition law is found, such as self-preferencing.77
 C. What to expect from the ACCC
It remains to be seen what the ACCC’s response will be to the views canvassed in response to its Choice Screen Issues Paper and the concerns raised by alternative web browser and search engine providers. While the ACCC has not yet proposed any direct government or ACCC intervention in relation to app stores, it may be more likely to do so in its forthcoming Browser and Search Report given it already recommended in 2019 that Google implement choice screens in Australia. However, we have likely also not seen the final word on app stores and the ACCC may be considering broader digital regulatory reform.

Apple and the Justice Department (DOJ) are headed to court, after the company balked at the DOJ’s information request from Apple in its antitrust suit against Google, reported Politico.
DOJ lawyers told US District Judge Amit Mehta they have reached an “impasse” with the company over documents despite weekly negotiations since February.
According to Politico, Apple’s lucrative agreement to set Google as the iPhone’s default search engine is a key to the Justice Department’s case. DOJ alleges that Google pays Apple between US$8 billion and US$12 billion each year for the default spot, a sizable chunk of the iPhone maker’s US$57 billion in profit last year.
Related: US Judge Says Google Request For Microsoft Documents Is Relevant
In a court filing late Tuesday, August 17, Apple accused DOJ lawyers of “manufacturing an impasse” by making requests that were “unnecessarily burdensome.” The iPhonemaker alleged that the Justice Department has demanded it search emails and documents of top executives for terms relating to “nearly all aspects of Apple’s business over the last 20 years,”  creating millions of hits.

Digital business ecosystems (“DBEs”) reflect the culmination of progressive changes in business models over the last 40 years. Coupled with the unique economic characteristics of the DBEs, these features amplify concerns arounds their ubiquity and significant market power. This article argues that existing competition analysis and proposed remedial approaches miss important implications of the complex business model and unique economic characteristics of DBEs. These include pervasive market failures, economies of scale in cloud computing technology, and algorithmic preference-shaping, all of which have myriad implications for assessing and controlling market power. If unaccounted for, these features will likely lead to competition analysis and policy approaches that do not appropriately target the source of DBE market power and vast capacity for expansion and growth.

I. INTRODUCTION
Digital business ecosystems (“DBEs”) reflect the culmination of progressive changes in business models and organizational structure over the last 40 years. DBEs feature collaborations of entities, primarily through digital architectures of information and communication technologies. Leading examples of large DBEs are Facebook (social networking), Google (search), and Amazon (e-commerce). Other powerful DBEs, however, are on the rise, including Zillow (real estate) and Optum (healthcare technology). The ubiquity and significant market power of large DBEs is t...

468,"August 17, 2021",Fix It or Forget It: A “No-Remedies” Policy for Merger Enforcement,"
The inherent limitations of remedies as a method of resolving competitive concerns with mergers have become more evident. The expansive use of remedies in actual practice has likely exceeded the capabilities of agencies and courts; and empirical evidence has increasingly cast doubt on their effectiveness. Accordingly, we propose a “no-remedies” policy under which the antitrust agency would not accept any conduct remedies and only limited divestitures. The agencies would only consider those structural changes that have been undertaken (or at least committed to) prior to the parties’ filing their merger proposal and would not enter into negotiation with the parties during the review period. This “Fix It or Forget It” (“FIFI”) policy would encourage merging parties to initiate the necessary competitive fixes and permit the agency to evaluate precisely what the parties file in their proposal. We believe this policy would strengthen merger enforcement by restoring the traditional roles of the agencies and the courts.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past several years, merger remedies have come under ever closer scrutiny. Adverse experiences have exposed the difficulties of fashioning effective remedies while academic studies have documented the frequency with which remedies have failed. This is particularly true for conduct or behavioral remedies, which proscribe specified actions on the part of the merged firm, but it is ...

469,"August 17, 2021",Recapturing the Business Side of Innovation in Antitrust Merger Analysis,"
The antitrust laws were not passed as an academic exercise. They were passed to break up the great Trusts, and to preserve competition. These were and are business issues. Our current debate over the impact of mergers on innovation seems to have left that business purpose and dimension out of the discussion. It is time to bring business reality back into the antitrust analysis. Innovation drives progress, and is a key factor in determining the success or failure of a business, an industry, and society overall. Innovation also is a concept with a rich heritage in business and social science. But our current legal discussions focus on only a part of what makes innovation important. We have set up a distinction between the idea of an innovation and the development of that idea into a successful product, and then downgraded or ignored that second part. But the transition from idea to product is a critical step in the process. After reviewing the ways in which innovation has been defined in the legal literature, we propose a definition arising out of the business world that captures the full meaning of innovation. It turns out that the current approach to evaluating the impact of mergers on innovation doesn’t really have much to do with innovation at all.

Internet users surfing from one website to another, or using various web-enabled applications, regularly encounter “dark patterns” — web-design choices that trick users into unknowingly providing more time, money, or attention than they realize. Dark patterns thus manipulate users, impairing their ability to exercise free choice and to express their actual preferences. Their use on the web is pervasive. Moreover, as artificial intelligence develops and as the “internet of things” rolls out, the ability and opportunity to manipulate and exploit consumers via dark patters will, predictably, increase. This article discusses various dark pattern techniques and explains the conditions accounting for their frequency of use in the digital space. Legislation prohibiting dark patterns and litigation challenging them as deceptive acts or practices are becoming available. However, dark patterns also have anti-competitive consequences, as they shift surplus from customers to suppliers, while also raising rivals’ costs to compete. Accordingly, antitrust enforcement should also be available to remedy these ubiquitous and pernicious online practices.

Chinese antitrust enforcement under the Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”) has visibly gained pace since the end of 2020. Some would even say Chinese antitrust has entered into a “new area.”2 A key reason for the increased antitrust enforcement was the high-level backing which top leaders voiced for antitrust enforcement.

Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. It would also prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices or conditions through another app store or payment system.
“I found this predatory abuse of Apple and Google so deeply offensive on so many levels,” Blumenthal said in an interview on Wednesday, August 11. “Their power has reached a point where they are impacting the whole economy in stifling and strangling innovation.”
Blumenthal said he expected companion legislation to be introduced in the House of Representatives “very soon.” The bill would also bar app stores from using non-public information about apps to compete with them.

Tile, which makes tags to help consumers find lost objects, complained earlier this year about Apple launching AirTags as a rival product.
Apple’s control over what apps enter its app platform and its commissions of 15% to 30% on digital sales have come under regulatory scrutiny. A federal judge is reviewing testimony on this issue to rule on an antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games.

Valve stated in a new court filing that Wolfire, which filed the lawsuit in April, has failed to demonstrate any actual wrongdoing.
In April, Wolfire Games filed an antitrust lawsuit against Valve, alleging that it uses Steam’s dominance of the PC game market to suppress competition and extract “an extraordinarily high cut” of sales made through its storefront. In a response filed earlier this week, Valve has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed outright, because it “fails to allege the most basic elements of an antitrust case.”
One of the central claims Wolfire made in its lawsuit is that Valve prevents developers and publishers from selling Steam keys at lower prices on other storefronts than it does on Steam. That’s bad for game makers, but also for gamers, according to Wolfire, because it means sellers have to keep their prices high in order to afford Valve’s 30% cut. Wolfire is the creator of Receiver and martial arts game Overgrowth.
Valve also defends its 30% take in the response, stating that there’s no actual evidence that it’s out of the ordinary. “Plaintiffs can muster only a generalization that economics predicts Valve’s 30% commission should have decreased over time … In fact, 30% has become the ‘industry standard,’ while Valve has faced competition from some of the largest companies in the industry, including Microsoft, Epic Games, and Amazon.”

474,"July 27, 2021",Growing Convergence: The Limited Role of Antitrust in Standard Essential Patent Disputes,"
In the last couple of years, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and several European countries have reversed previous interventionist decisions and limited the role of antitrust in the resolution of disputes concerning Standard Essential Patent (“SEPs”). These jurisdictions recognize the need to protect intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) by making available injunctions against infringers. Courts have realized that hold-up by a patent holder demanding excessive royalties is not a widespread problem and that patent implementers may hold-out against paying any royalties whilst they continue to practice a patent. They have accordingly adopted new standards for granting injunctions in disputes involving SEPs with the goal of increasing efficiency and legal certainty. We discuss this shift and its implications for competition policy and innovation.

475,"July 27, 2021",Why the New Administration Should Bury the New Madison Approach,"
The “New Madison” approach sounds so promising. Old but new. Updating the classics for the modern era. What could be bad? In a word: everything. The intersection of patent and antitrust law has a long pedigree. For decades, antitrust’s role in patent-based activity has been acknowledged. Patent licenses are subject to antitrust scrutiny. “Pay for delay” settlements are not entitled to antitrust immunity. And activity in the context of standard setting organizations (“SSOs”) could conceivably violate antitrust law. That history has recently come under attack. Between 2017 and 2020, the head of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, introduced a radical framework — the “New Madison” approach — that extricated patent-based conduct from antitrust scrutiny. Such a gambit diverged from the longstanding bipartisan approach that had recognized antitrust’s role in policing standards-based conduct. This essay introduces standards and then addresses five tenets of Delrahim’s approach. For each, it presents the argument and then discusses its flaws.

Many well-reasoned cases have concluded that a holder of standard-essential patents (“SEPs”) subject to a commitment to license on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (“FRAND”) terms may violate section 2 of the Sherman Act by breaching that FRAND commitment. However, a small but vocal minority has increasingly questioned that view, relying on Rambus, where the D.C. Circuit overturned an FTC order finding that Rambus engaged in unlawful monopolization due to its failure to disclose its patents to a standard-setting organization. For this point, Rambus relied almost entirely on the Supreme Court’s 1998 NYNEX decision, which involved a legal monopoly, not standard-setting activities. This article will (1) explain why Rambus was incorrectly decided, including its misinterpretation of NYNEX, and (2) describe the circumstances under which a unilateral breach of FRAND is a cognizable Section 2 violation.

By John “Jay” Jurata, Jr. & Emily N. Luken1

I. INTRODUCTION
Commitments by holders of standards-essential patents (“SEPs”) to license their patented technology on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (“FRAND”) terms serve as “important safeguards against monopoly power.”2 So when companies that make FRAND commitments do not follow through on them, they bypass these important safeguards. Thus, it is elementary that a SEP-holder’s violation of a prior FRAND commitment can be exclusionary conduct that distorts competition. Accordingly, va...

President Joe Biden has picked Jonathan Kanter to serve as the Justice Department’s (DOJ) assistant attorney general for antitrust, in a major win for progressive Democrats who accused the agency of failing to aggressively pursue major tech companies’ antitrust and privacy violations, Bloomberg reported.
According to the New York Times, Biden’s plan to appoint Mr. Kanter, an antitrust lawyer who has made a career out of representing smaller rivals of Big Tech, signals how strongly the administration is siding with the growing field of lawmakers, researchers and regulators who say that Silicon Valley has obtained outsize power over the way Americans speak with one another, buy products online and consume news.
If the Senate confirms him, Kanter would head the division that filed an antitrust suit against Google in October. 
Kanter began his career as a staff attorney at the Federal Trade Commission before moving to private practice. A protege of Rick Rule, a Republican who served as President Ronald Reagan’s DOJ antitrust chief, Kanter represented Microsoft when it settled the Justice Department’s probe in the early 2000s and then through the company’s travails with European antitrust authorities.
He also represented companies including US Airways in its merger with American Airlines, and health insurer Cigna in its failed deal with Anthem.

Slack shares edged higher in active trading Monday, July 19, after an antitrust probe into its US$27.7 billion takeover by Salesforce was dropped by the Department of Justice (DOJ).
The DOJ’s Antitrust Division opened a “second request” review into the deal earlier this year as the new administration of President Joe Biden vowed to take a closer look at big tech mergers. Slack stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it expects the deal to close on July 21.
Last month, Slack announced that its fiscal first quarter revenues rose 36% from last year to US$273.4 million, with billings rising 35% to US$278.5 million. Paid customer growth, the company stated, was up 39% to 169,000.
Salesforce, which published quarterly earnings on May 27, boosted its full-year outlook to an adjusted profit between US$3.79 and US$3.81 per share and forecast revenues in the range of US$25.90 billion and US$26.00 billion.
“Considering the deal price and the presence of a robust competitor in the collaboration market in the form of Microsoft, we expect investors to be keyed in on the early success Salesforce has in driving Slack penetration within its existing customer accounts,” said Stifel analyst Tom Roderick who carries a “buy” rating with a US$295 price target for Salesforce stock.

Zoom announced on Sunday, July 18, that it’s buying Five9, a provider of cloud contact center software, in an all-stock transaction valuing the company at US$14.7 billion.
The deal marks Zoom’s first billion-dollar acquisition and comes as the company prepares for a post-pandemic world with employees returning to the office. It’s the second-biggest US tech deal this year, behind Microsoft’s planned US$16 billion purchase of Nuance Communications, according to FactSet.
“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” said Zoom CEO Eric Yuan in a press release.
Zoom has been among the top growth stories in the 16 months since COVID-19 caused a sudden shutdown of offices across the globe, forcing workers in finance, retail, tech and law offices to communicate from remote locations.
After expanding revenue by 326% in 2020, Zoom faces a natural slowdown, especially as companies reopen and face-to-face meetings resume. While the company has launched new products to reckon with coming changes to its business, it’s now so big that organic growth alone is unlikely to satisfy Wall Street. It also needs new revenue sources as Microsoft ramps up competition in video chat with Teams.

482,"July 1, 2021",How to Tame the Tech Giants: Reverse the Burden of Proof in Merger Reviews,"
By: Tomasso Valletti (Pro Market)
As you read this, please remember two numbers: 1,000 and zero. The former number represents the 1,000 acquisitions made by GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) in the past 20 years. The latter is the number of those acquisitions actually blocked by regulators worldwide. 
Mergers and acquisitions have directly increased market concentration across Europe and the US, including in brewing, supermarkets, hospitals, car rentals, eyeglasses, crop seeds, industrial chemicals, meat packing, wireless carriers, and many others. Detailed studies document a rise in concentration and market power, a decline in the rate of new firms entering markets, and a fall in labor’s share of economic output.
When I was Chief Competition Economist at the European Commission from 2016-2019, I found myself in an unbalanced tug of war. My team of 30 (really excellent) economists, supervising the economic analysis of every major merger, antitrust, and state aid case in Europe, faced dominant companies that could hire any number of lawyers against us. They paid an army of consultancies to create doubt around an issue, while the burden of proof was on us to dismiss their claims. This burden was made worse by asymmetric information: the companies had all the incentives to hide vast amounts of information from us and use it selectively to create more obfuscating smoke.
As we tried to build our cases, the dominant companies bogged us down in endless, esoteric arguments about definitions of markets and other matters. This has a long history. When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, for instance, the discussion between the enforcers and the parties ultimately revolved around the “supply of photo apps,” which would be of limited interest to advertisers because “eyeballs are not on the app for a significant period of time” and “limited user data is captured.”  Of 8,000 cases analyzed by the European Commission since 1990, only 30 have been prohibited…

Facebook’s fate in terms of its acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer will be decided by antitrust officials soon, US News reported.
The deal was intended to help scale up the social media company’s WhatsApp, which saw a new spate of usage in the pandemic. It was announced late in 2020.
But with antitrust concerns being paramount these days, EU antitrust regulators want to look more closely at deals with tech, pharma and biotech startups.
They’re looking out for warning signs of “killer acquisitions” in which big companies buy out rivals to squash competition — something Facebook has been accused of before. Austria had asked the EU to take over the review. Now, the Commission can either clear the deal or decide that a four-month investigation would be prudent.
Earlier this year, Facebook hit a market cap of US$1 trillion, with that making it the fifth company — following Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet — to gain the distinction.
The revenue for Facebook is almost entirely the result of personal ads that Facebook users see when scrolling the popular social media site, along with companies it owns like Instagram.
The company has some new ideas in the pipeline, including a video-calling device and new virtual reality headsets from Oculus, with smart glasses slated to be released later in 2021.

484,"June 15, 2021",Self-Preferencing and Antitrust: Harmful Solutions for an Improbable Problem,"
Platforms, including vertically integrated platforms, are ubiquitous — both in the modern economy, and throughout history. While some such firms have managed to capture the popular imagination (and ire), there is good reason to expect self-preferencing by vertically integrated platforms is far more likely to benefit competition than to harm it. While there are limited cases in which self-preferencing could be harmful, existing antitrust laws are more than capable of addressing these situations. Finally, the proposed cures for a largely illusory problem are likely to inflict a great deal of harm, for little apparent gain. Antitrust enforcement involving platform self-preferencing should continue to follow the better course established by the existing legal and economic framework.

By D. Bruce Hoffman & Garrett D. Shinn1
 
Over the last few years, antitrust law has surged to an unusually prominent position in popular and political discourse — largely due to a chorus of claims that antitrust enforcement has been overly lax for close to half a century.2 Some of the loudest complaints target situations where a firm that offers a place for others to sell their products (a “platform”) decides that it’s going to sell its own products there as well — and sometimes gives its products an advantage.
This practice, frequently called “self-preferencing,” is often taken as a self-evident evil in need of a cure. Thus, Senator Elizabeth Warren colorfully used a base...

The Sherman Act and related antitrust jurisprudence have proven flexible and capable of balancing competitive effects of virtually any kind of concerted conduct among two or more conspirators under the rule of reason. The same flexibility, however, is not available to plaintiffs seeking to remedy unilateral conduct — no matter how anticompetitive — except in very limited circumstances. The current U.S. antitrust framework overwhelmingly fails to reach anticompetitive, unilateral conduct by companies growing upwards of seventy percent in any well-defined product market. This unilateral conduct gap severely restricts the ability to protect interoperability and innovation, particularly with respect to complementary products that increase consumer welfare and choice. Congress should seize upon the rare cross-aisle support for modernizing antitrust legislation to create a new rule of reason cause of action to remedy anticompetitive unilateral conduct separate and apart from Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

The recent focus on anticompetitive conduct in digital markets has exposed a fundamental limitation of U.S. antitrust legislation and jurisprudence: How do we rein in anticompetitive, unilateral conduct in emerging and adjacent markets by entities that may be dominant players in related markets, but might not have a monopoly share in the complementary market restrained by the conduct?

As the concepts of network effects, tipping, and lock-in have grown in importance with the rise, growth, and current ubiquity of platforms, data analytics, and computer software in the modern economy, competition concerns have followed. Considered through the lens of competition policy generally and antitrust law specifically, interoperability emerges as an indispensable part of the answer to these competition concerns, but one that requires careful implementation to navigate the inevitable frictions with intellectual property, privacy, and other doctrines that rub up against antitrust and competition policy. To the extent courts, regulators, and policymakers contemplate interoperability as a cure for network effects and other market failures, they will need to think carefully about how to strike the balance between sacrificing privacy and mandating interoperability, using the right combination of antitrust and regulation.

Self-preferencing occurs when a firm unfairly modifies its operations to privilege its own, another firm’s, or a set of firms’ products or services. Extensive domestic and international investigations have confirmed that dominant technology corporations, like Google and Facebook, use self-preferencing to acquire, maintain, and entrench their dominant market position. This article will explain how self-preferencing can violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Part 2 of the article will discuss how Congress intended and designed the Sherman Act to prohibit unfair competition. Part 3 will detail the harmful and exclusionary effects of self-preferencing.

As the world increasingly considers antitrust as a tool for governing and shaping large internet companies, we ask whether traditional antitrust analysis and remedies are well-suited to current regulatory challenges. We examine interoperability as a potential remedy, suggesting that a proper understanding of its objective and outcome is greater diversity of user experience and an increase in user agency rather than direct improvements in more traditional price or access metrics. Regulating interoperability from that perspective will involve practical challenges in balancing effectiveness with clarity of obligation. As a result, new models of co-regulatory governance including extensive engagement from all stakeholders should be explored.

489,"June 9, 2021",Democrats To Take On Big Tech With 5 Major Antitrust Bills,"


House Democrats plan to introduce five separate bills as early as this week that could dramatically reign in big tech companies’ economic dominance, Politico reported Wednesday, June 9.
The bills address a number of lawmakers’ concerns about the growing power of tech titans like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet-owned Google, and Facebook.
One bill, headed up by Rep. Pramilia Jayapal, of Washington, would let the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sue to break up tech companies by forcing them to sell parts of their business that present a conflict of interest, Politico reported. That could spell trouble for companies like Amazon and Google, which critics say use their dominance of web hosting and digital ad markets to promote their own products and services.
A second bill, authored by Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, would ban large tech companies from favoring their own products in digital marketplaces they operate and set the rules for, according to Politico. That takes aim at how Apple’s App Store policies impact app developers and how Amazon treats third-party sellers in its marketplace.
A third bill, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, would prohibit platform companies from acquiring or merging with potential competitors, Politico reported. That follows criticism of Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the FTC’s probe into potentially anticompetitive acquisitions by Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
A fourth bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, of Pennsylvania, would require platforms with more than 500,000 US users, or those designated by regulators as a “critical trading partner,” to make it easier for users to move their data to rival platforms, Politico reported. Lawmakers have criticized Facebook and Google for hoarding users’ personal data in an endless “feedback loop” that helps them maintain their market power.
The final bill, identical to one sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) and Chuck Grassley (Republican – Iowa) in a spending bill that passed this week, Politico reported, would require companies to pay antitrust regulators more when seeking their approval for mergers. Regulators are vastly under-resourced compared to the tech giants they’re tasked with regulating, placing them at a huge disadvantage if they seek to block a merger and it goes to court — increased legal fees could help balance the scales.

The European Union needs to be more ambitious in its control of Big Tech and smaller acquisitions that often go under the radar, Germany, France, and the Netherlands have all claimed.
According to CNBC, the 27-member bloc is currently discussing new legislation that could ultimately force Big Tech to change how it operates. The Digital Markets Act, a proposal put forward last December, aims to level the playing field in the EU market and could be implemented as early as 2022. In this context, Berlin, Paris, and the Hague are asking for a stricter stance on mergers.
“We have to strengthen and speed up merger control in particular vis-a-vis certain gatekeeper platforms to tackle the strategies of platform companies consisting in systematically buying up nascent companies in order to stifle competition,” the countries said in a joint statement.
It has long been a concern for European capitals that some of the world’s biggest tech companies have bought up start-ups, including ones in the EU, in deals that have escaped scrutiny because they did not meet a certain turnover threshold.
Whereas high profile purchases, such as Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype in 2011, makes the headlines; smaller deals often go unnoticed. In 2019, Apple bought an artificial intelligence firm in the UK (now no longer an EU nation) for an undisclosed sum, for example.

Today, online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have become the primary means of expression and source of information for many Americans. Since their inception, these platforms have enjoyed legal immunities under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a 25-year old statute that largely shields them from liability for hosting and moderating content posted by their users. For years, Section 230 was seen as striking the right balance between encouraging free expression on the internet and protecting content moderation by online platforms. But as both sides of the political aisle start to criticize “Big Tech,” the once-obscure statute, which is seen as providing sweeping immunities to some of the largest companies in the world, is taking fire from all directions. Multiple reform bills have been proposed by legislators, including ones that would prevent online platforms from using Section 230 as a defense in cases brought under antitrust law. Some have suggested that a Section 230 reform would broaden the reach of antitrust law and make it more likely for an antitrust case against “Big Tech” to succeed. This article explains why we believe a Section 230 reform would have little impact on antitrust law.

492,"May 25, 2021",What We Talk About When We Talk About Section 230,"
When we talk about Section 230 in a vacuum, separate from antitrust policy, or public utility policy, we miss how it works — or rather, how it fails, and, more importantly, how to coherently set up a new, comprehensive regulatory regime with a thriving informational sphere. Section 230 was born along with consolidation, and instead of just talking about full or partial repeal, we should be talking about a new vision for communications infrastructure in America.

It was probably about five years ago that I realized I had been totally wrong on Section 230, a kind of depth of wrongness that can make one more humble not just about the particular policy area, but all policy areas. I had adopted the view that Section 230 was fundamentally necessary for the flowering of decentralized, creative, online life, and that without it, there would be an internet, but it would be a highly controlled internet, one without joy or quirks, one that was organized from the top down. I advocated for it and campaigned on it.
There are two primary reasons for my wrongness about 230. First, I came to the law through copyright, and while I am by no means a free culture warrior, I have real and ongoing concerns about the monopolistic lock up of culture, and control that flows therefrom, in our current intellectual property regimes. As a result, many of my late aughts-early 2010s objections to touching 230 came not from a deep belief in the importance of platform immuni...

493,"May 24, 2021",Closing Arguments Completed In Apple-Epic Antitrust Case,"


Apple & Epic made their final pitch to a federal judge Monday, May 24, Epic looks to curb the market power of the App Store while the iPhone maker pleaded to leave its marketplace for 2 million apps undisturbed, reported Bloomberg.
US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers heard closing arguments Monday from attorneys for the creator of the blockbuster game Fortnite and the iPhone maker in a case that threatens to upend the how the US$142 billion world of mobile applications is managed.
Reprising the themes of a three-week trial in Oakland, California, the lawyers debated a set of topics, including the scope of the market in which Epic claims Apple wields power and whether Apple’s tight controls on its store hurts developers and users. Gonzalez Rogers, who is deciding the case without a jury, said she hopes to deliver a ruling as soon as possible but she didn’t specify a date.
After aggressively questioning Apple CEO Officer Tim Cook Friday in his first time testifying as a witness, the judge on Monday asked how Apple’s practice of taking a 30% commission from developers for in-app purchases made through its App Store has remained unchanged since the store opened in 2008.
“If there was real competition, that number would move and it hasn’t,” Gonzalez Rogers said. “If the relevant market here includes developer-side competition, so far there doesn’t seem to be anything that is in the market itself that is pressuring Apple to compete for developers.”
Apple’s lawyer Daniel Swanson said that Apple has improved its device quality even as its developer commission rate stayed the same. Games played on Apple’s iOS operating system can “hold their own” with some of the best games on consoles and PCs, Swanson said. “That is quality competition.”
Epic sued Apple in August, after the iPhone-maker removed Fortnite from its App Store because the gaming company created a workaround so it wouldn’t have to continue paying a 30% fee on customers’ in-app purchases. The case has drawn interest across Silicon Valley, with everyone from Microsoft Corp. to Nvidia Corp. weighing into the fight. In November, Apple sliced its revenue cut from 30% to 15% for developers who generate up to US$1 million in revenue.

The Australian competition regulator has approved the proposed acquisition of collaboration software firm Slack by CRM giant Salesforce for US$37 billion, stating the deal was unlikely to lessen competition.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Thursday, May 20, announced that it would not oppose the planned acquisition announced by Salesforce last December and is still awaiting US regulator approval.
The deal is the biggest in the CRM giant’s 21 year history and will see it compete with Microsoft in another market, with the companies already competing in sales, productivity and data visualisation software.
The ACCC considered the effect of the acquisition on the supply of CRM solutions and the supply of team collaboration software in Australia during a 50-day review that began in March.
“Salesforce and Slack mostly supply different software with distinct purposes, so there is minimal direct competitive overlap between them,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We focused on whether Salesforce having both CRM and team collaboration solutions could give rise to a substantial lessening of competition.”
Mr Sims said most interested parties raised no concerns with the deal and if Salesforce did engage in anticompetitive bundling or foreclosure customers had several alternatives in the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Adobe. Microsoft’s Teams products also offers an alternative to the Slack software, he said.

495,"May 19, 2021",Will the Digital Markets Act Kill Innovation in Europe?,"
By Pierre Larouche* & Alexandre de Streel+
 
In December 2020, the European Commission proposed an ambitious new set of rules, the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”),1 which could be applicable in 2023 and whose rationale leans heavily on innovation. In many places throughout the proposed DMA recitals, the Explanatory Memorandum included therewith and the Impact Assessment attached thereto, the Commission explains in greater detail how innovation is currently adversely impacted in the digital economy and how its proposal would improve the situation.2
 
General Relationship Between Competition and Innovation 
At a general level, the Commission reiterates its core belief that there is a direct relationship between competition and innovation: more competition leads to more innovation.3 Similar statements are found throughout the decisions and soft-law instruments issued by competition agencies across Europe. One might fault the Commission for taking what looks like a strong Arrowian view4 of the relationship between competition and innovation, ignoring both the Schumpeterian analysis5 (which posits an inverse relationship) and the contemporary synthesis (which returns an inverted-U relationship) made by a cluster of authors around Aghion.6 In the context of competition law, authorities are usually dealing with markets where competition is rather diminished than excessive. It may then not matter much in practice whether they take an Arrow or Aghion theoretical perspective, since in all likelihood authorities are active on the upward-sloping part of the inverted-U, where Arrow and Aghion coincide.
While the DMA may also play out in the upward-sloping part of the inverted-U, it cannot be excluded that in some situations, competition is already strong, so that authorities could be acting on the downward-sloping part of the inverted-U, where it is no longer correct to assume that more competition will unavoidably foster innovation. Indeed, in the more elaborate parts of its analysis, the Commission shows that it is aware that the relationship between competition and innovation is not so simple. There are some trade-offs involved, especially once the specific features of so-called Core Platform Services, i.e. the digital services targeted by the DMA, are brought into the picture, namely: economies of scale and scope, network effects (compounded by multi-sidedness), lock-in, lack of multi-homing, vertical integration and data-driven advantages. Innovation can come from the platform itself – and the firm controlling it (the “gatekeeper” pursuant to the DMA) – or it can arise around the platform, typically driven by a firm using the platform to bring an invention to the market (a “user” pursuant to the DMA). The Commission is well aware that the DMA could reduce the innovation incentives of the platform owner; the question then becomes what is gained in return. Once the analysis reaches that level of sophistication, however, it starts branching out in different directions. As the following paragraphs show, two distinct innovation scenarios are bundled together in the DMA.
 
Scenario 1: Sustaining Innovation by Users Based on the Core Platform Services
As a starting point, the Commission recognizes that online platforms have proven to be innovation hotbeds, with innovation originating throughout the platform ecosystem, i.e. not just from the gatekeepers themselves, but also from platform users, businesses and individuals alike.7 Platform users innovate by introducing complementary products, for instance games or productivity apps for mobile operating systems. Yet the heady early days of the Internet are over. In the current context, the Commission points to evidence that the rise of powerful gatekeepers controlling the main online platforms leads to sub-optimal levels of innovation. Essentially, the innovation incentives of the gatekeepers and the users become misaligned, and the gatekeepers start to divert some of their efforts towards preventing or appropriating innovations brought about by platform users. In that case, certain courses of conduct by platform operators hinder business users and adversely affect their innovation incentives. Ultimately, these businesses refrain or are prevented from bringing innovative offerings to the market.
Under this scenario, the main concern is that the platform gatekeeper would go out of its way to control the flow of innovation around its platform. While blocking inventive offerings by users is certainly possible, a more likely course of conduct, witnessed in a number of cases already (from Microsoft to Google Shopping and Google Android),8 is that the gatekeeper would use bundling or self-preferencing to exclude the inventive user and appropriate the profits from the innovation via a competing offering of its own. A significant proportion of the obligations contained in the DMA are designed to address that concern. They include generic prohibitions against the use of non-public data to compete with business users or self-preferencing in search rankings, as well as an obligation to grant equal access to APIs and other interoperability features.9 In addition, the DMA proposal protects more specifically some neighbouring markets against gatekeeper conduct, namely identification services, apps and app stores and payment services.10
As far as innovation theory is concerned, this scenario involves what would typically be incremental innovation around the existing core platform service (as with the Novell and Sun server operating systems in relation to Windows Server Operating System in Microsoft). Furthermore, that innovation will also be sustaining innovation as it will remain within the value network or the architecture created by the platform. For instance, it would consist of apps running on a smartphone operating system platform such as iOS or Android; a specialized search engine (or another ancillary service such as maps, etc.) accessible through a general search engine such as Google; or a retail business hosted on an online retailing platform such as Amazon.
As a normative matter, the Commission cannot be faulted for intervening to safeguard the ability of third parties to carry out incremental innovation around the core platform services. Incremental innovation is especially prevalent in the digital economy, and it can greatly contribute to consumer welfare. Starting with Microsoft, competition enforcement in the EU has protected incremental innovation in the digital economy, although this has never been explicitly stated.11 In that respect, the DMA proposal merely extends the innovation policy choices made in competition law enforcement.
Whereas the first scenario is laid out in the Commission Impact Assessment and translated in the list of obligations and prohibitions applicable to gatekeepers, it does not entirely fit within either the “contestability” or “fairness” objectives defined in the DMA proposal. Regarding fairness, the proposal indicates that it should be understood as a contractual imbalance between the respective rights and obligations of gatekeeper and user.12 This definition does not fil well with the first innovation scenario which is more about equality of competitive opportunity.13 As for contestability, the DMA proposal almost always defines it in relation to core platform services, in line with economic theory where contestability is a redeeming feature of monopolistic markets.14 However, the first innovation scenario, as regards both the analysis and the remedial obligations, has little to do with the contestability of core platform services: rather, it is about containing gatekeeper power and preventing it from adversely affecting neighbouring markets in the ecosystem of the core platform service.
 
Scenario 2: Innovation in the Core Platform Services: Frontal Competition or Disruption? 
When it comes to contestability on the core platform services, the DMA proposal does not clearly explain the link with innovation. The Impact Assessment mentions that the gatekeepers divert their resources away from R&D and towards M&A, in order to compete “for the market.” At the same time, it is known that “a significant amount of innovation is driven by disruptive firms,” so that the DMA proposal should seek “to protect the competitive process by which disruptive firms challenge the status quo.”15 These passages hint at disruptive innovation, but do not fully develop the analysis. For one, the Commission misunderstands disruptive innovation by linking it with competition “for the market.” In the case of gatekeepers within the meaning of the DMA, competition for the market would be very difficult to achieve, since gatekeepers have fully exploited the characteristics of core platform services to build a quasi-unassailable position. There is little hope for a new search engine to outperform Google, for a competing social network to oust Facebook or for an alternative online commerce and retail platform to outcompete Amazon.
The more likely scenario is not frontal competition, but rather sideways competition, where a core platform service is side-lined and made less central for users (competition “on the market”).16 Such sideways competition usually involves disruptive innovation in the technical sense – as introduced by Christensen and then updated by Gans17 – namely an innovation where the incumbent firm is caught off-guard and punished despite doing what made it successful. Disruptions are never frontal assaults: they involve a shift in the value network binding consumers to a given product space, or in the dominant architecture used by suppliers on that space. We witnessed a number of disruptions in the digital economy in recent years, usually with positive implications for competition policy. So it is that Google heralded the rise of Internet-centric computing, which turned client operating systems (such as Windows) into a sideshow. Then Facebook turned a social media platform into an alternative portal to search engines such as Google, limiting the impact of Google’s dominance. The rise of smartphones – led by the iPhone – not only reshuffled the market for mobile devices but also made computers less central, thereby reducing the impact of dominant positions in CPUs, for instance.
If disruptive innovation does not involve frontal competition and blindsides incumbents, can these incumbents do anything to avert it? Possible defensive strategies include trying to prevent potential disruptors (to the extent they can be detected) from gaining a foothold – as Microsoft did when it saw the threat emerging from Netscape in the 1990s – or acquiring potentially threatening firms to throttle any disruption.18
By now it has become clear that the Facebook/Instagram and Facebook/WhatsApp acquisitions were textbook cases of the latter strategy, as the recent US state-level and FTC antitrust case against Facebook indicate.19 The DMA proposal picks up on strategic acquisitions with its obligation to inform the Commission about intended concentrations but it is a relatively weak provision.20 In combination with the new Guidance on Case Referrals to the Commission,21 it could become a clever workaround to the notification thresholds. However, even if the Commission could eventually review these strategic acquisitions, they remain a blind spot in the current merger control law. Many questions remain unaddressed, such as which theory of harm would justify blocking such acquisitions, and which standard of proof should apply (balance of probabilities or balance of harms).
As for the defensive exclusionary strategy, even if the disruption analysis is not developed in the DMA, some of the obligations could help to keep gatekeepers vulnerable to disruption: they include the obligation to keep advertising markets transparent, to provide data to users and to allow for data portability, to refrain from MFN clauses and steering and to offer access to search engine data to third-party search engine.22 It is apparent from the rationale and the wording of these obligations that they are meant to support frontal competition with the core platform service in question. Yet these obligations can also provide cover for a disrupting innovator to come close enough to the gatekeeper, so that the disruptor can use its position as a stepping stone to shift the value network or the dominant architecture.
By way of illustration, the obligations relating to data portability, or to the availability of data generated by and through the activities of business users,23 could be used to enable a frontal competitor to Google, Facebook or Amazon – however unlikely – to survive by feeding on the data obtained from such gatekeepers via its users. But these obligations – depending on how they are specified in practice – could also be used to funnel data to an innovative entrant that would try to disrupt the value network or the dominant architecture: hypothetically, business users may for instance transfer the data they obtained from Amazon to a provider of a platform dedicated to second-hand sales and trades, local sourcing or ethical sourcing, that could disrupt online retail if successful.
For the sake of completeness, it should be added that disruption could also conceivably come from an innovator in a complementary product around a core platform service (Scenario 1), where this product would evolve from a mere complement into a disruptive offering. Such was the case, for instance, for Netscape’s original web browser, which started as a complement to an operating system such as Windows (enabling it to open up to the World Wide Web). Later it became an existential disruptive threat, triggering an anti-competitive reaction from Microsoft in order to protect its position. The obligations that surround Scenario 1 can therefore protect not just sustaining innovation on a core platform service, but also open up a path to disruption.
 
DMA and Innovation
Putting it all together, the DMA would be meant to affect innovation as follows. First, it seeks to preserve the innovation incentives of the users of core platform services, so that they can deliver innovative offerings of the incremental type, by way of complementary products within the platform ecosystem and thus of sustaining innovation (Scenario 1 above). Second, as far as the contestability of core platform services is concerned, the DMA proposal seems focused on enabling frontal competition with the gatekeepers (Scenario 2 above). It is questionable whether this is a realistic perspective, and how significant an innovation this would generate. Third, it could be argued that, in trying to safeguard innovation Scenarios 1 and 2, the DMA proposal is also opening some paths for inventive rivals to attempt disruption, either by starting from a complementary offering or by staking a market position close to the gatekeeper and using it as a springboard.
Thus, the DMA proposal leaves as many paths open as possible to innovative firms. This may be the best policy choice given the inherent unpredictability of innovation.24 Fairness (defined as equality of opportunity) and contestability (defined as reducing entry barriers on and around core platform services) would then be shorthand for a regulatory objective of keeping markets open and competitive as much as possible. Seen from that angle, the DMA would fit within a revamped version of the ordo-liberal tradition that still underpins much of EU competition law and economic regulation.25 This ordo-liberalism for the 21st century would have dynamism and innovation at its core, as the main reason why markets should be kept open and competitive.26 Seen from that angle, the DMA will not kill but rather promote the diversity – and hopefully the level – of innovation in Europe.

Two Republican lawmakers are pressing the Justice Department and the Pentagon to reopen a probe into conflicts of interest between Amazon ex-employees and consultants and the government architects of a Department of Defense’s (DOD) US$10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing program.
Sen. Mike Lee (Republican – Utah) and Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado), leaders on antitrust subcommittees in their respective chambers, sent letters on May 4 to Attorney General Merrick Garland and acting Defense Department Inspector General Sean O’Donnell as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking for information, documents and, in the case of the Justice Department, a probe into possible anticompetitive behavior on the part of Amazon Web Services.
“We are concerned that Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets relating to government and/or commercial cloud computing services by improperly influencing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process,” Senators Lee and Buck wrote.
The letters were released on May the Fourth because of the date’s memetic association with the Star Wars saga, Lee indicated in a hashtag of a tweet promoting a Wall Street Journal article on the allegations.
The letter to Garland and the letters to Bezos and O’Connell detail allegations of interference by former defense officials with ties to Amazon that were the subject of a DOD OIG investigation and circulated in press reports after the JEDI request for proposals was released and before the eventual award to Microsoft in Oct. 2019.

One of the EU’s most senior competition officials of recent years is joining Clifford Chance as an adviser, the latest in a series of moves that have seen top former regulators jumping to elite law firms. 
Cecilio Madero, who in a more than three-decade long career at the EU rose to be deputy head of the European Commission’s antitrust division, and briefly its acting head, will join the firm in Brussels in September. 
He worked on some of the EU’s largest antitrust cases of recent decades, including a probe into Microsoft in the 1990s and London Stock Exchange Group’s US$27 billion acquisition of data and trading business Refinitiv. 
His role will be part-time at Clifford Chance, where he will offer advice on different areas of competition law, including merger control, litigation, cartels, and State aid. “Cecilio has been at the heart of many of the world’s most significant and high profile antitrust matters over the past two decades, helping the European Commission lead the globe in antitrust policy and enforcement,” said Thomas Vinje, co-chair of Clifford Chance’s global antitrust practice, in a statement seen by the Financial Times.
Madero stirred controversy in June 2020 when he used a letter published in the Spanish media to call for the resignation of the country’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez for mismanaging the economy. Officials in Brussels investigated the episode and said Madero’s views did not represent those of the EU. Madero retired from the EU in September.

Valve, the owner of popular video game distribution platform Steam, is facing a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging its product’s dominant market share allows the company to charge excessive fees and hurt game developers’ incomes.
The complaint, filed by Wolffire Games in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, said Valve knowingly generated a monopoly and engaged in “predatory, exclusionary, and anticompetitive conduct, including but not limited to market-wide price controls, coercion of disloyal publishers, and defacto tying.
Wolffire is also taking issue with the way Valve allows Steam keys to be sold elsewhere. The team says Valve mandates that most Steam keys are sold directly through the Steam Store itself, and “blocks or threatens” publishers who try to sell Steam keys on non-Steam platforms. Wolffire says that even for those keys sold via other platforms, Valve “imposes punitive contractual restrictions” that means these sales don’t constitute meaningful competition. 
In summary, Wolffire thinks Valve’s perceived monopoly over the PC gaming market is unfair, and wants to punish the Bellevue gaming giant for its high commission rates
Wolffire isn’t the only studio taking up arms against these commission rates. Earlier today, Microsoft announced its intention to increase Microsoft Store revenue share for developers from 70% to 88%.

499,"April 29, 2021",Identifying the Market In the Facebook Antitrust Case,"
By: Herbert Hovenkamp (ProMarket)
In late 2020, the Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust suit accusing Facebook of monopolization. Every antitrust case claiming an unlawful monopoly must identify a “market” that the defendant is monopolizing. Past defendants often produced a single, readily identifiable product such as aluminum ingot, cellophane, or Intel-based computer operating systems. Often, parties dispute the boundaries of these markets. For example, should the cellophane market be broadened to include wax paper and tin foil? Or should the operating system market in Microsoft be broadened to include Apple’s operating system?
Facebook has generated a different kind of dispute, however, which is that the grouping of products it offers is not a “market” at all. A fundamental proposition of economics since the nineteenth century is that markets are made up of close substitutes. Competition occurs inside a market because it defines the range of a customer’s choices. For example, we say that three gasoline stations in a two-block area are in the same market. Customers can choose among them, so they must compete for that customer’s business. A station fifty miles away is not in the same market if it is not a realistic option, nor is a grocer that is nearby but does not sell gasoline.
The FTC claims that Facebook monopolizes a market for “personal social networking services.” That includes services that are quite dissimilar, however. For example, Facebook offers general messaging, two-party chatting, posting of photographs and videos, discussion boards, a marketplace and digital advertising, and even a kind of dating platform. Facebook moved to dismiss the case by stating that the FTC “has not alleged a plausible relevant market.”  A similar issue is likely to arise in the Google antitrust case, as well as a potential future case against Amazon. To date, the lawsuits against Apple have focused mainly on its control of app sales through its Appstore.
So what binds Facebook’s diverse assembly of products into a “market”? Facebook’s individual services are clearly not close substitutes for one another. Further, many firms offer individual services that compete with one of Facebook’s services. For many of these, Facebook is not the biggest. For example, it is not the biggest messaging app, platform for hosting photos or videos, or even digital advertising platform. This is also true of Amazon, which has less-than-dominant market shares in most of the individual products that it sells, save ebooks….

500,"April 26, 2021",Seven Lessons for Inclusive Antitrust from Feminist Foreign Policy,"
Inclusive antitrust – the idea that antitrust should be deliberately focused on hearing from and serving everyone – aspires to make antitrust better by improving data inputs, options, and outcomes. An inclusive antitrust policy may encompass a spectrum of options for how antitrust and its drivers are shaped and deployed to achieve healthy competition with minimal unintended negative ancillary effects. In laying out and considering these options, Feminist Foreign Policy – already the official government foreign policy of Canada, Mexico, France, Luxembourg, the European Parliament, and Spain – presents lessons for inclusive antitrust. The lessons gleaned provide steps that can be undertaken in both the near and long terms, from leadership to process to data use – and could not be timelier in light of calls for antitrust and competition law reform and upheaval taking place around the world. Feminist Foreign Policy provides guideposts to improve antitrust policy by offering principles in expanding information and data that can contribute to more effective analysis.

The British government has ordered an investigation of Nvidia’s proposed US$40 billion acquisition of UK-headquartered chip designer Arm. The country’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will prepare an initial report on the takeover by the end of July, which will cover potential national security issues, as well as competition and jurisdictional issues created by the deal.
“I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,” the UK’s digital secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement. “The UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.”
An Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC, “We do not believe this transaction poses any material national security issues. We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal.”
Earlier this year, the CMA invited third parties to comment on the merger ahead of a formal antitrust investigation. That investigation will probe the deal’s possible effects on competition in the UK.
In February, US federal regulators opened an investigation into the purchase while soliciting information from third parties. 
A consortium made up of Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm among others, reportedly asked antitrust officials to intervene in the sale, Bloomberg reported. At least one of the companies wants the deal “killed.”

502,"April 12, 2021",Open Banking in Brazil: A “Disruptive Step” Towards the Increasing of Competition in the National Financial Sector and Consumers’ Welfare?,"
Following an upward trend in the global agenda for digital-driven economies, Open Banking has emerged as a hot topic in Brazil. Since 2018, the Central Bank of Brazil has been playing a major role to stimulate debates and foster initiatives aimed at developing a national Open Banking framework as a measure with the potential to add new features and change the course of the Brazilian financial sector, so as to pave the way for a more competitive, efficient, innovative, transparent and inclusive financial system able to better address customers’ needs, besides empowering them with control over their personal data. However, in order to secure positive effects on both the national economy and society at large, the implementation of a suitable framework in Brazil requires that the protection of personal data, the financial awareness and the privacy rights remain at the foreground of the design of Open Banking products and services.

I. THE ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OPEN BANKING IN BRAZIL, IN A NUTSHELL
Open Banking has emerged as a worldwide agenda regarding the financial sector and is a buzzword when discussing policy frameworks to promote competition among financial players.2
As a matter of fact, the Brazilian landscape reflects this take. In recent years, both regulatory and competition authorities and customers have witnessed the consolidation of the national financial sector ...

503,"April 4, 2021","All Things Are Possible with Antitrust — CALERA, Capability Standards, and Looking to Europe to Reinvigorate U.S. Antitrust Enforcement","

By Joseph V. Coniglio1
 
Introduction 
It is becoming a truism to say that competition policy is at an inflection point both in the United States and around the world. For the past forty years, two major trends have driven political economy, each with major implications for antitrust law. The first is rapid technological change, and the resultant unprecedented gains in dynamic efficiency that have enabled the rise of large technology companies that are now scapegoated by an ever growing number of commentators, academics, and policymakers as representing the failure of the consumer welfare standard that has long guided antitrust law. The second is globalization — and, with respect to antitrust policy, the unequivocal failure of the consumer welfare standard to drive any sort of international consensus, with the European model being far and away the dominant player globally among the more than one hundred countries that have created competition regimes over the past few decades. The United States’ view is clearly the minority one.
Whereas the post-World War II order was once commonly seen as the triumph of Anglo-American liberalism — if not also the final form of world history — recent events in U.S. antitrust policy suggest that the European or “ordoliberal” model of neoliberalism may now be ascendant even in the United States, the land where both antitrust law was born and the consumer welfare standard once enjoyed, up until recently, a wide consensus among the antitrust cognoscenti. Known as the Competition and Law Enforcement Reform Act (“CALERA”),2 rather than reflect a wooden application of either the neo-Brandeisian neo-structuralism or the economic paternalism of some progressive academics, the most important legislative proposal for U.S. antitrust reform in recent history, in its most important respects, endorses the ordoliberal paradigm developed in Europe after World War II to prevent a return of fascism and construct a new liberal economy, and which has persisted in an evolved form within European competition law jurisprudence.
 
The Two Reform Movements 
Over the past several years, as the drumbeat for antitrust reform has continued its crescendo, commentators have largely adopted a bifurcated model for conceptualizing the paradigms such reforms might embody.3 Standing in for Scylla are the neo-Brandeisians, who for each of the monster’s heads name a socio-political goal that antitrust law should help bring about, and unabashedly call to eliminate the consumer welfare standard as the lodestar of antitrust enforcement.4 At bottom, their approach resurrects the older structuralist paradigm — hitherto relegated to the dustbin of antitrust history — in the name of protecting democracy and (positive) economic liberty, and elides any distinction between harm to competitors and harm to competition: conduct that is responsible for even the most de minimis increases in concentration can constitute an antitrust offense.5 For all its purported popularity, the neo-Brandeisian reform at bottom puts new wine into old bottles, with every indication being that both will perish.6
The Charybdis of the antitrust reform movement has taken the form of a economic paternalism, advocated largely by a congeries of wonks and academics.7 Far from eliminating the consumer welfare standard, these commentators would double down on technocratic antitrust policy by both embracing a behavioral view of antitrust in lieu of the neoclassical assumptions of rationality reflected in the consumer welfare consensus, and — at least in some areas — would open the Pandora’s box of using antitrust law as de facto regulation, such as through the elimination of a price-cost test to find a firm’s pricing behavior unlawful.8 That is, whereas the neo-Brandeisians fail to grasp the distinction between harm to competitors and harm to competition in favor of a myopic focus on the former, the progressive paternalists in effect do the same in favor of the latter — empowering antitrust law to proscribe conduct untethered from any harm to the competitive process.
 
Ordoliberalism 
As a theory of competition policy, ordoliberalism — the cousin of American neoliberalism9 — has proven somewhat difficult for American commentators to get their heads around, with some claiming that its role in European competition law has been overstated.10 Forged in the ashes of Europe after World War II, the ordoliberal paradigm represented an attempt to use competition law to create a liberal market order that approximated the atomistic ideal of the classical economists as a third way alternative to laissez faire capitalism and socialism.11 For early ordoliberals, market power was the central evil in a market economy, and the purpose of competition policy was to act as a disempowering force to protect the individual autonomy of market participants. To this end, ordoliberals promoted a standard under which firms were required to act “as-if” they were in a competitive market, whereby “performance competition” that benefitted consumers was permitted, but “impediment competition,” which was injurious to rivals, was prohibited.
Notwithstanding the undoubted influence that the economic approach embodied by American neoliberalism and the consumer welfare standard has had on the development of European competition policy, the latter remains broadly consistent with the core ordoliberal framework. And, to be sure, it is a straw man to suggest — as some do — that on the ordoliberal view harm to competitors is not necessarily sufficient to show harm to competition. To be unlawful, the conduct must also be “capable of restricting competition,” which can take the form of naked restraints, restraints otherwise unlawful by object, or those that are found to be capable of restricting competition by virtue of their effects.12 As such, the European approach represents a deviation from the consumer welfare standard not, as is sometimes surmised, by failing to distinguish harm to competitors from harm to competition, but by its causation standard — a capability, rather than the but-for or likelihood standards.13
 
A Third Way Again?
So understood, the ordoliberal-European model, as evolved, represents a third paradigm for U.S. antitrust reform that is both distinct from and, in some respects, more nuanced than either the neo-Brandeisian or the progressive economic proposals. Unlike the neo-Brandeisians, with their knee-jerk policies and reactionary rhetoric, the ordoliberal model is careful not to deem conduct that increases market concentration as unlawful in and of itself, but only when there is the capability that competition will be restricted. In making this determination, the ordoliberal-European model can readily avail itself of economic analysis, especially when applying a by effect rule to evaluate business conduct. Moreover, with its emphasis on consumer choice — as opposed to the neo-Brandeisians’ fixation on market structures — it shares the consumerist orientation of the American model, albeit from a more deontological or “rights based” perspective, rather than the utilitarian or welfarist one that typifies American neoliberalism and U.S. antitrust policy.14
Consistent with this rights based framework, the ordoliberal-European approach also differs greatly from the paradigm of the progressive economists in light of its emphasis on harm to the competitive process, as opposed to a technocratic maximization of consumer welfare. Here again, the case of predatory pricing is instructive. Whereas for the progressive economists, the price-cost test is seen as an intent-focused test that is unnecessary to determine real world effects on consumer welfare, the European framework makes the price-cost test, as a measure for determining whether a firm has competed on the merits, the bedrock of its predation jurisprudence: pricing below average variable cost is per se unlawful, and pricing above average variable cost but below average total cost is unlawful if part of an exclusionary scheme, of which intent — another non-welfarist measure of the merits of a firm’s behavior, as opposed to actual effects — is an important factor.15
 
The Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act
This ordoliberal lens, much more so than the theories of the neo-Brandeisians or the progressive economists, puts CALERA into its clearest focus. Introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, CALERA is careful not to commit the neo-Brandeisian error of striking the consumer welfare standard from antitrust jurisprudence and treating the distinction between harm to competitors and harm to competition as one without a difference. And, to be sure, while CALERA’s elimination of the below-cost pricing and prior course of dealing elements for predatory pricing and refusals to deal rules respectively are a thinly veiled nod to the progressive economists, its most far-reaching and general proposal is to formally change the causation standard for finding that mergers and exclusionary conduct harm competition to an “appreciable risk”16 — which, like the European “capable of restricting competition,” is a potentiality standard that could do much to lessen the importance of empirical economics within current antitrust practice.
Put simply, while validating the program of the progressive economists with respect to certain rules dealing with species of unilateral conduct, the antitrust framework CALERA endorses appears to be, for all practical purposes, the European one: mergers or unilateral conduct that harms rivals will be unlawful if they create a meaningful risk, or are capable, of harming consumers, which will presumably one day expressly be interpreted to include reductions in “consumer choice.”17 Indeed, over the past few years, high level policymakers have been not so quietly emphasizing how capability causation standards already exist within existing U.S. law, specifically for causation in monopolization cases.18 The key precedent is U.S. v. Microsoft, where the D.C. Circuit found Microsoft’s conduct to be unlawful because it was merely “reasonably capable” of harming competition.19  While this standard has a limited application presently,20 enacting CALERA would effectively generalize it to cover all mergers and exclusionary conduct, and thus in a rather Fabian fashion radically transform the consumer welfare standard without abandoning it — precisely the sort of thing, it should be noted, of which the consumer welfare revolutionaries have been increasingly accused.21
 
How Much Is Possible?
Viewed in this way, CALERA has important implications for both a reinvigorated U.S. antitrust enterprise and global competition policy. The question of just how much potential for competitive harm conduct must have to be unlawful is a tantalizing one for antitrust theorists and metaphysicans alike. And clearly the law rightly imposes bounds.22  Indeed, one of the most obvious problems with potentiality standards is that they fail what was once more broadly known as the “scholastic tag”: ab esse ad posse valet consequentia, a posse ad esse non valet consequentia.23 Put simply, conduct that only may harm competition also might not. While it is true that under Microsoft a merger between a monopolist and nascent rival might be condemned on the grounds that it is reasonably capable — or rather “creates an appreciable risk” — of harming competition, in cases where this competition is for next-generation, rather than existing, products, it may prove to exceed the bounds of the antitrust laws.24
Viewed as an endorsement of the European model, adoption of CALERA would constitute a major development in international antitrust by virtue of signaling a shift toward moving U.S. competition policy more in line with that in Europe, and raising the possibility of bridging the transatlantic divide in competition policy and approaching international convergence — a feat that was at best economic pie in the sky even at the height of the Washington consensus. Amidst ongoing efforts by the Biden administration to facilitate economic cooperation with Europe, including in antitrust,25 seeing CALERA as a step toward a more European competition policy cannot but take added significance as cohering with a broader geopolitical strategy on the part of the United States — despite the fact that European efforts to curb large technology companies are clearly trending toward more regulatory solutions, rather than a doubling down on competition tools.26
 
Conclusion
As the most significant proposal for antitrust reform in decades, CALERA will no doubt prove to be a topic of much discussion within the broader antitrust community as calls for reform continue to grow louder from both sides of the political aisle. Notwithstanding some similarities with the programs of both the neo-Brandeisians and progressive economists, its most wide reaching change of adopting an “appreciable risk” causation standard to evaluate mergers and unilateral conduct is best viewed as an endorsement of the ordoliberal-European approach and its “capable of restricting competition” framework. To the Foucauldian observer, rather than embody a hard break with neoliberal competition policy, CALERA may thus foreshadow merely a replacement of the American model with the European one. Moreover, the question of how potential harm to competition can be and still fall under the antitrust laws raises somewhat thorny and unresolved issues that the antitrust community may have to carefully analyze in the years ahead.27

Lawyers for Alphabet’s Google and the government tangled on Tuesday, March 30, over how many documents related to the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against the search and advertising giant should be turned over, and how fast.
In a status conference before Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department’s Kenneth Dintzer said Google had balked at delivering some older documents, dating to the early 2000s. He also said that third parties, which could include Microsoft and Apple, had delayed responding to government subpoenas until they got a subpoena from Google – which slowed that process down.
“Broadly speaking, it’s going slowly,” he said, reported Reuters.
For Google’s part, John Schmidtlein, who argued for the company, said they would send some subpoenas to third parties this week and next.
He also said that Google had produced some 250,000 documents, the equivalent of 1.4 million pages, and that another 200,000 were being prepared for delivery to the government.
Judge Mehta told the two sides that if they had specific disagreements, he could jump in but they needed to resolve the larger issues.
The Justice Department has been pushing Google to produce documents on a long list of topics related to its lawsuit, which accuses the company of breaking antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses.

505,"March 19, 2021",In Comity We Trust: Utilizing International Comity to Strengthen International Cooperation and Enforcement Convergence in Multijurisdictional Matters,"
Competition authorities across the world have taken increasingly divergent enforcement approaches, including in respect of the conduct of companies involved in the high technology and digital markets. New regulatory developments may further accentuate such divergence, increasing the risk of inefficient and conflicting regulatory efforts. With these trends, there is a greater need for competition authorities to advance international cooperation efforts and convergence on enforcement, particularly when enforcers with sufficient parallels in competition laws and enforcement principles are involved. This article proposes that the application of international comity principles would helpfully promote international cooperation and convergence on multijurisdictional enforcement, creating a “win-win” for competition authorities and the respondent businesses subject to competition scrutiny in the form of consistency, predictability and efficiency. In advancing this thesis, this article proposes five considerations where international comity can helpfully promote international cooperation and enforcement convergence in multijurisdictional matters.

Targeted at Big Tech, Section 19a of the Competition Act, Germany’s new antitrust tool for dealing with large digital platforms, rebalances power in favor of the German competition authority. Under the new tool, the authority may declare that a firm is of “paramount significance for competition across markets” and prohibit it from certain specified practices presumed to be unlawful. The addressed firms carry the burden of proving the practice’s countervailing procompetitive or efficiency-enhancing effects. Decisions by the German competition authority under Section 19a can only be challenged at the German Federal Court of Justice as the first and only avenue of appeal. We identify the advances and shortcomings of this new tool, as well as the opportunities and risks, when it comes to employing it in the field.

Germany is one of the countries at the forefront of these developments. On January 18, 2021, the German legislature finally adopted the Tenth Amendment to the German Competition Act2 (“Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen”), which includes a number of legal changes aimed at protecting competition in times of digitalization.

510,"February 28, 2021",Judge Tells Google Lawyers To Work Out Document Dispute,"


A federal judge hearing a US government antitrust case against Google urged the lawyers to work out a complicated dispute on pre-trial document production among themselves, reported Reuters.
The Justice Department has been pushing Alphabet’s Google to produce documents on a long list of topics related to its lawsuit, which accuses the company of breaking antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses.
Google has balked at some of the production, describing some requests in a court filing as “overly broad.”
The Justice Department’s lawyer, Kenneth Dintzer, said that the government needed Google’s help in crafting a list of search terms that would be used to find relevant documents, saying that people in the company would use nicknames for certain topics, like writing “Redmond” instead of “Microsoft.” Microsoft, a Google rival and critic, is based in Redmond, Washington.
In the end, US District Judge Amit Mehta issued no order but urged the two sides to sort out the disagreements, saying that the government needed to figure out what it wanted and Google needed to help it write search terms to find that data.
“I just don’t know any better way to do that… but to continue hammering at this,” he said.
The Justice Department’s lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google’s search and search advertising. That federal case has been combined with an antitrust case brought by states for pre-trial matters.
The state case, which was filed in December, also accused Google of seeking to extend its dominance to devices like speakers, televisions, and even smart cars.

511,"February 25, 2021",Match. com Pulled Into Battle Between Apple And Epic Games,"


More technology companies are joining either side of the legal battle between Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, and Apple, with PC games giant Valve being the latest firm to get caught up in the melee, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, February 25.
The fight came to a head in August 2020 when Fortnite was pulled from the iOS App Store in a feud between Epic Games and Apple over user agreement terms.
Epic is looking to get testimony from online-dating company Match Group, the owner of Tinder and other apps, and from a former Apple executive, the Journal reported. Epic’s lawyers are planning to question Apple CEO Tim Cook.
Apple has subpoenaed numerous tech companies — Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Amazon.com, Samsung — and recently subpoenaed Valve, according to a court filing. Valve, however, has challenged the iPhone maker’s demand for six years of Steam sales and other data.
Apple maintains that Valve’s sales data holds vital information that could help its case with Epic Games. Valve stated that it’s private financial information. Valve competes against Epic’s digital PC games storefront.
“Apple has, for lack of better words, salted the earth with subpoenas to other participants in the market,” Judge Thomas Hixson told Valve’s lawyers on Wednesday, February 24, per the WSJ. “So don’t worry, it’s not just you.”
Apple was originally requesting data from 30,000 games available on both Epic and Valve’s digital stores. It is now asking for information from 436 games, including Grand Theft Auto V. Valve stated it would be a monumental task for its 350 employees to get all of the data.
Epic Games filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in the European Union. The Fortnight creator said there should be a more balanced playing field for developers and consumers. The complaint accuses Apple of snuffing out payments and other competitors by instituting restrictions.

512,"February 8, 2021",The Necessary Revival of Sherman Act Section 2,"
The application of the antitrust laws to single-firm behavior is challenging. On the one hand, neither courts nor government enforcers are well equipped, or even inclined, to micro-manage a single firm’s choice of suppliers, customers, distribution strategies, or product bundling, even if that firm is a monopolist or otherwise dominant. On the other hand, firms with substantial market power can inflict serious economic harm. For many years, the difficulty of controlling exclusionary practices led to the de-emphasis of Sherman Act Section 2 cases. But in recent years, as the harms from single-firm exclusionary behavior have become more apparent, in the big tech world and beyond, there has been a resurgence of interest in Section 2. This essay argues that the antitrust laws are indeed capable of effectively addressing practices that sustain market dominance, and it encourages renewed attention to, and use of, Section 2.

Recently, the term “gatekeeper” has featured prominently in policy discussions concerning whether “big tech” needs to be regulated and whether antitrust laws need to be reformed to better protect consumers from their market power. Consequently, this Article asks: what exactly is an online gatekeeper? Within that discussion, it also asks whether the term is useful within antitrust. Next, it discusses some general guidelines that should be considered when determining whether an online service qualifies as a gatekeeper. Finally, it discusses potential concerns with gatekeepers that go beyond the standard litany of antitrust theories of harm — namely, information asymmetries and representations made to users and businesses.

In the 1990s, the typical path to the Internet was a subscription to America Online (“AOL”) using a dial up modem on a Microsoft Windows computer. AOL was, at the time, the dominant online presence and offered what was commonly referred to as a “walled garden” — providing email (who can forget the notification “You Got Mail”), messaging, and website access for an hourly and, later, monthly fee.2 A walled garden is an online ecosystem where the provider exerts considerable control over the content including restricting access to non-approved content.3 The emergence of broadband internet access (such as, DSL and cable modems) and standalone web browsers, such as Netscape, began to change that ...

The allegedly entrenched positions of certain dominant companies in the digital economy and the alleged inability of antitrust enforcement to prevent potential anticompetitive conduct by these firms have led several European jurisdictions to consider an overhaul of their competition policy approach. A common theme is giving competition authorities or newly created digital agencies the power to regulate firms with gatekeeper status. This article discusses the criteria that have been proposed in the EU, UK, and Germany for identifying the firms, or gatekeepers, that are to be subject to such regulation. It also highlights advantages and disadvantages of different approaches as well as challenges for practitioners in their implementation, and discusses some potentially far-reaching consequences due to inconsistencies in the proposed criteria across jurisdictions.

The U.S. House Report on digital markets suggests adopting important changes to U.S. antitrust law. If implemented, the proposed changes (particularly those related to unilateral practices) would bring U.S. antitrust law closer to EU competition law, by lowering the burden of proof and expanding existing prohibitions. Yet, the experience from the EU suggests that the proposed reforms are unlikely to provide an adequate solution for the problems identified with digital markets. In December 2020, the European Commission presented a proposed text for the Digital Markets Act, a regulation that seek to ensure “contestable and fair” digital markets. The regulation stems from the explicit recognition that even a broader competition law regime, such as the one available in the EU, cannot address the problems with big tech. One could thus question whether expanding U.S. antitrust law is likely to provide an adequate relief in dealing with the problems described in the House Report.

Microsoft-backed Graphcore has objected to Nvidia’s US$40 billion acquisition of Arm Holdings, according to a key member of the British chipmaker’s early development.
Hermann Hauser, who helped to create Arm in 1990, told CNBC that Graphcore has opposed the deal in a “major submission” to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.
“If Nvidia can merge the Arm and Nvidia designs in the same software then that locks out companies like Graphcore from entering the seller market and entering a close relationship with Arm,” said Hauser, who is an investor in Graphcore through his venture capital firm Amadeus Capital.
A spokesperson for Nvidia, which is planning to buy Arm from Japanese tech giant SoftBank, described the deal as “pro-competitive” on Wednesday, February 3. Arm did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Graphcore isn’t the only tech firm that has objected to the transaction. Local chipmakers in China including Huawei have urged Beijing to try to block the deal over fears that they could be at a disadvantage if Arm ends up in the hands of a US company.
The deal is now being investigated by regulators around the world. The EU and the UK are set to open “in-depth competition investigations” into the deal.

Five gamers filed an antitrust class action law suit accusing Valve of forcing developers to list the same prices for their games as in other stores. The suit alleges that this destroys competition.
Valve, whose game distribution service Steam controls 75% of all PC sales, is on the verge of a new trial. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the five gamers accuse the company of requiring developers and publishers to enter into a “Most Favored Nations” (MFN) clause.
It’s the part of the Steam Distribution Agreement that doesn’t allow developers to set lower prices for their games on other platforms. It means that the price of a PC game on Steam should be the same as on any other online store.
“The Steam MFN also hinders innovation by creating an artificial barrier to entry for platforms,” the lawsuit reads. “If this market functioned properly — that is, if the Steam MFN did not exist and platforms were able to compete on price — platforms competing with Steam would be able to provide the same (or higher) margins to game developers while simultaneously providing lower prices to consumers.”
The plaintiffs think that Valve’s policy doesn’t allow platforms like Microsoft Store or Epic Games Store to price games lower. The lawsuit also alleges that it prevents new stores from entering the market.

As a staunch Trump ally, former Attorney General Bill Barr will be remembered for a lot of things. His role in the redaction, and then subsequent disclosure, of the Mueller report and his interventions in cases involving Trump associates spring to mind. However, perhaps his legacy will be something entirely different, with wider ramifications for citizens across the globe, far beyond the Washington political bubble.
Under Barr’s watch, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) initiated a major lawsuit against Google in October for alleged violations of US competition law. Announcing the action, Barr said this was “a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.”
The DoJ’s case has been taken in conjunction with 11 state Attorneys General (including the likes of Florida, Georgia and Texas). It is a civil antitrust lawsuit which alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies through anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets.
The significance of the DoJ’s action cannot be underestimated. Google is one of the wealthiest corporations on the planet with a market value of over US$1 trillion. In announcing the action, Barr threw down the gauntlet to Google saying the “lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google’s grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist.” He compared the lawsuit with the historic antitrust actions taken against AT&T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998…

In the United States, the leading providers of fixed broadband service are different from the leading providers of mobile broadband service. In recent years, however, a trend known as “fixed/mobile convergence” has caused this line to blur. The major cable companies have launched mobile services that they now sell to customers located within their network footprints. Meanwhile, the major wireless providers have begun offering fixed services over their wireless networks and hope to improve the quality of these services as wireless technology advances. This article provides an overview of these new categories of services and their implications for broadband competition. It then considers the analytical framework that would apply to a merger between a fixed broadband provider and a mobile broadband provider in light of the changing competitive landscape.

Most consumers purchase two types of broadband Internet service. “Fixed broadband” allows the user to access the Internet from home, and “mobile broadband” allows the user to access the Internet from a mobile device. In the United States, the leading providers of fixed broadband are different from the leading providers of mobile broadband. Cable companies sell approximately 70 percent of fixed broadband subscriptions nationwide, while three major wireless providers — Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T — sell around 98 percent of mobile broadband subscriptions.2

The “legacy” communications industries — plain old telephone service, fixed and mobile broadband access, cable and satellite video distribution — afford two useful teachings for a way forward in the Google search engine antitrust case, including a way past the conundrums presented by the complaint filed against Google by the Department of Justice. First, be careful not to throw out the baby of the competition you want with the bathwater of the exclusivity arrangements you do not like.

After all, Google search queries need a pipe to travel from us, the hopeful searchers toiling on our computers, tablets or smartphones, to Google servers.

This paper analyzes the development of a “tight oligopoly on steroids” in the communications sector. It uses Business Data Service as an example because it represents a new choke point in the sector. The other services in the “tight oligopoly” include wireline and wireless, cable and set top boxes, and broadband. Using antitrust concepts in the Merger Guidelines the paper argues that high levels of concentration are reinforced by geographic separations, technological specialization, and product segmentation to magnify market power. The paper also uses Alfred Kahn’s discussion of the justification for regulation to explain the long and successful dual jurisdiction (antitrust and regulation) used to control the pervasive market power in the sector. The paper concludes by showing how the concepts and recommendations can be applied to the digital platforms (search and social media), in which an even worse “tight oligopoly on steroids” exists.

522,"January 26, 2021",“Privacy Fixing” After Texas et al v. Google and CMA v. Google (Privacy Sandbox): Approaches to Antitrust Considerations of Privacy,"

By Tim Cowen, Claire Barraclough & Josh Koran1
 
Executive Summary
Societies have designed antitrust laws to protect consumers from unfair practices (e.g. exclusive dealing, price fixing, abuse of dominance and restraint of trade) by ensuring competition drives business rivals to innovate, thus providing consumers with a greater choice of suppliers to address their needs. This paper discusses the practice of “privacy fixing” and how antitrust laws apply to that activity.
We describe the issue of “Privacy Fixing” as raised in Texas v. Google and discuss potential approaches to considerations of privacy as an antitrust issue with reference to the current UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) investigation into Google’s Privacy Sandbox2. We examine three examples of unfair practices regarding the misuse of data privacy policies that may expose organizations to antitrust liability, namely exclusionary abuse, exploitative abuse, and collusion.
 
Introduction
Before addressing the recent Google antitrust cases, let us first define the issue of “privacy fixing.” Privacy fixing can arise in situations of individual firm action where a dominant organization unilaterally acts to use privacy to exclude rivals from a market or to limit the extent and degree of privacy choice available to its rivals. Alternatively, a number of businesses can agree to restrict or limit consumer choice, either directly by reducing their terms of trade with relation to privacy, or otherwise by jointly limiting competition that might offer people the choice of a differing level of privacy.
In 2017, Benjamin R. Dryden & Shankar Iyer reviewed the issue of privacy fixing and predatory privacy under U.S. law, in an article published in the leading online competition journal “Competition Policy International.” As the authors put it “Protecting privacy may seem so obvious a social good that any comparison with price fixing looks silly.” However, “the antitrust laws apply to non-price elements of competition like privacy policies. The Supreme Court has made clear that “for antitrust purposes, there is no meaningful distinction between price and non-price components of a transaction.”3 For these reasons the antitrust rules have been applied “even to public safety rules by private standards-setting organizations.”4
That paper reminds readers that collusion between competitors is “the supreme evil of antitrust” and accordingly antitrust law treats classic collusive activity, like price fixing, bid rigging, or customer allocations, as illegal per se. This means that these kinds of collusive activities have “such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect, and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit, that they are irrebuttably presumed to violate the law.”
Before continuing it is necessary to define the form of “privacy,” which underlies these antitrust concerns. Privacy regulations define “personal data” as information associated with identifiable individuals.5 This information poses higher privacy risks when it is directly associated with people’s offline identity. Privacy regulations state that organizations can reduce the privacy risks for people by instead associating the same information with only a pseudonymous identifier.6 A pseudonymous identifier is one where the organization processing the personal data has appropriate technical and operational processes in place to keep the identifier distinct from people’s directly-identifiable identity.7 Dryden & Iyer discussed likely theoretical examples of privacy that could raise antitrust liability and whether it could be considered per se illegal, quasi criminal, or subject to a rule of reason analysis under U.S. antitrust.
Now we have real world examples. Two independent antitrust investigations, in the United States and the United Kingdom, now raise the privacy fixing issue. On December 16, 2020, Texas’ Attorney General announced that it, along with nine other U.S. States, had filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google.8 The case is neither the first nor last lawsuit against Google to be announced in the U.S., with USA v. Google making headlines in October,9 partly for the surprising extent of the collaboration it revealed between Google and Apple. Colorado’s Attorney General filed another multistate lawsuit on December 17, 2020 covering similar, but not the same, ground. The Texas case focuses on a new aspect, given revelations about collaboration between Google and Facebook and the sharing of WhatsApp data between Google and Facebook.
One allegation made against Google in the Texas case is that “it restricts information to foreclose competition and advantage itself.” Within this, Texas argues that Google “uses privacy concerns as an excuse to advantage itself over its competitors,” even where its “entire business model is to collect comprehensive data about every user in the service of brokering targeted ad sales.”10 The Texas pleading cites evidence from Google’s internal documents, including Google’s proposal to eliminate third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, which “is justified on privacy grounds, but the effect is to increase information asymmetries between Google and its competitors.”11 The documents available to Texas appear to evidence individual firm action – a kind of exclusionary abuse of dominance by Google vis-à-vis Google’s competitors.
Contrary to Google’s assertion that its actions protect people’s privacy, Texas also refers to the fact that Google “violates users’ privacy in other egregious ways when doing so is convenient for Google.”12 Moreover, the complaint goes on to state that “Google actively coordinates with its competitors when it comes to privacy,”13 raising the further question of whether coordination between competitors in relation to privacy terms or policies could constitute anticompetitive collusion, or even a cartel-esque offence. In respect of this, the complaint states: “Of course, effective competition is concerned about both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the quality metric of privacy – one might call it privacy fixing – underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.”14
On January 8, 2020, the CMA announced a formal investigation of the 23 proposed changes to Google’s Chrome and Chromium Browser engine that Google announced on August 22, 2019 under the heading of the “Privacy Sandbox.”15 That investigation is concerned with Google’s unilateral action, the effect of the announcement, and the proposed changes on the market, specifically the negative consequences for publishers, marketers, and others affected relative to the benefits that inure to Google from these changes. The CMA had, during the course of 2019, conducted a wide-ranging Market Investigation which investigated these browser changes among other practices and obtained evidence from many sources. The conclusion of the Market Investigation was to propose new legislation to remedy the situation of dominant gatekeeper platforms’ abuse of dominance, which the Government is now working to enact. 16
One Google document the Market Investigation brought to light discloses the financial impact on publishers of Google’s browser changes, which is particularly relevant to the new investigation. That document discloses that if implemented, just 1 of Google’s 23 proposed changes would likely lead to catastrophic loss of revenue for publishers and, after the impact of the pandemic, the impact on funding for many web publishers and a plurality of the media in the UK could be devastating. A key graph drawn from Google’s publicized research on this topic estimates the impact on publisher revenues from removing interoperable data, which disproportionately impacts smaller players.17 If Google followed through on its change, they estimate approximately 75 percent of the worlds’ largest publishers would lose more than 50 percent of their revenues.
  This internal Google document further bolsters the CMA’s observations that a 70 percent loss in advertising revenues could be suffered by publishers if the announced browser changes were implemented.18 The disproportionate impact on smaller publishers is particularly concerning, given these not only represent a large number of minority voices, provide diversity of opinion, and support the plurality of the media, but also because such an impact would threaten future competition from new rivals by raising barriers of entry to the web publishing ecosystem. An application has now been made to the CMA for interim measures to prevent this from happening and is being considered in the current investigation.19
Let us review three antitrust considerations raised by privacy fixing in the Texas case below.
 
Privacy as a Factor in Competition Cases 
Price and non-price factors of competition are the basis on which consumers make purchasing decisions, and are factors that are routinely taken into account by antitrust authorities when examining those decisions and competitive rivalry among firms. Among the non-price factors antitrust regulators routinely consider are reductions in product quality, variety, and service.20 The United States Supreme Court has also determined that non-price factors deserve protection under antitrust laws.21 Whether privacy is an important non-price factor will depend on the product in question. In traditional goods and non-digital markets it is, however, hard to see situations where privacy is a key component of many purchasing decisions.22
Privacy is more likely to be a component of purchasing decisions in online markets. One early EU case in which this issue arose was Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp. Users of messaging services were, arguably, attracted to WhatsApp’s messaging service and flocked to use its offering in their millions on the basis that it was entirely private and highly secure; and provided groups of people a method for competing with Facebook groups or messenger services and other messaging apps. All were free to the user at the time23, and one clear competitive differentiator between offerings was privacy, given the lack of privacy protection in Facebook’s terms of trade. WhatsApp accumulated 400 million users before being bought by Facebook for over $22 billion. The merger was alleged to be anticompetitive at the time and given Facebook’s notorious compliance record on privacy protection, concerns were raised that Facebook was “taking out” a fast-growing competitor and would degrade the privacy protections offered by WhatsApp over time.
The case was the subject of numerous complaints before EU member states and U.S. authorities’, and eventually the EU Commission.24 The Commission in that case accepted that the degradation of privacy policies could affect other aspects of product quality, or amount to an increase in the “price” paid by consumers for the product (e.g. in terms of requiring more personal data to be provided). The precedent was established that:
“In two-sided markets, where products are offered to users for free and monetised through targeted advertising, personal data can be viewed as the currency paid by the user in return for receiving the ‘free’ product, or as a dimension of product quality.”25
After Facebook gave assurances that WhatsApp users’ private data could not technically be combined for the use of advertising, the merger was allowed. While it allowed the merger, Facebook’s later breach of its undertaking earned it a fine of over $100 million for misleading the Commission,26 and the case became notorious when a UK House of Commons Select Committee released documents that showed Facebook senior executives knew they were taking out a rival competitor at the time.27  Facebook has now announced in January 2021 that it will use personal data gathered in WhatsApp for its advertising, but will not allow third-parties to advertise in this inventory.28  This undermines one of the three rationales the Commission relied upon in allowing the original merger, namely that “a number of alternative providers would continue to offer targeted advertising after the transaction, and a large amount of internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes not within Facebook’s exclusive control would continue to exist.”29   Moreover, the Commission found that, contrary to Facebook’s statements in the 2014 merger review process, the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook and WhatsApp users’ identities already existed in 2014, and that Facebook staff were aware of such a possibility.
Unsurprisingly, the fact that privacy protection can be a major factor in customer’s preferences and hence in online competition has been followed in subsequent cases.30 Whether privacy is important to consumers decision making will depend on the product and market concerned. For example, in Microsoft/LinkedIn the Commission considered that data privacy is “a significant factor of quality” in the market for Professional Social Networks.31
 
Misapplication of Data Privacy Policies that Cause Exclusionary Abuse 
The Dryden & Iyer paper above presents a hypothetical example of a dating app which has decided to match competitor’s privacy policy or commitment not to monetize user data for advertising, a decision “motivated by a predatory, monopolistic desire to injure its smaller rivals, rather than a bona fide decision to honor its users’ privacy.”32
In the example they provide, two competitors rely on privacy policy not to improve their service, but instead to reduce competition, given new entrants would not have a scaled user base to support their operations using a direct payment business model. In their example, since advertising revenues can reduce direct cash payments by website visitors, by agreeing to eliminate this revenue model this would raise the prices consumers would need to pay. Essentially, in the example, the dominant dating app is using privacy as a non-price factor of competition to undermine future competition. Such behavior conducted by a dominant supplier that may “create a barrier to entry that inhibits the growth of the new entrants” is likely to be anticompetitive and predatory under U.S. law. The paper cites the leading U.S. antitrust case of Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp, 472 U.S. 585 (1985), where it was found that when a firm “attempt[s] to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency, it is fair to characterize its behavior as predatory.”33
Another example of such behavior, in the digital space, can be found in Texas v. Google where it references the attempts by Google to claim that changes to its Chrome browser are privacy protecting, but which are, in reality, exclusionary of advertising rivals. Essentially, platforms such as Google, which themselves have relied on data monetization to grow, are pulling up the drawbridge behind them. The Texas complaint cites the example of Google’s announcement that it will remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser.34 That action will limit the ability of competitors to Google’s advertising business to access the data needed to optimize the matching of adverts to people across different websites. This negative impact to other publishers is not in dispute, as evidenced in Google’s publicized research.35 It also suggests that the motivation behind the change is designed to reduce competition. The CMA investigation into Privacy Sandbox is assessing how Google’s proposed changes would further concentrate more revenues into Google’s hands to the detriment of competition.36
One potential solution to the issue of exclusionary abuse in the provision of data would be providing access to that data by competitors. The French Autorité de la Concurrence dealt with this issue as long ago as 2014 in the GDF Suez case.37/sup>  The measures requested by the complainant included ordering GDF Suez to give competing suppliers of natural gas access to customer data including the customers’ names, addresses, telephone numbers, and consumption profiles. Such data were private and protected under the French Loi Informatique et Libertés but that did not prevent the Autorité from ordering GDF Suez to grant access to the data, subject to consumers’ consent. In line with the recommendations made by CNIL (the French data protection authority), the Autorité required GDF Suez to inform its customers that competitors would be able to request access to their personal data and they had the right to refuse such access. Another solution would have been to provide access to anonymized data, which falls outside the scope of the GDPR, or to pseudonymized data.
The CMA has proposed such a solution in its Market Investigation38 and it may be forthcoming in the anticipated UK legislation designed to underpin its new Digital Markets Unit. This risk of exclusionary abuse is a just one issue of privacy fixing antitrust authorities should consider in relation to online digital markets.
 
Misapplication of Data Privacy Policies that Cause Exploitive Abuse 
In digital markets, where data is so important for monetization through advertising, there is a tension between companies’ incentives to acquire as much personal data as possible about consumers and incentives to respect consumer privacy. Where subject to competitive constraints, one could expect that companies which stray too far one way or the other will suffer. If they gather too much sensitive data that frequently causes privacy harms, consumers who worry about these risks will seek alternatives and switch away from privacy invading firms so the privacy invaders revenues will suffer. However, in the absence of such competitive choice people may find themselves subject to exploitive abuse.
In competitive markets where offerings are vying with each other to provide greater levels of privacy in return for the service supplied, privacy could be a key differentiator in people’s choices over which services to use. Thus, when competition exists, much depends on the actions and choices of end consumers. Some consumers may be willing to share personal data with a trusted supplier in return for specific services; others may not.  Different levels of sharing may be offered for different levels of service – and competitive rivalry acts to spur innovation.
Indeed, we have some evidence of digital services that compete in this manner. Duckduckgo is a rival search engine to Google’s dominant search service, which differentiates itself by not collecting an individual’s prior search activity to personalize search results.  Both search services have access to the same website data, but essentially compete on privacy. A second example is Brave Browser that offers its users that it alone will collect their personal data and monetize publisher properties without sharing any non-aggregated personal data with marketers. Given this browser is a white-label version of Google’s dominant Chrome browser, Brave essentially is using data sharing with marketers as the principle differentiator. Neither of these alternatives have attracted significant users, which suggests that a majority of people are perhaps not concerned with the exchange of non-sensitive personal data for cost-free access to web services. However, the market context is one of a market that has been dominated and distorted for many years and is not fully competitive. On any analysis, combinations of price and privacy protections are possible, are likely to be better made and reflect consumers real choices in competitive markets than in markets controlled by advertising-funded monopolies. In markets that are funded by advertising, without the constraint imposed by competition, there is an incentive on the monopolist to harvest more sensitive private data if by doing so it can achieve greater numbers of sales and increase profits, even at the expense of consumer privacy.
One leading commentator, Dina Srinivasan, has highlighted this issue in relation to Facebook in both a New York Times article,39 and a longer academic paper.40 She cites Facebook, when it was a start-up, committing to consumers that it did not and would not use cookies “to collect private information from any user,”41 essentially using privacy as a competitive differentiator. Over time Facebook rowed back on the plan. Facebook now gathers a considerable amount of consumer data, including through third party cookies across the internet.42 Since the early 2000s, Facebook has seen its competition diminish, either through the demise of rivals such as MySpace or Bebo, or through acquisition of nascent competitors, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. In “2014, Google announced that it would fold its social network Orkut. Emboldened by the decline of market threats, Facebook revoked its users’ ability to vote on changes to its privacy policies and then (almost simultaneously with Google’s exit from the social media market) changed its privacy pact with users.”43 As competition dwindled, by agreement or otherwise, Facebook began collecting more consumer data. As Srinivasan puts it, “the price of using Facebook has stayed the same over the years (it’s free to join and use), but the cost of using it, calculated in terms of the amount of data that users now must provide, is an order of magnitude above what it was when Facebook faced real competition.”44
Google also changed its stance over the collection of personal data after it acquired DoubleClick. Unlike most digital advertising which marketers evaluate through analysis of consumer behavior after measuring exposure across multiple digital properties, marketers value Search advertising by the immediate click event on a single property (a search engine). For this reason, prior to Google’s expansion into other forms of digital advertising that followed its DoubleClick acquisition, Google differentiated its offering by not collecting and storing personal data associated with its search solutions. In 2007, Google’s VP of product management for advertising was quoted as stating Google was not stitching together a user’s various online actions in one profile.45 This executive stated, “Nothing is stored, nothing is remembered. It all happens within that session.”46 After the DoubleClick acquisition, this same executive announced Google would store user web interactions in a profile to optimize the matching of content to people based on their past actions:
“At Google, we believe that ads are a valuable source of information — one that can connect people to the advertisers offering products, services and ideas that interest them. By making ads more relevant, and improving the connection between advertisers and our users, we can create more value for everyone. Users get more useful ads, and these more relevant ads generate higher returns for advertisers and publishers. Advertising is the lifeblood of the digital economy: it helps support the content and services we all enjoy for free online today, including much of our news, search, email, video and social networks…. We think we can make online advertising even more relevant and useful by using additional information about the websites people visit. Today we are launching “interest-based” advertising as a beta test on our partner sites and on YouTube. These ads will associate categories of interest — say sports, gardening, cars, pets — with your browser, based on the types of sites you visit and the pages you view. We may then use those interest categories to show you more relevant text and display ads.”47
The CMA has recently found that most consumers, when surveyed, indicate that they are concerned about their privacy online.48 It can be inferred, therefore, that consumers would, in a competitive market, switch from Facebook, but to what? In a paradigm where there is not, in most cases, a realistic alternative, as competition in social media is limited, consumers are not currently being protected by market forces.
Of course, given that a defining property of social networks is that they depend on the sensitive personal data of identity, a more competitive market might provide people choice to have their cost-free access subsidized via advertising, but ensure that their digital activity is not linked by the social network to their identity via this advertising.
The CMA itself has put forward a proposal that would both address user needs for protection of privacy and identity and allow advertisers with a pseudonymous ID sufficient for allowing ads to be tailored and relevant, and enable the online marketing and advertising industry to measure the performance of ads across multiple websites.
 
“Privacy-Fixing” Under EU as well as U.S. Competition Law
The examples above reference the issue of privacy in competitive offerings and the issues that have come up in mergers, collusion and unilateral behavior. Both the Texas complaint and the Dyden & Iyer paper explicitly discuss the concept of “privacy fixing,” as a non-price factor that can remove consumer choice either directly by reducing privacy, or by limiting competition. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that even companies acting unilaterally “to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end” is against the public interest.49
The Texas case also reveals that Google may have agreed with Facebook to give it an advantage in advertising markets and between them the parties have taken steps to limit the data that they share with other players.
Under EU and UK law, if competitors were to agree to reduce or limit the level of protection for users’ personal data in their terms or quality of competing offerings, as with an agreement to limit their prices, their conduct would be prohibited in the EU as an anticompetitive agreement within the prohibition of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), and in the UK under Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998. Such an agreement would be similar to an agreement to reduce or limit the quality of the parties’ products. For instance, in the Belgian Association of Pharmacists case, an agreement to restrict suppliers from producing products of a different, inferior, standard (thus limiting the variety of products supplied) has been found to infringe Article 101(1).50
Thus, privacy fixing is an important non-price factor that organizations should consider, along with factors of controlling price, supply, quality, service, and reductions in innovation, to avoid potential liability from activities that may expose them to potential antitrust violations. Similarly, the exchange of information between competitors about planned changes to their privacy policies may violate competition law if it would remove the uncertainty as to their future conduct and, thereby, eliminate the risk of independent competitive conduct on a market.51
 
Coordination Between Online Ad-funded Platforms
Texas v. Google refers to agreements between Google and Facebook that came to light since the House of Commons DCMS select committee investigations of Facebook, which released documents showing that Facebook trades with others and accumulates data from other online businesses on a non-reciprocal basis.
The Texas complaint now goes further and alleges that Google and Facebook not only discussed privacy, but also signed an exclusive agreement in 2015 under which Facebook shared WhatsApp data with Google.52 The timing of that 2015 agreement is remarkable in light of the Facebook/ WhatsApp acquisition since Facebook notified the acquisition in 2014 and informed the EU Commission that it would be unable to establish reliable automated matching between Facebook users’ accounts and WhatsApp users’ account data. It stated this both in the notification form during 2014 and in a reply to a request of information from the Commission. However, in August 2016, WhatsApp announced updates to its terms of service and privacy policy, including the possibility of linking WhatsApp users’ phone numbers with Facebook users’ identities. All the while it now appears that Facebook perhaps not only had access to that information but had agreed to provide information to Google. This is not an issue on which the record is entirely conclusive, but it could be expected to be a matter of some interest to a curious authority.
Google and Facebook both offer very limited privacy protections in their end user contracts. Rather than relying on pseudonymous identifiers (that most of their smaller rivals rely on), both companies offer marketers content targeting based on matches of this directly-identifiable data. There is presently no evidence of any direct agreement between them to take such an approach, but the Texas case refers to evidence that in their dealings with each other they share user data so obtained to their mutual benefit. The extent of their coordination may become clearer as the Texas case progresses.
 
Collusion in Collective Agreements and Standards-making Involving Data Privacy Policies
The concern about competitors meeting and discussing prices goes back centuries. As the well-known quotation goes:
 “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”
Adam Smith eloquently stated the above in The Wealth of Nations Book 1 Chapter X.  it is often repeated as the reason that antitrust authorities maintain vigilance over gatherings between competitors.  A few examples of agreements and collaboration that involve privacy issue are provided below.
In Dryden & Iyer’s dating app example, two competing dating apps hypothetically agree to forego monetization revenue in order to create a barrier to entry preventing new competitors from entering the market at sufficient scale to benefit from network effects in the markets they operate in.
As described above, privacy fixing can, like price fixing, be collusive activity which restricts competition among products and firms and would be condemned by antitrust laws on both sides of the Atlantic. Companies making agreements or arrangements with each other about information sharing, can similarly be guilty of illegal collusion to achieve anticompetitive outcomes.53  In Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1 (1945), the U.S. Supreme Court held that prohibitions on newspaper members of the Associated Press against sharing real-time events was an antitrust violation of the Sherman Act, even though the Associated Press had not achieved a complete monopoly.
Another potential method of privacy-fixing posited by Dryden & Iyer is collusion through an industry body, standards body, or trade body. Indeed, they argue that “the most likely target for a privacy fixing or predatory privacy claim might well be a standards-setting organization or trade association that tries to adopt a best privacy practice or a rule of ethics for an entire industry.”54
Standards bodies, sit within a kind of safe harbor from an antitrust perspective, generally regarded as beneficial or enabling different but complimentary activities to interoperate provided that the standards created are competitively neutral. If such bodies are used for collusion and are not involved in standards-creation or the standards are not competitively neutral, there could well be a breach of the antitrust laws.55
Google has, for example, stated publicly that its proposed changes to its browser, labelled the Privacy Sandbox, are being discussed in W3C groups.56 These proposals are arguably intended to allow Google to collect and process people’s personal data, on terms that it determines, but restrict or limit the accuracy and timeliness of the data provided to all of its advertising rivals. By impairing the interoperable data that smaller publishers rely on, Google inherently forces publishers and advertisers to become even more reliant on its own technology.
Cursory investigation reveals that such discussions are not taking place within standards-making groups of the W3C, but rather in business groups that do not have any standard-making capacity. Facilitation of exclusionary and anticompetitive abuse, as alleged by Texas v. Google via such a medium, is potentially made worse by the fact that the discussion involves all the major players in the industry.
While Facebook/Google coordination appears in the Texas case, Google/Apple coordination is at the center of USA v. Google. That case highlights cross-platform coordination between Apple and Google to an extent that has not previously been appreciated. It is well known that Google has been the exclusive provider of default search on all Apple devices for many years.57 It is also well known that Apple has been pursuing a walled-garden strategy of “there’s an app for that” – within its enclosure for many years. According to USA v. Google, Google has a bigger walled garden, containing more apps, and 90 percent of apps on Android are downloaded through Google Play.58   Although denied by Google, USA v. Google refers to emails and evidence that appear to show that Google and Apple jointly pursue profit maximization to their mutual benefit:
“120. Apple’s RSA incentivizes Apple to push more and more search traffic to Google and accommodate Google’s strategy of denying scale to rivals. For example, in 2018, Apple’s and Google’s CEOs met to discuss how the companies could work together to drive search revenue growth. After the 2018 meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.”59
The sentiment echoes the statements made by companies operating within more traditional cartels.60 Nevertheless, the fact that senior execs have met and discussed a range of topics and that one employee thinks the vision should be to work together as one company may not in itself be sufficient to support a claim for any anticompetitive collusion. If Google’s strategy is similar to Apple’s, and now Google is adopting browser changes to “encourage” publishers to become apps on its walled garden, that may not involve collusion or collaboration with Apple; it might simply be that they have independently worked out that reducing rival publishers’ access to interoperable data makes walled gardens more attractive to marketers, and that app stores provide more control over the market for web content and services.
Whether or not there is a coordinated strategy between Apple and Google, or Google is merely following Apple’s lead in making browser changes, may be a matter of further investigation in the DOJ case, and the Texas case, or if they are consolidated.61
This use of collusion in collective agreements or standards making is a third example of “privacy fixing” that the antitrust authorities should consider in relation on online digital markets.
 
Conclusions
As is clear from the above review, the antitrust considerations related to the misuse of data privacy policies are potentially very significant. As ever, much depends on the facts and the markets in question, and on the extent and degree of choice available to end users.
Antitrust regulation is built upon the notion that consumers ought to have sovereign choice in competitive markets, given this choice drives rivals to innovate to better meet those consumers’ differing needs. Societies are harmed when organizations conduct practices that significantly undermine these market forces, even when such organizations offer some countervailing benefit. Given the idea of consumer sovereignty is central to the operation of most antitrust laws, whether by individual monopolistic action or by agreement, the usurping of consumer choice is and should always be a concern for the authorities. In this article we have referred to three examples: exclusionary abuse, exploitative abuse, and collusion. All usurp consumer choice.
As digital markets are more and more important to society, maybe it is now time to add privacy to the list of other factors, such as prices, that are not a matter for legitimate discussion among competitors.

523,"January 24, 2021",Google Paying For News In Australia Is “Inevitable”  Says Treasurer,"


Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it’s “inevitable” that Google and other tech behemoths will have to eventually pay for using media content, responding to the internet giant’s threat to disable its search engine in the country if it’s forced to pay local publishers for news, reported Bloomberg.
Google stated Friday, January 22, that a proposed law, intended to compensate publishers for the value their stories generate for the company, is “unworkable,” opposing the requirement that media companies pay for displaying snippets of articles in search results.
As Google escalates a months-long standoff with the government, Frydenberg said Australia could either be a “world leader” in pushing for the code or wait to follow others in passing similar legislation.
“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if the legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said.
The threat is Google’s most potent yet as the digital giant tries to stem a flow of regulatory action worldwide, but such a radical step would hand an entire developed market to rivals. At least 94% of online searches in Australia go through the Alphabet unit, according to the local competition regulator. 
Still, Google’s market share puts the company in a position to boost revenue in other businesses to make up for higher costs.
“The company’s product lead in search over rivals such as Yahoo, Microsoft’s Bing and DuckDuckGo makes it unlikely that advertisers and publishers could move to competitor platforms for driving referral traffic in the near- to medium-term,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Matthew Martino. “The company could offset this by raising ad prices and by lowering traffic acquisition costs paid to mobile network carriers.”

524,"January 20, 2021",The ACCC’s Continued Digital Inquiry: Online Private Messaging and App Stores,"
By Felicity McMahon & William Georgiou (Allens)1
 
I. Introduction
Concern from consumers, businesses, governments and antitrust regulators about the growing power of digital platforms, their increasing ubiquity in all facets of public and private life, and their impact on competition and data privacy continues to grow globally.
The circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for businesses to operate digitally and serve their customers through digital means.2 As businesses “pivoted” to operating and serving customers in a digital way, the importance of the architecture of our digital economy became acutely apparent. A future in which all businesses are “digital” necessitates reflecting on how digital platforms shape our markets and society, and what regulatory and policy responses might be required to deal with the challenges created by the increasing role that digital platforms play in our supply chains, as well as our daily lives, both business and personal.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) continues its examination of developments in digital platforms issues through its ongoing Digital Platforms Services Inquiry 2020-2025 (DPSI).3 The DPSI follows the ACCC’s original Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (DPI Final Report), released in July 2019.4
The Australian Government’s direction to conduct the DPSI provides the ACCC with an extensive remit to examine, among other things, the impact on competition and consumers of internet search engine services, social media services, online private messaging services, digital content aggregation platform services, media referral services, and electronic marketplace services.5
This article summarizes the key findings and implications of the ACCC’s first DPSI interim report covering “online private messaging services” (Messaging Report).6 It also considers the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its next DPSI interim report covering app stores (App Store Report),7 relevant international antitrust cases and the public submissions received in response to the App Store Report’s issues paper.
  
II. The DPSI Messaging Report (October 23, 2020)8
The focus of the ACCC’s Messaging Report was on competition and consumer (including privacy) issues associated with online private messaging services. The Messaging Report also updated the findings reached by the ACCC in its original DPI Final Report in relation to social media and search services.
The impetus for the ACCC’s focus on messaging services in this report no doubt relates to the COVID-19-related uptake of these services, with the ACCC remarking upon releasing its Messaging Report that it “shows how the use of online private messaging services has grown significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as workplaces and schools moved to remote access and people sought alternatives to face-to-face communication.”9
The ACCC’s findings included:

Online private messaging services: Facebook (through its Messenger and WhatsApp services) and Apple (through its iMessage and FaceTime services) are among the largest suppliers of standalone online messaging services in Australia. The ACCC found that Facebook’s large user base gives Facebook a significant competitive advantage and a degree of freedom from competitive restraint when compared with Apple and smaller suppliers of standalone messaging services.
Key data and privacy concerns: The ACCC reported that data collection, use, and disclosure practices by messaging services raised concerns. The ACCC recognized that broad disclosures about these practices (e.g. via privacy policies or T&Cs) were unclear and did not provide sufficient information to enable consumers to understand what data was collected about them and how data would be used/sold to third parties (and who these third parties were).10 While the ACCC is not Australia’s privacy regulator, it is taking enforcement action for data and privacy-related issues through Australia’s consumer protection laws in circumstances where it considers there have been misleading data collection and use disclosures made to consumers.11 The ACCC has also shown a willingness to address data and privacy-related issues in its assessment of competition matters, most recently in its ongoing assessment of Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit.12
Market power in advertising, search, and social media services: The ACCC considered that an increasing number of consumers were choosing search platforms on the basis of privacy protections (e.g. DuckDuckGo). However, despite some shifts in consumer behavior and some instances of new entry and expansion, consumers continue to spend a large proportion of their time on Google and Facebook services. Google is by far the largest search services provider with over 95 percent of supply of search services in Australia, and Facebook/Instagram are the most used social media platforms. The ACCC observed that Google’s and Facebook’s dominance also translates to an increasing share of online advertising expenditure, and it explicitly noted that Google and Facebook both continue to have substantial market power in search (Google), social media (Facebook) and online advertising services (both Google and Facebook).13
Potential consumer harms across these services: The ACCC considered that increased tracking and profiling of consumers by platforms and third parties (including data from private messaging services, mobile apps, websites, video games, etc.) has a range of potential and actual harms. These harms ranged from decreased consumer welfare and privacy to increased discrimination and exclusion.

The ACCC considered that consumers’ online activity is extensively tracked by Google and Facebook. This includes tracking via Google and Facebook software development kits installed in third party apps, and consumer data collection via voice assistants and other new technologies (e.g. Google Assistant). This data is often sensitive and includes, for example, location information, audio recordings, and personal health data. The ACCC outlined concerns that consumers have a limited understanding of the consents they give to allow their data to be used and aggregated and their online activity to be tracked. As discussed above, similar competition concerns regarding the aggregation and potential use of data (in this case, health data) have arisen in the ACCC’s ongoing review of Google’s potential acquisition of Fitbit.

Potential small business harms across these services: Small businesses are increasingly reliant on the advertising services provided by platforms like Facebook and Google. The impact of sponsored posts and advertising searches impacts the ability of businesses to organically reach customers. Small businesses that rely on digital platforms to reach customers often have to accept disadvantageous default terms, including broad discretions to suspend/terminate accounts or to remove content, and terms that seek to limit a small business’ ability to dispute these issues.

The report characterized both Google and Facebook as having a substantial degree of market power in relevant advertising markets, acting as “gatekeepers” controlling access to digital advertising services which small businesses require.14 In relation to alleged concentrations of market power such as this, the ACCC has raised concerns with the ability for it to intervene in markets using Australia’s competition laws. For example, ACCC Chair Rod Sims recently recognized “you cannot rely on competition laws alone to stop or deal with all the adverse consequences from a growth in market power.”15 In order to fill this perceived gap, the ACCC continues to advocate for changes to Australia’s consumer protection laws. This includes reforms to Australia’s unfair contract terms regime to make such terms illegal and give courts powers to impose penalties for their use,16 and for the addition of a broad ‘unfair trading practices’ prohibition (e.g. on business models that are arguably oppressive or exploitative).17

Emerging trends including platforms expanding their ecosystems: The ACCC noted that large platforms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon continue to expand their ecosystems by acquiring businesses and developing new products and services. While this is obviously not inherently illegal and can (in certain cases) result in efficiencies, innovation, and increased competition, the ACCC recognized that “[w]here a platform occupies a strong gateway position and acquires a business in a related market, the platform may have the ability and incentive to harm downstream rivals through high fees or restricted access.”18 Like the UK Competition and Markets Authority,19 the ACCC expressed concerns that expansion into adjacent markets by these platforms entrenches their incumbency and provides them with further opportunities to gather consumers’ data.

The Messaging Report’s findings also generally reiterated the consumer protection and privacy law recommendations that the ACCC previously made in its DPI Final Report.
  
III. The forthcoming DPSI App Store Report (due March 31, 2021)20
A. The Issues Paper
To inform the ACCC’s App Store Report, the ACCC released an Issues Paper seeking feedback from interested stakeholders to understand the extent of any competition and consumer issues with respect to app store markets (Issues Paper).
The ACCC’s focus for this report is on “mobile apps” and their related app stores (i.e. not app stores generally, such as on gaming consoles or personal computers). The ACCC defined ‘mobile apps’ as software applications that are downloaded onto, and run on, a mobile operating system such as on a smartphone, tablet, smartwatch or smart car.21
At the outset, the ACCC recognized that the two major app stores were the Apple App Store (for Apple mobile devices running Apple’s “iOS” operating system) and the Google Play Store (for mobile devices running Google’s “Android” operating system).
The ACCC stated that “[w]hile there are various app stores or marketplaces, app sales are dominated by the Apple App Store, for iOS, and the Google Play Store, for Android devices.”22 It referred to estimates that in 2019, consumers spent around $54 billion USD on the Apple App Store and around $29 billion USD on the Google Play Store.23 The ACCC also noted that 99 percent of smartphones globally use either the Apple iOS or Google Android operating systems.24
Some of the key issues the ACCC sought to understand in its Issues Paper included:25
how Apple’s and Google’s various roles as the key suppliers of app stores (but also simultaneously as app developers, operators, and licensors of their mobile operating systems and device manufacturers) affects the ability of third-party app developers to compete, including the impact of app store fee structures on rivals’ costs;
terms, conditions, and fees (including “in-app purchases” (IAP)) imposed on businesses to place apps on app stores. In particular, app developers offering “digital goods and services” are required to use Apple’s or Google’s proprietary IAP systems. These developers are also charged a 30 percent commission by Apple/Google for each transaction through the IAP system;
how app stores determine whether an app is allowed on their app store, and the effect of this on app providers, developers, and consumers; and
how the app search, display and ranking system works on an app store and whether being “featured” on an app store is important to an app’s success.
The ACCC’s Issues Paper also sought to understand substitutability and potential market definitions with regard to app stores. For example, question three asked about the extent to which app developers could bypass the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to distribute apps; question five asked about the extent to which app developers list apps on different marketplaces; and question eight asked about the extent to which web-versions of mobile apps are substitutes for their mobile version counterparts.
Consistent with the Messaging Report and DPI Final Report, the ACCC also highlighted in the Issues Paper that it sought views on the collection and use of consumer data by app store providers (e.g. Google and Apple) and app developers, as well as whether consumers are provided with adequate disclosures about these practices and can control the data that is collected about them.
B. The International Context
The key issues canvassed in the ACCC’s Issues Paper closely follow those aired in a variety of private litigation cases, regulatory investigations and inquiries.
For example, Epic Games is litigating against Apple and Google in the U.S. after its video game app, Fortnite, was removed from both the App Store by Apple and Play Store by Google. This was, alleges Epic Games, in response to Epic Games allowing Fortnite users the option to use Epic Games’ own IAP system on Apple and Android devices.26 There are also a number of class actions on foot against both Apple and Google regarding the IAP and 30 percent commission requirements.27 Epic Games recently instituted proceedings against Apple in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging that Apple misused its market power by restricting developers from creating rival app stores on iOS and by requiring that developers use Apple’s own proprietary IAP system.28
The European Commission is also investigating complaints against Apple from a number of complainants, including Spotify, an e-book distributor, and an audiobook distributor. These complaints allege that the 30 percent commission distorts competition.29
The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) published a report into mobile app stores, outlining developer concerns that a 30 percent IAP commission is excessive, particularly when fees of 2-3 percent can be found in alternative financial services.30 The U.S. House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust also examined these issues, among a variety of others, in its investigation into competition in digital markets (the House released its report on October 7, 2020).31
C. The Submissions in Response
The ACCC received a number of submissions in response to the Issues Paper. The table below briefly summarizes key points from some of these submissions:32



Apple submission
Apple considered it brought innovation and competition to apps through the App Store. Apple outlined that its focus is on device sales such that it has an incentive to promote a rich app ecosystem. Apple’s submission generally referred to privacy and data security as central to its various practices, including its app store review process, and restrictions which do not allow rival iOS app stores to compete with the App Store.Apple defined an app store market broadly, arguing that all app stores compete with Apple’s App Store, including app stores managed by Android device manufacturers (called “OEMs”) (e.g. Google, Samsung, Oppo, Huawei, etc.), those on desktop computers, notebooks, televisions, cars, game consoles, etc. Apple also argued its App Store competes with web-apps and websites.
Apple argued that its proprietary IAP system was necessary because it provided a safe purchasing mechanism for consumers and enabled Apple to record sales and collect commissions from developers to fund Apple’s investment in, and maintenance of, the App Store (including developing technology that developers take advantage of, such as development tools). Apple also argued its 30 percent commission, collected through the use of its IAP system, was consistent with industry standards. Apple also noted that developers whose business model depended entirely on advertising and those who sold physical goods and services paid no commission.


Google submission
Similarly to Apple, Google argued that it delivered innovation and competition with the creation of Android and the Play Store.Google noted that Android was an open platform which allowed OEMs and others to create their own app stores which compete with the Play Store.
Google did not appear to consider the relevant market to be as broad as Apple did. Instead, Google suggested the Play Store competed with other mobile app stores, including other Android app stores, Apple’s App Store, and websites and web-apps.
Google justified its 30 percent fee for IAP transactions on the basis that it enabled Google to maintain its investments in the Play Store and the Android ecosystem more broadly. It argued that Google’s IAP system was a safe and secure payment system.


App developer submissions
Submissions included those from Microsoft, dating app provider Match Group, property advertising services provider REA Group and various television and radio broadcasting app developers (and their developer associations).Developers expressed concern with mandatory requirements by Apple and Google to use their respective IAP systems. They considered that the 30 percent commission raises developers’ costs, with REA Group noting it was a significant disincentive to improving its paid app services.
Submissions noted that there was confusion as to when an app would be required to use Apple’s or Google’s IAP systems, arguing there is no clear distinction between apps that provide “digital goods and services” (which must use a proprietary IAP according to Apple and Google) and those offering “physical goods and services” (which do not use a proprietary IAP). Developers disputed the justifications put forward by Apple and Google in this regard.
Submissions also indicated that there were no technical reasons for mandating the use of these proprietary IAP systems for certain transactions over others. Submissions referred to Apple’s decision to allow Amazon to use its own IAP system to deliver digital content as an example of an inconsistency which undermines arguments in favor of such mandatory requirements.
Submissions noted that the app review process for the approval of apps or new content (in updated apps) was opaque and led to inefficiencies and uncertainties for developers. It was suggested that the requirement to use an IAP system and pay a 30 percent commission favored a data-monetization business. Concerns were also raised with the transparency of the app search, display and ranking processes, the app review process and the collection of transaction data by IAP systems that can be used by Apple/Google later to target that particular app segment.


Association submissions
Submissions included those from the Australian Investment Council (AIC), Australian Business Software Industry Association and the Developers Alliance.The Developers Alliance, whose membership includes Google and Facebook, argued that app ecosystems currently work well but a market-driven code of conduct, with dispute resolution and transparency enhancing mechanisms, could be an option to address concerns relating to the lack of transparency in the market (e.g. regarding app rankings or the strategic targeting of app segments by app store operators).
Other associations, such as the AIC, argued that the mandatory IAP and 30 percent commission requirements raise barriers to entry and impact developers’ ability to generate returns and reinvest in their businesses. The lack of transparency with respect to the app review process and the ability for app store operators to self-preference, including in their display rankings, was a feature of these submissions.



It remains to be seen what the ACCC’s response will be to the views canvassed in response to its Issues Paper and concerns raised by the numerous app store-related disputes and inquiries. When the ACCC produces a report following an inquiry, it will usually result in a range of legal recommendations and reforms, as well as some enforcement action (as resulted from the Digital Platforms Inquiry33). The ACCC made a range of recommendations in the DPI Final Report which, among other things, led the Australian Government to request the ACCC develop a mandatory bargaining code for negotiations between Australian news media content producers and Facebook and Google. Legislation for this media bargaining code of conduct has recently been introduced to the Australian Parliament.34
The ACCC could also use the concerns expressed by developers to bolster its advocacy efforts in favor of the introduction of a general “unfair practices” prohibition.35

525,"January 18, 2021",The CCPA and the GDPR Are Not the Same: Why You Should Understand Both,"
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) are milestone pieces of legislation, in major markets, one on each side of the Atlantic. While the CCPA has not had the international impact that the GDPR has and is considered to have been influenced by the latter, it is no “GDPR clone.” The result is that corporations must understand both pieces of legislation and their differences, in order to formulate compliance strategies going forward. In the context of events such as the passage of the California’s Proposition 24, the monitoring of legal developments is likewise of great importance. This study helps in highlighting the extraterritorial effect of both, and certain major differences between the two, as well as noting a couple of important changes to come through Proposition 24.

I. INTRODUCTION
Within less than two years, on both sides of the Atlantic important data privacy laws became applicable — on the one side, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and the other countries of the European Economic Area in 2018,2 and on the other side the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) as amended, in the United States in 2020.3 These two data privacy laws have rightly attracted attention outside the borders of their home jurisdictions, due in part to the importance of the markets they cover, and in part to their extraterritorial effect, co...

526,"January 18, 2021",Consumer Choice and Consent in Data Protection,"
The mechanism of the GDPR limited legal grounds for the collection and processing of personal data, and the narrow and very restrictive interpretation of the same legal grounds runs the risk of limiting consumer choice, instead of reinforcing self-determination. This leads to removing the choice for consumers to pay with their data. The superimposition of competition law with the proposal to introduce dominance into the GDPR analysis is liable to exacerbate this effect by further limiting consumer choice. The GDPR example highlights the risk of introducing general and comprehensive privacy laws for consumer choice: while it reinforces consumer control on their data in general, it puts constraints on self-determination by reducing its choice in terms of features, products or ability to use its personal data to obtain more services.

By Pranvera Këllezi1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Consumer choice and consent go together in data protection, where the consumer has a choice when it consents on how the data are collected and processed. Express or implied, opt-in or opt-out: these requirements are there to qualify consent and consequently determine the choice of the consumer. Granularity of consent gives more choice to consumers on the collection and processing of their data. By contrast, strict conditions on the validity of consent reduce the ability of the consumers to consent and therefore their choices.
Consumer choice between substitute products makes competition work. Consu...

527,"January 17, 2021",Platform Mergers and Antitrust,"


By Geoffrey Parker (Dartmouth College), Georgios Petropoulos (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) & Marshall W. Van Alstyne (Boston University)
Platform ecosystems rely on economies of scale, data-driven economies of scope, high quality algorithmic systems, and strong network effects that typically promote winner-take-most markets. Some platform firms have grown rapidly and their merger and acquisition strategies have been very important factors in their growth. Big platforms’ market dominance has generated competition concerns that are difficult to assess with current merger policy tools. In this paper, we examine the acquisition strategies of the five major US firms—Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft—since their inception. We discuss the main merger and acquisition theories of harm that can restrict market competition and reduce consumer welfare. To address competition concerns of acquisitions in big platform ecosystems we develop a four step proposal that incorporates (1) a new ex-ante regulatory framework, (2) an update of the conditions under which the notification of mergers should be compulsory and the burden of proof should be reversed, (3) differential regulatory priorities in investigating horizontal versus vertical M&A, and (4) an update of competition enforcement tools to increase visibility into market data and trends.

The House Judiciary Committee’s report on big-tech monopoly is in a lot of ways very welcome, and it accomplishes important work. It was a large feat of fact-finding and conceptual foundation-work, and it evidently helped launch or support the pending federal monopolization suits against Google and Facebook. But it also invites the same discouraged fatigue that are the daily bread of anyone who cares about American antitrust. It’s still hard to imagine meaningful correction to the law’s catastrophic misdirection, in a divided America governed by broken institutions.

By Chris Sagers 1
 
The House Democrats’ big-tech monopoly report2 was several things. Measured by length and detail, the Report was above all a fact-finding exercise. Its vast majority — upwards of four hundred pages and more than 2,400 footnotes — consists of very long, meticulous analyses of the conduct of four particular firms. It reads more or less like a complaint in litigation, and indeed, the pending government lawsuits against Google3 and Facebook4 both track it closely. In some respects, the fact-finding work is loose and lacks rigor, for what that may be worth. For my money that includes its routine, unelaborated conclusions that particular firms have market power in particular areas, and its essentially undefended claim that “Amazon has adopted a predatory-pricing strategy across multiple business lines at various stages in the company’s history.”5 But put that aside, beca...

529,"January 12, 2021",The Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets: Looking in the Wrong Forest?,"
The majority staff of the House Judiciary Committee recently released its Report and Recommendations (“MSRR”) following an investigation of competition in digital markets.  It claims that the leading digital technology firms (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook) have acquired and maintained monopoly power by exclusionary conduct, and blames this on alleged narrow vision and weak enforcement efforts of the U.S. antitrust agencies and courts.  The MSRR proposes a near-total revision of U.S. antitrust, restoring the enforcement approaches of fifty years ago when per se rules and structural presumptions were predominant.  Considering that the U.S. is the unquestioned leader in digital technology, and that the EU has far fewer leading digital technology firms but does have antitrust rules very much like those proposed by the MSRR, it seems that both the MSRR’s view of the evidence and the logic of its proposals are questionable.

By Abbott Lipsky, Jr.1
  
U.S. antitrust law has gone through a long evolutionary process of refinement in light of changing business practices and improving understandings of how the economy functions and how it responds to the law-enforcement systems applied to competitive conduct. The Sherman Act contains two very brief and general prohibitions – on “restraint of trade” and “monopolization” – which require interpretation by courts faced with particular forms of business conduct challenged in specific cases...

530,"January 12, 2021",Understanding the House Judiciary Committee Majority Staff Antitrust Report,"
The U.S. antitrust system is undergoing a profound reassessment.  Many events and commentaries have inspired this upheaval.  Among the most important is an inquiry conducted over the past two years by the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. The Report nominally addresses “competition in digital markets,” but its policy agenda is much broader. The Majority Staff proposes to fundamentally redesign basic elements of the entire U.S. antitrust system, not only concepts involving big tech. The Majority Staff urges Congress to repudiate, in whole or in part, fifteen court decisions. The broader implications of these proposals have received little attention. In this essay, we pose questions about the Report’s larger implications in three areas: (1) the restatement of antitrust system objectives; (2) doctrinal changes involving antitrust procedure; (3) doctrinal changes involving antitrust law’s substantive commands. Overall, we worry that the Report, in its abbreviated discussion of doctrinal reforms, has not come to grips with the administrability implications of overriding certain precedents and replacing them with new decision-making principles.

The House Antitrust Subcommittee Report makes clear the weakness not just of competition in the tech sector, but also of competition policy toward the tech sector.  We argue that this is the result of the failure to employ one important tool of antitrust, namely, structural separation.  Economics and experience teach that breaking up such firms is almost surely necessary in order to make the companies focus on serving customers better rather than on handicapping their rivals.  We review the evidence, discuss the alternatives, and provide guidance for how structural separation can be employed in bringing competition to the tech sector.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The House Antitrust Subcommittee has concluded its milestone study of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google with a lengthy report entitled “Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets.” Despite that title, the report is in fact not so much about the weakness of competition in digital markets as it is a report on the weakness of competition policy toward digital markets. After all, the bulk of the report documents the unimpeded rise to dominance of these giants over online search, ecommerce, social media, and advertising, and how this dominance has “diminished consumer choice, eroded innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy, weakened the vibrancy of the free and diverse press, and undermined Americans’ privacy.” Since these object...

532,"January 12, 2021",A Missed Opportunity,"
The House Report assembles a large amount of information about competition in digital markets and will be a valuable resource for those who want to understand the leading digital platforms.  It falls far short, however, of its stated objectives of examining “whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct” and whether existing antitrust laws “are adequate to address those issues.”  As to the former, it does not say what it means by anticompetitive conduct, often fails to examine possible exculpatory explanations of the conduct and documents it discusses, and does not address issues of efficiency and economic welfare that are central to antitrust analysis.  As to the latter, it does not discuss whether antitrust law is or might become adequate to address the issues it describes or the costs of the policy changes it recommends.

On December 2, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) competition committee held a roundtable on the role of competition policy in promoting economic recovery, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. While the roundtable was a closed-door, off-the-record event, the country submissions and speaker presentations are publicly available on the OECD’s website.1 Below are highlights from submissions by various countries and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC at OECD).
 
Background – Competition Authorities’ Role in Economic Recovery
After a year of government measures in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the roundtable focused on how “competition policy and competition authorities [can] contribute to a faster and more sustained economic recovery.”2 As articulated by the secretariat’s background note, competition authorities’ “expertise in how markets function and the key role of competition in ensuring conditions for economic growth and recovery make them privileged stakeholders in a wider policy context.”3
Perhaps reflecting COVID-19’s disparate health and economic impact across countries, participants’ submissions reveal that they undertook a wide range of initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis. As but a few examples, participating countries and their competition authorities have: advocated for the prioritized development of ultra-broadband telecommunications infrastructure,4 advocated for state intervention in the aviation sector to mitigate its significant financial losses,5 and provided technical guidance to local policymakers on assessing the impact of their competition decisions.6 This article focuses on three types of initiatives undertaken by multiple participants: (1) issuance of guidance for recovery-related collaborations, (2) increased vigilance around exploitative pricing and related unlawful conduct, and (3) analysis of whether existing merger standards ought to be relaxed in times of economic crisis.
 
Recovery-Related Collaborations
Seeking to ensure the continued provision of essential goods and services and encourage innovation in response to the COVID-19 crisis, several competition authorities have issued guidance on recovery-related collaborations between competitors. The secretariat’s background note identifies that permissible collaborations generally have three common key criteria: “i) the necessity and indispensability of . . . address[ing] a specific market disruption due to the Covid-19 crisis; ii) a positive impact of the co-operation on consumers; and iii) a strict time limit.”7  
The U.S. submission focuses on the March 2020 joint statement from the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which committed to account for exigent circumstances and provide expedited antitrust guidance for collaborations related to COVID-19.8 Since March 2020, the DOJ has approved four COVID-related collaborations through their expedited business review process — three related to the manufacture and distribution of personal protective equipment and/or medication, and a fourth related to the production of pork.9 Of particular note, the DOJ permitted various pharmaceutical companies to “exchange limited information about the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies that may be developed to treat COVID-19” in order to expedite innovation in vaccine production.10
Italy’s competition authority issued a similar statement in April 2020, announcing that it “d[id] not intend to oppose any necessary, temporary and proportionate measures taken to avoid shortages of supply.”11 Since then, Italy’s competition authority has provided guidance in two instances. First, it declined to oppose a cooperative agreement between two pharmaceutical distributors for the joint purchasing and distribution to pharmacies of disposable surgical masks.12 Second, it declined to investigate a common scheme among financial providers of consumer loans to defer customers’ main loan terms for a limited time period.13 In both instances, the authority concluded that the “exceptional health emergency” permitted such collaborations for a limited duration.
The European Commission similarly adopted a temporary framework for addressing antitrust issues in projects aimed at addressing the shortage of essential products and services during the COVID-19 crisis.14 The framework contemplates the issuance of “ad hoc written comfort” letters for specific projects. The Commission’s only letter to date favorably assessed a cooperation between pharmaceutical manufacturers to combat the shortage of critical medications for the treatment of COVID-19.15
Declining to interfere with such collaborations illustrates how competition authorities can exercise discretion in their enforcement powers to address the issues arising from an economic shock. But, as the secretariat’s background note cautions, while such collaborations help prevent supply chain disruptions and encourage critical innovation, “[s]ectors where co-operation between competitors arose as a response to the crisis should be made the target of stricter scrutiny as soon as circumstances change.”16
  
Vigilance Around Exploitative Pricing and Related Unlawful Conduct
Participants across the board showed increased sensitivity to exploitative pricing and other unlawful conduct arising from the COVID-19 economic environment. But, as the secretariat’s background note acknowledges, “[d]istinguishing legitimate from illegitimate pricing practices, as well as how best to deal with the latter, has created substantial challenges for competition authorities.”17 As a result, the roundtable submissions reflect various approaches.
In the U.S., the DOJ created a COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force. While the U.S. (unlike, for example, the EU) does not regulate pricing or prohibit exploitative abuses, the Task Force “is charged with developing effective enforcement measures and best practices, and coordinating nationwide investigation and prosecution of illicit activities.”18 Since its creation, the Task Force has aided the investigation of a range of conduct, including the sale of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) at exorbitant prices, fraudulent attempts by individuals to sell PPE they did not possess and had no means to acquire, and foreign countries’ shipment to the U.S. of misbranded and defective PPE.19
By contrast, rather than exercising purely legal authority, Italy’s initial response to crisis-related abusive conduct relied upon “a form of moral suasion.”20 Specifically, Italy’s competition authority requested information on price spikes in the food and health sectors and announced the changes with a press release, which often prompted corrective action. For example, a press release about various laboratories’ prices for antibody tests caused the laboratories to significantly reduce those prices, in some cases by nearly 70 percent.21 In another effort to prevent abusive conduct through increased transparency, Italy’s competition authority also requested grocery retailers to report on the trend of prices for “basic groceries, detergents, disinfectants and gloves.”22 Such reporting helped the authority distinguish legitimate price increases from those that caused concern.
With respect to other types of unlawful conduct, Canada’s submission highlighted its Competition Bureau’s issuance of warning letters to businesses which “sought to benefit from the fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 by selling products that allegedly prevented, treated or cured the disease.”23 In the United States, too, the FTC and the Food and Drug Administration have issued over 90 joint warning letters to companies marketing products as COVID-19 treatments or cures.24
 
Assessment of Existing Merger Standards
Finally, participants’ submissions reflect that many have reassessed whether existing merger standards — in particular, the failing firm defense — ought to be loosened in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The failing firm defense allows for approval of an otherwise anticompetitive merger if certain criteria are met, including that the acquired firm is in danger of failing and exiting the market altogether. Though the possibility that more businesses will fail as a result of the COVID-19 crisis has provoked a second look at the defense, the consensus is that rigorous enforcement of existing merger standards remains the securest path towards economic recovery.
For some historical context, similar discussions arose in 2008 and 2009, stemming from the notion that relaxed standards might help businesses better weather the then-ongoing financial crisis. At that time, participants in an OECD roundtable on the failing firm defense concluded that its “criteria should not be relaxed in times of crisis.”25 The secretariat’s current background note reaffirms this conclusion, noting that past crises suggest that that suspension of antitrust laws holds back recovery and that relaxed merger control does not improve long-term resilience.26
The roundtable participants tend to agree. For example, the U.S. submission states that the DOJ and FTC’s “view of key U.S. antitrust standards has not changed.”27 With respect to the failing firm defense in particular, the agencies assert that they continue to apply the same test  and to “require the same level of substantiation as was required before the COVID pandemic.”28 The EU submission takes a similar view, noting that “the crisis cannot and should not serve as a pretext for approving mergers that would hurt consumers and hold back recovery.”29 The positions taken by the U.S., the EU, and others reflect concerns that relaxing merger control based on economic uncertainty, standing alone, would set a challenging precedent and distort competition law in the long-term.
As a counterpoint, the OECD’s BIAC, which represents a network of companies across the globe, took a more flexible view. The BIAC submission suggests that the defense “may justifiably be partially relaxed” by, for example, “specifically allow[ing] competition agencies to take imminent job losses into account.”30 Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that countries will change their views in response to this recommendation from the business community.
 
Conclusion
Despite the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine, rising case numbers and new lockdowns have left many countries and their competition agencies in the emergency phase of pandemic management. Understandably, then, most country submissions to this roundtable focused on short-term, immediate measures to lessen the most disruptive economic impacts of the crisis — a necessary first step. But the true test of competition policy’s role in promoting economic recovery is still to come, when, in the recovery phase, “the focus [will turn to] building back the economies in a speedy and sustainable manner.”31

Highlights from the OECD Forum on Competition, Day One – By Melanie Kiser (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
As governments around the world contemplate calls for fundamental reforms to competition policy, the OECD Global Forum on Competition convened virtually to exchange views and ideas on December 7, 2020. The four-day event began with a keynote address and panel titled “Competition Policy: Time for a Reset?” moderated by OECD Competition Committee Chairman Frédéric Jenny.
Discussion revolved around whether public interest goals should be added to prevailing competition standards and how best to address the unique issues presented by digital platforms, among other topics.
 
Problems with “Public Interest” Goals in Competition Law
Much of the panel discussion focused on whether the consumer welfare standard (“CWS”) should be replaced with a standard looking beyond effects on competition to reflect other public interest goals such as employment. With one exception, the panelists generally expressed skepticism and/or concern towards the idea of incorporating public interest goals into competition policy.
Keynote speaker Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission’s “A Europe Fit for the Digital Age” task force, was first to address the question of whether it is “time for a reset” in competition policy. “The answer very much depends on what you mean by a ‘reset,’” she said. “If we are asking if it’s time to change the aims of competition policy,” as advocates for a public interest standard have argued, “the answer has to be no,” she said. “Quite the contrary, it’s more important than ever that we take effective action to keep competition working the way it should.”
This view was echoed by U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Christine Wilson, who said that she “remain[s] confident that competition is the best way to achieve the best results for consumers, and that antitrust law informed by economic analysis is the best way to achieve the most good for the greatest number.”
Panelists generally agreed that many public interest goals are better served through other policy tools. People often “lose sight of the fact that [competition law] is one tool in a broader toolkit that really does include a variety of levers that we can use to address larger public policy problems,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.
South Africa’s Approach – Chairman Jenny observed that the presence of public interest goals in some countries’ laws may reflect differences in the value placed on competition. On one hand, there are jurisdictions such as the United States and European Union, “where there is enough support for competition as a value to society.” On the other, there are certain developing countries, often with higher unemployment, “where it is not so evident to people that competition is a good thing, and where the only way to actually promote competition is, in fact, to have some public interest goal in the law.”
Panelist Thando Vilakazi offered views from South Africa, a country falling into the latter category that has long integrated public interest considerations into its competition law.2 In that region, the question is not whether such goals should be included but whether they should be broader and whether they are performing as intended, said Vilakazi, the executive director of the Centre for Competition, Regulation, and Economic Development at the University of Johannesburg. In South Africa, current law provides for consideration of a merger’s effects on “(a) a particular sector or region; (b) employment; (c) the ability of small businesses, or firms controlled or owned by historically disadvantaged persons, to become competitive; and (d) the ability of national industries to compete in international markets.”3
While South Africa has published guidelines describing the process for consideration of these goals, they do not indicate the weight to be given to each factor or how conflicts between the various policy goals will be resolved.4
Transparency & Accountability – Incorporation of public interest goals, as done in South Africa, “puts a premium on the clarity with which policymakers are willing to describe what they’ve done and not hide tradeoffs they’re making,” said Bill Kovacic, professor at George Washington University. This is “a degree of transparency that is hard to achieve in practice” because “the tradeoffs are so hard that there is an enormous temptation to mask them.” Under such standards, regulators “owe it to the public” to do as they would on a math exam and “show their work.”
The addition of public interest goals posed similar concerns for Damien Neven, an Economics Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and Senior Academic Advisor for Compass Lexecon. “If you have multiple objectives,” he explained, “at the end of the day it is difficult to reach a decision for which the agencies can be accountable,” and there is greater risk and scope of regulatory “capture.”
Because antitrust enforcement “is law enforcement,” it is “an evidence-based investigatory process and subject to judicial review,” explained Moss. As such, “concepts of standards and administrability do play in a very important way.” There is also a “danger” of replicating public interest standards already in place for regulated industries at other agencies, Moss said. Speaking from her experience as an industrial policy regulator at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Moss said she and her colleagues there “struggled with [the] public interest standard at FERC.”
Advantages of the CWS – Panelists identified a range of advantages to the prevailing CWS. “Precisely because it is tethered to economic principles,” Commissioner Wilson explained, the CWS “provides predictability to market actors, administrability to the courts, and credibility to the decisions made by competition enforcers.” These elements are necessary for competition law to have legitimacy and buy-in from stakeholders and citizens, she said. By contrast, a public interest approach would require enforcers to engage in an “unavoidably political calculus on who to serve” and “greatly increase subjectivity and uncertainty,” she said.
As a standard for protecting competition, Moss observed that the CWS “is far more competent in addressing issues than it has been given credit for,” noting that it “rightly focuses on the impact of anticompetitive mergers or conduct on market participants adversely affected by exercises of market power.” This focus on the participants affected, she said, enables the CWS to address (1) harm at any level in a supply chain, (2) both short-term static and longer-term dynamic effects, and (3) effects on non-price dimensions” such as quality and new products, she said. It also inherently accounts for the ability of consumers to discipline exercises of market power through consideration of barriers to entry/expansion and other competitive constraints, she said.
 
Dealing with Digital Platforms
The panel discussed several proposals under consideration in the U.S. and Europe that aim to address digital markets in particular.
Europe – The European Union is considering an approach that would designate specific digital platforms for additional regulation.5 These firms would be subject to a list of prohibited conduct (e.g. self-preferencing) and set of obligations to guarantee market contestability, which could include such requirements as data sharing, interoperability, and access to key inputs.
There is a risk with this proposal “of basically only allowing innovation by small firms and basically preventing large firms from innovating,” Neven said. The proposal would create “very strong presumptions about what large platforms can do and other platforms cannot do.” These presumptions should be informed by “stable economic theory, enforcement experience, and empirical evidence” that are not yet fully available.
Commissioner Wilson expressed skepticism about the economics underlying the potential obligations. “Economics teaches us that if you force companies to share certain assets with competitors, innovation and investment in those assets will decline.” This means that some proposals “may sound ‘fairer’ in how they would divide the pie, but they actually result in a smaller pie for policy makers to divide.”
United States – The U.S. panelists took a range of views on the idea of digital-specific antitrust legislation, which has been suggested in a recent report by select members of Congress. Moss suggested that further thought must be given “to the advent of the ecosystem business model,” which is “very unique” and gives rise to concerns about leveraging consumer data across platforms and about data and analytics “as assets.”
Commissioner Wilson disagreed, stating that antitrust laws in the United States “are broad enough to take into account the digital sector as it exists and will exist in the future,” and authorities have been grappling with these issues since the D.C. Circuit’s Microsoft case from the 1990s. Kovacic echoed that U.S. officials “have been so attuned to high tech innovation” for many years. “The notion that they were blind to these considerations is such a myth.”

Conclusion
Returning to the overarching question posed to the panel – whether it is “time for a reset” in competition policy – the answer was largely in the negative. While speakers differed in their views on how competition policy could be improved, there was significant skepticism about overhauling its goals or approach.

Highlights from the OECD’s November 2020 Roundtable on Competition in Digital Advertising Markets – By Max Fischer-Zernin (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
Over the past decade competition enforcers across the globe have investigated various aspects of “digital” or “online” advertising. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Competition Committee’s (“OECD’s”) “roundtable on competition in digital advertising markets” suggests enforcers’ interest in the digital advertising sector may continue, if not intensify, in the coming years. At the November 30 virtual roundtable, enforcers, academics, and representatives from the business community gathered virtually to exchange learnings from the past few years and set out an agenda for future market studies and legislative changes.
While the roundtable was an off-the-record meeting, the OECD has published OECD-member country submissions (“Notes”), an extensive OECD briefing document (the “Brief”), and remarks to the Committee by Hal Varian, David S. Evans, and Fiona M. Scott Morton.2 A notable absence is the lack of a submission from the United States.
In this article I draw out some of the key themes from the roundtable material.
 
Market Studies, Enforcement Actions, and Regulatory Initiatives
The country submissions offer a helpful retrospective on major market studies and enforcement actions of the past decade. The Australian Note summarizes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (“ACCC”) recent Digital Platforms Inquiry and the ongoing Digital Advertising Services Inquiry. The French Note summarizes the 2010 and 2018 Autorité de la Concurrence inquiries into digital advertising, and a variety of decisions imposing interim measures, fines, and commitments in the search advertising sector. The UK Note discusses the 2020 Final Report from the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) online platforms and digital advertising market study. And the Japanese Note raises the JFTC’s 2019 Report regarding trade practices on digital platforms.
Some Notes discuss existing or planned specialized competition “units” to oversee digital advertising and other digital sectors. The Australian Note provides an overview of the ACCC’s newly established digital platforms branch, charged with monitoring competition in digital platform markets and taking competition enforcement action.3 The French Note mentions the new digital economy unit in the Autorité¸ established in early 2020.4
The UK Note calls for the creation of a broader “Digital Markets Unit” within the CMA to oversee a new “pro-competitive ex ante regulatory regime” for the digital advertising sector, including an enforceable code of conduct to govern the behavior of platforms with “strategic market status” and a set of “pro-competitive interventions” including data access and interoperability remedies.5 The UK submission views the new Unit as a necessary response to perceived gaps in competition law.
The Spanish Note finds that “competition policy offers a flexible framework to adapt to complex industries such as online advertising” but agrees that “perhaps more and better resources are needed (in specialized units) to deal with the complexity of digital markets.”6
Other country submissions discuss the need for new enforcement powers. The French Note highlighted the importance of the Autorité’s power to issue interim measures (injunctions), and forthcoming legislative enactments that will allow the Autorité to “to start proceedings ex officio when it deems interim measures to be necessary in a given market, without having to wait for a referral by third parties,” as is currently required.7
The Autorité has also made “proposals for possible adjustments to its means of intervention in order to address the challenges and specificities of the digital economy,”8 which call for “implementing a prevention and sanction system specifically for [large digital platform] players.”9
Like the French Note, the Korean submission previews legislation by which the KFTC “has strengthened investigations and monitoring on infringements by online platform operators, while pushing ahead with institutional improvement including revision of laws and regulations to promote competition and establish order for fair trade in the field.”10
The Spanish Note calls for additional scrutiny of mergers in “data-intensive digital services” to identify harms to competition “even if apparently they are not involving potential competitors.”11 The submission concludes that “apart from merger control, antitrust tools can adapt to theories of harm related to potential concerns in online advertising markets,”12 but leaves the door open for “some type of regulation” around issues like data portability and interoperability, and transparency.13
The OECD Brief cautions that the proposed legislative and regulatory responses could have harmful unintended consequences, warning that “it will be important to consider any possible unintended consequences, such as undermining procompetitive digital business models that rely on digital advertising as a main or significant source of revenue.”14
While these Notes do refer to more extensive comments made in market studies and issue papers, they lack an extensive discussion of error costs, administrability, and the risk of chilling procompetitive conduct.15 An exception is the Note by Spain, which states: “If regulation were to be enacted to overcome some of the challenges raised by digitization and, specifically, by online advertising, it is crucial that it is well-designed in order to avoid unintended effects on competition.”16
The OECD Brief also suggests “[i]t will also be important to ensure that related policy experts, such as from data protection and privacy agencies, and consumer protection agencies, are involved to ensure there are no unintended consequences in these adjacent policy spheres.”17 The call to align competition and data privacy initiatives is echoed by the OECD-member countries.18
  
The Structure of the Digital Advertising Sector and Attempts to Define Relevant Markets
Various member countries recognize digital advertising as an innovative sector. Business at OECD19 finds that “[a] common feature of digital media markets, including online advertising, is that they bring fast and potentially disruptive innovation, are characterized by an impressive growth rate as well as by the presence of digital platform intermediaries that have a central role. Online advertising is able to compete with traditional advertising because it has generated unprecedented advantages for businesses and end consumer[s] alike.”20
The French Note states that the display advertising sector “is developing within a powerful technological dynamic” and “[m]any intermediation and data processing service providers have entered the market.”21 The Spanish Note states “[d]igital advertising has been, in general, a positive disruption, increasing the efficiency of campaigns and bringing new innovations.”22
These views find support in other expert analyses, such as the 2020 ACCC submission by Daniel S. Bitton and Stephen Lewis, Clearing Up Misperceptions About Google’s Ad Tech Business. Bitton & Lewis review industry data and conclude that “the ad tech space displays two key features of a highly competitive space: growing output and declining prices.”23
Country submissions also suggest a taxonomy for digital advertising inventory (ad slots on different types of websites and apps). The United Kingdom, Australian, Mexican, and French Notes divide advertising into offline and digital,24 and further divide digital advertising into search, display, and classified advertising, suggesting limited substitutability between the three.25 The UK Note, for example, suggests search and display advertising serve different purposes: search advertising is “aimed at driving consumers to take a particular action” while display advertising is intended for “raising brand awareness and shifting brand perceptions.”26
Catherine Tucker, whose work is quoted extensively in the Business at OECD Note, explains the key determinant is neither the type of format nor the objective of an advertisement, but the advertiser’s measured return on ad spend:
“In the past, advertisers believed that in the upper funnel, because they were competing against clutter, they needed to use storytelling and highly visual formats to gain attention. . . . However, this rule has been replaced by measurement, meaning that advertisers can effectively use any format at any place in the funnel and evaluate whether it is effective for that particular target audience. Ultimately, an advertiser is indifferent between whether it is a video ad, or a static text-laden ad that influences a customer to purchase as long as they can measure how effective that format was relative to its price.”27
The ability to “target” advertising and measure its effectiveness is discussed at length in the country submissions.28 But the Notes largely omit arguments about how targeting and measurement can blur the so-called “marketing funnel.” Targeting could be used in display advertising to elicit an action from the user, such as with “remarketing” advertising, or search advertising could be used for brand awareness, especially when a user’s search query does not suggest commercial intent (i.e., the user is not using search to make a purchase). As the UK Note acknowledges, the CMA has seen “some evidence that display advertising, particularly on Facebook, is increasingly being used for targeting in-market conversions.”29
The French Note also acknowledges that while digital advertising’s innovations in targeting and pricing distinguish it from traditional advertising, like television, “this observation could change in the future depending on the development of targeted and programmatic television advertising.”30
To varying degrees UK, Australian, and French Notes use the taxonomy for digital advertising inventory to suggest separate relevant markets for display and search advertising.31 With the exception of certain adjudicated enforcement actions, the member countries explain that these statements are not intended to provide binding conclusions about relevant market definitions.32 For example, The UK Note states clearly that the CMA market study “did not seek to undertake a formal market definition exercise.”33
In his remarks to the roundtable, David S. Evans cautions against drawing binding conclusions about market definition from market studies: “Market definition is very much tied to whatever it is the conduct is that we are trying to analyze . . . . Trying to make an overarching determination now as part of a market inquiry sort of approach . . . I’m not sure aside from providing general information that that’s really a great thing to do.”34
Business at OECD encourages competition enforcers “to undertake any analysis of online advertising markets with precision to ensure that conclusions are robust and directed at identifiable competition violations, and that remedies are appropriate to address the competition violation at hand [and] to the extent that regulation (rather than enforcement) is considered on the basis of competition concerns, precision in identifying the underlying competition problems is both a necessary precursor and an essential element of an effective framework.”35
 
An Overview of the Ad Tech Stack and its Complexities
The UK, Australian, and Mexican submissions and OECD Brief provide an overview of the “ad tech stack,”36 those services that “assist advertisers and publishers in the automatic purchasing and selling of digital display advertising.”37
The Notes highlight the complexity of the ad tech stack, but do not address arguments that the historical origin of each ad tech service or functionality explains how they increased competition and efficiency compared to the then-prevailing status quo. For example, Bitton & Lewis explain that, when viewed “in the context of market developments that took place over this time,” Google’s publisher ad tech product Google Ad Manager “has a track record of enhancing rather than inhibiting competition, and that its evolution reflects Google’s responses to rapid technological and competitive changes, as well as attempts to balance the interests of users, publishers and advertisers.”38
 
Network Effects and Data in the Digital Advertising Sector
There is widespread agreement among member countries that digital advertising platforms are two-sided platforms that exhibit network effects and use user data as an input,39 and that these characteristics contribute to market power in the digital advertising sector.
The UK Note states that “network effects” and “unequal access to user data” “entrench” incumbent platforms’ market power.40 And the Mexican and Spanish Notes argue that network effects and big data facilitate market concentration.41
Regarding network effects, country submissions do not discuss the risks of relying on network effects as indications of substantial power or monopoly power. As the American Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law has written, “[w]hen evaluating network effects, it is important to consider, next to switching costs and multi-homing and other factors, the possibility of negative network effects.”42
As Koren Wong-Ervin has explained: “[n]etwork effects can cut both ways, sometimes leading to highly concentrated markets due to positive feedback loops or ‘tipping,’ and other times hastening the decline of a dominant player.”43
In a prior publication, Evans and co-author Richard Schmalensee explained that “[n]etworks can have exponential growth when every additional customer attracts more consumers. . . . the same principle can lead to exponential decline. Each lost customer induces other customers to leave, which induces more to leave.”44
Regarding the importance of data, the UK submission describes data as “highly valuable” and an “essential input” for ad targeting and measurement,45 two uses of data also highlighted by the Spanish Note.46 The Australian Note also characterizes data as a “source of competitive advantage.”47
Multiple submissions discuss the allegedly unique characteristics of data. The Mexican, Spanish, and Business at OECD Notes agree data is non-rivalrous.48 Business at OECD states data is also non-exclusive,49 but the Spanish Note suggests “regulation actually promotes excludability in general.”50
Wong-Ervin has explained that, while data is a valuable input, new entrants do not need to replicate incumbents’ data to succeed.51 Similarly, Darren Tucker and Hill Wellford have argued that “[a]n entrant that needs personal data can collect relevant information from its users once the service is operational. Data collected in this manner is free or nearly so. Entering the market and then collecting and analyzing user data is not a theoretical approach but rather the very model followed by many of the leading online firms when they were startups or virtual unknowns, including Google, Facebook, Yelp, Amazon, eBay, Pinterest, and Twitter.”52
The Mexican Note states that, despite its risks, “the collection of large datasets and analysis of data could lead to benefits for consumers, such as access […] to better and personalized services.”53 Business at OECD also explains that targeted advertising results in efficiencies as advertisers waste a smaller portion of their budget advertising to an overly broad audience.54
 
Types of Potential Conduct Raising Competition Risks
The OECD Brief provides a summary of the structural issues and conduct that were raised in countries’ submissions as potential issues to examine in the digital advertising sector: conflicts of interest in vertically integrated firms, self-preferencing that raises rivals’ costs, leveraging market power, opaque data practices, and more general market opacity that gives dominant platforms the ability to create market distortions.55
 
Concluding Thoughts 
The OECD’s Competition Committee’s “roundtable” offers a helpful summary of how key competition enforcers have approached the digital advertising sector. This article highlights some areas of agreement among countries as well as the disagreements and misunderstandings that still remain.
As David S. Evans told the roundtable, showing monopoly power or dominance in a relevant market is a fact-specific inquiry that must be conducted in the context of the merger or conduct at issue. Market studies, white papers, and submissions to the OECD may provide helpful general information but they are not dispositive. In the context of the digital advertising sector it is helpful to consider some of the arguments made by Business at OECD, Wong-Ervin, and Tucker regarding the complexities of network effects and data inputs.
Looking ahead, as certain member countries pursue new legislative initiatives, it will be important that they clearly identify market failures and consumer harms to be remedied, any actual gaps in competition law, and how the new regulation will mitigate error costs, administrability issues, and the risk of chilling procompetitive conduct. Member countries will often find that their existing competition regimes are the more appropriate channel for competition enforcement in the digital advertising sector.

OECD Roundtable on Market Studies: Consensus on the Strengths and Limitations & Divergence on Binding Remedies – By Pauline (Shi) Tang (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
On December 10, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Competition Committee held a roundtable on “Using market studies to tackle emerging competition issues.” The country submissions and speaker presentations are publicly available on the OECD’s website. The Secretariat’s background note, country submissions by the United States, Japan, and Mexico, and the submission by Business at OECD (“BIAC”) represent some of the key opinions on the use of market studies. The submissions explore the strengths and limitations of using market studies to diagnose and solve novel competition issues; the utility of using them beyond traditional enforcement actions; and the potential dangers of imposing market-wide binding remedies following market studies absent a finding of violation of the law, especially in dynamic sectors.
  
OECD Background Note: Market Studies Used as a “[F]lexible” and “[F]orward [L]ooking” Tool, But Remedies That Follow Should Be Proportionate and Principle-Based 
The Secretariat’s background note describes how market studies can be used by competition authorities as a “flexible tool” to examine new and evolving challenges “outside the context of merger reviews or antitrust investigations.”2 The submission by BIAC finds that “holistic yet structured assessments” are better suited to evaluate new business models with “overlapping ecosystems of suppliers and customers.”3
Market studies are useful, according to the Secretariat, in part because they are forward-looking and market-wide in nature. Enforcement actions are limited to historical or ongoing anticompetitive practices by specific companies. Market studies, by contrast, can look at potential scenarios in the entire market and “identify and diagnose emerging competition issues.”4 The Secretariat considers such a holistic tool important, especially in dealing with certain structural features such as “large economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, high barriers to entry, and ‘winner-takes-most’ dynamics” that risk leading to high concentration, even if no anticompetitive conduct has yet been taken by incumbents.5 In other words, market studies provide opportunities to “focus the analysis on the process of competition and not just on outcomes.”6 The Secretariat’s background note states that such a tool applies not only in digital markets, but also in any type of “challenger” businesses with “innovative business models and new technologies” that will potentially disrupt the existing markets.
The Secretariat believes market studies are good at creating “synergies” between competition law and other policy areas by analyzing the market from the perspectives beyond competition to include consumer protection or data and privacy considerations.7
The Secretariat’s background note also points out potential limitations of market studies. Substantively, the Secretariat cautions that even though the studies can offer more predictability to companies entering the market, agencies need to avoid offering static recommendations or remedies that no longer fit market reality by the time the study is published, especially in fast moving digital markets. To solve that issue, the Secretariat encourages broad “principle-based primary legislation,” to be followed by secondary legislation or guidance tailored to new sector conditions later on as needed.8
The Secretariat acknowledges the difficulty to implement recommendations coming out of market studies as they will not be legally binding in most jurisdictions. The note suggests putting the burden on lawmakers to explain why they opt out of adopting any recommendations of the competition authority. By contrast, for the few jurisdictions that can issue binding recommendations (including potentially the European Commission given the “New Competition Tool” currently being considered), the Secretariat believes such power should “com[e] with very tight governance and procedural checks and balances to ensure the competition authority remains within its remit and is accountable for its interventions.”9
The Secretariat believes there are clear benefits for different competition authorities and governments to work together and develop a “shared international approach” as the emerging competition issues are global in nature, and common issues deserve common approaches.10
 
Submission by the United States: Cautiously Optimistic About Market Studies’ Offering of Holistic Insights in Evolving Sectors Limited to “a [S]napshot in [T]ime”
The U.S. submission states that market studies may be appropriate in sectors with evolving competition landscapes, and when the competition authorities need to be educated on certain novel market conditions or past wins and losses therein.11 The submission finds market studies helpful as they provide agencies with “stakeholder, academic, industry and consumer feedback,” and data that allow agencies to perform empirical research in support of policy recommendations.12 As pointed out by the background note, the U.S. submission also recognizes that market studies can only provide information “relevant to a snapshot in time.”13 Any remedy based on the market study findings needs to be carefully evaluated as the snapshot captured by the market study might have already shifted. Moreover, the submission acknowledges that such studies are “extremely resource intensive” for the agencies and “burdensome to companies both in terms of time and cost of compliance.”14
The submission introduces the U.S. agencies’ market studies portfolio, including workshops, retrospective studies of consummated mergers, and market studies conducted without a specific law enforcement purpose under the FTC’s 6(b) authority.
The submission briefly summarizes several recently held workshops on evolving market trends, including a workshop on “Venture Capital Investment and Antitrust Law.”15 It covered trends in venture capital investment since the 1990s, tips from investors on how to “identify nascent competitors” and why some competitive alternatives to the market-leading platforms have tended to become less attractive investment opportunities in recent years.16
The retrospective studies are intended to analyze whether the agencies’ reporting threshold for mergers has been too high, how effective the tools used by the agency economists are in predicting effects of proposed mergers in the markets, and how effective merger remedies are in maintaining or restoring competition lost due to a merger.17
The submission also illustrates how the FTC is currently using its 6(b) authority to study the “acquisition strategies” of the largest technology firms — including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — by looking at acquisitions falling below the reporting threshold.18 Information gathered from this study will be analyzed to examine to what extent those firms are making acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors, and whether those below-the-thread deals or agreements have raised competitive concerns.19 Although this study of below-the-thread deals may offer insights into whether current merger control is effective in digital markets, how agencies will manage the scope and frequency of similar studies given the submission’s acknowledgement of high burdens relating to market studies remains to be seen.
 
Submission by Japan: Market Studies — Leading to Recommendations for Businesses’ Voluntary Improvement — Considered “[N]ecessary” to Obtain a “[F]ull [P]icture” of a Market
Japan’s submission considers market studies “necessary” to gather reliable factual findings and to obtain a “full picture” understanding of market structures or trade practices, and eventually to ensure appropriate implementation of competition law and policy.20 “[F]act-finding surveys” conducted by the JFTC also aim to “prevent” anti-competitive practices before they materialize, as mentioned in the background note.21
The submission points out fact-finding surveys, conducted by the Economic Affairs Bureau, bear no direct relationship with actual party-specific investigations conducted by the Investigation Bureau.22 The JFTC, however, will issue letters to companies that may “potential[ly] infring[e]” antitrust law, as found in the surveys, and encourage them to “voluntarily improve such practices in [a] pro-competitive way.”23
The submission describes its recent market study on code payment services (one of the cashless payments methods). The JFTC interviewed over 50 banks and fintech companies and issued questionnaires to more than 100 businesses, during which the JFTC finds that the market condition made it “indispensable for nonbank code payment providers to make contracts with banks,” thus granting banks “incentives to exclude nonbank code payment providers from the market.”24 The survey report therefore recommended that banks should consider “developing an environment” in which nonbank providers can have access to the Application Programming Interfaces used by large banks, and then develop substitutes for banks’ services.25
 
Submission by Mexico: Enthusiasm for Article 94’s Authority to Issue Binding Remedies Following Market Studies. Expectations for More Jurisdictions to Adopt Similar Approaches
Mexico’s submission discusses the Federal Economic Competition Commission’s (“COFECE”) uncommon authority to issue legally binding recommendations following a “market investigation” under Article 94 of the Federal Law of Economic Competition. The submission describes Article 94 as a “hybrid” competition and regulatory tool, allowing the Mexican agency to conduct a thorough market assessment aiming to identify “structural problems [and] order their correction through various remedies.”26 Recommendations could be subject to judicial review if an appeal were filed.27
The submission states that this tool has been effectively used by the COFECE to intervene in digital markets, when the issues are typically “unnoticed” by traditional antitrust tools.28 Due to the “winners-take-all” dynamics in digital markets, the submission argues that Article 94 allows the Commission to intervene at an early stage, before any single market participant acquires substantial market power. The submission finds Article 94 useful in analyzing behaviors that “do not necessarily fit in the list of abusive of dominance practices” but were identified in the international discourse as potentially problematic, such as self-preferencing practices, imposition of abusive contractual terms, or collusion using algorithms.29
Only the United Kingdom, Iceland, Greece and South Africa have similar broad authorities as Article 94 to impose binding remedies after a market study.30 But the submission observes that the international community has started to recognize the effectiveness of similar ex-ante market study authorities independent from an entity’s specific anticompetitive conducts, especially in the analysis of digital markets, citing the EU’s contemplation of the “New Competition Tool.”31 Indeed, there is an ongoing debate on whether antitrust law needs a reform vis-a-vis the digitalization of markets and market-wide remedies may be more effective in tackling certain types of issues. However, as the Secretariat’s note cautioned, with great power comes great responsibility, such market-wide remedies need to come with strong procedural checks and balances. It is also worth considering whether one-size-fits-all remedy packages that will accurately target the issues corresponding to businesses with diverse business models truly exist.
 
Critiques by BIAC: Market Studies Not Predictive in Nature, Remedies That Follow Should Be Recognized as an “[E]xtraordinary” Power 
BIAC’s submission cautions against unrealistic expectations for market studies and discusses several of their limitations and dangers.
First, BIAC explains that market studies are not inherently “predictive.” To the contrary, market studies are to some extent limited by agencies’ preconceived beliefs on how antitrust law is failing because they tend to focus on “markets with known and observable existing systematic challenges.”32 As a result, the submission expresses doubt on market studies’ potential as a “panacea” for resolving emerging and future issues in markets.
Second, to prevent market studies from becoming “burdensome fishing expeditions,” BIAC emphasizes the need for a “clearly articulated test for when a study is warranted,” including why existing competition powers are insufficient.33 The submission does not believe “vague notions of concentration and profitability” are sufficient reasons, for example, to launch market studies. BIAC opines that a clearly-set out scope and objectives may potentially avoid subjecting companies to “mission creep.”34 To properly manage the scope and minimize unnecessary burden on companies, BIAC believes preliminary inquiries in the format of pilot questionnaires or consultations of key stakeholders in the preliminary stages can be useful.35
Third, BIAC points out that the ability for a competition authority to impose remedies on businesses in the absence of any infringement is an “extraordinary power” without the “democratic legitimacy of an elected legislator.”36 BIAC thus “strenuously disagrees with the need for powers to impose remedies” to be included in market studies.37 The preferred route, rather, is for market studies to “analyze, diagnose and inform, but for changes to be achieved through other means.” Avenues like individual voluntary commitments, code of conduct, or legislation should all be options.38 BIAC’s warning is on point because authority to issue binding remedies following market studies risks turning agencies into regulators.
If remedy powers are to be included, the submission stresses the need for agencies to “proceed cautiously and proportionately,” as market studies are not the place for “creative and speculative theories of harm.”39 BIAC states that agencies should design remedies that are “effective and proportionate to the issues identified,” and avoid remedies that may “chill innovation.”40 BIAC also suggests the importance of a “merits-based judicial review of any remedies” that come out of market studies, and to put in place structures to “revisit remedies over time” especially in dynamic markets.41 Agencies should recognize the potential need to allocate long-term resources to keep the code of conduct up to date because otherwise, a rigid outdated code of conduct may instead stifle innovation in fast-moving sectors.
Lastly, BIAC warns that the many emerging competition issues, especially the ones in digital markets, are inherently global, and therefore “inappropriate for consideration, and certainly unsuitable for remedy, at the level of a single jurisdiction.”42
 
Conclusion
The country submissions reveal a varying degree of enthusiasm for the use of market studies in terms of how useful they will be in tackling emerging competition issues beyond the existing enforcement tools, and whether any legally binding remedies should come out of those studies. Overall, the submissions recognize market studies’ utility in obtaining a market-wide picture of evolving sectors, but also counsel that, before fully grasping the strengths and limitations of market studies, agencies should remain realistic about what they can achieve and stay vigilant to the danger of overusing them due to the high compliance costs they impose on companies. BIAC’s submission also urges agencies to keep in mind that imposing binding, one-size-fits-all remedies on companies without any specific violation may lead to unintended consequences. These may include preventing the flexibility needed, particularly in fast-moving and dynamic markets.

534,"January 5, 2021",Too Big Not To Fail? Google’s Antitrust Woes,"


By Ronan Dunne & Philip Lee
As a staunch Trump ally, former Attorney General Bill Barr will be remembered for a lot of things. His role in the redaction, and then subsequent disclosure, of the Mueller report and his interventions in cases involving Trump associates spring to mind. However, perhaps his legacy will be something entirely different, with wider ramifications for citizens across the globe, far beyond the Washington political bubble.
Under Barr’s watch, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) initiated a major lawsuit against Google in October for alleged violations of US competition law. Announcing the action, Barr said this was “a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.”
The DoJ’s case has been taken in conjunction with 11 state Attorneys General (including the likes of Florida, Georgia and Texas). It is a civil antitrust lawsuit which alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies through anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets.
The significance of the DoJ’s action cannot be underestimated. Google is one of the wealthiest corporations on the planet with a market value of over US$1 trillion. In announcing the action, Barr threw down the gauntlet to Google saying the “lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google’s grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist.” He compared the lawsuit with the historic antitrust actions taken against AT&T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998.
Barr’s references to AT&T and Microsoft are significant. This is the first time that the US has initiated court action against a major tech company since Microsoft in the late 90s. While Microsoft was able to cut a deal that left its business intact, the same cannot be said for AT&T. The Bell System of companies, led by the Bell Telephone Company and later by AT&T, had dominated telephone services in the USA for over a century before it was broken up in the early 1980s as a direct consequence of the DoJ’s actions.
Could a similar fate befall Google? That is the great unknown at this stage. The DoJ has stated that “nothing is off the table”. But the litigation is likely to drag on for years at a minimum. A settlement may, ultimately, suit all parties. That’s unlikely to lead to a break-up of Google, though divestments of specific business functions cannot be ruled out. It is too early to tell how the chips will fall.
The action does, however, mark a turning of the tide against the US tech titans which, up until now, had seen antitrust action concentrated in Europe. The early years of the Trump administration were set against a backdrop of global trade wars and increasingly protectionist policies. The Google lawsuit reflects a clear departure from those days, in a direction that is only likely to continue under president-elect Joe Biden. Indeed, early December saw further lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and over forty states against Facebook. These proceedings accuse Facebook of buying up rivals to suppress competition. DoJ and FTC investigations into Amazon and Apple are also ongoing, reflecting the growing bipartisan support in the US for action against Big Tech.

535,"December 29, 2020",Little Law And No New Regulator: What’s Missing In The House Antitrust Report,"
By: Neil Chilson (Pro Market)
It might be hard to believe the report is missing anything. After all, the subcommittee under Cicilline’s leadership spent more than a year investigating digital markets, held seven hearings with 38 witnesses, collected nearly 1.3 million documents, interviewed more than 240 market participants, and received 38 written submission from 60 antitrust experts. At the end, the Democratic staff released 449 pages distilling the results of their investigation and offering 30 pages of recommended changes. What could possibly have been left out? It turns out the Cicilline report has two defining absences.
Missing Legal Analysis
The report is primarily a narrative document, not an argumentative one. It gathers and lays out many factual findings but does not apply the law to those facts to reach any legal conclusions. Even the narrative is circumscribed; for example, the report does not describe the existing state of antitrust law. Part V spends 267 pages—more than half the report—describing the business practices of four specific technology companies: Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. (Speaking of things that are missing, where is the description of Microsoft, the second-largest tech company in the world?)
The report’s tone often indicates that staff are critical of a particular business practice. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find in the report even one business practice that staff considers valuable to consumers. For example, Amazon Prime has made free next-day shipping so commonplace that people barely remember that just 10 years ago, standard shipping took six to eight weeks…

536,"December 29, 2020",Why the Federal Government’s Antitrust Case Against Google Should—and Likely Will—Fail,"
By: Thom Lambert (Truth on the Market)
On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and eleven states with Republican attorneys general sued Google for monopolizing and attempting to monopolize the markets for general internet search services, search advertising, and “general search text” advertising (i.e., ads that resemble search results).  Last week, California joined the lawsuit, making it a bipartisan affair.
DOJ and the states (collectively, “the government”) allege that Google has used contractual arrangements to expand and cement its dominance in the relevant markets.  In particular, the government complains that Google has agreed to share search ad revenues in exchange for making Google Search the default search engine on various “search access points.” 
Google has entered such agreements with Apple (for search on iPhones and iPads), manufacturers of Android devices and the mobile service carriers that support them, and producers of web browsers.  Google is also pursuing default status on new internet-enabled consumer products, such as voice assistants and “smart” TVs, appliances, and wearables.  In the government’s telling, this all amounts to Google’s sharing of monopoly profits with firms that can ensure its continued monopoly by imposing search defaults that users are unlikely to alter.
There are several obvious weaknesses with the government’s case.  One is that preset internet defaults are super easy to change and, in other contexts, are regularly altered.  For example, while 88% of desktop and laptop computers use the Windows operating system, which defaults to a Microsoft browser (Internet Explorer or Edge), Google’s Chrome browser commands a 69% market share on desktops and laptops, compared to around 13% for Internet Explorer and Edge combined.  Changing a default search engine is as easy as changing a browser default—three simple steps on an iPhone!—and it seems consumers will change defaults they don’t actually prefer…

537,"December 22, 2020",Google Rejects DOJ Antitrust Suit Claims,"


Google is pushing back in court this week on antitrust claims brought against it by the Justice Department two months ago, reported The New York Times. In a legal filing with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Google denied or partially rejected almost 200 specific complaints against it. On only one count, that Google was a “founded in Menlo Park garage 22 years ago,” did the company side with the Justice Department.
The filing, a 42-page document, is a paragraph-by-paragraph — and sometimes sentence-by-sentence — denial of the claims made by the government and a group of states that have joined its lawsuit. In the filing, Google claims it “developed, continually innovated and promoted” its search product as part of its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
“People use Google Search because they choose to, not because they are forced to or because they cannot easily find alternative ways to search for information on the internet,” the company stated.
In October the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.

David EVANS:
Hello everyone. This is David Evans. I’m sitting here in Boston, Massachusetts at the moment, but we’re going to be talking today about the Asia-Pacific region. There’s a robust digital economy in the region. Western tech firms are very active in lots of places. Chinese tech giants are more active in Asia-Pacific outside of China than in the West. But there’s a lot of innovation by domestic and regional players. And there’s also a great diversity in the digital ecosystems across countries. India is very different than Japan, which is very different than Australia. Just like everywhere else in the world competition authorities and others are really thinking very hard about the right regulatory framework for the digital economy. And they’re doing that in a context in which market investigations and proposals are quite far along in Europe and to a lesser extent in the United States. And of course, China, the giant of the area has recently announced proposals or actually a framework for the digital economy.

The questions in FTC v. Qualcomm are consequential in setting competitive norms in an economy anxious about the exercise of market power. Like many other antitrust cases, this one shows symptoms of antitrust law’s inherent vulnerability to ideology stampeding facts and data. Seen as an algorithm, antitrust has had patches and updates over the years. Still, few have recognized the breadth and depth of transformation artificial intelligence (“AI”) can bring to antitrust adjudication. AI enables courts to better render evidence-based decisions. As a tool, it is non-ideological and enables courts to minimize ideological stampeding. As a powerful new partner in making sense of the complex, dynamic, and fast-moving licensing markets many businesses operate in, courts and agencies can harness its ability to model price and innovation effects more precisely. There are challenges to implementing AI with data accountability, data availability, and data bias. These challenges can be addressed. The time to retool antitrust is now.

Good evening, good morning, or good afternoon, depending on where you are when you are hearing this. It is my very great privilege to be moderating this extremely distinguished panel to discuss the competition issues related to the mobile ecosystem, especially with reference to India. The topic is very vast. As I understand it, the mobile ecosystem at its core consists of manufacturers of mobile devices, the semiconductors that go into them, the telecom or internet service providers that provide the access to the net, the developers of operating systems and the app stores that are embedded in these devices, the app developers who place their apps in the app stores into those devices. That is the core of the mobile ecosystem.
But of course, it is that ecosystem that gives us all access to the myriad services that we avail of from these devices. And especially in the last six months, we have learned the hard way how dependent we are on that little device which so far was just a convenience for chatting or for occasional transactions.

542,"December 14, 2020",Rebooting Digital Market Power,"

By David Teece & Henry Kahwaty1
 
I. Introduction
The European Commission is considering legislative proposals to address the perceived market power of online platforms. The proposals include the use of ex ante rules to require certain conduct and prohibit various other types of conduct without an assessment of the effects on consumer or overall welfare in any specific case. The assumption is that large firms have market power, and this market power causes anticompetitive outcomes. Competition policy – and government policy more broadly – are often based on a static view of industries and markets – a snapshot in time – rather than being viewed as part of a dynamically evolving ecosystem. This applies to the Digital Markets Act currently under consideration and the proposed ex ante remedies.
Under a static view of an industry or model of a market, the technologies available to firms are fixed or given, and rivals make decisions on price and/or innovation investment when deciding how to compete in the narrowly circumscribed “product market.” Future innovation driven changes in markets, or possibly even market redefining innovations and the potential development of entirely new markets, play only a peripheral role in the analysis. This analytical frame of reference may be sufficient in some markets or industries where market opportunities depend on competitors’ size, or where innovation capabilities are limited, but in digital industries, adopting a static frame of reference misses key dimensions of competition.
There is a great deal of focus now on adapting competition policy to the digital economy, and the Digital Markets Act under consideration is one possible approach. Standard and familiar tools, developed over decades, are used to analyze competition in industrial and other markets, and are also commonly applied directly to the digital economy to diagnose concerns and prescribe interventions. But this approach risks missing the fundamental nature of digitally enabled competition. In the digital economy, while static competition may drive incremental innovation, it is the threat and potential for market redefining innovation that drives dynamic competition.
 
II. Dynamic Competition
Dynamic competition is fierce rivalry between firms to develop new products or services, new means of delivering services to consumers, new business models to combine assets in different ways, and new production techniques.2 This innovation competition can come directly or indirectly from entities active in an industry or in an adjacent one, and it can also come from entirely unexpected entrants, including new businesses.
Innovation competition is critical to economic performance because it drives productivity growth and economic value creation. Examples of this include the development of vaccines in medicine and the development of refrigeration for food storage in the house and during transportation. Magnetic resonance imaging both substituted for and complemented decades old x-rays. Jet airplanes substituted for and complemented propeller airplanes, both internal combustion and gas turbines. 5G mobile wireless is a step function improvement over 4G/LTE.
Innovation can be incremental or fundamental and radical, leading to entirely new categories of products or services, new and better business models, or new production techniques. Disruptive innovation can have large effects on markets and the products and services available to consumers and can be driven by existing firms or new entrants.
Netflix, for example, disrupted the creation and distribution of video content to consumers in numerous countries. It started in the 1990s as a mail-order service for DVD rentals. Consumers would order DVDs that they would receive by mail and then return through the mail after viewing. As a new entrant, its business model disrupted the video rental stores that occupied local street corners at the time. It now has about 200 million subscribers streaming content in 190 countries around the world and has dramatically changed video distribution and related markets – disrupting the businesses of large cable television providers and even affecting the theatrical exhibition of new, feature-length films.
 
III. The Digital Economy
The digital economy is very dynamic, and this dynamism is driven by the creation of the internet and the developments in microprocessors, memory, and optical fiber. Digital businesses have developed new products and services and developed new ways of delivering services to consumers, often through the use of new business models. Think of the feature rich communication services offered by apps on a cell phone, including arranging accommodations via Airbnb, ride-hailing via Lyft, food delivery via Deliveroo, or playing music via Spotify. By bypassing traditional channels and leveraging technological innovations, the digital economy has grown the overall productive capacity of the economy.
Leading businesses and new digital entrants compete with each other in a myriad of ways, leading to dynamic competition with various entities trying to out-innovate each other. Virtual (personal) assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana are pushing the boundaries of search. Sony, Facebook, and Microsoft are pushing the boundaries of Virtual Reality. Apple now challenges Intel in microprocessors and outpaces all of Switzerland in timepieces.3 Netflix rivals most of Hollywood in terms of both audience and content.4
Innovators, however, need not be large businesses, and disruptions can come from entrants that start with no scale in the market. As the Netflix example shows, size is no protection from competition in digitally enabled markets. Successful businesses in digital commerce need to maintain their innovative activity or they will be overtaken by other, more nimble and creative rivals.
 
IV. Competition Policy Tools and Dynamic Settings
A fundamental concept in competition law and economics is market power. How do you measure market power in the digital economy? Standard measures like mark-ups over cost have little meaning when services are offered to consumers for free, and market shares may have little meaning in dynamic settings. Market shares are often based on revenue, but revenue-based market shares are not informative when services are provided for free or in exchange for data. If competition is driven by rivalry among ecosystems, such as Android and Apple’s iOS together with the hardware, software, and services from many businesses that are associated with them, defining markets around a component of an ecosystem and calculating market shares for that component would miss much of the vibrancy of the competition between the ecosystems.5
In the merger context, for example, market shares need to be forward-looking because the analysis is usually about predicting the effects of a potential transaction in the future.6 Market shares that are snapshots of the present or compilations of the past are often assessed in the light of future projections and the competitive constraints arising from rivals, including any “mavericks” currently active in the market. Such projections may not mean much in digital markets when innovation is on-going and entry can come not only from adjacent markets but also from other areas entirely.
Before you can assess market shares, you need to know “shares of what”? Markets are defined as a tool to assist with the assessment of market power. They should capture the nature of the competitive situation facing businesses.7 Competition analysis typically views suppliers offering similar or identical products as being close competitors that place constraints on each other, and markets are defined around the supplies of these similar products or services. But if a fundamental driver of competition in the digital economy is innovation to offer new, potentially market redefining services, tools designed to define markets for industrial products will miss this core element of competition, especially if innovation may come from a range of different sources. A market defined in a manner that does not take primary methods of competition into account can no longer meaningfully inform competition enforcement or public policy.
Proposed new policy frameworks include abandoning measures of market power and instead focusing on size, with policy interventions targeted at the largest digital platforms because bigger platforms are viewed as wielding disproportionately more power in markets characterized by network effects and ‘winner-takes-all/most’ competitive dynamics. Competition law and economics has long recognized, however, that while size may be easy to measure, large firms can lack market power or face significant competition. One must remember that market power, not size, is a gating characteristic for successful market intervention. With vibrant dynamic competition, even a “winner-take-all/most” outcome is only temporary as entities look for means to develop better, more convenient, or higher value offerings for consumers, while seeking to displace the incumbent platforms (even if these platforms are “large” as measured by the number of users or some other metric).
In the absence of meaningful measures of market power, analysis should focus on traditional antitrust concepts based on evaluating the core competitive capabilities of the firm or firms involved and determining how scarce these resources are. In manufacturing, the key assets may be specific types of production facilities, and these may be few in number and difficult to replicate. This approach could be applied to the digital economy. It is conceivable that there are impossible to replicate advantages; where these are found, they are usually due to some form of government restriction.
Market power held by players in the digital economy due to their prior dynamic capabilities and strategic investments are not inherently objectionable, in the same way that a government granted exclusivity on patented technology is not objectionable. The rewards to successful innovation are what incentivizes innovative efforts, which benefits inventors, drives productivity growth, and develops and expands the broader economy. The policy question is whether there are barriers to dynamic competition, and, if so, what are they?
The key strategic assets and competitive strengths in the digital economy are the features that drive dynamic capabilities and investments in innovation: access to data scientists and programmers, deep R&D capabilities, creativity, an innovation culture, visionary management, willingness to adopt innovative business models,8 and a supportive policy and investment environment more generally. While the mix of assets and the strategic vision and other factors differ across firms, these assets are not bottlenecks in the traditional antitrust sense.
 
V. Conclusion
Innovation is critical for economic advancement and growth and is the key handmaiden of competition in the digital economy. While the proposals under consideration may on the surface appear to be targeting the market power of “gatekeeper” platforms, by failing to take into account the dynamic nature of the digital economy and the competition that flows from innovation, these proposals may instead serve only to limit the potential for future disruptive innovation and dynamic competition in the European economy. It would be tragic and ironic if the European authorities were to cripple innovation and competition in the name of advancing them. More static competition but less dynamic competition means anemic competition overall, less innovation, reduced productivity growth, lower wages, and lower growth in the overall economy. The risk of mistakes is high when the competitive dynamics of the digital economy at issue are poorly or only partially understood.

543,"December 10, 2020",Vertical Restraints in a Digital World,"
The subject of vertical restraints is well-trod territory in antitrust. Most of the cases, and economic literature, have focused, however, on the physical world of manufacturers and distributors. This paper considers what’s new and different about the digital world that matters for the antitrust analysis of vertical restraints. Cases and economic learning from the physical world remain highly relevant. What makes the digital world different is the prominence of intermediaries, most of which are multisided platforms, and the implications of the Internet and other information technologies for these intermediaries and the businesses that rely on them. After describing key features — including critical mass, multi-homing, and platform governance regimes — this paper considers important aspects of analyzing vertical restraints in the digital world. It then considers several applications involving platform rules, exclusive contracts, and MFNs for digital intermediaries.

544,"December 10, 2020",Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,"


By Jennifer Newstead (Vice President & General Counsel, Facebook)
Billions of people use Facebook’s products every day. To earn their time and attention, we compete fiercely against many other services across the world. As the internet has grown over the last 25 years, the ways in which people share and communicate have exploded thanks to dynamic competition. The most successful platforms mature and adapt to people’s changing preferences. Our products became and remain popular for this very reason — we constantly evolve, innovate and invest in better experiences for people against world-class competitors like Apple, Google, Twitter, Snap, Amazon, TikTok and Microsoft. We innovate and improve constantly because we have to.  
We provide many ways to communicate, share and connect — with people, businesses, news and entertainment. We also help millions of businesses reach and engage with their customers. More than 200 million businesses use our free tools and services to connect with customers, hire new employees and grow their businesses. Most of our advertisers are small businesses, many of whom have benefitted by moving online to reach their customers during the pandemic.   
The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general today attack two acquisitions that we made: Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. These transactions were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did. Both of these acquisitions were reviewed by relevant antitrust regulators at the time. The FTC conducted an in-depth “Second Request” of the Instagram transaction in 2012 before voting unanimously to clear it. The European Commission reviewed the WhatsApp transaction in 2014 and found no risk of harm to competition in any potential market. Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward because they did not threaten competition. 
Now, many years later, with seemingly no regard for settled law or the consequences to innovation and investment, the agency is saying it got it wrong and wants a do-over. In addition to being revisionist history, this is simply not how the antitrust laws are supposed to work. No American antitrust enforcer has ever brought a case like this before, and for good reason. The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today. And, notably, two FTC commissioners voted against the action that the FTC has taken today.  
Now the agency has announced that no sale will ever be final, no matter the resulting harm to consumers or the chilling effect on innovation. When we acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, we believed these companies would be a great benefit to our Facebook users and that we could help transform them into something even better. And we did. This lawsuit risks sowing doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s own merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the legal process. It would also punish companies for protecting their investment and technology from free-riding by those who did not pay for the innovation, making those companies less likely over the long term to make their platforms available to spur the growth of new products and services.

545,"December 1, 2020",32 Antitrust Advocates Ask Biden To Exclude Big-Tech Execs In New Admin,"


On Monday, November 30, in a letter, president elect Joe Biden was urged to reject the influence of Big Tech companies on his administration by 32 antitrust, consumer advocacy, labor, and related groups.
Biden’s transition team contains more tech executives than those opposed to tech influences, Reuters reported. That, to analysts, could indicate the kinds of thoughts that will influence his presidency.
The letter from the consumer advocates urged the incoming administration to exclude executives, lobbyists, and consultants who have been affiliated with Big Tech, including companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, or Microsoft. According to the letter, those companies’ practices have generally hurt the American consumer.
“We believe that eliminating the decades-old revolving door between Silicon Valley and your administration will only help your cause,” the letter stated, according to Reuters.
The letter also stated that the new administration “must confront the threats posed by the monopolistic Big Tech companies. … however, we can only bring these companies to account if you do not rely on affiliates of these very companies to make up your government,” according to Reuters.
Signatories include Public Citizen, American Economic Liberties Project, Open Markets Institute, Progressive Democrats of America, the Revolving Door Project, and Athena.

The Blue Cross Blue and Blue Shield Association (BCBS) and the health plan subscribers who brought an antitrust challenge to its business model got preliminary approval from a federal judge in Alabama for a US$2.67 billion settlement, reported Bloomberg Law.
Judge R. David Proctor gave his tentative blessing to the agreement, which would resolve the subscribers’ claims in the US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The suit accuses dozens of independent insurers affiliated with BCBS of illegally carving up the US health insurance market into regional “service areas” to avoid having to compete with one another.
The case had been brought on behalf of more than 1 million individual and corporate policyholders, whose policies covered tens of millions of Americans.
They alleged that the member companies violated the Sherman Act and other antitrust laws by, among other things, dividing up health insurance markets to avoid competing with each other.
Blue Cross Blue Shield stated its member companies cover more than 109 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the US population, including at major employers such as General Motors, Microsoft, and Walmart.

Thierry Breton, EU’s digital chief, says tech giants breaking the bloc’s new rules could face fines or more severe punishments like breaking up their European businesses, Reuters reported.
Breton is set to present the draft rules, called the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The new rules could affect major players including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
Under the DSA, companies will have to explain how their algorithms work, open up advertising archives for regulators and researchers, as well as do more to fight hate speech, damaging content, and fake products on their platforms. And the DMA will target online gatekeepers for new requirements such as sharing some kinds of data with rivals and regulators, and outlaw other practices such as favoring their own services over others’ products, along with sanctions, according to Reuters.
“We start with a fine, then you have a bigger fine, then you may have a temporary remedy, specific remedies, then you may have at the end of the day, what we have also in the competition rules, structural separation,” Breton said per reports, adding that breaking up a company would be the last resort.
Breton said the separation was “not an objective” of the rules and that it was just supposed to be an option in the case that it would be needed.
The laws are still only proposed for now, though, and will have to be approved after negotiations between The European Commission, the EU countries, and the European Parliament, Reuters reported.

548,"November 26, 2020",Antitrust Chronicle® – Data Portability,"
Dear Readers,
The question of data portability, in its many forms, has long been an antitrust issue. This stems back as far as the Microsoft interoperability cases of the 1990s, or even further (notably such as in telecoms markets).
Today, however, data portability has taken on even greater importance in antitrust discourse. Like many concepts, it is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, regulators wish to ensure that competitors are not foreclosed by dominant platforms who maintain walled gardens of data that erect barriers to entry. On the other hand, particularly in light of data protection rules such as those enacted in California and the EU, it has been recognized that consumers have a right to protect their own data, which renders complex the imposition of antitrust remedies mandating its portability. Mandating data portability can also create other unintended consequences, by potentially distorting companies’ incentives to innovate.
Navigating the strait between portability and consumer data protection will be one of the key dilemmas facing regulators in years to come.
The contributions to this volume plot a course through this dilemma by discussing the latest developments in both data portability around the world, and its interaction with other laws and regulations.
As always, thank you to our great panel of authors.
Sincerely,
CPI Team

Data portability (the ability to transfer data without affecting its content) and interoperability (the ability to integrate two or more datasets) significantly affect the use of data, with important implications for antitrust policy. Allowing for improved data portability can facilitate the ability of consumers to switch services, which would substantially increase competition. However, barriers to data portability can increase market power and be a major source of social inefficiency. This paper lays out the pros and cons of a move towards requirements of data interoperability and portability. Of further note is the need to account for the fact that increasing the scale and scope of data analysis can create negative externalities in the form of better profiling, increased harms to privacy, and cybersecurity risks.

Data portability is attracting attention, especially due to recent portability laws in Europe and California, and the hope that it can reduce the market power of digital platforms. This article discusses the potential pro-competitive and other benefits of new data portability requirements, including for lock-in effects, network effects, and barriers to entry. There are significant risks and costs from mandating portability, including privacy and cybersecurity risks if individuals’ personal data is not carefully protected. The discussion applies the framework of the Portability and Other Required Transfers Impact Assessment (“PORT-IA”) to antitrust law. The PORT-IA provides a structured set of relevant questions, to assist legislators, regulators, enforcement officials, and others to evaluate whether proposed mandatory data sharing is likely to be net beneficial. The article concludes with analysis of how the PORT-IA may appropriately be included in merger review, enforcement discretion, fashioning of remedies and other aspects of antitrust law.

Data portability has become a hot topic in competition law. Although some commentators have suggested that data portability represents low hanging fruit compared with more complex remedies such as interoperability, the debate about how to implement any such mandate, presumably under the essential facilities doctrine, remains underdeveloped. Key issues that remain unresolved include the impact of the distinction between structure and unstructured data on essentiality, the significance of regulatory regimes that can provide access to data, the tension between portability and privacy, and the difficulties associated with ordering, provisioning, compatibility, and standardization of data. Closer examination of these challenges reveals that data portability is not a panacea and that enforcement officials will have engage in the type of nuanced, fact-specific determinations that characterize classic antitrust analysis and the implicit limitations of the essential facilities doctrine.

Data portability has a hybrid nature. What emerged as a data protection concept is now also becoming part of policies aiming to stimulate competition and innovation. To reap the full benefits of data portability, this article argues that there is a need for regulators to steer its implementation and to provide guidance on how data controllers should handle tensions between different interests and overlapping legal entitlements. Data portability can empower individuals and business users to make better choices but more asymmetric enforcement is needed to ensure that data portability will stimulate competition. And as a tool to promote data-driven innovation, data portability is a necessary but probably not a sufficient condition to keep data-driven markets open to newcomers.

Mandatory access to digital platforms’ data is one of the remedies proposed to address potential failures in digital markets. In addition to the high costs of implementing a governance framework for data access, such remedy is likely to involve important trade-offs that should be carefully balanced by regulators. In particular, data access is likely to undermine competition on the merits and the incentives to offer services to consumers free of charge. Furthermore, it could distort companies’ incentives to innovate with user data. To avoid these unintended effects, this article proposes to focus instead on prohibiting exclusionary practices by large digital platforms.

Brennan Hawkings, an 11-year-old boy from Utah, was found after being lost for more than four days in rugged terrain at a Boy Scout camp.2 Brennan’s parents later discovered why it had taken so long to find him: he had avoided passers-by, including the search teams looking for him. The boy was afraid that someone would steal him, as he’d been told “not to talk to strangers.”
Brennan’s case is a textbook example of the so-called Law of Unintended Consequences. Not talking to strangers is a universal lesson taught by well-intentioned parents to protect their children. In the context of Brennan’s disappearance, however, it had the unintended effect of leaving him unprotected.

Big tech companies stated that confidential material they provided for the US government’s antitrust probe of Google should not be shared with the search giant’s in-house lawyers because the information is too sensitive, reported the Los Angeles Times. 
In a filing Friday in federal court in Washington, Apple said it gave the US Justice Department “competitively sensitive” documents and that allowing lawyers inside Google to see the information would result in “material harm” to Apple. A similar joint filing was made by Amazon, AT&T., Microsoft, Oracle, Comcast, Sonos, Duck Duck Go and T-Mobile.
Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google, alleging abuse of its power to thwart competition. The Justice Department and Google have clashed over the extent of access to information collected by the government before it sued. The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, has yet to rule on the issue.
The Justice Department has proposed allowing companies that provided information to designate their most sensitive documents as “highly confidential,” which would prevent access by Google’s in-house lawyers, according to court papers. The US argues that allowing the search giant to see the proprietary information would give Google even more power in the market than it already has.
“Disclosure of this information to Google would directly implicate future business dealings between Apple and Google, provide Google with a substantial advantage over Apple in negotiations, and potentially disadvantage competitor search engines that negotiate with Apple and other software providers,” Apple stated.

560,"November 1, 2020","Restoring Balance to Digital Competition – Sensible Rules, Effective Enforcement","

By Philip Marsden & Rupprecht Podszun1
 
The EU Commission is stepping up efforts to come up with new regulations for digital gatekeepers. Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager proposes a “New Competition Tool” and some form of “ex ante regulation” for platforms.
We offer proposals for sensible ex ante rules and enforcement frameworks to restore balance to digital competition. Other studies have established that there is a need for a better legal framework for digital gatekeepers. We now move on to the “how”:

How do we design new tools and regulation to correct market failures in relation to digital platforms before the abuses of market power happen?
How do we re-set the balance so that genuine innovation and choice prevail, and all businesses have an equal opportunity to compete in the marketplace?
How do we ensure that the best product wins, not just the platform that offers it?

Three principles should guide the search for new rules: freedom of competition, fairness of intermediation, and the sovereignty of economic actors to take their decisions autonomously. These principles are described intentionally as having a constitutional character and importance and thus should be the foundation of any new EU regulation in this area.
These principles inform our new Sensible Rules – or “Do’s and Don’ts” – which set out obligations and prohibitions relating to Platform Openness, Neutrality, Interoperability and On-platform Competition; Non-discrimination; Fair terms; Controllability of algorithmic decisions and Access to justice; and Access to information; Respect for privacy; Choice on the use of data, and Choice for customers; Simplicity, not Forcing.2
The most important part, however, is the stage of enforcement. What institutional design do we need? How do we enforce new rules? This is the core issue of the whole debate, not least since classic ex post antitrust enforcement takes too long and has achieved too little so far. Our proposal is the following:





The European Commission may trigger Market Investigations, conducted by an independent panel (the New Competition Tool). Such Market Investigations shall be modelled on the UK system with strict timelines, transparent processes and strong order-making powers.
A new Early Alerts Unit would be formed within DG COMP to monitor market developments, particularly movements to unnatural tipping, and the consequent ramifications for application of our Sensible Rules. This unit would report particularly when conditions are arising such that the New Competition Tool should be deployed.
A new Platform Compliance Unit in DG CNCT would be formed to ensure that the new rules remain fit for purpose given such market developments reported by the Early Alert Unit, including the rules’ interpretation and scope of application. These two units would work closely together to ensure the effective application of the new rules, including issuing guidance.
A new Platform Complaints Panel would be set up to deal swiftly and independently with private complaints of violations of the rules, e.g. regarding access to data.





Effective enforcement must keep pace with market dynamics, and requires sensible and flexible rules. As the underlying study underpinning our thinking was written during the German Presidency of the EU, and in the context of discussions leading up to enactment of a Digital Markets Act, and creation of a New Competition Tool, our proposals are necessarily European in institutional focus.  However, we welcome developments to create Digital Markets Units and ex ante regulation in other jurisdictions, and thus hope our proposals will offer inspiration for how all competition authorities and digital regulators can work best together to restore digital competition.
The reasons for new regulatory efforts vis-à-vis digital giants are obvious: Some market platforms and aggregators have tipped the balance of market power among themselves, and others – particularly small businesses and consumers. Some of the fundamentals of commerce have changed as business has moved to a digital environment. There are many benefits from this as well – in terms of increased opportunities from scale, scope and reaching new markets. Consumers have benefitted from greater choice, speed of delivery and a feeling of engagement, tailored solutions and even advertising. However, several government and academic studies and investigations have found violations of antitrust, consumer protection, and privacy law, including combinations of them all. Germany has been a leader in this regard, offering inspiring studies, targeted legislative amendments and leading investigations. Nevertheless, the problems are bigger than any one nation can remedy. And in many cases even European findings of infringements have not always been able to be remedied. They have attracted enormous fines, but only after long and tortuous litigation, with many appeals. And only rarely has the actual ill-conduct been remedied, and if then, all too late or in a piece-meal and incomplete manner.
The actual causes of these ills are asymmetric market power, not only between giant platforms and aggregators on the one hand, and small businesses and consumers on the other, but also as between the tech giants and government itself. The balance needs to be re-set, or a levelling of the regulatory playing field if you will. This calls for new thinking to address new problems, and new competition tools and asymmetric and ex ante regulation to address the growing and troubling asymmetry of market power and its resulting inequities. The crucial task is to implement this new and necessary set of instruments without undoing or jeopardizing the many benefits of the new digital environment, to do so “in real time,” and to do so in a way which ensures that competition law, consumer protection, and privacy guarantees are upheld and balanced. To do nothing is not an option. First, because the inequities of the imbalances of power will only worsen. Second, because this in turn would lead to political calls for vast regulatory change which could stultify what are undoubted exciting and vibrant markets. What is needed – we argue – are sensible rules, backed up with effective enforcement. Relying on ex post law enforcement is insufficient: we urgently need new rules, and new institutional capabilities to guarantee effective enforcement.
To make one point clear: A new regulatory approach is not the ultimate and only answer to the many transformations of digitization. European politicians need to do much more – incentivize innovation, create a digital infrastructure, take care of those left behind, or educate children in using digital tools. All this is beyond our study – the regulatory framework for gatekeepers is merely one part of restoring balance.
 
Rules for Effective Enforcement
Effective enforcement of ex ante rules relies on three key factors:



Compliance with these rules should be automatic and swift.
Enforcement requires new institutional capabilities, and a strong interplay between these functions and the responsible officers (e.g. both within and between DG COMP and DG CNCT, with national institutions, and market actors).
Rules need to be flexible enough so that they can be updated without legislative proceedings that are too complicated.



As such, we welcome enactment of a new Market Investigations Regime, as contemplated in the consultation for the New Competition Tool, implemented by DG COMP. We note insights from the similar tool in the UK show how it has already operated in some markets to impose interoperability and data portability remedies on platforms, accelerating innovation, technological development, and competition. Market investigations can be readily implemented at the EU level, including related to binding timelines, open processes, and independence of decision-making. The read-across between market investigations remedies, themselves a form of ex ante regulation, and a regulatory regime is clear. We see a need and opportunity for a strong interplay between market investigations by DG COMP, and evolving regulation, for example, by DG CNCT.
 
Securing the Interplay in Brussels
We propose a much stronger interplay between, in particular, DG COMP and DG CNCT in enforcing the new rules effectively.
Making the DGs act much more in concert means to look at their specific qualities: DG COMP is the only body in the European Commission having a vast experience in direct contacts with undertakings. Officials there are used to leading investigations, interpreting data, defining remedies and sanctions, sometimes battling with parties. Direct enforcement should rest with this body. DG CNCT and DG GROW are strong policy-making departments that have a broader view on economic and social needs in the EU. They can assure that the legal framework for platforms is not out of touch with two essential aims of this Commission: Building the digital single market and unleashing the power of digital innovation. They also have a view on the social costs that may come with certain platform behavior as well as with regulation. It is important to connect their policy-making power with the competition principles that are primarily pursued by DG COMP.
 
Market Investigations and Ex Ante Rules
Clearly, we support the introduction of a tool on the European level that is close to the Market Investigation tool in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The charm of these investigations is that the team looking at markets can investigate without prior infringement or suspicion of infringement. The focus is much broader: Do markets function? Such investigations start as a fact-gathering endeavor with all market participants joined at the table, and it moves to remedies that are discussed and may address individual undertakings, but also regulatory boundaries. We find it important that governments and the EU may also be targeted by such investigations and that the teams come up with suggestions of how to amend the market framework. In the UK, this has led to the much-applauded Open Banking initiative, for instance.
Equally clearly, while we view market investigations as a valuable addition to the Commission’s competition toolkit (with enforcement of Art. 101, 102 TFEU and merger control remaining in full force), they are unlikely to provide a complete solution to competition concerns in digital platforms. As such, the Commission’s proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large digital platforms is necessary. Ex ante rules in the form of do’s and don’ts provide clear guidance for companies. We need to move beyond the P2B-regulation with its requirements of transparency since transparency does not help if you are dependent or in an unfavorable bargaining position.
As such, and to assist both of its competition and regulatory initiatives, we recommend that the Commission establish two new units. First, at DG CNCT, a Platform Compliance Unit for new and specific regulatory obligations. And second, within DG COMP, an Early Alert Unit relating to tipping markets. Additionally, for the New Competition Tool, we propose to have independent Market Investigation Teams.



Market Investigation Teams
For Market Investigations with the New Competition Tool, we suggest that each investigation gets its own terms of reference and is conducted by an independent panel that is composed of experts – including, of course, Commission staff. The decisions of this panel should be independent.






The Platform Compliance Unit
At DG CNCT, a new “Platform Compliance Unit” would be formed that is competent for the ex ante regulation of platforms, monitoring platforms and issuing compliance orders, as well as forward-looking guidance. To this end, the P2B-regulation would have to be amended and turned into a regulation that provides a framework for digital platforms in the European Union.
In order to retain flexibility, the regulation should foresee two special features: Firstly, there should be a possibility to subject certain undertakings and sectors to a special rule (asymmetric regulation). Secondly, the Platform Compliance Unit would need some flexibility in defining new rules without going through the burdensome procedure of an amendment of an EU regulation. This speaks in favor of a more flexible legal provision that can be amended in an easier fashion. Such a rule could take the form of a delegated act, provided that the essential features of rules on remedying structural imbalances in markets are set forth in the basic regulation. New rules should be based on the outcome of a market investigation.
The Platform Compliance Unit would also be in a position to exempt certain platforms from some or all of the obligations. This will be particularly helpful for new market entrants or platforms with less deep pockets so that concentration processes of the large companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook) may have a counterweight in the market. Before declaring these obligations binding, the parties would of course be heard and the Early Alert Unit at DG COMP consulted.






The Early Alert Unit 
Within DG COMP, an Early Alert Unit would investigate where a tipping of markets is suspected of developing. To this aim, the Early Alert Unit should regularly monitor markets where it is likely that a platform may change the market structure in the near future. Such an investigation would not be as elaborate as a sector inquiry or a market investigation, but simply amount to a monitoring and largely be fueled by publicly available information and voluntary information provided from market players.
If the Early Alert Unit has indications that a competition for the market is going to take place and a “tipping” is likely in the near future, based on scenarios experienced so far, it could suggest that the set of substantive rules are made binding for the relevant platform and be complied with. This would require early communication and concurring decision-making with the Platform Compliance Unit at DG CNCT. This is not to hamstring a nascently successful platform, or impede it from growing swiftly to a position of genuine success, or what we call natural tipping. But that growth must not be through anti-competitive acts or features for example, through exclusionary acts, banning multi-homing, self-preferencing, or non-transparent practices or misuse of data, nor must the tipping itself jeopardize the effective functioning of markets, through, for example, exclusionary or exploitative behavior.



 
An example of the interplay
We foresee the Early Alert Unit as having the ability to identify the causes of tipping markets, engage with platforms and others to identify the extent to which a further market investigation is warranted, and throughout be able to engage with the Platform Compliance Unit in DG CNCT, to ensure that reasonable rules have been complied with during the platform’s growth. The role of the Early Alert Unit could thus be described as that of an investigatory arm of DG CNCT’s Platform Compliance Unit. The Early Alert Unit’s function extends to recommending a market investigation. If it appears that behavior is occurring that involves a violation of our rules, and this is contributing to the platform’s growth and a potential unnatural tipping of the market, then the solution is not to await another two years of further market investigation. The first act instead is to communicate with the Platform Compliance Unit and get the rules obeyed, and the platform in compliance. This may avoid the rationale for a market investigation and its attendant delay for worthwhile remedies. The operating principle throughout should always be to remedy problems as expeditiously as possible, ideally through mandating compliance with our ex ante rules. To enable quick measures, an appeal against such a compliance order would not have suspensive effect unless otherwise ordered by the courts.
The Early Alert Unit would also be able to propose new substantive rules for the platform regulation to the Platform Compliance Unit at DG CNCT. The proposal would also be vetted by DG COMP’s Chief Economist Team and the Legal Service before being made to DG CNCT. DG CNCT would have an obligation to consider and reply substantively to the proposal within a set period of time.
The Early Alert Unit should closely cooperate with national competition agencies and could delegate some of its market monitoring powers to these authorities depending on usual principles of effectiveness. In this regard a more active engagement of the European Competition Network is viewed as useful, as well as proportionate.
Ex ante rules and compliance with them can be monitored by the Platform Compliance Unit, akin to a supervisory function, but there needs to be an actual enforcement mechanism to handle disputes, as well as build up precedent.



The Platform Complaints Panel We suggest introducing a Platform Complaints Panel that works like an arbitration mechanism or an ombudsperson for platforms. It should draw on independent adjudicators, potentially with experience in the sectors affected, and offer a rapid remedy to violations that are observed by market participants. The system would thus give a quick remedy to those who wish to stop certain practices by the operator at fast pace. Instead of leaving this to the public judiciary or the Platform Compliance Unit that may be easily overburdened or to an arbitration mechanism set up by the platform operator, it would be best to have an independent panel to regulate the claims. Upon direction by the Platform Compliance Unit, certain platforms of a particular status would be subjected to submitting to such a panel. In this regard we recommend a standing panel of independent adjudicators, supported by staff from DG CNCT, and with powers to decide on complaints brought by private parties where an allegation of a breach of the rules is made. This Platform Complaints Panel would operate swiftly, relying on a paper-based adjudication mechanism with strict timelines, with the only operating principle being to identify whether a platform is in violation of the rules, identify any objective justifications, and order corrective measures if necessary to restore competition. Appeals may be on the merits, but would necessarily be swift, given the adjudicative approach intended.
The panel would be competent to deal with individual concerns and complaints relating to conflicts of users with the platform, but also users on the platform with each other. A typical example may be that a supplier of goods on a marketplace complains that the platform does not disclose transaction data as required in a possible ex ante rule. The Platform Complaints Panel would look at the case and order a quick remedy for the parties.



 
Conclusion
In our view, it is necessary to define the principles first that should govern our vision of living in a digitized economy. We stick to the principles of free competition, fair intermediation, and sovereignty of users in decision-making. This leads to sensible rules – in the following Appendix – that have to be respected by platforms due to the unique characteristics of digital platforms (operating with network effects and large amounts of data). These rules, often coming from individual competition cases, should go into an ex ante-rulebook for platforms. Whether all platforms should be targeted in the same way is a different question. We think that some rules may extend to all digital platforms, some platforms may be exempted, remedies may be tougher for large gatekeepers.
Secondly, it is vital to model the New Competition Tool according to the experiences in the United Kingdom with the Market Investigation Tool. The advantage of such a regime is that it enables the body to look into the whole market without biases or pre-determination. It also makes sure to come up with tailored remedies that at a next stage could go into the rulebook as ex ante rules. Obviously, certain safeguards for this regime are vital. In particular, we advocate to make the panel conducting a market investigation largely independent from other institutions and to have external experts on board.
The third pillar of effective enforcement is a regime that is tailored to the deficits with competition cases in the platform economy. Since competition law enforcement proved to take too long, we advocate an interplay of DG CNCT overseeing the reasonable ex ante rules and DG COMP as the strong enforcement body of the Commission. We wish to secure their interplay combining their strengths. An Early Alert Unit is to be set up at DG COMP to step in where a platform is about to gain a “winner takes it all” position. A Platform Compliance Unit is to be set up at DG CNCT dealing with policy and the ex ante rules for platforms. Both bodies need a close cooperation mechanism. Finally, enforcement should foresee a Platform Complaints Panel that resolves the issues of compliance with the help of market participants in a swift manner. These three bodies strictly address only situations where there is a structural imbalance of powers.
The ideas sketched in this paper are just that – ideas. They do not represent a final conclusion, but are an invitation to discuss with public and private stakeholders how the institutional set-up could be further developed to be fit for the platform economy.
 

Appendix
Sensible rules



Rules for free competition
Openness: Platforms must not impose undue restrictions on the ability of users of the platform (business or consumers) to use other providers that compete with the platform or to compete with the platform themselves. 
This rule is aimed at exclusivity arrangements. Such arrangements can take the form of direct contractual obligations or indirect obligations having the same effect or technical restrictions that make it impossible to switch to other providers without a substantial loss.  A particular form of this affecting suppliers and customers are attempts to hinder portability of data. If customers cannot move their acquired information, contacts, etc. to another platform or service provider, competition will not be possible.
Neutrality: Platforms must not mislead users or unduly influence competitive processes or outcomes by employing means to self-preference their own services or products (or where the platform derives a commercial benefit) over services or products of competitors. 
Such a differential treatment, for instance through rankings that are based on the profitability for the intermediary platform, may be misleading for customers, drain companies that depend on the platform and harm competition. The rationale for this rule can be found in the Google Search (Shopping) case, the practice is also currently under investigation in the complaint by Spotify against Apple.
Interoperability: Platforms must make it possible for undertakings to build products that are interoperable. 
Interoperability guarantees competition, it must not be unreasonably restricted. Similarly, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) must be open so that third party technology can be integrated and become a competitive tool. Interoperability has become key in the digital economy – where this does not work, the provider of the foreclosed technology will be able to set up technological lock-ins for suppliers and customers. Interoperability is an established feature of competition law ever since the Microsoft case.
On-platform competition: Platforms that have created marketplaces must ensure that there is free on-platform competition.
If, for instance, competitors agree on prices or discriminate against others, it is the platform operator who needs to take the first steps. This may be a matter for competition by design (taking technological precautions, for instance against the visibility of certain information for other suppliers) or a part of the liability of the organizer of a forum for what happens in that forum. Whoever makes the rules in a marketplace needs to respect the ordre public – including antitrust rules.



 



Rules for fairness of intermediation
Non-discrimination: Platforms must not discriminate against individual suppliers seeking access to the platform, and may only base any exclusion on substantive, transparent, and objective grounds.
In a scenario where one platform won the race for organizing the market, competition takes place at the periphery. Suppliers of goods and services need to get access to the platform. In such a gatekeeper situation, discrimination would amount to foreclosure of the market for specific suppliers. It would no longer be the customer who acts as the referee in the market, but the platform operator. Competition on the merits would be reduced. Such kinds of discrimination are viewed critically in competition law.
Fair terms: Platforms must trade on fair and reasonable contractual terms, without exploitative pricing or acts
The basic assumption of contract law is that the contractual partners meet on a level playing field and thus are able to secure a win-win-situation. Where one partner has such a structural advantage that the bargaining position is completely out of balance, the law needs to step in and find remedies.
Controllability of algorithmic decisions, AI and reviews: Platforms must be transparent and fair about the working of their algorithms – and this needs to be controllable. 
Platforms may have considerable influence over the businesses of suppliers using the platform to match with customers. If such platforms change their terms & conditions, their rankings or other parameters, they may spark a domino effect for companies using the platform. The most stunning examples can be found where ranking algorithms are changed and thus companies tumble in their positions, making it virtually impossible for some to reach out to customers.
Access to justice: Platforms must submit to an independent arbitration mechanism.
Market actors enjoy the right to seek redress if there are conflicts with business partners. Since the public judiciary is often too slow and too costly for many disputes, platforms should bind themselves to an arbitration system – for disputes between the platform and users (be it commercial or consumers), but also for disputes among users of the platform.



 



Rules for sovereignty of decision-making
Access to information: Platforms must give access to customer and transaction data to the suppliers involved in that transaction.
Platforms squeeze in between suppliers and consumers. For companies offering goods or services this means that they may lose the interface with their customers. Information and transactions are often operated by the platform in a way that does not necessarily guarantee a flow of relevant information to the supplier. This means that important business signals (such as price data) may be lost. Therefore, platforms must give access to customer and transaction data to the suppliers involved in that transaction. This idea forms part of the Amazon investigations and is also to be found in Section 19a of the German Draft Bill.
Respect privacy: Platforms must offer a real choice on the use of data (which data, which application, which sources, combination of data). 
As the German Federal Court of Justice has argued, this is not just a matter of privacy rules, but – as in the Facebook case – a matter for competition and constitutional law. As a starting point, platforms need to keep the use of data in line with the principle of data minimization (only asking for the data essential for the service) unless customers had a real choice to decide otherwise.
Give a choice: Platforms must allow customers to take decisions. 
These decisions should relate to the most important economic decisions: What services to use, how to spend money. The more such decisions are taken by the operator, the more users and suppliers are driven out of their decision-making capacity (example: introduction of a payment service that has to be used mandatorily, or providing a browser with the operating system without leaving the user a real choice). As in the Microsoft browser case, offering a drop-down-menu may serve as a countermeasure.
Keep it simple: Platforms must give users the service they ask for, but not impose mandatory extensions of service.
Again, this follows from the line of reasoning set out be the German Federal Court of Justice in the Facebook case. Providing all sorts of services, usually aiming at making the customer more dependent or incentivize her to stay for longer in the digital ecosystem, resembles the problem of illegal tying: Competition on the merits is again replaced by the use of leverage effects. Remedies include a fair design of default modes so that informed customer choice is really facilitated.

561,"October 30, 2020",Diversification Is At The Heart Of Competition,"
By: Richard N. Langlois (Truth on the Market)
Market share has long been the talisman of antitrust economics.  Once we properly define what “the product” is, all we have to do is look at shares in the relevant market.  In such an exercise, today’s high-tech firms come off badly.  Each of them has a large share of the market for some “product.” What I appreciate about Nicolas Petit’s notion of “moligopoly” is that it recognizes that genuine competition is a far more complex and interesting phenomenon, one that goes beyond the category of “the product.”
In his chapter 4, Petit lays out how this works with six of today’s large high-tech companies, adding Netflix to the usual Big Five of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.  If I understand properly, what he means by “moligopoly” is that these large firms have their hands in many different relevant markets.  Because they seem to be selling different “products,” they don’t seem to be competing with one another.  Yet, in a fundamental sense, they are very much competing with one another, and perhaps with firms that do not yet exist.  
In this view, diversification is at the heart of competition.  Indeed, Petit wonders at one point whether we are in a new era of “conglomeralism.”  I would argue that the diversified high-tech firms we see today are actually very unlike the conglomerates of the late twentieth century.  In my view, the earlier conglomerates were not equilibrium phenomena but rather short-lived vehicles for the radical restructuring of the American economy in the post- Bretton Woods era of globalization.  A defining characteristic of those firms was that their diversification was unrelated, not just in terms of the SIC codes of their products but also in terms of their underlying capabilities.  If we look only at the products on the demand side, today’s high-tech firms might also seem to reflect unrelated diversification.  In fact, however, unlike in the twentieth-century conglomerates, the activities of present-day high-tech firms are connected on the supply side by a common set of capabilities involving the deployment of digital technology…

562,"October 30, 2020","How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria (or, say, Big Tech)","
By: Pinar Akman (Chilling Competition)
Nicolas Petit’s book Big Tech and the Digital Economy comes at a time of increasingly polarised and politicised debates on how one solves a “problem” like big tech.[1] It presents a meticulously studied anatomy of six big tech companies – Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix. It offers nuanced prescriptions of what one can do about this group of companies, which displays levels of growth, size, and market capitalisation that are unheard of in economic history. Petit’s proposals are primarily aimed at competition law and regulation, but the book has a wide scope that will be of appeal to a broader audience due to the book’s incorporation of management, technology, economics, and different areas of law such as tax and data protection.
Petit’s book easily distinguishes itself from the crowd by its clear-headed inquiry into whether there is a problem with big tech and, if so, what competition law can and should do about it. His analysis is objective, yet critical, unlike the – what Petit calls – “airport books” on the topic, where everyone can find a narrative about what’s right or wrong with big tech to suit her personal taste or “echo chamber”. Petit’s book, in contrast, displays the best qualities of public discourse on a subject of contemporary significance (such as open-mindedness), whilst avoiding the worst (such as the ad hominem). It is both very accessible for the non-specialist and full of thought-provoking ideas for the specialist. This particular piece will discuss one such important and interesting theory put forward in the book, namely that traditional antitrust principles modelled on “rivalry” should be abandoned or radically altered in digital markets.[2]
According to Petit, the protection of rivalry is not always socially beneficial in industries with increasing returns to adoption, such as the digital markets under scrutiny.[3] Petit’s theory is premised on the idea that “in industries with increasing returns, economic forces … produce incentives on structural monopoly firms to compete by indirect entry in untipped markets, and avoid privately and socially inefficient rivalry in tipped markets”.[4] According to Petit, “[r]ivalry in tipped markets is privately inefficient because it is very costly for the direct entrant, and it is socially inefficient when there are increasing returns to scale due to rising marginal benefits”.[5] Thus, “[a] sound antitrust regime should … preserve competitive pressure on monopoly firms in markets that have tipped and in which incentives to indirect entry have therefore disappeared”.[6] One implication is that “antitrust should focus on cases of harm to competition in markets that have tipped, and be more forgiving toward the leveraging of market power in untipped markets”…

Hi there. I am delighted to be here today on the CPI session to engage with some of our best and brightest thinkers on this topic of digital platforms. As moderator, I will certainly try to avoid offering my views, but should I fail to do so, they are my own.
Another point on my moderating role, I think many of you saw the traffic after the first presidential debate suggesting that the moderator should have been any mother who had been home with her children since March. In that spirit and without the ability to benefit from a mute button for speakers, I’ll just note that I have spent several months as a single parent working for the FTC teaching at night and dealing with two rowdy boys. Speakers you are forewarned.
Our panel today is going to talk about regulation. This is part of a four series CPI event that has looked at whether our innate trust tools are sufficient, online advertising, I think we’re going to address open versus closed ecosystems later in the week. But today we’re talking about regulation and you’ve just heard Senator Klobuchar’s remarks.

564,"October 27, 2020",FTC fit to its purpose: responding to Kovacic’s market investigation proposal,"
The U.S. antitrust agencies function as law enforcers and competition advocates. Giving the Federal Trade Commission market investigation and  remedy  powers  like  those  of  the  UK’s  Competition  and  Markets  Authority would transform the FTC into a market regulator. This kind of authority would be a poor fit for the FTC, given the very different history and context of the U.S. economy and laws – particularly the role of judicial process. The agency should focus on using its existing market study tools to remain abreast of market developments, to guide its own enforcement initiatives, and to provide input to sectoral regulators and legislative bodies on how to enhance competition.

The idea that “antitrust is law enforcement, it’s not regulation,” 4 has become a bipartisan staple of remarks delivered by chairs of the Federal Trade Commission and Assistant Attorneys General for Antitrust at the Department of Justice.

The  recent  hearings  on  digital  markets  rest  upon  the  assumption  that  these markets exhibit unique attributes that the current version of the antitrust  laws  cannot  address.  Specifically,  proponents  of  revising  the  antitrust laws argue first, that there are unique competitive issues with digital  markets  that  are  likely  to  entrench  dominant  firms  and  retard  innovation; second, that digital markets are not behaving in a compet-itive manner; and third, the antitrust laws should be modified to deal with the unique issues in these markets. The truth that digital markets are not unique, except for the fact that there is actually far more entry in these markets than in other sectors of the economy.  Indeed, it seems that that those pushing for reform to the antitrust laws have a broader goal  in  mind,  namely  to  bring  large  American  companies  to  heel  re-gardless of whether they are in the tech sector or not.  Such new rules and regulations are likely retard innovation and investment throughout the American economy, making it potentially easier for less innovative and lower quality competitors to compete, a result that is most certainly harmful to American consumers and the economy as a whole.

Judges can be too demanding of plaintiffs and thereby stymie meritorious cases, but that is not what happened in FTC v. Qualcomm. The FTC challenged several of Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and sought to reduce the royalties it collected from makers of cellular devices. But the litigation failed to elicit a cogent economic theory explaining how the tactics Qualcomm used to obtain higher royalties had the effect of undermining  competition  among  modem  chip  suppliers,  as  the  FTC  alleged. The Ninth Circuit kept antitrust out of matters dealt with by contract and patent law. If the Democrats are swept into power, courts might find it necessary to keep antitrust out of all sorts of matters.

The majority staff of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law recently published detailed allegations of anticompetitive conduct against four tech giants — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.2 The antitrust cognoscenti might be reminded of the 50th Congress, when the House Committee on Manufacturers published hearings on four industrial giants — the Cotton Bagging Trust, the Standard Oil Trust, the Sugar Trust, and the Whisky Trust. Senator John Sherman followed up with his anti-trust bill on the first day of next Congress, and after extensive revision, the Sherman Act became law on July 2, 1890.3

567,"October 27, 2020",We Need Rules to Rein in Big Tech,"
What  should  the  US  do  about  Big  Tech?    This  essay  proposes  antitrust  rule-making  by  the  Federal  Trade  Commission.    Case-by-case  litigation  is too slow and too piecemeal, and the Sherman Act jurisprudence is too conservative.  Break-ups  are  unlikely  to  be  ordered;  even  divestitures  of  anticompetitive  acquisitions  may  prove  difficult  to  implement  where  a  platform  has  deeply  integrated  those  acquisitions  into  its  operations.    Legislative restructuring and a required separation of functions raise the need  for  on-going  supervision  and  the  potential  for  regulatory  capture.    In comparison, the FTC is an established agency with competition as a core mission.  It already has significant evidence of Big Tech’s economic power  and  how  they  use  it  to  stifle  competition  and  take  advantage  of  people as consumers, users, and budding competitors. The FTC uniquely has  power  over  anticompetitive,  unfair,  and  anti-consumer  tactics,  can  address the problems holistically, and can best assure that Big Tech plays by  the  rules.    With  rule-making  proceedings,  the  United  States  would  finally join the international conversation over how to deal with the global challenge that Big Tech platforms present.

Antitrust sits at the cusp today. That is driven at least in part by the rise of the great digital tech firms of the day and uncertainty about whether antitrust is the right tool to respond to the issues that they raise. And the fact that these firms operate at scale across the planet means that there is a shared focus for antitrust regulators across the globe.

As I write this, we are seven months into the global coronavirus pandemic and the feared fall second wave seems to have arrived with no obvious end in sight. China’s economy seems to be growing, but other economies are stalled or shrinking as consumers shrink back from a host of normal economic activities. And it is roughly one week before the 2020 U.S. election. There is certainly the possibility of a new President and a new Democratic majority in the Senate (it seems almost certain the Democrats will retain the House).
The House antitrust subcommittee recently released its enormous report on its sixteen-month investigation into digital marketplaces. On Tuesday, October 20, 2020, the long-awaited U.S. antitrust case against Google finally arrived. It is clearly the most significant U.S. antitrust case in the tech section since the 1998 case against Microsoft. That case, of course, would ultimately find that Microsoft had illegally maintained its operating system monopoly in its eff...

569,"October 26, 2020",Possible Problems in the Google Case,"

By Gregory J. Werden & Luke M. Froeb1
 
Google invented neither the search engine nor the Internet browser, but it made them better. Competing on the merits, Google overcame Microsoft’s substantial incumbency advantages and displaced it as the dominant incumbent. At a cost of billions of dollars each year, Google provides and improves services that make it the third most trusted brand in American (behind the United States Postal Service and Amazon). To give up all on-line search and maps, the median American (in 2017) must be paid $21,178 per year.
The complaint filed by the Department of Justice and 11 states echoes the Microsoft case by alleging that Google has monopoly positions in search and search advertising which Google protects with anticompetitive tactics. The complaint has been criticized for not going further, but it states a case that seeks to take advantage of a causation standard for monopoly maintenance so low that the D.C. Circuit’s liability opinion in Microsoft described it as “edentulous.” Even so, Judge Mehta could get hung up on some points.
The complaint stresses the inability of small rivals to compete because they lack scale, and it alleges that Google’s practices block small rivals from achieving scale. But the complaint does not allege that Google’s small rivals had a plausible path to obtaining scale in the absence of all the challenged practices. If every computer and mobile device were preloaded with every search engine and browser, the vast majority of users likely would choose Google’s search engine and browser.
Among other things, the complaint alleges that Google pays makers of mobile devices and mobile service providers to promote usage of Google search. A striking allegation in the complaint is that Apple charges Google $8-12 billion per year to use its search engine. One might wonder whether Apple is the real gatekeeper and Google is just paying the price of admission.
The foundational allegation of the complaint is that “For both mobile and computer search access points, being preset as the default is the most effective way for general search engines to reach users, develop scale or remain competitive.” And the complaint acknowledges that Microsoft takes advantage of its monopoly in PC operating systems to promote its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Yet statcounter reports that Google has an 81.5 percent share in U.S. desktop search engines, while Bing has just a 12.1 percent share. Being preset as a default either does confer a big advantage on Bing, or Google overcomes that advantage through competition on the merits.
The obvious remedy would bar Google from buying distribution. The big loser could be Apple, and the loss of Google’s payments would act like a cost increase throughout the mobile device supply chain, so consumer prices likely would rise. Microsoft stands to benefit significantly, as it has the second most popular search engine and browser. The impact on Google is least clear, but it could come out ahead: Google could save billions of dollars a year in payments yet experience only a modest decline in usage.
The complaint asserts that “Google’s practices are anticompetitive under long-established antitrust law,” but antitrust law has not come to grips with monopolies in free services. An earlier monopoly claim against Google brought by KinderStart.com was dismissed, in part, on the basis that free Internet search could not be a monopoly under antitrust law. But conventional antitrust principles can be applied to free search with careful modification to account for monetization through advertising.
The complaint misapprehends application of the hypothetical monopolist test (“HMT”) to free search. The HMT made market delineation into a market power inquiry. Because market power normally is exercised by raising prices, the HMT asks whether a profit-maximizing monopolist would raise price, or perhaps whether an actual monopolist already did. Although a search monopolist would maximize profits by charging monopoly prices for advertising, the complaint omits the profit maximization and alleges that a hypothetical monopolist “would be able to maintain quality below the level that would prevail in a competitive market.”
A curious aspect of the government’s complaint is the public bemoaning of the fact that Google instructed employees not to use language that the government otherwise would have quoted. Antitrust plaintiffs love to invite the inference of anticompetitive motivation from small snippets taken from memos and emails. But the government cannot be inviting the inference of anticompetitive motivation from the absence of the usual snippets, so what is the point?
It also is unclear what the government hopes to achieve. History suggests that, no matter what is accomplished, the Biden Administration can be accused of selling out the American people in the 2024 election campaign. As President, William Howard Taft presided over the breakups of American Tobacco and Standard Oil in 1911. In the 1912 presidential election campaign, both Wilson and Roosevelt lambasted Taft for selling out the American people, and Taft got just 8 electoral votes (compared to 321 in 1908).
While any remedy is unlikely to satisfy the public, any rationale in the liability ruling is unlikely to satisfy the antitrust bar. In the platform context, legitimate competitive practices can look like illegitimate anticompetitive practices because network expansion lowers cost and improves quality. According to the complaint, Google increases the quality of it services by enlarging its user base and the best way to do that is through the sort of arrangement the government challenges. No one should expect the legal guidance from this case to be either clear or clearly in the consumer’s interest.

572,"October 22, 2020","Forget Antitrust Laws. To Limit Tech, Some Say a New Regulator Is Needed.","


By Steve Lohr, New York Times
For decades, America’s antitrust laws — originally designed to curb the power of 19th-century corporate giants in railroads, oil and steel — have been hailed as “the Magna Carta of free enterprise” and have proved remarkably durable and adaptable.
But even as the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday for unlawfully maintaining a monopoly in search and search advertising, a growing number of legal experts and economists have started questioning whether traditional antitrust is up to the task of addressing the competitive concerns raised by today’s digital behemoths. Further help, they said, is needed.
Antitrust cases typically proceed at the stately pace of the courts, with trials and appeals that can drag on for years. Those delays, the legal experts and economists said, would give Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple a free hand to become even more entrenched in the markets they dominate.
A more rapid-response approach is required, they said. One solution: a specialist regulator that would focus on the major tech companies. It would establish and enforce a set of basic rules of conduct, which would include not allowing the companies to favor their own services, exclude competitors or acquire emerging rivals and require them to permit competitors access to their platforms and data on reasonable terms.

On Tuesday, October 20, the US Department of Justice sued Google over charges that its search and advertising empire violated federal antitrust laws, finding after a year-long investigation that the tech giant wrongfully wielded its digital dominance to the detriment of corporate rivals and consumers, reported the Washington Post.
In its complaint, the Justice Department makes sweeping allegations that Google has stifled competition to maintain its powerful position in the marketplace for online search and search advertising. 
Eleven states, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas,  joined the suit, according to the complaint.
The Justice Department did not explicitly ask a judge to break apart Google as part of its complaint, though it did request the court consider “structural relief” — which theoretically could include a requirement that the company sell a portion of its business. In doing so, government lawyers invoked the specter of the government’s last major antitrust challenge against a tech giant, its years-long war with Microsoft, in making the case that Google violated the Sherman Act.
“Absent a court order, Google will continue executing its anticompetitive strategy, crippling the competitive process, reducing consumer choice, and stifling innovation,” the Department of Justice alleged in its complaint, adding, “For the sake of American consumers, advertisers, and all companies now reliant on the internet economy, the time has come to stop Google’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition.”

576,"October 12, 2020",Opening the Black Box: An Analysis of Google’s Behavior in Search and Display Advertising Using Large-Scale Datasets,"
This article summarizes three quantitative pieces of analysis using large transaction-level datasets that the CMA undertook in a recent market study into online platforms and digital advertising. These are: a comparison of Google and Bing’s search advertising prices; an analysis of Google’s fees from providing advertising intermediation services; and an assessment of the value of targeting digital advertising through the use of third-party cookies. We find that Google’s search advertising prices are 30-40 percent higher than Bing’s on a like for like basis, while Google’s fees for advertising intermediation services are broadly comparable with those of its competitors. Regarding the value of user data for targeting, we find that blocking access to third-party cookies reduces publisher revenue by around 70 percent. We expect that this form of analysis will become an increasingly important aspect of regulatory oversight of digital markets in the future, as it can provide highly valuable insights into the working of the often-opaque algorithms that increasingly drive digital market outcomes.

By Simeon Thornton, Chris Jenkins, Giacomo Mason & Dan Griffiths1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) conducted a market study into online platforms and digital advertising in the UK between July 2019 and July 2020.2 Our aim was to assess the state of competition in the sector, and to analyze the sources and implications of market power of the large platforms funded by digital advertising – notably Google and Facebook. The market study concluded that there was a need for pro-competition ex ante regulation of digital platforms to address the exploitation of market power by the large platforms and to implement remedies to increase competition in specific markets.
Some other recent studies have drawn similar high-level conclusions and also made a case for regulatory reform, including the Furman and Stigler Center reviews in the UK and U.S. respectively.3 However, one thing our study was able to do that was not possible in these other exercises was to undertake detailed empirical analysis of very large-scale datasets in order to assess the extent of the concerns in relation to online platforms and the size of the detriment arising from them. This sort of in-depth analysis can provide a robust quantitative evidence base for assessing the case for interventions to address competition concerns in relation to online platforms, and is required in order to move beyond high level prescriptions and diagnoses to detailed design and implementation of the new regulatory regime.
When conducting a market study, the CMA has statutory information-gathering powers to require parties to provide data and other information. Using these powers, we compiled several large transaction-level datasets which allowed us to carry out detailed empirical analysis in a number of areas.4 This article summarizes three quantitative pieces of analysis we undertook in the study which use large transaction-level datasets and which focus specifically on the behavior of Google in search and display advertising markets:

A “like for like” comparison of the search advertising prices of Google and Bing;
An analysis of Google’s fees from providing advertising intermediation services; and
An assessment of the value of targeting digital advertising through the use of third-party cookies

For each exercise, we set out the objectives of the analysis, summarize the data collected and the analysis undertaken, and discuss the results and implications for the study findings. Part of our aim in the market study was to demonstrate the type of data analysis that might be carried out by a future regulator of digital markets, and in the conclusion, we set out some considerations that should be taken into account in undertaking this future work.
 
II. COMPARISON OF GOOGLE AND BING SEARCH ADVERTISING PRICES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
A key question for our study was whether the market power of the large platforms leads to higher prices for advertisers. Consumers using online platforms such as Google and Facebook typically do not pay directly for the service; instead they provide attention and data which are monetized by the platforms through the sale of advertising. We would expect platforms with market power to be able to earn higher returns than their competitors from digital advertising.5
We tested this hypothesis in relation to search advertising by comparing the UK search advertising prices of Google, which accounts for more than 90 percent of search queries and search advertising revenues in the UK, with those of Bing, its main competitor in the UK, which has less than 10 percent of revenues and queries in the UK.
Google, Bing and other search engines sell advertising based on the search query entered by the user. Advertisers bid to display adverts in response to specific search “keywords.” When a user enters a particular search query, the search engine determines which advert(s) to show using a real-time auction, taking account of the price bid by the advertiser, relevance of the advert to the search query, and other quality factors. Search adverts are typically sold on a cost per click (“CPC”) basis, where the advertiser only pays if a user clicks on the ad link.
The main challenge for our analysis was how to compare prices on a like-for-like basis. CPC varies significantly by search query (i.e. some search queries have much higher commercial value than others), so a simple comparison of average CPC across all search terms would be affected by differences in the mix of search queries seen by Google and Bing. Similarly, we would expect CPC to vary based on the position of the ad on the page (i.e. a higher ad position is more valuable), and on the device type used (mobile vs desktop). We therefore collected transaction data on search events from Google and Bing as described below, to allow us to control for these factors and identify price differences on a more comparable basis. To our knowledge, this is the first time an analysis of this type has been carried out using a comprehensive dataset from more than one party, allowing for like-for-like comparisons to be made.
B. Data Collected
The CMA collected data for all the (3 – 4 billion) search events made in the UK on Google and Bing during a single week in 2020. For the purposes of the analysis, each search that is undertaken on a search engine is regarded as a “search event.” The text that is associated with a search event is a “query.” Many queries are associated with multiple search events. The set of queries that remain once duplicates have been removed are “distinct queries.” The “frequency” of a distinct query is how many times it appears in the dataset.
For each search event, the CMA could observe: (i) basic characteristics of the user’s device, such as operating system platform (mobile, tablet, or desktop) and browser; (ii) number of text ads (ad load), number of clicks, and total revenue; (iii) for the top text ad (the one appearing in the highest position), the cost per click (“CPC”) and the price-bid ratio (“PBR”) – defined as the ratio between the amount actually paid by the advertiser and the what the winning advertiser had actually bid. CPC and PBR were only observed when the top ad was clicked.
C. Results and Implications
We compared the prices of queries that were observed by both Google and Bing, and calculated the results separately for queries on desktop and mobile, to yield results that can be compared “like-for-like” on a query basis. This allowed us to isolate differences in market outcomes, rather than capturing differences in the scale or distribution of queries across Google and Bing. The results from our analysis were striking. We found that top text ads on Google have a CPC that is on average 30 to 40 percent higher than Bing on both desktop and mobile, for comparable queries where the top ad was clicked.
Differences in the CPC of Google and Bing at the query level may be in part driven by differences in the perceived value of a click between Google and Bing. This may be due, for example, to differences in advertiser or audience composition (e.g. one search engine attracts more valuable users and/or advertisers) or differences in the ability of the search engine to interpret search intent and serve relevant ad results that are more likely to lead to conversions.
To address this issue, we also compared PBRs for Google and Bing, which measure the difference between the winning bid and the price paid. Insofar as the bid is an indicator of the advertiser’s willingness to pay (i.e. the value it expects to derive from a click),6 the PBR controls for any difference in the value of a click on Google as opposed to Bing. A higher PBR means that the platform is able to extract more of the rent or surplus value from the advertising opportunity, and a lower PBR means that the advertiser retains more of the surplus value. Our results show that the PBR for searches on Google is [20 – 30 percent] higher than that of Bing on a like for like basis on mobile and [10 – 20 percent] higher on desktop, indicating that Google is more effective at extracting surplus value from the advertiser than Bing.
Overall, these results support the hypothesis that Google’s market power gives it an ability to raise prices above the competitive level.7 Given that over £7bn was spent on search advertising in the UK in 2019, higher advertising prices are likely to result in considerable detriment to UK consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services that use search advertising, including hotels, flights, and consumer electronics.
In addition to allowing for the comparison of Google and Bing’s prices, our analysis shed light on a number of other characteristics of search advertising prices in the UK. For example, we found that ads on less common queries tended to be more expensive than ads on more common queries and that CPCs on desktop were more expensive than CPCs on mobile.
Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to quantify the extent to which Google enjoys greater access than Bing to uncommon “tail” queries, which can be of particular value in training algorithms to improve the quality and relevance of search results. We found that, of the queries that Google only saw once or twice, only 1.0 percent were in the Bing dataset, while of the queries that Bing only saw once or twice, 31.5 percent were in the Google dataset. This is shown in the figure below.
Figure 1: Distribution of the percentage of Google search events which were for queries seen by Bing, and vice versa, by the frequency of their search query
We define the head as the 15 percent of queries seen most often in a dataset and the tail as the 30 percent of queries seen least often.
This evidence is supportive of our assessment of Google’s scale advantage in search. The scale and variety of click-and-query data seen by Google underpins its ability to provide timely and relevant search results. The benefits of scale are particularly large for less common queries, where Google’s advantage over Bing is more significant. In view of the importance of search relevance to consumers and keyword coverage to advertisers, we found that a lack of comparable scale in click-and-query data is likely to be a key factor that limits the ability of other search engines to compete with Google.
 
III. ANALYSIS OF GOOGLE’S AD TECH FEE RATES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
A second piece of analysis conducted during the market study related to open display advertising. In this part of the market, online publishers sell advertising in real time via a chain of intermediaries (the “adtech stack”) that bring together demand from advertisers and run auctions to decide which ad to show to a specific user on a publisher’s site. Various stakeholders in the CMA’s market study including publishers, advertisers and public bodies expressed concerns regarding the proportion of advertising revenues in open display which accrues to the providers of intermediation services, and the lack of transparency over these payments.
We carried out an aggregate-level analysis based on information requests to a wide range of intermediaries, which found that ad tech intermediation services accounted for at least 35 percent of the amount paid by advertisers. However, there were concerns that this aggregate analysis might not identify so-called “hidden fees” which could arise if ad tech intermediaries were able to exploit a lack of transparency to take additional margins at different points in the ad tech chain.
We therefore gathered transaction-level data from Google to investigate in more detail the fees it earned at different points in the ad tech chain. While this could only tell us about Google’s fees rather than those charged by other intermediaries, Google is the largest player in all the main parts of the ad tech chain, so the analysis was informative about a significant portion of the market.8 The fact that Google operates in all parts of the chain also meant that we could trace a large number of individual transactions from “end to end,” allowing us to observe all payments including any hidden fees.
B. Data Collected
The CMA obtained from Google a dataset containing event-level information generated by Google Ad Manager in the seven-day period beginning March 8, 2020 Pacific Time (“PDT”).9 The dataset covers all Google Ad Manager open auction web traffic in the UK (based on user location) for that week, amounting to several billion observations.
The dataset is at the bid level, including, for each bid, the DSP, the amount bid, any bid floor, and the result of the auction. For the winning bid in each auction, information about buy- and sell-side fees is also available. Finally, the dataset includes user characteristics (operating system, platform, browser) and the domain of the page where the auction took place. This data allowed us to observe the end-to-end payments from advertiser to publisher where Google intermediaries were used – including any possible “hidden fees” which would not be visible to either the advertiser or the publisher
C. Results and Implications
Our analysis found that, in transactions where both Google Ads and Ad Manager (“AdX”) are used, Google’s overall take rate was approximately 30 percent of advertiser spend. Overall, Google take rates were broadly in line with, or slightly lower than, aggregate market-wide fee estimates from other sources.
This data allowed us to investigate an additional concern raised by stakeholders, notably UK news publishers, that Google Ads has an informational advantage over other DSPs that allows it to shade its bids in the auction,10 such that the Google Ads winning margin (its winning bid minus the maximum of the second highest bid or floor price) would be systematically lower than that of other DSPs. Such an outcome could be thought of as a “hidden fee,” as Google Ads would be able to maximize the difference between the winning bid in the auction that it holds among buyers on the platform and the bid that it submits to the unified auction.
To shed more light on these concerns, we calculated the margin between the winning bid and the second highest bid for Google and non-Google DSPs, to test whether Google Ads was systematically able to win with a lower margin over the second highest bid compared to other DSPs. We did not find clear evidence that Google’s winning margins were systematically lower than non-Google DSPs. In absolute terms there was some evidence that Google Ads is able to achieve lower winning margins than other DSPs. However, in proportionate terms its winning margins were higher than other those of other bidders.11
Overall, the results of our analysis in relation to Google’s adtech fees stand in contrast to those regarding Google’s search advertising prices, in that we did not find evidence that it systematically charged higher fees than its competitors, notwithstanding its market power in different segments of adtech intermediation. We noted in the study that Google’s position was still a source of concern, particularly if it led to reduced dynamic competition and innovation over time, and that Google retained the ability and incentive to raise fee levels in the future.
 
IV. THE VALUE OF TARGETING WITH THIRD PARTY COOKIES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
The third piece of analysis related to the value of user data in digital advertising. One of the defining characteristics of digital advertising is the ability to target advertising at specific users or groups of users based on information about their characteristics, preferences and interests. This form of “personalized” advertising is particularly important in relation to display and video advertising. Advertisers want to target advertising at consumers for whom their adverts are more likely to be relevant, reducing deadweight loss and increasing the likelihood of conversion, i.e. achieving a sale as a result of a consumer seeing an advert.
We sought to assess the value of user data by analyzing how access to it translated into higher advertising prices. This analysis helped us to understand how the large platforms’ extensive access to data on consumers’ preferences and past browsing behavior might act as a source of competitive advantage over smaller players and online publishers. Further, it allowed us to assess how future changes to the market – introduced either by large platforms or by regulatory authorities – that changed participants’ access to user data would affect their ability to generate revenue through serving targeted advertising.
Our analysis was based on observing the impact on advertising revenues of “switching off” access to third party cookies, which are a common means of tracking users across the web and targeting them based on their interests.
B. Data Collected
In the summer of 2019, Google ran a global randomized controlled trial (“RCT”) to assess the short-run impact of disabling third-party cookies on publisher revenues from display ads. The CMA obtained the data for the UK subset of this experiment and expanded the analysis, to shed more light on the value of cookies in targeted advertising.
The dataset contained a few million impressions where Google was operating on the demand and/or supply side. These impressions were randomly sampled from Google’s traffic in the UK, and allocated with equal probability to a control group (the “business as usual” case) and an intervention group, where Google’s systems were prevented from accessing the information associated to each cookie ID. For each impression, we observed advertiser payments and publisher revenue for the winning bid, user characteristics (operating system, platform, browser, cookie age) and the domain of the page where the auction took place.
The dataset was smaller than the others discussed in this article. Further, it did not originate directly from a data collection request that was designed by the CMA, but was collected by Google as part of an internal experiment. However, the randomization in the RCT design helps to answer research questions of a causal nature, compared to purely observational data.
C. Results and Implications
As part of our analysis, we identified a number of sample selection issues and implemented a different econometric approach to tackling each one.12 Having implemented these, our best estimate was that blocking cookie information reduced average publisher revenue by around 70 percent. Thanks to the availability of rich transaction-level data, we were able to go beyond average effects and investigate whether the effect differs by type of user. We adopted a causal forest approach, which uses machine learning to flexibly account for all possible combinations of user characteristics. We found that the negative effect of blocking cookies on publisher revenue was larger for users with older cookies (and thus with a potentially more complete profile) and was smaller for users navigating with browsers that adopt anti-tracking technologies such as Safari and Firefox.
The results of the experiment make clear that, for individual publishers competing against other publishers that offer personalized inventory using cookies, blocking access to cookie identifiers reduces publisher revenue from users navigating with cookies by a significant amount. This impact is best understood as a short run effect, where the blocking applies to a relatively small subset of impressions in an ecosystem where third-party cookies are the commonplace means of identifying users. A question this experiment cannot answer is what the impact would be in a “long-run market-wide” perspective, where third-party cookies are unavailable throughout the ecosystem. In such a world, the impact on publisher revenue is likely to be mitigated by dynamic responses, for example heavier use of contextual targeting rather than personalized targeting, and alternative methods of cross-site tracking, including fingerprinting.
This analysis proved valuable in helping us understand the importance of Google’s announcement early in 2020 that Chrome browsers will stop support for third-party cookies in the future, restricting the ability of publishers to sell personalized advertising.13 Depending on how the proposals are implemented,14 this decision has the potential to have a significant impact on publishers’ revenues and the CMA has undertaken to discuss this with ICO, alongside a number of other issues relating to the interaction between competition and data protection regulation in digital advertising markets.
 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK
The pieces of quantitative analysis outlined in this paper played an important role in supporting the overall findings of our market study. They provided empirical evidence of the impact of Google’s market power on search advertising prices, shed light on fees paid to ad tech intermediaries and quantified the value of access to personal data on for targeted advertising. This quantitative work is important in evidencing the scale of harm from lack of competition, and in providing the basis for assessing the costs and benefits of potential regulatory interventions.
We expect that this form of analysis will become increasingly important as part of regulatory oversight of digital markets in the future. One of the key characteristics of digital markets is their reliance on real-time processes driven by algorithms, based on access to very large sets of data on the behavior and characteristics of consumers and other market participants. These processes can be very hard for third parties (including regulators) to assess. For example, the way in which auction prices are adjusted to take account of quality cannot be observed purely by interrogating auction outcomes, and transactions in the open display market typically cannot be traced from “end-to-end” – i.e. from the advertiser to the publisher on which an ad is shown. We think that regulators will increasingly need the powers to request and interrogate large datasets from the platforms in order to understand their behavior and to ensure that any regulatory rules designed to prevent exploitation of market power are being complied with.
The experience of carrying out large-scale data analysis during the market study has highlighted some lessons that can inform the future work of the Digital Markets Unit (“DMU”), a body proposed by the Furman Review and the CMA’s market study to regulate the behavior of large online platforms and encourage greater competition in online platform markets. We have found that this type of analysis should be well within the reach of a regulator like the DMU. Thanks to advancements in open-source software, multiple well-known tools are available that can perform data manipulation and statistical analysis. The availability of cheap cloud computing resources allows this type of analysis to be scaled in a mostly seamless fashion, making the processing of large amounts of data possible. These capabilities can be effectively supported by building in-house teams with specialist data science and software development knowledge, whose skills can be leveraged in concert with more traditional specialist profiles already present within competition authorities and regulators.
The right tools and skillsets can enable more ambitious analysis. In the instances described in this paper, we chose to collect transaction-level data rather than asking parties to compute aggregate figures beforehand. This clearly increases the workload on the regulator’s side. However, it has numerous advantages: it provides more insight into online platforms, enabling regulators to understand their dynamics on a deeper level; and it increases flexibility in the analysis, allowing for adjustments rather than being wedded to a fixed, pre-specified analysis. Furthermore, the code generating the analysis can be shared with the parties – which reduces the chance of errors and increases transparency. All of these aspects are likely to be particularly important for the DMU, with its envisaged powers of continuous monitoring, and assessment.
Finally, we note that working with personal or otherwise sensitive data need not be an obstacle to the pursuit of regulatory functions. Throughout the study, we were able to cooperate effectively with parties and minimize the risks connected with transferring and analyzing personal data, for example by anonymizing transaction-level data and encrypting potentially sensitive information such as search engine queries. In more complex cases, privacy-enhancing technologies can be used to enable sharing of information across parties while preserving confidentiality.15

5 The precise mechanisms by which a platform with market power can charge high prices in digital advertising markets is complicated by the fact that prices in these markets are largely set through real time auctions. In Chapter 5 and Appendix Q of the market study final report we discuss a variety of ways in which platforms can influence the prices in these auctions, and conclude that market power will increase a platform’s ability to raise prices compared to a situation in which they were subject to greater competitive pressures.
6 This is more likely to be the case where the advertiser sets a maximum bid directly, as opposed to automated bidding, in which the bid is set according to a Google algorithm. In 2019, [40-50] percent of Google’s UK search advertising revenue came from advertisers using automated bidding, while the remainder set maximum CPC bid limits. The data we collected did not allow us to distinguish automated from advertiser-set bids. This could be explored in further work.

8 In 2019, Google had a share of [90-100] percent of the publisher ad server segment, [80-90] percent of the advertiser ad server segment and shares of [50-60] percent in supply-side platforms (SSPs) and [50-60] percent in demand-side platforms (“DSPs”).

Below we have provided the full text transcript from the Fireside Chat section of our conference, The Future of Antitrust: Comments on the HJC Report.

Maureen OHLHAUSEN:
Great. I’m delighted to be here, certainly with my old friend and colleague, Tim Muris. Tim and I are going to have, I think, a good conversation about the future of antitrust, and what this new report from the House Judiciary Committee might mean. Before we look too far ahead, I think we also need to understand the foundation of antitrust and some of the issues that, I think, the report is focused on. But, Tim, let me turn it over to you to say a few words before we start our dialogue.

Timothy MURIS:
Thank you, Maureen. Let me thank CPI for hosting this. Tech issues, as you mentioned, are at the forefront of the antitrust debate, certainly at the forefront of what the House Judiciary Committee is doing. Mark Twain famously said that history might not repeat itself, but it rhymes. We’re certainly going to see that today, I think, in our discussion about what’s happening in antitrust.
OHLHAUSEN:
Great. Well, thanks. I know I’ve been following what the committee has been doing. I testified last Summer at one of their hearings. I filed a comment on my own and a joint comment with this committee. Tim, I know you filed a comment, as well. But one of the things that struck me, as I followed the hearings, and particularly the one this Summer that had all the tec...

578,"October 11, 2020",Revising the Competition Law Rulebook for Digital Markets in Europe: A Delicate Balancing Act,"

By Kris Van Hove & Argyrios Papaefthymiou1
 
Introduction
It is a truism to say that digitalisation has brought with it a revolution in economic life and consumer experience in the 21st century. Developments in digital technology unfold in rapid speed, markedly upgrading the quality of life, but also requiring constant review of legal and economic thinking to keep up with the pace of digital evolution.
Competition law has been at the epicentre of this re-evaluation process, as the field of law that moves most closely in tandem with economic thinking and business models. It is thus no surprise that there has been an onslaught of policy and legislative developments in recent years in the competition law space to tackle what is perceived by some as an “overexpansion” of the market power held by big tech companies (commonly identified as “GAFA” – Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple). In parallel with these developments in the policy and legislative space, competition authorities around the globe are increasingly stepping up their scrutiny of various practices implemented by digital companies.
The present article seeks to provide an overview of the key competition concerns identified in Europe in the digital sphere and the main approaches that are currently being discussed to tackle those concerns, with a focus on the EU. Although the digitalisation of the global economy presents specific challenges for competition law enforcement, which may require tweaking the existing regulatory framework to some extent, the article attempts to critically assess whether the reform proposals that have been put forward are necessary and proportionate to the perceived challenges. This assessment is made in light of the tools that are already available and that have been employed to address competition concerns in the digital sector by competition authorities in the EU. While the proposals that have been put forward centre on the rules on abuse of dominance and merger control, the analysis that follows is conducted through the prism of antitrust, with references to merger control as it relates to the interplay between ex ante enforcement (merger control) and ex post enforcement (rules on abuse of dominance).
 
A. Main Competition Concerns in Digital Markets: The View in Europe
Over the past couple of years, public authorities in Europe, both at EU and national level, have commissioned expert studies and reports on the application of competition law in the digital era. An indicative list includes: the European Commission’s report on “Competition Policy for the Digital Era,”2 the UK Furman Report on “Unlocking Digital Competition,”3 and the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (the “CMA”) market study on online platforms and digital advertising,4 the German “Competition Law 4.0” report,5 the Italian6 and Franco-German7 reports on big data and competition law, the French study on competition and e-commerce8 and the French report on digital economy competition challenges,9 etc. From this body of expert studies and reports, it is possible to distill some key insights into the characteristics of digital markets and the perceived competition concerns they generate. These are addressed briefly below.
1. Characteristics of Digital Markets
Digital markets are often characterized by strong economies of scope, favoring the development of ecosystems and giving incumbents a strong competitive advantage. The economies of scope are considered to result from other features of digital markets, and in particular from:

high returns to scale (meaning that the cost of producing a digital service is much less than proportional to the number of customers served);
network externalities (meaning that the more users join a digital technology, e.g. a social media platform, the more convenient it becomes); and
the importance of data as an input for many digital services (meaning that, where applicable, those with significant data collection and processing capabilities have a sizeable competitive advantage).

These features and the strong economies of scope they generate are increasingly considered in enforcement and policy circles as facilitating large incumbents’ market power to become ever more entrenched and as potentially allowing anti-competitive strategies to materialize unencumbered.
2. Self-Preferencing
The European Commission’s Digital Experts’ Report defines “self-preferencing” as a practice engaged in by a platform operator that gives preferential treatment to the operator’s products and services when they compete with products and services of other entities using the platform. This practice has been at the forefront of many discussions on digital competition policy. Whether or not it is as such problematic from a competition perspective is the subject of ongoing debate. Yet, alongside data-related practices, it is the conduct most closely associated with competition concerns that big tech companies raise. Headline cases such as the EU Google Shopping case10 have featured this practice as the principal conduct under scrutiny.
3. Retail Most-Favored-Nation (“MFN”) Clauses
Retail Most-favored-nation clauses or MFNs11 are contractual obligations imposed by a buyer on a seller that require the seller to offer the buyer terms and conditions that are at least as favorable as the best terms and conditions offered by that seller to other buyers. The terms and conditions concerned may be either price-related or non-price-related. Such clauses are commonly divided into two categories:

“narrow” Retail MFNs, which dictate that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website (but can do so on other platforms); and
“wide” Retail MFNs, which dictate that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website or on any other platform.

Retail MFNs have been particularly pertinent in the digital context, with “platform MNFs” being scrutinized both at EU level (Amazon E-books MFNs case12) and at national level (antitrust investigations by the German, French, Italian and Swedish national competition authorities into MFNs in agreements between hotels and online travel agents (Hotel Reservation Service (HRS),13 Booking.com,14 and Expedia15). Generally speaking, “wide” Retail MFNs are considered more problematic from a competition law perspective than “narrow” Retail MFNs.
4. Switching Costs and Multihoming
Switching from a product or service offered by one firm to a functionally similar product or service offered by another firm may generate so-called “switching costs.” These are costs associated with certain investments made by the user in the ecosystem of the first firm (e.g. the time spent familiarizing with the particular features of that ecosystem) which have to be re-incurred when the user switches to the ecosystem of the second firm. Switching costs are also conceptually linked to “multihoming,” which is a consumer’s ability to use different competing online services simultaneously (e.g. platforms).
Depending on the circumstances, a dominant platform may try to retain its user base on an exclusive basis by making switching or multihoming more costly or more difficult otherwise. Such conduct could enable the platform to entrench its market position with potentially negative effects for competition.
5. Big Data and Data-Related Practices
“Big Data” is a dataset with three features which are commonly referred to as the “three V’s.”  It consists of:

large Volumes of data (that is, large amounts of data generated through online or offline transactions),
data with significant Variety (it can be structured or unstructured data and human-generated or machine-generated data), and
data generated with high Velocity (that is, incoming data flows are processed in real-time).

Big Data and its interplay with competition policy is a key focus in many competition authorities’ ongoing evaluation of the digital sector. Particular attention is paid to data leveraging strategies that, under given circumstances, may amount to anti-competitive unilateral conduct. For instance, a refusal to provide access to data that is unique and indispensable for a competitor to provide services (so, data that constitutes an “essential facility”) may be considered to amount to an exclusionary abuse. Another example of potentially abusive conduct is discrimination by a vertically integrated platform with downstream activities in the provision of access by retailers to competitively strategic data. Furthermore, competition authorities are increasingly sensitive to issues of “data portability” and “interoperability.” “Data portability” (giving end-users the freedom to transfer their data to alternative digital service providers) as well as “interoperability” (ensuring compatibility between software of different ecosystems) are considered valuable means to keep switching and multihoming viable for end-users. But these are not the only issues competition authorities are looking into. For instance, at EU level, the European Commission has launched a formal investigation into Amazon’s use of sensitive data obtained from independent retailers selling on Amazon’s marketplace and competing with Amazon’s retail business (July 2019).16 The Commission is also conducting antitrust enquiries into Facebook’s and Google’s data-gathering and monetization practices (since 2019).
An additional concern that recently came to the fore in relation to data-related practices centers on the interaction between privacy protection (legislated at EU level through the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR17) and competition law. This interaction is highlighted in the German Facebook case. In that case, the German competition authority found that Facebook had abused its dominant position in the market for social networks by making access to its social network conditional on the collection of user data from multiple sources, including third-party websites. The German authority thus ordered Facebook to cease applying the abusive clauses.18 The authority’s decision was appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, which issued a suspension order against the decision, noting serious doubts about its legality.19 The decision was, however, reinstated by Germany’s Supreme Court20 pending a final decision on the merits of the case from the Higher Regional Court. The German Facebook case has sparked an intense debate on the theory of harm put forward by the German competition authority, with critics finding its focus on consumer protection problematic for the purpose of identifying the competition concerns. It is expected that the final outcome of this case will have significant implications for the use of data-related theories of harm in competition law enforcement.
6. Killer Acquisitions
A strongly contested practice that some consider is taking place in the tech sector in recent years is the acquisition by established players of start-ups that have the potential of strongly competing with the incumbents, with a view to “killing off” future competition from those start-ups. Such acquisitions are commonly referred to as “killer acquisitions.” The concept originated in the pharma sector, where – according to some – the practice of buying up start-ups, only to subsequently eliminate pipeline projects that might have increased competition for the incumbent’s offerings, would have been empirically observed.21 In the context of the digital sphere, however, this concept appears to mean something different, as the acquisitions considered by some to be controversial (e.g. Facebook/WhatsApp,22 Facebook/Instagram) have not resulted in the “killing off” of the acquired firm’s offerings. Rather, what is meant by “strategic acquisitions” in digital markets relates to a counterfactual where the acquired firm, in light of its subsequent evolution into a strong market player, might have exerted intense competitive forces on the acquiring incumbent, with positive results for competition and consumers, had it not been acquired. The existence of harm to competition arising from these acquisitions is not beyond dispute. On the one hand, arguably, the acquisition of innovative start-ups can in some cases reduce future competitive constraints on the incumbent. On the other hand, for many start-ups, being acquired by an established market player at a lucrative price point can serve as a key incentive for innovative research and development.
In any event, in various European jurisdictions there is a strong current towards reforming the rules on merger control to address what is perceived to be an excessively lax approach to controlling acquisitions in the tech sphere. Reform proposals have taken various forms. One commonly pronounced suggestion is to lower the jurisdictional turnover thresholds to account for the fact that, at the time of acquisition, the turnover of many innovative start-ups is too low to trigger a notification. Another proposal is meant to address the fact that turnover may not be the most appropriate metric to assess the need to exercise merger control over a tech acquisition. It consists in adding an alternative threshold based on the value of the transaction, where a high purchase price (despite low turnover) triggers mandatory notification due to its indications of innovative potential. This proposal has in fact already been adopted in certain jurisdictions and notably Austria and Germany. Finally, at the more “radical” end of the reform spectrum, some jurisdictions (such as France) have been considering to implement an ex post merger control regime, whereby certain transactions (particularly in the digital sector) may be re-evaluated even years after they have been consummated, should market developments in the transaction’s aftermath indicate that the transaction might have generated adverse effects on competition.
7. Conclusion
The discussion presented above has direct implications for the debate on digital-specific reforms of the competition rules: if the concerns delineated have merit, then more ex post scrutiny may be required. For example, a history of relatively lax merger control could be viewed as a factor that has contributed to the proliferation of self-preferencing cases which focus on perceived anti-competitive differential treatment by vertically integrated businesses. The intensifying review of data-related abusive practices could perhaps also be partially attributed to a perceived overexpansion of big tech firms.
 
B. Reform Directions: A Critical Overview
Competition authorities in Europe have been engaged in intensive public discussions on how to approach the perceived problems identified above for competition in the digital sector. From the flurry of policy activity and legislative initiatives on this subject, it is possible to extract the key proposals presently on the table, and to critically assess their necessity and proportionality. Each of these proposals is addressed below.
1. Mandating Pro-Competitive Conduct and Prohibiting Anti-Competitive Conduct under an Ex Ante Regulatory Regime
In June 2020, the European Commission launched a public consultation to gather views on two legislative proposals. A first proposal relates to a “Digital Services Act.” This proposal would introduce, inter alia, a targeted, sector-specific ex ante framework regulating the conduct of large online platforms that benefit from significant network effects and that act as “gatekeepers” of their respective platforms. A second proposal relates to a “New Competition Tool.” This proposal would give the European Commission new powers to investigate entire sectors of the economy and impose remedies where it finds dominance-related or market structure-related competition problems (on this second proposal, see section 2 below).
The Digital Services Act package considered by the Commission in its Inception Impact Assessment23 puts forth different policy options for enhancing the “fairness and contestability” of markets where large online platforms operate. While two of these policy options focus on enhancing transparency obligations for platforms in the context of the Platform-to-Business Regulation24, the third option – which has received the most public attention – proposes the adoption of a new ex ante regulatory framework that governs specific trading practices of large online platforms benefiting from significant network effects and acting as “gatekeepers.”25  The platforms concerned would be identified on the basis of predetermined criteria such as significant network effects, the size of their user base and/or their capacity to leverage data across sectors.
Two separate components are considered for the ex ante framework. A first component would lay down predetermined prohibited trading practices (“blacklisted practices”) and predetermined obligations. An example of a blacklisted practice subject to a horizontal prohibition would be intra-platform self-preferencing. A second component would provide for the possibility for the regulator to impose tailor-made remedies. Examples of such remedies would be the imposition of platform-specific non-personal data access obligations and the imposition of specific interoperability and data portability requirements. The two components are not mutually exclusive and could be introduced as complements. The idea of ex ante prohibitions of certain platform conduct (e.g. self-preferencing) is also endorsed in the proposed 10th amendment of the German Act Against Restraints on Competition,26 as well as in the French competition authority’s study on competition and e-commerce and the French report on digital economy competition challenges.
Similar to the notion of ex ante regulation, the UK Furman Report puts forth the idea of drawing up binding codes of conduct for certain platforms with “strategic market status” (broadly defined as a position of enduring market power over a strategic gateway market, giving the platform a powerful negotiating position and making other undertakings dependent on it). Adherence to the codes of conduct would be monitored and enforced by a dedicated Digital Markets Unit within the competition authority (such a unit has already been established within the French competition authority, with a mandate to assist in cases with a significant digital dimension27). As opposed to the focus of the ex ante regulatory approach on the prohibition of specific types of conduct in addition to required compliance with specific obligations, the focus of the codes of conduct approach would be only on mandating pro-competitive conduct. This more flexible form of regulation could be seen as an incentive for large platforms to work in partnership and share their input in drawing up codes and as a means perhaps of avoiding exogenously imposed obligations and prohibitions that may go “over the top” in their response to the perceived problems they seek to address. The idea of codes of conduct specifically for large online platforms has also been supported in the German Competition Law 4.0 Report.
It further bears observing that, for a practice to qualify as an ex ante prohibition, it is rather logical to assume that such practice’s harm to competition must be significant, acknowledged to a degree of (near-)consensus, and context-independent – almost, in a sense, like a “by object” restriction under EU competition law. However, certain of the practices identified in policy proposals, such as the Digital Services Act and the relevant German and French studies, are still the subject of much debate as regards their anti-competitive nature. The most indicative example in this respect is self-preferencing, which some commentators view as a natural consequence of vertical integration, and its horizontal condemnation as near-equivalent to competition law engaging in the imposition of specific business models on companies.28 Furthermore, depending on the context in which it is observed, self-preferencing could be viewed through the lens of classic theories of harm that have already been successfully applied by EU courts to deal with instances of integrated firms favoring their own affiliates, such as a refusal to supply an indispensable input (Bronner, IMS Health, Slovak Telekom) or tying (Microsoft I).29 In any event, the uncertainty that surrounds self-preferencing as a self-standing theory of harm might call for a more nuanced approach than outright banning practices that can be labelled as self-preferencing.
Of course, self-preferencing is not the only conduct that is targeted by the ex ante regulation approach and, for instance, proposals mandating interoperability and data portability in specific circumstances may be less controversial. However, these practices could just as easily be imposed through codes of conduct. This approach would arguably be preferable, as it may provide a step – rather than a leap – in the exploration of ways to address competition concerns relating to the behavior of large incumbents in digital markets. Codes of conduct are likely more easily adjustable to account for developing market dynamics and insights drawn from their enforcement practice than formal legislation (especially at the EU level where the legislative process includes up to three different institutions, i.e. the European Commission, the Council of the EU, and the European Parliament).
2. Leveraging Market Investigation Tools
In parallel with the Digital Services Act addressed above, the European Commission has been gathering views on a proposed “New Competition Tool” (or “NCT” for short). This tool would allow the Commission to investigate entire sectors of the economy and impose behavioral or structural remedies to address what it perceives to be dominance-related or market-structure-related risks to competition. The NCT could be used pre-emptively, that is, before actual risks to competition materialize. Its scope of application would be limited to markets within the digital sphere, or be open-ended.30 If the tool would be open-ended and targeting market structure risks, it would resemble a classic market investigation mechanism, such as the one available in the UK as well as in certain other jurisdictions worldwide (e.g. Greece, Mexico, Israel). Although the European Commission already has a sector-wide probe tool at its disposal, i.e. the sector inquiry, that tool can result only in findings but not in remedies, which may be imposed only in subsequent individual infringement proceedings.31 In contrast, an NCT investigation could result in the immediate imposition of market-wide remedies.
A market investigation mechanism would be a very powerful tool in the hands of the European Commission, with significant implications for competition enforcement in the EU at large. Cases that have centered on challenging theories of harm could be dealt with through an NCT-like process in an easier manner, dispensing with the hurdle of proving to the requisite legal standard the elements of a “traditional” antitrust infringement (e.g. specific abusive conduct). The Commission’s antitrust investigations in landmark digital cases have often spanned multiple years (the Google Android32 case took over three years and the Google Shopping case took seven years for the Commission to complete). Critics have argued that the duration of these investigations, especially in rapid-changing markets, has made it impossible to effectively reverse the damage that the conduct at issue has allegedly caused to competition. By the time a decision is issued, the undertaking concerned would have derived most, if not all, potential competitive advantages from the infringing behavior, and would have further entrenched its dominant market position. The duration factor may have played a significant role in motivating the Commission to seek market investigation powers.
The NCT proposal has, however, not been met with unequivocal approval. Stakeholders have expressed concerns that the tool is too far-reaching, disproportionate to the issues it seeks to address, and legally questionable (its legal basis is at least partially the antitrust provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, despite the fact that the NCT’s application – as envisaged – cannot result in a finding of infringement). Also, the design of the NCT itself is raising questions: the profound impact the tool may have on markets and market players, especially in its broadest possible form, requires meticulous design of the different parameters for its use, namely: when use of the tool would be appropriate, who would be empowered to request the launch of an NCT investigation, what the legal thresholds and substantive standards of assessment would be, and what precise form the rights of defense would take. Yet, most notably, in the 40+-page questionnaire of the NCT public consultation, only one question addresses rights of defense, which is arguably the most burning concern for stakeholders. Since the NCT is evidently intended to facilitate swifter intervention, there is a pressing need to ensure that this speedy and more flexible approach does not discount on any of the rights of defense that are available to companies in regular antitrust proceedings as provided for in Regulation 1/2003. 33 In fact, beyond the uncertainty as to what form the rights of defense would take, there may be a broader systemic issue in play here: due to the relatively loose concepts involved compared to those in regular antitrust enforcement (e.g. “structural competition concerns” vs “abuse of a dominant position”), market investigation instruments have the potential to go much further with respect to the conducts targeted and the remedies that can be imposed. This far-reaching nature justifies strong checks and balances and recourse to an efficient and effective judicial oversight system.
A final observation with regard to the NCT relates to its scope of application: while two of the four policy options put on the table by the Commission are limited to certain digital or digitally enabled markets, the other two are horizontal. As the rationale presented by the Commission for the need of an NCT is heavily focused on the reform of competition enforcement in the digital sector, the proposal of a horizontal tool is somewhat puzzling. Yet, the horizontal option may be sensible in a “future-proofing” strategy: as the EU legislative procedure is rather cumbersome, and expanding the tool’s scope in the future, should the need arise, would be time- and resource-consuming (as well as uncertain), choosing the broadest possible option from the outset could make practical sense. However, the fact remains that, based on its reasoning to date, it is questionable whether the Commission has made a convincing case for a horizontally applicable market investigation tool.
3. Facilitating the Burden of Proof
The European Commission’s Digital Experts’ Report observes that highly concentrated markets with strong network effects and high barriers to entry may require the imposition on the incumbent of proving the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. In terms of specific conduct to which this burden of proof shift would apply, the Report suggests that, where a dominant platform tries to expand into neighboring markets, a presumption should exist in favor of a duty to ensure interoperability and the burden to reverse that presumption should be on the platform. The Report further notes that a presumption of interoperability could also be justified where a dominant platform controls specific competitively relevant sets of user or aggregated data that competitors cannot reproduce but need in order to compete and again the burden to reverse that presumption should be on the platform. With regard to self-preferencing, the Report makes the proposition that, if a platform serves as an important intermediary with a “regulatory” function on its platform, then that platform should bear the burden of proving that a given self-preferencing practice has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets.
The proposals for shifting the burden of proof from the investigating authority to the investigated undertaking constitute a significant departure from established norms in EU competition law. As provided for in Regulation 1/2003, the burden of proof in antitrust proceedings falls on the party making the claim at issue. It is therefore unclear how these proposals could come to pass without revision of this Regulation. It is little surprise that proposals on altering the burden of proof allocation have not been widely endorsed in other policy reports or legislative proposals in this area. Furthermore, the need for such a significant change to a fundamental procedural rule in a selective manner for a specific group of companies is not apparent in practice: the European Commission as well as national competition authorities in the EU have managed to issue decisions with findings of infringement by big tech companies in the past without having presumptions of illegality at their disposal (e.g. the EU Google Shopping case).
4. Adapting Existing Antitrust Tools to the Digital Era
Certain EU jurisdictions have recently been examining amendments to their competition laws aimed at facilitating a more effective enforcement in the digital context. The most notable and coherently laid out proposal for reform to date in the EU has come from Germany, which in late 2019 introduced for deliberation a 10th amendment to its Act Against Restraints on Competition, which is suitably dubbed “Digitalisation Act.” This draft legislation introduces modifications to German competition law focusing on its update for the digital era. It encapsulates many of the reform directions that have been put forth in the policy discourse on the subject.
The German draft amendment proposes to supplement the criteria for assessing dominance with two new criteria, namely access to data relevant for competition, and “intermediary power.” The first criterion in essence expands the “essential facilities” doctrine to expressly cover data that is necessary as a resource for effective competition. The second criterion attempts to capture the importance of intermediation services in multi-sided markets for access to purchase and supply markets. This modification targets specifically the bottleneck power of digital platforms that act as “gatekeepers.” Their market power is considered particularly enhanced due to their ability to control market access for suppliers that use the intermediary services through features such as search result rankings.
In addition to these adjustments of the dominance criteria, the 10th amendment proposes to expand the German competition authority’s powers so that it will be able to investigate in a time-efficient manner undertakings with “paramount significance for competition across markets” and the business practices they engage in. To assess whether an undertaking holds such “paramount significance,” the authority will in particular take account of:

the undertaking’s dominant position in one or more markets;
its financial strength or access to other resources;
its vertical integration and activity in interconnected markets in ways other than through vertical integration;
its access to data relevant for competition; and
the importance of the undertaking’s activities for access to purchase and supply markets by third parties, as well as the influence of those activities on business activity.

What is particularly notable about these expanded powers is that, to sanction certain practices that are considered anti-competitive, the competition authority will no longer have to prove an undertaking’s dominant position in a particular market. Rather, it will be sufficient for the authority to look at the undertaking’s overall position across multiple markets, and if it meets the paramount significance threshold, the authority will be able to block practices considered anti-competitive at an early stage, even before the undertaking entrenches a dominant position in the market at issue. The provision is considered to be targeting specifically the big tech companies which, due to their particular features such as network effects and data advantages, may outpace the competition authority when leveraging their strong market positions in certain markets to rapidly build up such positions in neighboring markets so that regulatory intervention is no longer effective. By dispensing with the arduous process of establishing an undertaking’s dominance in a specific market, this amendment’s apparent aim is to give the German competition authority powers to curb leveraging practices at a much faster pace.
Once the authority has issued a decision that finds a particular undertaking to hold “paramount significance for competition across markets,” it will be able to order that undertaking to refrain from certain practices, namely:

engaging in “self-preferencing,” that is, in its capacity as provider of access to purchase and sales markets (i.e. in its capacity as a platform), providing preferential treatment to its own products or services to the disadvantage of competing products and services;
directly or indirectly hindering its competitors in markets where the undertaking in question can rapidly expand its position even without being dominant, if the hindrance is likely to significantly impair the competitive process;
using competitively relevant data collected in a market where the undertaking in question is dominant to establish or enhance barriers to entry in markets where the undertaking is not dominant;
making the interoperability of products or services or the portability of data more difficult, thereby hindering competition; and
inadequately informing commercial users about the scope, quality or success of the service provided or commissioned, thereby making it difficult for them to assess the value of this service.

By expressly listing these practices in the legislation as potentially the subject of a prohibition, the competition authority will be able to dispense of developing detailed theories of harm, thereby facilitating faster intervention.
The 10th amendment also proposes to broaden the German competition law concept of “relative market power.” This concept is the German law manifestation of the “economic dependence” doctrine, which – irrespective of market dominance – seeks to prevent abusive practices by undertakings on which other undertakings are business-dependent. While the application of the current version of the provision is triggered only when abusive practices take place vis-à-vis economically dependent small-and-medium size enterprises (“SMEs”), the proposal expands the doctrine to business-dependent undertakings of all sizes.
Finally, the draft amendment proposes to facilitate the ability for the competition authority to impose interim measures (a sort of injunctive action). It does so by changing the threshold for such measures from the risk of serious and irreparable damage to competition to the predominant probability of an infringement finding coupled with the necessity to prevent harm to competition or to avoid an imminent and serious threat to another undertaking. This change in effect amounts to a lowering of the threshold, as the constitutive elements of the new test are likely more easily met than the stringent requirement of proving serious and irreparable damage to competition. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the draft amendment was proposed around the time the European Commission decided to impose interim measures for the first time in 18 years (this was in the Broadcom case).34 This “resurrection” of interim measures at EU level in a sector closely associated with the digital sector (chipsets for TV set-top boxes and modems) is no accident: in the context of the broader debate on the efficacy and speed of antitrust enforcement, the digital sector (equally characterized by rapid evolution of market dynamics) has been earmarked as the prime candidate for increased imposition of interim measures. As noted by Competition Commissioner Vestager after the Broadcom interim measures decision: “[I]nterim measures are one way to tackle the challenge of enforcing our competition rules in a fast and effective manner. And this is why they are so important. Especially in fast-moving markets. Whenever necessary, I am therefore committed to making the best possible use of this important tool.”35
5. Introducing Ex Post Merger Control 
The idea of introducing an ex post merger control regime, which has recently been circulating among policy circles in the EU, is arguably closely related to the perceived inadequacies of the abuse of dominance rules. These inadequacies, it is claimed, would have contributed to the creation of “mega-players” in the digital sector.
In 2018, the French competition authority launched a public consultation on a proposal to introduce a new ex post review mechanism into the French merger control regime. Under this system, unreported past mergers that did not meet EU or national filing thresholds would be open to investigation by the French competition authority if the latter would determine after implementation that the transaction is raising substantial competition concerns in France.36 The French authority originally proposed a post-transaction deadline of between six months and two years, after which ex post intervention would no longer be possible. However, more recently Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, has expressed support for the possibility of reviewing “killer acquisitions” in certain sectors, most notably the digital sector, years after the conclusion of the transaction, invoking as inspiration the US merger control system which allows for a review of mergers years after their completion.37
Although the view that the entrenchment of certain firms’ market positions is a fait accompli that can perhaps only be undone by essentially rewinding the clock on those firms’ years-long expansion may be understandable in some cases, the introduction of an ex post review would constitute a significant shift for merger control standards in the EU. Merger control has traditionally operated within the EU in an ex ante fashion, and for good reason: the legal uncertainty that an ex post regime entails could be too significant and therefore have an inhibiting effect, especially if the deadline for intervention post-transaction is very long. On the other hand, to effectively take account of the real effects of a merger on competition, a longer time horizon may be necessary.
Striking a balance between these conflicting considerations is certainly not easy. However, other proposals that have been voiced on the subject – although not perfect themselves – could be more prudent. For example, a wider introduction of transaction-value-based thresholds would be a more modest way of capturing acquisitions of start-ups by big tech firms that fall under the radar in a pure turnover-based threshold system. Another way of tackling the specific concern of “killer” acquisitions, although indirect, is offered in the UK Furman Report: for companies with the “strategic market status” designation, all acquisitions could be made subject to mandatory notification.  A more modest approach to address “killer” acquisitions has very recently been advanced by Competition Commissioner Vestager suggesting that the European Commission could be empowered to review transactions referred to the Commission by national competition authorities even if those authorities themselves do not have the power to review these transactions because they fall below the national turnover thresholds.38 Finally, a more vigorous application of interim measures in the context of abuse of dominance investigations could contribute to a more speedy and efficient antitrust enforcement, thereby preventing the risk of systematic consolidation and expansion of such firms’ market power.
  
C. Conclusion
The ongoing vigorous policy debate on reforming the application of antitrust law in the digital sector is not without reason. The digitalization of the economy has brought with it notable challenges for maintaining competitive conditions in digital and digitally enabled markets. However, certain challenges in the digital sphere are not novel and have already been dealt with by competition authorities and courts in both digital and non-digital markets using the existing antitrust toolset with success. While the digital economy’s particularities may require some tweaks to the enforcement mechanism, it is important to assess each proposal against robust necessity and proportionality standards, while placing the need to guard procedural defense rights – and, in a sense, the rule of law – at a prominent place in that reform process.
Some proposals and general policy directions for reform are uncontroversial, such as enhancing and facilitating the application of interim measures. However, before implementing concrete reforms, it is equally important to carefully study the implications of each initiative that might bring about deeper and lasting changes to the foundations of competition law enforcement in the EU. Ex ante prohibitions, the establishment of expansive market investigation powers and ex post merger control are just some of the proposals that require intense scrutiny to avoid generating chilling effects: first in their rationale, and second, if considered desirable, also in their design. It remains to be seen how this delicate balancing act will play out in practice.

25 The concept of “gatekeeper” originates in the work of social psychologist Kurt Lewin and has been used in different contexts in various fields (information science, communications, management). Within the broader regulatory context, Emily Laidlaw identifies “gatekeepers” as “non-state actors with the capacity to alter the behaviour of others in circumstances where the state has limited capacity to do the same.” See Emily Laidlaw, “A framework for identifying Internet information gatekeepers” (2010) 24(3) International Review of Law, Computers & Technology 263, 265.

579,"October 6, 2020",Antitrust Enforcers Gather at the ICN 2020 Virtual Annual Conference to Tackle Challenges Presented by Digital Markets,"

By Susan Zhu (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP)1
 
On September 14-17, the International Competition Network (“ICN”) held its 2020 Annual Conference. This year’s conference was jointly hosted by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was held virtually and, for the first time, was open to the public.2 Over the course of the four-day conference, more than 3,000 attendees heard from top competition enforcers and experts from around the globe.
The focus of the ICN 2020 Annual Conference was on challenges posed by digital markets and online platforms to competition policy. Participants remarked that the topic was especially relevant because the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the rate of digital development, but has also led to protectionist tendencies by some governments and calls to relax antitrust standards in deference to industrial policy.  The DOJ and FTC expressed their conviction that antitrust enforcers should push back against these tendencies and ensure robust competition in the marketplace. Other enforcers agreed that antitrust enforcement is critical, and many expressed an urgency to meet these new challenges and advocate domestically for the importance of competition policy. Enforcers also agreed that going forward, competition policy in the digital age will become increasingly interconnected with data privacy and consumer protection.
Substantively, the main challenges identified by antitrust enforcers were alleged monopolization/abuse of dominance conduct by large online platforms; so-called “killer acquisitions” (acquisitions of small startup companies); and pricing algorithms. It was apparent during the conference that the U.S. agencies and non-U.S. agencies, notably the European Commission (“EC”), had divergent approaches to digital markets and online platforms, especially as they pertain to monopolization/abuse of dominance claims of the Big Four (Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook). While certain non-U.S. enforcers, such as the EC and the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”), elaborated on new regulations and tools they are developing, the U.S. enforcers reiterated their position that the existing laws and tools in the U.S. are flexible enough to meet any challenges posed by digital markets. Top U.S. enforcers also repeatedly and strongly cautioned against new regulatory regimes and tools, including ex ante rules and interim measures, as “blunt tools of government mandated technology solutions” that are subject to “regulatory capture” and are likely to chill competition and innovation rather than promote them. There was, however, more consensus among U.S. and non-U.S. enforcers that merger thresholds may need to be adapted to catch acquisitions of small startups by large players and that companies need to adjust their compliance policies to address digital challenges, such as pricing algorithms.
 
Some Consensus…
As a general matter, competition enforcers and experts around the world agreed that the world has become rapidly digitized and the development may accelerate even more in the near future. Indeed, digitization is no longer confined to “technology” markets, but has permeated almost every facet of the economy. Many enforcers and experts also commented that digital markets, particularly online platforms, often have characteristics that may present challenges to competition policy, such as multi-sided platforms, zero-price business models, and indirect network effects.
In responding to these challenges, enforcers across various jurisdictions agreed that it is important for competition authorities to invest in new internal resources relevant to digital markets. To that end, many jurisdictions have reorganized or newly established staff who are exclusively focused on the digital economy. For example, the DOJ reorganized its Technology and Financial Services Section to focus exclusively on technology markets and platform business models. Other jurisdictions have brought in non-legal staff like data scientists and IT experts to strengthen their internal knowledge base and skill set. For example, the Korean Federal Trade Commission (“KFTC”) recently hired fifteen digital forensic experts. Moreover, many enforcers are utilizing sophisticated technology tools and large volumes of data to detect violations or monitor compliance, particularly in the cartel space. Enforcers also emphasized that companies need to make sure that their compliance programs are updated appropriately to address potential new areas of liability, such as machine pricing algorithms.
Enforcers across multiple jurisdictions further agreed that one of the challenges posed by digital markets are acquisitions of small companies that are below merger filing thresholds because they do not yet have significant revenues, but nevertheless may have other assets that pose a competitive threat, such as a large user base or a large amount of data. Enforcers from many jurisdictions indicated that they have implemented or are considering alternatives to turnover thresholds to address this issue, such as transaction value or market share thresholds. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons stated that the FTC is conducting a 6(b) study of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft with regards to their acquisitions of nascent companies that are below the merger filing thresholds. The FTC hopes that the study will allow it to “examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals,” “learn more about how small firms perform after they are acquired by large technology firms,” and help it consider “whether additional transactions should be subject to premerger notification requirements.”3
  
… and Some Differences
Despite consensus on many important issues, the conference also laid bare some key differences in how competition authorities view the need for new legal frameworks to address digital markets. The divergence was most apparent between the U.S. agencies and the EC. EC Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager described digital markets and online platforms as unique because they are often winner-take-all and prone to tipping, meaning that winners can capture dominant market shares and become gatekeepers that put up barriers to keep other competitors out. Enforcers from other non-U.S. jurisdictions agreed that large market shares and high concentrations are potentially problematic. U.S. enforcers and experts disagreed for the most part. In his keynote speech, Professor Herbert Hovenkamp opined that for the most part, large online platforms like the Big Four are not winner-take-all (or natural monopolies) because there is significant product differentiation. FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson agreed that the winner-take-all assumption does not describe most online platforms. She also highlighted that consumers can benefit from network effects, so the existence of a platform with strong network effects does not necessarily mean there is a need for stronger enforcement. Similarly, Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim reminded the audience that “digital” is not just one thing and digital companies have different business models, which modify their incentives.
This divergence plays out in the agencies’ responses to challenges posed by digital markets. Several non-U.S. jurisdictions have established or are working on new regulatory regimes and tools. EC Commissioner Vestager spoke about two initiatives: 1) the New Competition Tool (“NCT”); and 2) the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) ex ante rules for large online platforms. (The NCT would allow the EC to investigate and impose remedies in markets when it believes the market structures are inherently anticompetitive without a prior finding of infringement by any specific companies. Several European enforcers also expressed hope that the NCT may be a useful tool to investigate tacit collusions as a result of AI and machine pricing algorithms. The DSA ex ante rules would be a list of dos and don’ts for what the EC considers to be large gatekeeper platforms.) Another example discussed was the ACCC, which is working on the News Media Bargaining Code to address bargaining imbalances between platforms and businesses.
U.S. enforcers, including FTC Chairman Simons and Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, expressed the U.S. position that new regulatory regimes, especially ex ante rules, are not the answer, and that the U.S. antitrust laws are flexible enough to adapt to big technology companies and reach conduct that undermines competition. As Delrahim said, “[b]y timely using our existing laws to ensure robust competition in the digital marketplace, we can prevent having to resort to the blunt tool of government mandated technological solutions, which can stifle the very innovative atmosphere that our competition laws seek to promote.”4  Simons similarly advised “strong caution before adopting any regulatory regime rather than relying on a competition regime” because U.S. history shows that regulatory regimes are often subject to “regulatory capture and political influence, resulting in entrenched dominant firms and artificial barriers to new competition.”5  Delrahim agreed that agencies “get captured by the industries they regulate” because “the rules cannot adapt, and what happens is that businesses innovate to those rules rather than innovating for the consumer ultimately.”  For instance, Simons explained that the EC’s proposed ex ante regulations for “gatekeepers” will need to have “some kind of a threshold at which somebody becomes a gatekeeper or some other kind of dominance threshold that triggers the regulation and what you have to worry about there is creating an incentive to stop competing before or to pull your punches before you hit that threshold,” which is “very damaging to consumer welfare.”  Delrahim also emphasized that competition authorities have to make sure that any new regulations and tools do not “expand beyond the reach of competition law under the guise of competition laws.” In summary, he iterated U.S. jurisprudence’s long held conviction that “antitrust laws represent an effort to avoid detailed government regulation of business by keeping competition in control of prices” and government should “confine its responsibility to seeing that a true competitive economy functions.”
 
How to Remedy
By the same token, the divergence was reflected in the agencies’ approach to remedies. EC Commissioner Vestager explained that because digital markets are prone to tipping, it is sometimes appropriate to utilize interim measures during a pending investigation to ensure that there is no irreversible anticompetitive harm, as the EC did in Broadcom.6 U.S. enforcers, on the other hand, cautioned strongly against interim measures, both for due process concerns and because several U.S. studies have concluded that antitrust remedies in past monopolization cases have largely been ineffective. As FTC Commissioner Wilson stressed, “if history demonstrates remedies in unilateral conduct cases have been at best irrelevant and at worst have inflicted harm on consumers, I worry that imposing interim measures before an investigation has completed increases the likelihood that we may harm rather than benefit consumers.”  For the same reason, Wilson stated that structural remedies are less likely to be appropriate in Section 2 monopolization cases, which Professor Hovenkamp also agreed with. Indeed, Wilson suggested that if there is no viable remedy available, enforcers should seriously consider whether to pursue enforcement.
Enforcers did generally agree that data will be an important aspect of remedy assessment because it plays a crucial role for many digital markets and online platforms. However, there was no consensus on what form a data remedy might take. Data access, interoperability, transparency, prohibition of data aggregation were all mentioned as potential remedies, but enforcers acknowledged that each has drawbacks and it can be difficult to devise an effective remedy.  Indeed, U.S. enforcers have observed in the past that forced sharing of data “reduces the incentive to invest in innovation” and is an “inherently regulatory” approach, which is why U.S. laws generally do not impose a duty to share one’s assets (data or otherwise) with competitors.7 They have also cautioned that “legally mandated data access, data sharing, or data pooling involves significant administrative costs” and mandatory data sharing may “cause enhanced risks of cartelization.”8
 
ICN Going Forward
As the ICN is entering its third decade, it will be interesting to see how it evolves and responds to the new challenges its members face. Participants at the conference praised the ICN for creating a forum for competition enforcers to collaborate and share best practices, as well as helping new competition agencies grow. Going forward, ICN plans to focus further on diversity and inclusiveness (especially inclusion of developing countries and new competition agencies) in composition, participation, and agenda. ICN members acknowledged that there is, and there will be, skepticism of the importance of competition law, especially during times of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic or in a jurisdiction where the competition authority has been established only recently. Many ICN members expect that they may need to tackle political questions or collaborate with other relevant government agencies, such as consumer protection and data privacy. ICN members also acknowledged that continued outward-looking advocacy (i.e., ICN as an external advocate) will be critical for the future of competition law and committed to continue to advocate for competition enforcement.

580,"September 30, 2020",Report: DOJ’s Google Antitrust Suit May Come Next Week,"


Months of investigations into Google’s alleged violation of antitrust laws is expected to culminate in a lawsuit as early as next week, sources told Reuters.
When the government’s case against Google reaches a courtroom, prosecutors will focus on the multinational technology conglomerate’s power over internet searches, the news service reported.
Sources told Reuters the complaint is expected to accuse the world’s dominant search engine of hurting competitors, including Microsoft’s Bing.
In addition, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also been investigating Google’s search advertising, the ads that appear under a search box when someone looks up a word or phrase.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is urging state attorneys general to become plaintiffs in the suit. The Mountain View, California-based company has insisted it has not committed any wrongdoing, noting users have access to other information and eCommerce sites.
Google has stated that users can choose Amazon to buy products and Twitter for news. In the competitive world of advertising, Google claims it faces competition from many companies, including Oracle and Verizon.
While DOJ investigators examined Google’s ability to place ads across the internet and the prices it charges advertisers, the suit was narrowed to the company’s search engine. Prosecutors say the sharp focus will allow the antitrust complaint to be filed soon and have the best chance of beating any potential court challenges.
Attorney General William Barr has vowed to bring the case against Google by October 1.
In 2019, Federal Trade Commissioner (FTC) Rohit Chopra said fining tech companies is not enough. “We’re not going to solve some of these problems just by small-time fines that aren’t going to change the underlying business model of these firms,” he said. “We actually have to take a hard look at whether these behemoths are killing off innovation and competition.”
Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have faced backlash from lawmakers and regulators around the globe. The president has supported efforts to limit the power of the tech giants. In addition, the House of Representatives and the FTC have each had their own separate investigations.

Cloud services like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google need more competitors so European businesses have more choice about where to store their data, the European Union’s tech and antitrust chief says at an online conference Monday, reported Bloomberg Law. 
“We need competition to the cloud solutions that we see today,” said European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, adding it was important that European businesses “feel they have real choices when it comes to how and where to store their data.”
Speaking at an event on Online Competition staged by the German Presidency of the EU in early September, the Commission’s Vice-President for Digital, Margarethe Vestager, also noted how Europe’s online marketplaces should not be controlled by a handful of dominant gatekeeper platforms.
“Europe’s online marketplaces should be vibrant ecosystems, where startups have a real chance to blossom. They shouldn’t be closed shops, controlled by a handful of gatekeeper platforms,” she said.
In wider EU attempts to clamp down on so-called ‘gatekeeper platforms,’ the EU executive will, alongside the Digital Services Act, also present before the close of the year a New Competition Tool, which will be designed to mitigate structural risks in markets and intervene in situations whereby a market is close to ‘tipping.’

As the Trump administration moves toward antitrust action against search giant Google, it’s campaigning to enlist support from sympathetic state attorneys general across the country, reported the Detroit News. 
And President Donald Trump was pushing his campaign against big tech on Wednesday, September 23, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounced as biased against conservative views.
The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government’s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.
Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.
For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 US states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google’s business practices. They cited “potential monopolistic behavior.”

583,"September 24, 2020",The Venture Capitalism Business Model for Start-Ups and the Debate on Killer Acquisitions: The Greek Example,"

By Petros Vinis (Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton)1
 
On August 27, Greece’s PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis congratulated InstaShop, a grocery delivery platform with around 500,000 users in five markets, on the largest Greek-founded start-up company acquisition for a value of $360 million.2 The PM mentioned that “with R&D based in Greece and initial Greek investment, it highlights how our start-up ecosystem is thriving and going from strength to strength.”3  Earlier in May, Microsoft acquired Softomotive, another Greek-founded start-up platform dealing with software robotic automation, which was till that date the largest acquisition of a Greek tech company for approximately $150 million.4
It was not long ago though that the European Commission’s (“Commission”) Vice President and Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager had marked similar “killer acquisitions” as “a recurring issue,” whereby large digital businesses “may be blocking innovation by buying tech start-ups.”5 Also, former Chief Economist of DG Comp Tommasso Valletti had suggested that competition agencies are under-enforcing in the area of killer acquisitions due to a lack of appropriate legal tools and had explicitly mentioned that allowing a Big Tech company to further grow, by e.g. acquiring yet another application for mobile phones, “has limited social benefit compared to stopping it from acquiring a smaller business that could go on to become its next competitor.”6
Large-scale concentration on the tech pyramid is certainly not welcomed by the European competition agency, as further demonstrated by the launch of the review of the Market Definition Notice of 1997. In that regard, Commissioner Vestager has previously clearly expressed her concern on large digital businesses “expanding their powers across the digital world” and creating “an ecosystem of services that could leave consumers locked in.”7
The debate around “killer acquisitions” relates to the impact of mergers on innovation, and how to deal with transactions in digital industries in particular. The concerns expressed by the Commission center around the ability of large incumbent companies to buy up potential future rivals or rival products, thereby either preventing the emergence of a new product or further entrenching their incumbent position by acquiring a nascent rival who ceases to be an independent player.8
The Commission has long faced criticism on its “wilful blindness” towards the innovation-stimulating (rather than innovation-killing) effects of these type of acquisitions, which are essentially based on the venture capital business model. Venture capital and private equity investment into early-stage projects and start-ups is critical. This type of investment might not have happened in the first place, if investors were not given the ability and the choice to exit their investment by selling to a strategic buyer. The example of how the following Greek start-ups took advantage of the venture capital business model to eventually reach great revenues from their acquisition is enlightening in that respect:

The game-changer year for Softomotive was 2018, when the British private equity firm Grafton Capital injected $25 million to acquire 25 percent of the company, with the aim of the rapid development and the eventual acquisition of the company by a larger digital group. Grafton Capital transferred Softomotive’s HQ in London and entrusted the management of the company to the co-founder of Upstream (another leading Greek firm in the field of e-commerce) and the former CEO of Sage Group, one of Britain’s largest IT groups.9 These moves projected confidence in Softomotive’s Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) product and within two years attracted Microsoft’s interest.
InstaShop was initially backed in 2015 by VentureFriends, a European early-stage investor from Greece, and Jabbar, an investor from the Middle East region. Equifund’s contribution was also crucial in the financing of the company. Equifund is an initiative created by the Hellenic Republic in cooperation with the European Investment Fund (EIF) and co-financed by the EU and national funds, which has as its object the strengthening of “the venture capital market in Greece, which can in turn provide entrepreneurs with the crucial financing they need to grow their businesses (and attract private sector investment).”10 Equifund had funded Venture Friends, which in turn invested in InstaShop.

Equifund’s (indirect) involvement in Instashop’s acquisition raises an additional policy issue that has not been so far properly brought to light in the context of the debate on killer acquisitions – the strategic decision by Member States and the European Union to boost the economy through mobilizing private financing for strategic investments. This vision is reflected in the European Fund for Strategic Investments (“EFSI,” also known as “Juncker Plan”), which aims, among others, to “help small businesses to start up, to grow and to expand by providing risk finance.”11 The European Fund for Strategic Investments is an EU-budget guarantee providing the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) with a “first loss protection,” which means that the EIB is able to provide financing to projects with a higher risk than normal.
As further shown by the infographic below, 34 percent of the investment funds that EFSI has mobilized so far, reaching the amount of approximately EUR 524 billion, relates to investment in “smaller companies,” including start-ups. Source: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/jobs-growth-and-investment/investment-plan-europe/investment-plan-results_en
Greece, in its part, in an effort to foster an investment-friendly environment, has already since 2013 introduced a law on the “Creation of a Development Friendly Environment for Strategic and Private Investments” and, among other initiatives (including the Equifund mentioned above), has launched the “Startup Greece” online portal to promote entrepreneurship. More recently, the Minister of Trade announced the Greek government’s intention to create a start-up hub in Athens12] and activate an EU program of subsidizing insurance contributions for start-up companies.13
It seems contradictory that while the European Union is strongly endorsing the start-up business model and proactively helping its financing in all EU Member States, it is indirectly casting doubts on this business model by letting in the discussions on “killer acquisitions” through the back door. Private investors, start-up founders and national governments require clarity from the Commission with respect to its intentions on the proposed two-pronged approach on “killer acquisitions” (i.e. the revision of merger control thresholds to capture acquisitions of early stage products14 and/or the shift of the burden of proof to the acquirer to show that the acquisition is pro-competitive).
Firstly, will the Commission endorse the introduction of a transaction value-based threshold, as the appropriate enforcement trigger (thus potentially influencing commercial negotiations on the set deal price)? And how does the Commission plan to treat the (currently non-harmonized) national legislative attempts to introduce such thresholds – would there be a “one size fits all” valuation threshold, given the vastly different dynamics in the economies of many of the Member States?15
Secondly, with respect to the reversal of the burden of proof, what exactly would the acquirer need to prove – the absence of a significant impediment to effective competition or the pro-competitive benefits and efficiencies of the transaction? In the latter case, how would these efficiency gains be substantiated – perhaps through long-term business plans, describing the proposed incorporation of the nascent product to the acquirer’s portfolio?  And what is the possibility that these would act as quasi-commitments, on the basis of which the Commission could hold the acquirer accountable, if it deviates from such plans?
It is evident that these are only a fraction of the questions and issues which could severely frustrate the deal-making process between start-ups and large-scale acquirers.  Still, it is highly unlikely that Europe’s competition agency believes that every start-up is a potential “unicorn,” i.e. a maverick-in-the-making that can shake up the incumbent market ecosystem, which could justify the disruption of the aforementioned EU policy goals to support the start-up ecosystem. Therefore, the Commission’s concerns regarding killer acquisitions need to be clearly delineated and benchmarked against policy considerations. Europe’s competition agency should seek to strike a balance between the need for regulation of the digital world and the EU’s and Member States’ strategic priorities. The EU’s (mainly human) capital invested into the creation of start-ups cannot afford to be a side effect in the EU’s intervention against Big Tech.
The domino effect that could result from the Commission’s potential decision to adopt an aggressive enforcement strategy on killer acquisitions, could create a chilling effect on (largely EU-funded) investments in start-ups, the business model of which is largely structured around their future ability to be absorbed by a larger group. This would, in turn, condemn start-ups to being forced to create a business plan that would ensure their viability longer than the regularly envisaged acquisition cycle. As a result, this could reduce not only the risk appetite from private equity but also the creation of new business ideas, if their creators cannot secure a safe exit strategy.

584,"September 21, 2020",Trump Says He Will Block Any TikTok Deal Allowing Chinese Control,"


Donald Trump said he might rescind his tentative blessing for a deal between Oracle and ByteDance to create a new US-based TikTok service, casting doubt on the agreement as Chinese state media signaled reluctance in Beijing, reported Bloomberg.
Speaking in an interview on Fox News on Monday September 21, Trump said he wouldn’t approve the deal if the Chinese company retains control of TikTok. However, he also indicated that he expected Chinese influence to be diluted by a future public offering of the new company.
“They will have nothing to do with it, and if they do, we just won’t make the deal,” Trump said, referring to ByteDance, which owns TikTok. “It’s going to be controlled, totally controlled by Oracle, and I guess they’re going public and they’re buying out the rest of it — they’re buying out a lot, and if we find that they don’t have total control then we’re not going to approve the deal.”
Shortly after Trump’s comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the China state-affiliated Global Times, tweeted that Beijing would likely reject the deal “because the agreement would endanger China’s national security, interests and dignity.”
The Global Times is a tabloid run by the People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party. Hu’s tweets are closely watched after accurately forecasting previous moves by China’s government, though his statements at times don’t reflect official policy, reported Bloomberg.
ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok in August, when Trump threatened to ban the app in the US over national security concerns about the service’s data gathering. After Microsoft Corp. made a proposal for a full buyout, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle’s offering, in which the Chinese parent will maintain a solid majority stake.
ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the app’s operations in the U.S. and the rest of the world excluding China.

Donald Trump was on a flight back from Florida in late July when he announced the US faced a new threat that needed to be banned: TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app which has become hugely popular among younger Americans.
Delivered to reporters on Air Force One, the president’s decision came as a complete surprise to the lawyers and White House aides who had been working to finalise a deal that would place TikTok’s US business in the hands of Microsoft, the Seattle-based tech giant. “We are not an M&A country,” Mr Trump said, using a term for mergers and acquisitions.

The US Commerce Department has issued a new order to block people in the US from downloading the popular video-sharing app TikTok as of September 20th, Reuters first reported Friday.
The full order was published by the Department of Commerce on Friday morning. “Any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd,” the order reads, “shall be prohibited to the extent permitted under applicable law.” It is set to take effect on September 20th.
Over the last few weeks, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, has been engaged in talks with US companies like Microsoft and Oracle to create a new company, TikTok Global, that would meet the Trump administration’s concerns over user data security. Earlier this month, President Trump sparked negotiations after calling for US TikTok operations to be shut down unless sold to a US company by September 15th. Microsoft has dropped out of the bidding, leaving Oracle and Walmart as the leading candidates to hold stake in the new TikTok company. Still, the administration has yet to strike a deal that meets all of its requirements.
Officials told Reuters that a Commerce Department rule banning US downloads of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps like the messaging platform WeChat could be issued as early as Friday. That rule would reportedly go into effect Sunday, September 20th, banning new downloads of both WeChat and TikTok.
Reuters said that the administration’s ban would bar Apple and Google from offering any of these Chinese-owned apps in their app stores for US users. The tech companies would still be allowed to offer TikTok to users outside of the US. US-based companies would not be barred from conducting business with the Chinese-owned apps, like how Walmart and Starbucks allow users to make transactions through WeChat.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Reuters Friday, “We have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.”

591,"September 14, 2020",Oracle Officially Named As TikTok’s US “Technology Provider”,"


Oracle Corp., the Redwood City, Calif.-based software and technology giant, has confirmed that it has been selected by ByteDance to be the “trusted technology provider” that will take over Chinese-based TikTok’s U.S. operations.
The two-sentence statement was issued Monday (Sept. 14) following U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s announcement of Oracle’s winning bid for TikTok’s U.S. operations on CNBC.
Oracle bested a bid by Microsoft Corp. for TikTok, a popular video-sharing app that President Donald Trump has threatened to ban in the United States over allegations that it could share Americans’ personal information with the Chinese government. He signed an executive order to do so unless ByteDance reached agreement to sell TikTok’s U.S. arm to an American firm in the next several weeks. However, it’s unclear if making Oracle a “trusted technology partner” for the operation means ByteDance is selling TikTok’s U.S. arm or not.
But in its blog on Sunday, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft wrote that ByteDance had given it a heads-up about Oracle’s winning bid. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users while protecting national security interests, “ Microsoft said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”

Those possibilities include handing over operational control of TikTok data to a US tech company, while potentially still holding on to some ownership of assets.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Wednesday that ByteDance was working with the US government on ways to avoid a full sale. The discussions have been taking place for months, the Journal reported, and the situation remains fluid. It’s still unclear if the Trump administration will be willing to go along with such a solution.
The White House previously set a deadline of Sept. 20 for the Chinese-owned company to announce a plan to sell TikTok’s US operations to a US corporation, or face a shutdown in the United States by Sept. 29. Any such deal would have to be completed by Nov. 12.
The company had been negotiating to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft in partnership with Walmart, or Oracle. A deal was close to completion, prompting CEO Kevin Mayer to announce his resignation.However, the sale hit a snag after Chinese officials introduced new restrictions on technology exports that could require Chinese approval for TikTok to sell its algorithm, which is part of the core value of the app.

593,"September 6, 2020",A Topology of Multisided Digital Platforms,"


By Daniel Hanley (Open Markets Institute)
Digital platforms dominate the marketplace. The largest platforms–Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft (collectively known as “GAFAM”)–have an unparalleled financial position in the marketplace, and collectively maintain at least a thirty-three percent market share in fifteen separate markets with user bases in the billions. These corporations are also consistently ranked as the largest companies on Earth by market capitalization. The GAFAM companies transact and function as intermediaries with both buyers and sellers, which designates them as multi-sided businesses–more commonly known as platforms. The conventional business model consists of transacting with only consumers or sellers, known as single-sided firms. Although the veracity and legal significance of this difference between single-sided firms and multi-sided platforms are debatable, this article will accept the current schema that platforms operate under different conditions than their single-sided counterparts. In what follows, because of their market power, user bases, and anti-competitive conduct, this article will use the GAFAM platforms as representative examples of the kind of anti-competitive actions that digital multi-sided platforms can engage in. This article organizes the actions of multi-sided platforms into a framework that categorizes their characteristics and conduct by the goals multi-sided businesses are trying to achieve. This framework consists of three categories: Amassing Characteristics, Entrenching Conduct, and Exploitative Conduct. These categories provide the framework for this article. Part I describes Amassing Characteristics, which are business conditions used by multi-sided platforms to obtain a significant user base. Part II details Entrenching Conduct, which are business practices multi-sided platforms can implement to inhibit users from leaving the platform and maintain their user base. Part III details Exploitative Conduct, which are the efforts and the ability of a multi-sided platform to leverage their existing user base to suppress competition, enhance its market power, and extract value from its entrenched user base. This framework can aid antitrust enforcers and scholars to understand how the characteristics and conduct described in this article interact to facilitate market power, undermine competition, and, particularly when some of these practices are executed by platforms in unison, enable platforms to become resistant to future competition. Such analysis can encourage agencies, governments, and private litigants to use the antitrust laws to curb the market power of multi-sided platforms and provide justification for regulatory changes.

594,"August 31, 2020",Report: TikTok Sale Could Come Tuesday,"


The winning bidder for TikTok’s U.S., New Zealand and Australian operations could be announced as soon as Tuesday (Sept. 1), sources told CNBC.
But the source did not reveal or perhaps did not know whether the winning bidder is the team of Microsoft Corp. and Walmart Inc., Oracle, Twitter or an unnamed company that has negotiated under the radar.
The saga began on Aug. 6 when President Donald Trump issued an executive decision to ban transactions with TikTok or its parent company, China-based ByteDance Ltd., within 45 days. Later, Trump issued an order that gave the China-based company 90 days, until Sept. 20, to divest its U.S. TikTok operations.
Trump raised security issues alleging the app could be taking personal information from TikTok users and passing it on to the Chinese government. ByteDance has denied the allegations and filed suitin U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, where TikTok’s American operations are based. ByteDance argues Trump’s far-reaching action is unconstitutional because it failed to give the company a chance to respond. It also alleges that the administration’s national security justification for the order is false.

Triller executive chairman Bobby Sarnevesht said on Friday, August 28, that the short-video app had made a US$20 billion offer with investment firm Centricus Asset Management for the assets of rival TikTok that China’s ByteDance is seeking to divest.
According to Retuers, ByteDance and TikTok denied knowledge of the offer, raising questions over whether the proposed deal between two of the most popular social media apps in the United States represented a serious bid or was a publicity stunt.
ByteDance has been ordered by President Donald Trump to divest TikTok in the United States, amid security concerns over the personal data it handles.
Microsoft and Oracle are among the US companies vying to acquire the assets of TikTok, which claims about 100 million monthly active users in the United States. The Chinese firm is expected to pick a bidder to enter into exclusive talks soon.
“We submitted an offer directly to the chairman of ByteDance through Centricus, and have confirmation it was received and is under consideration by him,” Sarnevesht told Reuters.

596,"August 27, 2020",Antitrust Subcommittee and Big Tech CEOs Live on Very Different Planets,"


By MoginRubin, Competition Law News
They appeared at the hearing, appropriately enough, digitally. This allowed the witnesses, captains of the tech industry, to be in two places at once on July 27, 2020, when they testified before the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law. When it came to their conduct in their respective markets, the CEOs and the members of the Subcommittee also were in separate places.
Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.; Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google parent Alphabet, Inc.; Tim Cook, CEO, Apple, Inc.; and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Inc. testified live via web video before the Subcommittee chaired by David N. Cicilline of Rhode Island. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on the Judiciary, chaired by Jerrold Nadler of New York. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey declined an invitation from Subcommittee Republicans, much to their irritation. As President Trump’s favorite bullhorn, Twitter has drawn the attention of the commander in chief and his allies for flagging some of his tweets as violations of Twitter’s “abusive behavior” policy.
To hear the CEOs tell it, their companies are building a better world. And in many ways they certainly are. This article was drafted on an Apple computer using Microsoft Word with some research performed via Google. It will be noticed on Twitter, and it may even make its way to a Facebook page near you. The CEOs say their platforms give individuals and businesses access to tools and information they would never have had before, and much of it for free, they said. They are socially and environmentally responsible. They are creating jobs. They connect people with each other, with valuable products and services, and with information in volumes never imagined. They are doing all of this in the face of stiff competition from larger players in specific segments as well as smaller innovators and disruptors snapping at their heels.
To hear the Democratic members, the companies are ruthless, mercenary bullies who have little regard for fair competition or the privacy of individuals or companies. They use their dominance to act both as service providers and competitors against the retailers use their platforms. Their positions give them access to competitive information which makes them better able to compete with their own clients. Should any company start to give them a run for their money, these giants devour them. And, to hear some of the Republican members, the companies are biased against conservative points of view.

597,"August 27, 2020",TikTok CEO Quits Amid Controversy,"


After being on the job for just 90 days, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer said he will quit as the popular short video sharing company gets closer to a showdown with the White House over its alleged ties to the Chinese government.The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Mayertold staff that the political atmosphere has shifted in the last month and the expected sale of TikTok’s US operation will likely change the operation.“I understand that the role that I signed up for including running TikTok globally will look very different as a result of the U.S. administration’s action to push for a selloff of the U.S. business,” Mayer wrote in a letter obtained by the WSJ. “I’ve always been globally focused in my work, and leading a global team that includes TikTok US was a big draw for me.”Vanessa Pappas, the social media company’s US general manager, is expected to serve as interim head of TikTok, Mayer wrote.
For weeks, ByteDance, the Chinese global internet technology company based in Beijing and parent of TikTok, has been at the center of a firestorm. On Aug. 6, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transactions with TikTok if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer within 45 days, alleging the company could be taking personal information from TikTok users and passing it on to the Chinese government.ByteDance has denied the allegations. Since then, TikTok has been in talks with Microsoft Corp. and Oracle for a potential purchase.On Monday, (Aug. 24) ByteDance filed a lawsuit to fight President Trump’s move to ban its video-sharing application. ByteDance argues TikTok poses no security risk.A TikTok blog post said the company had made a “nearly year-long effort…in good faith to provide the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States the voluminous information requested.”The blog added that Trump’s Aug. 6 executive order “has the potential to strip the rights” of millions of Americans to keep using the app while potentially costing U.S. employees their jobs. In addition, the company said, Trump’s threat was made “without any evidence to justify such an extreme action, and without any due process.”

598,"August 25, 2020",An Anticlimactic Ending in the “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook”: An Antitrust Enforcement Action Against Facebook’s Long-Consummated Acquisitions Would be Unwise,"

By Chris Renner (Davis Wright Tremaine)1
 
The “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook” (the “Roadmap”) purports to explain how publicly available materials, sourced primarily from an investigation conducted by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), “might support a finding of liability in a monopolization case [against Facebook] here in the US.”2 Although the Roadmap alleges a range of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook, one of its main allegations is that Facebook’s acquisitions of what the authors describe as nascent or potential rivals — including Instagram and WhatsApp — had a causal connection to the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power by Facebook. Similar charges were levied during a recent House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing.
Although these allegations could theoretically raise Section 2 concerns, there are a number of common-sense reasons to think that such a claim would be speculative and difficult to prove, especially as the main predicates for this theory — the acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 — are well in the past. Given the consumer benefits from those transactions, and the procompetitive rationale for acquisitions of complementary products generally, a challenge to Facebook’s long-consummated acquisitions would be unwise.
First, a plaintiff would struggle to make out a prima facie case on the basis of the conduct alleged in the Roadmap. A Section 2 plaintiff must show that the challenged conduct had some causal connection to the acquisition or maintenance of market power, that is, that the conduct resulted in a less-competitive future, with likely effects on price, output, or quality. Both Instagram and WhatsApp have grown since their acquisition by Facebook, which has itself seen strong growth over the relevant timeframes, and consumer surplus has been created in the process.3 There is no reason to think that Instagram and WhatsApp would have been more successful but-for their acquisition, and reconstructing after many years what these two firms would have achieved but-for their acquisition by Facebook would be nearly impossible.4 In fact, the CMA Final Report finds evidence “suggestive of Facebook’s wider resources having contributed to Instagram’s success.”5 Similarly, a retrospective study commissioned by the CMA found “reasons to believe that Instagram’s growth has significantly benefitted from the integration with Facebook: Snapchat’s case shows that transforming users’ attention into advertising revenue is no easy task, and Instagram’s success in this respect has likely benefitted from Facebook’s guidance and expertise.”6 Conversely, it is by no means clear that Instagram and WhatsApp would have even survived, let alone thrived, absent their acquisition by Facebook.7 And absent any reason to believe that Instagram and WhatsApp would have grown into even stronger platforms but-for the acquisitions, there is no reason to think that the real world is any worse off as a result of the acquisitions. This, on its own, would likely end a challenge to these acquisitions.
The pre-merger review that each of these transactions received illustrates the forensic and evidentiary differences that a retrospective challenge to these long-consummated transactions would face. The Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of the Instagram transaction in 2012, which included a second request, by taking no action.8 The UK Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”), which also closed its review of the Instagram transaction without taking action, issued a closing statement in 2012 that explained that “In the social networking space, the OFT has no reason to believe that Instagram would be uniquely placed to compete against Facebook, either as a potential social network or as a provider of advertising space.”9 Nor does the benefit of hindsight change the view. For example, in 2019, a retrospective study commissioned by the CMA found no clear way to determine whether Instagram would have struggled as a standalone competitor or, alternatively, developed into a close and capable competitor to Facebook, and that there were efficiencies from the transaction in either scenario.10
Similarly, the European Commission approved the WhatsApp transaction in 2014 without condition, finding that Facebook and WhatsApp were “if anything, distant competitors” in a social networking services market.11 The FTC similarly reviewed and did not challenge the WhatsApp acquisition. Moreover, given that there is no monetization strategy for WhatsApp, the acquisition’s causal connection to any form of consumer injury is especially attenuated.
Second, even if a prima facie case could be established, there are many procompetitive justifications for the acquisitions. In general, acquisitions of start-up companies can allow acquirers to effectively outsource early stage R&D, acquiring new technology only after competition between start-ups has revealed the best technology. Acquirers can also obtain access to top talent in acquisitions of promising start-ups. For start-ups, acquisitions can be an attractive exit strategy in lieu of a risky IPO, and the option to monetize investments in entrepreneurial activity and early-stage R&D may provide high-powered incentives to innovate. In digital markets with differentiated products and innovation-based competition, mergers can enhance incentives to invest in R&D as the merged entities share technological knowledge.12 In fact, the 2019 retrospective commissioned by the CMA found evidence-based and merger-specific efficiencies from Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in the form of more effective targeted advertisements, which can benefit both users of social networks and advertisers.13 The Roadmap authors acknowledge that more effective targeted advertisements benefit consumers.14
The purely speculative theory of harm in any challenge to Facebook’s long-consummated acquisitions, the demonstrable and substantial consumer surplus that accompanied those acquisitions in the real world, and the procompetitive justifications for these and similar transactions, together strongly suggest that an antitrust challenge to these acquisitions risks tampering with an engine of innovation that has developed market-leading companies in the United States. In particular, it would be perverse to focus enforcement efforts on the transactions that were successful in delivering benefits to consumers, chilling the incentive of acquirers to invest in output-enhancing post-merger integration lest they find themselves defending an antitrust action based on those very investments.
Proponents of an antitrust challenge to these acquisitions after all these years make a number of arguments to avoid this simple logic. Here are some of those points, drawn from the Roadmap and other contemporary materials, and presented in a conversational format.
Q. Regardless of the post-acquisition success of Instagram and WhatsApp as part of Facebook, can’t we assume that consumers would have benefitted from these firms staying independent and competing with Facebook, regardless of whether these firms thrived or failed?15
A. Not unless we are willing to assume that these firms would have developed from complements into uniquely close substitutes for Facebook’s social network. Note that if we make this assumption we should also be willing for the sake of intellectual consistency to regard highly differentiated competitors of Facebook today such as Pinterest or Snapchat as potentially strong competitors of Facebook tomorrow, calling into question the degree or durability of market power that Facebook enjoyed at the time of those transactions and today. Perhaps more importantly, and even if we make these assumptions, this argument simply assumes away of all of the demonstrated, measurable consumer welfare benefits that accompanied Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, benefits that are manifest from their impressive post-acquisition growth and could well have outweighed any short-run innovation and quality competition.16 The plaintiff in this scenario would be required to prove that two birds in the bush are worth more than one in the hand. Absent a presumption that the acquisition of a nascent competitor by a firm with market power harms competition regardless of the demonstrated track record of post-acquisition success realized by the acquired firm, a presumption that appears unwarranted, a plaintiff would struggle to establish a prima facie case of harm on these facts.
Q. But what about that plaintiff-friendly causation standard in United States v. Microsoft? Wouldn’t that standard relieve, in whole or in part, the plaintiff’s burden to show that the world would be better off if the acquisitions of Instagram and Facebook had not occurred?
A. Not at all. Microsoft stands for the proposition that causation can be inferred from exclusionary conduct when that conduct likely caused anticompetitive effects, “reasonably appear[s] capable of making a significant contribution to . . . maintaining monopoly power” and has no legitimate business justification.17 Microsoft would not authorize a presumption of causation in a challenge to acquisitions of (at most) nascent competitors that had merger-specific efficiencies.18
Q. Should we be concerned that Facebook’s acquisitions eliminated competition with Instagram and WhatsApp?
A. All horizontal mergers eliminate a rival, and some vertical mergers have the potential to do the same, and yet the vast majority of transactions raise no significant antitrust concerns. Whether analyzed under Section 7’s standard of a substantial reduction in competition or as monopolization under Section 2, the antitrust question turns on the closeness of competition between the parties before the merger, the competitive constraints that remain post-merger and on merger-specific efficiencies. Given the range of competitors Facebook faced at the time of the transactions and today, and the consumer surplus associated with the transactions, challenges to these transactions would likely fail and should probably not be brought in the first place.
In summary, while the acquisition of nascent competitive threats is potentially actionable conduct under Section 2, the case against Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp appears unwarranted in the context of the clear consumer benefits from those acquisitions, not to mention legitimate interests in repose from litigating the merits of transactions examined and cleared by relevant enforcement agencies long ago. Nor is there any obvious reason to believe that the federal antitrust enforcement agencies are less than diligent in addressing acquisitions of nascent competitors when they have reason to believe that those acquisitions are anticompetitive under existing law, as shown by the recent activity of the agencies in this area.19 The acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, however, do not fit that description.

599,"August 24, 2020","General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital Pushing Oracle’s Bid For TikTok","


General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, two major investors in TikTok’s Chinese parent company, are maneuvering to be part of a deal to acquire the U.S. operations of the popular video-sharing app as it seeks to avoid a ban by the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The investment firms, which own large stakes in Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., are key drivers behind a possible bid for TikTok by a group including Oracle Corp., the people said. The Oracle group emerged recently as a possible alternative to Microsoft Corp., which said early this month that it was in talks to buy TikTok’s operations in the U.S. and three other countries.
Microsoft had said it might invite some U.S. investors to join its bid. But more recently Sequoia and General Atlantic grew concerned that they wouldn’t have a place in a Microsoft deal and looked for another potential tech partner that could give them a piece of the action, some of the people said. They are now pushing the potential Oracle bid, which quickly won President Trump’s public support, although some of the people said the Microsoft talks are fluid and outside investors could still be included as minority investors in Microsoft’s bid.
Sequoia and General Atlantic both hold seats on ByteDance’s board. Sequoia’s seat is occupied by its China head, Neil Shen, while its efforts in the U.S. to participate in an acquisition are being led by Global Managing Partner Doug Leone. General Atlantic’s effort is led by its chief executive, Bill Ford, who represents his firm on ByteDance’s board. The investment firms have two points of interest that potentially conflict: their obligation as board members to maximize the value to ByteDance of its prized asset, and trying to buy into TikTok in the U.S. at a good price to capitalize on its potential.

600,"August 24, 2020",CPI Talks… with Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser,"


In this month’s edition of CPI Talks… we have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Phil Weiser, Attorney General for the State of Colorado, Hatfield Professor of Law and Telecommunications, former Executive Director and Founder of the Silicon Flatirons Center for Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship, and Dean Emeritus at the University of Colorado Law School.

Thank you, Mr. Weiser, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.

Colorado, along with 46 other States and territories has initiated an investigation of Facebook for potential antitrust violations, and has joined 50 States and territories in an investigation into Google. In parallel, the FTC has launched its own investigations into Facebook’s and Amazon’s practices, while the DOJ is stepping up its investigation into Google. As you recently noted in the merger context, “[t]he states are independent enforcers of the antitrust laws. It’s up [to] the courts, not a federal agency to decide the lawfulness of a merger.” Is there need for better coordination between individual States and the agencies in this regard?

A strength of the American model of governance is our Federalism. Under this model, States have independent authority and the responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws. This dynamic is also the situation in the international arena, where there is a need for coordination and harmonization. With respect to state-federal coordination, the general rule is that we work very well together, sharing information, documents, and analyses, enabling us to reach better results. Where we end up pursuing different paths, as happened last year in Colorado in a merger between United Health and DaVita Medical Group, that coordination can still hold. The real exception is where the federal government takes umbrage at the possibility that states would go in a different direction and makes the claim that it has the ability to occupy the field, excluding states from exercising their independent authority. In the Sprint/T-Mobile case, where the federal government made such a claim, it was appropriately rejected by the court, as I explained in the address you referenced.

More generally, is litigation the correct means to resolve potentially anticompetitive conduct in high tech sectors, such as social media? Or is a multi-pronged regulatory and litigation-based approach necessary, given that the margin of maneuver of the agencies (and the lower courts) is limited by the relatively restrictive federal case law with respect to certain key antitrust doctrines? Given the high velocity of tech markets, and the relatively slow pace of litigation, is there a risk that industry developments will outpace any evolution in the case law?

There are a couple of questions in this one, so let me take them in turn. First, with respect to the development of antitrust doctrines, I believe that they are supple and, in the face of compelling facts and well-reasoned economic theories of harm, thoughtful judges can adapt to meet new challenges. The Microsoft case stands as a powerful case in point. Second, on the point about antitrust remedies, there is indeed a challenge with respect to dynamic industries. This concern was captured well by Judge Posner after his stint as a special master in the Microsoft case: “The real problem [facing antitrust law] lies on the institutional side: the enforcement agencies and the courts do not have adequate technical resources, and do not move fast enough, to cope effectively with a very complex business sector that changes very rapidly.” There are, however, powerful responses to this concern and for addressing a pattern of conduct that achieves lasting anti-competitive harm. I have discussed strategies for developing remedies both in my scholarly work (see here and here) and as an antitrust enforcer (see here and here).

On a related note, certain players (notably Facebook) have called for government “regulation” of certain aspects of their businesses (notably the dissemination of harmful content). In theory, a similar initiative could apply to competition principles. In parallel, international reports into the digital sector, notably the UK’s 2019 Furman Report, have called for industry codes of conduct to forestall potential antitrust violations. Is there a risk in adopting industry-sponsored initiatives (either in the form of government regulation or “codes of conduct”)? Do such initiatives risk creating a mere smokescreen, or, worse, regulatory capture? How can any “knowledge gap” between industry and the private sector be breached?

This is an important challenge to keep in mind with respect to regulation generally, whether overseen by an administrative agency or through audited self-regulation (or co-regulation, as it called in Europe). I do believe that codes of conduct can play a constructive role where there are checks on the concern of capture and the development of a regulatory capacity to operate effectively. For a longer discussion of this promise, see this article.

The DOJ is currently reviewing its Vertical Merger Guidelines. There appears to be growing recognition among regulators that vertical mergers are not always as benign as had previously been presumed (notably in light of the recent experience of the Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger remedies, and the DOJ’s attempt to block AT&T/Time Warner). In your view, what are the key reforms that ought to be implemented, both in terms of substantive review of vertical mergers and potential remedies? Should agencies and courts adopt a more imaginative approach to the design of behavioral remedies for vertical mergers (despite the DOJ’s stated preference for structural remedies wherever possible)?

This past February, Colorado led a coalition of states that filed comments with the federal agencies on how to approach vertical mergers. (I discussed those comments here.) With respect to key lessons, a starting point is to recognize that, in a range of scenarios, vertical mergers can be anticompetitive and therefore merit close scrutiny. One such scenario is where a vertical merger may remove the most likely potential rival to an incumbent firm. Another scenario is where a dominant firm seeks to undermine an upstart rival by gaining control of a critical input. This was the circumstance in the United/DaVita merger I mentioned earlier, where we took action to protect competition in the Medicare Advantage market. As for behavioral remedies, we discussed the appropriate role for them in our comments, explaining that “[i]f employed to eliminate harm, conduct remedies must be adequate to address identified risks, subject to practicable monitoring by the Agencies, and capable of being effectively enforced in a timely manner.” In the case of the United/DaVita merger, we identified and implemented this very form of relief, ending an exclusive contracting arrangement that facilitated United’s dominant market position.

In the absence of legislative reform at the Federal level, to what extent should State legislatures fill the legislative gap? The Colorado legislature, in particular, has been active in enacting bipartisan legislation to combat anticompetitive practices. Please outline the major reforms introduced at the State level in Colorado. What further work needs to be done, and what can other States (and Congress) learn from Colorado’s experience?

One of the advantages of states is that they can be, as Justice Brandeis put it, laboratories of democracy. To that end, the Colorado General Assembly charged our office with investigating the rise of insulin prices. Between 2012-2016, notably, such prices doubled. In normal competitive markets, we don’t see such behavior. As such, we are now undertaking a study of what dynamics are taking place in this market, whether there are measures for addressing them, and how we can protect those who depend on insulin. After we publish our report this fall, we look forward to contributing to the national debate on this important issue. The Colorado General Assembly also recently addressed the Attorney General’s authority to challenge mergers, adopting the vision that I described earlier: Colorado has independent sovereign authority to review mergers in parallel with, but independent of, federal agencies and we are committed to using that authority appropriately

601,"August 24, 2020",State Antitrust Enforcement: The Same and Not the Same,"
We have a national policy that favors competition over other types of economic arrangements. Like other aspects of our federalist system, there are times when states determine that the best interests of their citizens require a stronger enforcement approach than that taken by the federal authorities, or vice versa. The authority of the states to act independently is strongly supported by statutes and Supreme Court precedent. Recent cases illustrate instances when the states have exercised that authority to pursue a result that they believe will best protect their citizens from anticompetitive harm.

I. INTRODUCTION
There has been much discussion in the past two years about the role of the states — that is, State Attorneys General — in antitrust enforcement. Some aspects are not controversial — for example, the right of a state to address a merger between two health care providers within a state.2 And no one (save the defendant) questioned before the court the New York Attorney General’s authority to seek a nationwide injunction under Section 2 of the Sherman Act to stop a monopoly maintenance scheme with national effects.3 Views on the states’ exercise of their independent authority under federal law are most sharply presented in cases where both federal and state authorities investigate the same matter, under federal law, and reach different conclusions.
Challenges to the states’ authority to enforce the federal antitrust laws are...

602,"August 24, 2020",In Defense of State Enforcement: A Positive Perspective on State and Federal Cooperation,"
Antitrust enforcers do not always see eye to eye. The recent cases of Qualcomm and Sprint/T-Mobile provide two recent examples. Despite the rare fractures that separate enforcers, the two-tiered enforcement infrastructure has significant benefits that outweigh any inefficiencies. State and federal enforcers have been able to expel many of the inefficiencies in our overlapping enforcement regime through cooperation. Cooperation, however, does not happen merely by accident. The spillover effects between state and federal enforcement incentivizes cooperative antitrust federalism. Those spillover effects flow in both directions. On one hand, the concurrent jurisdiction held by States Attorneys General and both federal enforcers under federal law exhibits externalities in which an enforcement decision by one agency affects the decisions by other concurrent enforcers. At the same time, enforcement decisions under federal law have serious implications for States Attorneys General, who have their own state antitrust laws that are commonly constructed and construed consistent with federal law.

Congress has constructed antitrust enforcement in the United States in a cake-like fashion: with three separate layers. Each layer contains its own set of independent enforcers, adding further complexity to the U.S. enforcement regime.

Oracle has expressed an interest in acquiring TikTok, according to the Financial Times, giving Microsoft a potential competitor in its bid to control the Chinese social video app in the US.
Larry Ellison’s enterprise software giant has reportedly held preliminary talks with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance already, working with venture capital firms including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, and is “seriously considering” acquiring its business in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
President Trump issued an executive order on Friday ordering ByteDance to sell its US business within 90 days. The FT notes that Oracle’s billionaire co-founder Ellison is one of the few US tech executives who has been openly supportive of Trump, though it’s not clear whether Oracle would be the White House’s preferred suitor for TikTok.
The FT also stated that said Twitter had also expressed an early interest, but there are said to have been “serious concerns” about its financial capacity for the deal. While ByteDance hasn’t named a price publicly, TikTok’s success propelled it to become the world’s most valuable startup in 2018.

Shares of Rackspace Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: RXT) were up almost 12 percent as of 11:56 a.m. EST Monday (Aug. 17) following a Reuters report indicating that Amazon (Nasdaq: AMAZ) may buy a stake in the company.
Rackspace sells customers access to its own cloud and also offers a service called RackConnect, which helps customers access clouds maintained by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, VMWare and Google Cloud.
Reuters reported that Amazon is considering buying a minority stake in Rackspace, but there is “no certainty” that a deal would be reached. Rackspace’s majority owner is Apollo Global Management Inc.
Rackspace and Apollo declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.
In an SEC filing connected with its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this month, Rackspace listed net income of $102 million and revenue of $2.4 billion for the fiscal year that ended Dec. 31, 2019.

Facebook and Snap have both reportedly held talks with Dubsmash, a lip-syncing short-form video app and rival to TikTok, about a possible acquisition.
The discussions took place in recent weeks and the parties reached the point of talking a price in the “hundreds of millions of dollars”, reports The Information. Despite the talks progressing to that stage, both Facebook and Snap are no longer in conversation with Mobile Motion, Dubsmash’s developer.
Dubsmash, along with other TikTok competitors like Triller and Byte, has seen a surge in downloads in response to the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. TikTok is currently facing the prospect of being blocked in the US after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would prohibit any US individual or company from doing business with TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance. However, its highly unlikely TikTok will actually be banned in the US, particularly with discussions ongoing with companies including Microsoft and Twitter about purchase acquisition of its US business.
At the same time, Facebook and Snap have recently taken inspiration from TikTok with some of their latest features. Facebook launched Reels on Instagram, while Snap began testing a music overlay feature on Snapchat.

606,"August 11, 2020","If It Ain’t Working, Fix It — With Competition, Not Monopoly","
The ability of individuals to repair, maintain, or modify things they own is often referred to as the “right to repair.” In recent years, manufacturers have erected barriers, “repair monopolies” that require customers to have items repaired exclusively by the manufacturer or its authorized agent. These repair monopolies dilute customer ownership. Manufacturers assert that items customers believe they have purchased were “licensed.” Insofar as the “license” view prevails, “owners” may be barred from doing what they want with their devices. Customers pay more for repairs than they otherwise would have, and environmental waste results. Moreover, amidst of the COVID-19 pandemic, repair monopolies have disabled hospitals from fixing broken devices used in treatment, thus demonstrating that protecting the right to repair has critical human health implications. Antitrust laws can — and should — be used to challenge repair monopolies.

By Joe Nocera, Bloomberg
In the late 1990s, when David Boies 1 prosecuted the Microsoft antitrust trial, he told me that despite the thousands of documents, emails and deposition transcripts that were rolled into court each day, no more than 50 were the key to the government’s case. He memorized them and knew right where to find them if he needed them in the middle of a cross-examination.
Of those 50, maybe two dozen were the kind you just don’t forget — bald, vivid illustrations of what the government hoped to prove: that Microsoft was using its monopoly power to squeeze Netscape, the upstart browser company that Microsoft viewed as a potential threat to its Windows monopoly.
“How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?” Microsoft founder Bill Gates asked, according to an email recapping a meeting with AOL executives. (He added, “This is your lucky day.”)
In another email, Gates suggested that Microsoft offer Intuit “something like $1M … in return for switching browsers” from Netscape to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.

608,"August 9, 2020",Longtime Federal Appeals Judge Dies Of Coronavirus At 83,"


Judge Stephen F. Williams, a member of the powerful Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit for more than three decades, died Friday, August 7, of complications from the coronavirus, his family and court officials said. He was 83.
Williams, a senior judge with a professorial manner and special expertise in regulatory and economics law, had been hospitalized since May after becoming sick, reported the Washington Post. 
Although Williams went on senior status in 2001, he continued to handle a full caseload until he turned 80 in 2016 and heard cases until earlier this year.
Williams, whose father had been a well-known lawyer and former law clerk to William Howard Taft, who became Supreme Court chief justice after he was president — was a fierce advocate of the philosophy that free markets create free societies. He presided over a host of significant legal cases that touched on energy deregulation, gun control, the powers of independent prosecutors, and the Civil Rights Act. He also served on the panel of judges who heard Microsoft’s antitrust appeal, finding that the software giant had abused its Windows monopoly, but reversing a lower court’s order to break up the company.
Williams was known for his down-to-earth style. He rode a bicycle to the courthouse, wore casual dress off the bench, including a knit cap at times during cold weather, and brown-bagged vegetarian lunches. He nursed a passion for studying pre-revolutionary Russian history that culminated in two books about the subject. A father of five children, he stopped eating meat after visiting a slaughterhouse, his daughter Susan Ellis, of Chantilly, Virginia, said.
Among colleagues, Williams was known for consuming almost every legal opinion circulating on a legal question before the court and being unfailingly polite and solicitous toward clerks and staff.
“Truthfully, it breaks my heart. He was my closest colleague. He was my friend. We would have lunch occasionally and talk about everything in the world,” Judge Laurence H. Silberman said Saturday in an interview. “We teased each other because he thought I was too sympathetic to trade unions, and I thought he was too sympathetic to animals.”

609,"August 9, 2020",Twitter And TikTok Talk Deal As Trump Ban Looms,"


The social network and TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, have engaged in “preliminary” discussions about merging TikTok’s US operations with Twitter, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous individuals.
A TikTok rep said via email Sunday, “As a matter of corporate policy we do not comment on market rumors.”
The M&A chatter about Twitter and TikTok emerged after Microsoft last week confirmed that it has been exploring a TikTok takeover. That comes under the threat of Donald Trump’s effective US ban of TikTok by Sept. 21, with the president claiming the popular lip-syncing app “continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States”, if ByteDance can’t close a deal with an American buyer for TikTok’s US-based business by then.
Meanwhile, TikTok is planning to sue Trump over his Aug. 6 executive order as early as this Tuesday, arguing the president’s unilateral move is unconstitutional because it denied TikTok any due process, NPR reported. The lawsuit also will allege that Trump failed to provide any evidence that would show TikTok is a danger to the US’s national security, per the report.
On Friday, TikTok called Trump’s order a “dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets” and said it was planning to fight the ban in court.
What the financial mechanics of a Twitter-TikTok combo might look like are unclear. Twitter’s market capitalization, based on its Aug. 7 closing stock price, is $29.38 billion, while TikTok has been valued at about $50 billion by a group of US-based ByteDance investors who were looking to acquire control of TikTok last month.

610,"August 6, 2020",Trump Issues Order Banning TikTok’s Parent Companies If Not Sold Within 45 Days,"


President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order that would ban the social media app TikTok and WeChat from operating in the US in 45 days if they are not sold by their Chinese-owned parent companies, reported The New York Times. 
The orders, which use similar language, do not state that a certain amount of money from the sale needs to be sent to the US Treasury Department, which the President has been insisting on for several days.The order regarding TikTok prohibits after 45 days “any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd.,” the Chinese company that owns the social media platform.
The move turns up the pressure on negotiations over the popular video app’s future through a potential sale. The dramatic back and forth began when Trump said Friday night that he would ban TikTok from operating in the United States using emergency economic powers or an executive order.Microsoft said Sunday that it was pushing forward with talks to acquire the app following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and the President. On Monday, Trump set September 15 as the deadline for TikTok to find a US buyer. Failing to do so, he said, would lead him to shut down the app in the country. In an unusual declaration, Trump also said any deal would have to include a “substantial amount of money” coming to the US Treasury.Thursday’s order alleges that TikTok “automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users,” such as location data and browsing and search histories, which “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.”

611,"August 5, 2020",Amid Antitrust Scrutiny Instagram Launches TikTok Clone,"


According to The Hill, Facebook’s Instagram launched a direct competitor to short-form video app TikTok in 50 countries Wednesday, August 5, amid antitrust scrutiny.
Reels, which is available within Instagram on iOS and Android, lets users edit together 15-second clips with music.
Instagram will now include Reels in its Explore page, allowing users to scroll through them vertically, much like TikTok’s “for you” page.
The launch of Reels comes as President Trump threatens to block TikTok from operating in the US over its ties to China.
The short-form video app’s parent company, ByteDance, is headquartered in and operates out of Beijing, though TikTok’s American data has been moved to servers in the US.
Although it is questionable whether Trump has the authority to ban an app, the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has reportedly asked ByteDance to sell off TikTok.
Microsoft confirmed Sunday that it has been exploring a deal to purchase the app after speaking with Trump.
Microsoft stated that it would complete discussions with TikTok by September 15. The companies have both provided a notice of intent to the CFIUS to explore a proposal that would give Microsoft ownership of the app in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
The launch of Reels also comes one week after executives from America’s biggest tech companies, including Facebook, testified before Congress on competition in the digital marketplace.

The saber-rattling between China and the U.S. is heating up — with boardroom as battleground, and with some of the biggest U.S. companies as potential casualties.
It’s a ripple effect, perhaps, of the ongoing controversies surrounding TikTok, and by extension, the interdependence of the two countries when it comes to consumer spending. In addition, the as-yet-unfinished drama over who owns TikTok is shining a spotlight on unresolved issues tied to data sharing and privacy.
In the end, we may see a rising tide of backlash — one where the Chinese shun U.S. firms finding already shaky ground and rocky economic environments.
The story thus far: Microsoft has a deadline, at Sept. 15, to strike an acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. operations, effectively cleaving it from parent company ByteDance. That comes a bit after President Donald Trump said he was mulling an outright “ban” on TikTok (or, more specifically, its video-sharing app).

The general manager of TikTok in the United States, Vanessa Pappas warned Saturday, August 1, that the Chinese network has no plans “of going nowhere,” In response to the announcement by President Donald Trump to veto it in the country.
In a video posted on Twitter, Pappas also thanked the millions of Americans who use this network daily and assured that they do not plan to “go anywhere.”
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced Friday night his intention to ban the Chinese social network TikTok in the country, which Washington views with suspicion for reasons of national security, reported Yahoo. 
Trump also stated that he has that authority and said that action could occur even Saturday.
Pappas stated in her message that TikTok is proud of the 1,500 workers they have in the US and that they will create another 10,000 jobs over the next three years.
“We don’t plan to go anywhere. TikTok is the home of creators and artists to express their ideas and connect with people from different backgrounds. We are proud of everyone who calls TikTok home, ”stated the general manager in the video.
Earlier this month, the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, had hinted that the Trump administration considered restricting access to TikTok given the possibility that Beijing is using the social network as a means to monitor and distribute propaganda.
TikTok is a social network based in Beijing, China, in which short videos are shared. It has achieved great success among teenage audiences, but at the same time has raised great doubts about the security of user data and its links with the Chinese Communist Party.

President Donald Trump is set to order TikTok’s Chinese parent company to sell the app’s US operations, Bloomberg reported on Friday.
Trump is planning to sign an order directing ByteDance to “divest its ownership” of TikTok in the US, the report said. Earlier this month, the Trump administration first said publicly that it was considering banning TikTok over concerns about its ties to China and the foreign government’s access to user data and content moderation.
Bloomberg said an announcement on Trump’s plan could be made as soon as Friday.
The Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino said on Twitter on Friday that Microsoft was interested in buying TikTok’s US operations. The White House is “deeply concerned” about Microsoft’s interest, Gasparino said.
“We are looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House Friday. “We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.”
As TikTok grew more popular, U.S. officials grew more concerned about the potential for the Chinese government to use the app to gain data on U.S. citizens. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which investigates overseas acquisitions of U.S. businesses, began a review of the purchase in the fall of 2019, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
Trump’s threat to ban TikTok came just a few weeks after reports that many TikTok users had tried to sabotage a Trump campaign rally by requesting tickets they never planned to use and coordinated a push to flood Trump’s 2020 campaign app with negative reviews.

Technology was a small industry until very recently. It was exciting and interesting, and it was on lots of magazine covers, but it wasn‘t actually an important part of most people’s lives. When Bill Gates was on every magazine cover, Microsoft was a small company that sold accounting tools to big companies. When Netscape kicked off the consumer internet in 1994, there were only 100m or so PCs on earth, and most of them were in offices. Today 4bn people have a smartphone – three quarters of all the adults on earth. In most developed countries, 90% of the adult population is online. 
The change isn’t just that almost all of us have a computer now, but that we’ve changed how we use them.  This is my favourite chart to show this – in 2017, 40% of new couples in the USA met online. It’s probably over 50% now. Anyone does anything online now.

616,"July 30, 2020",Most Targeted Industries and Conduct in China’s Antitrust Investigations against Abuse of Dominance,"

By Cheng Liu, Yun Bi & Jeff Liu (King & Wood Mallesons, Beijing)1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
The abuse of dominant market position is one of the significant infringements under China’s Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”). According to public records, since the AML came into effect in 2008 (and as of June 30, 2020), the Chinese antitrust authorities have concluded 48 investigations against abusive conduct (this does not include the cases that were tried in courts). Thus, the administrative authorities have been able to accumulate more experiences and increased sophistication in investigating complicated issues in abuse of dominance cases.
In this article, we have reviewed and identified the key targeted industries and abusive conduct that attracted the authorities’ attentions in the previous administrative proceedings. Looking at recent enforcement actions may give us insight into the type of industries and conduct which enforcement authorities are most concerned with.
 
II. MOST TARGETED INDUSTRIES
Sixteen industries, ranging from banking, public utilities to pharmaceutic industries, have been targets of abuse of dominance investigations.Among them, the most frequently targeted industries are (i) public utilities, tobacco, and salt; (ii) active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”); and (iii) high-tech and IP.
Unsurprisingly, public utility (water, gas, electricity, telecommunication, etc.), tobacco and salt companies were the top target given that they are essentially natural monopolies in China. Altogether, there have been 29 investigations (24 investigations against public utilities, 3 investigations against tobaccos and 2 investigations against salt companies) against them which were publicly announced and closed/suspended.
The second most frequent target of abuse of dominance investigation from Chinese authorities, in terms of the number of investigations, have been API suppliers. In China, there are specific requirements and high barriers for manufacturing APIs. Therefore, there are only limited number of suppliers of APIs, who usually hold high market shares and thus more likely to be caught by Chinese authorities.
Multinational companies in the high tech and IP sectors were the third most frequent target of abuse of dominance investigations, in terms of number of cases. While there have been only three investigations against “high-tech”/IP sectors so far, they were all against well regarded multinational companies, i.e. Qualcomm, Tetra Pak, and InterDigital, and considered as landmark cases in China’s AML enforcement. There have also been reported of on-going/potential investigations against other multinational high-tech companies such as Microsoft and Ericsson, although no official decisions have been announced.
The above statistics are also consistent with what Chinese authorities have publicly stated about their enforcement priorities. In the past three years, in the authorities’ statements about their enforcement priorities, sectors concerning peoples’ livelihood (including public utility, APIs, daily necessities, etc.) have always been mentioned.2
In recent years, it appears that SAMR has also started to pay closer attention to the conduct of the major internet giants. For example, SAMR and its local authorities have ever received the complaints against Tencent Music,3 and Meituan4 in 2019 for abuse of dominant market practice.
However, so far, the Chinese authority has not officially penalized any internet platform companies. One possible reason is the difficulty in establishing the existence of a dominant market position in the fast-changing internet sector. In Qihoo 360 v. Tencent,5 the Supreme Court set a relatively high bar for the plaintiff to establish that an Internet company holds a dominant market position, which may cause the administrative authority to also be cautious in determining that any Internet platform company holds a dominant market position in its administrative investigations. Also, in the context of the broader competition for consumers’ attention, competition is not limited in certain specific products or services, but broadly extends to competition between different types and areas of products and services6. For example, while online shopping malls (like T-mall) and online videos platforms (like Tencent) provide difference services to consumers, they all seek to attract and compete for the attention of consumers, which make them compete with each other to a certain extent. This makes it more difficult to clearly delineate and define a proper relevant market, and thus more challenging for the authority to establish that any specific company holding a dominant market position.
 
III. MOST TARGETED CONDUCT
The AML has specified seven types of typical abusive conduct, namely: (i) selling at excessive price or purchasing at an unfairly low price; (ii) selling at below cost prices without justification; (iii) refusal to deal without justification; (iv) imposing exclusive dealing requirement without justification; (v) imposing unreasonable trade condition; (vi) tying without justification; and (vii) discriminatory treatment on the counterparties at the same conditions without justification..
Based on the statistics, among the 48 investigations, the most targeted conduct types are (i) imposing unreasonable trade condition; (ii) tying; (iii) excessive pricing; and (iv) exclusive dealing.
3.1 Imposing unreasonable trade conditions
There have been 19 investigations where the authorities found the abusive conduct of imposing unreasonable trade conditions had occurred. The concept of imposing unreasonable trade definitions is very broadly defined and thus conceivably all types of trade conditions that a company may ask its counterparty to accept could be covered by this. Based on past investigations, typical types of conduct which has been considered to be imposing unfair conditions include:

Forcing the counterparties or consumers to pay deposits or pre-pay services fees

In Nanjing Lishui District Power Supply Branch of State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., LTD. (“Nanjing Electricity Supplier”), decided in August 2018,7 Nanjing Electricity Supplier was found to impose unreasonable trade conditions by requiring the users to pre-pay the electricity fees based on the 80% of electricity consumption in the last month. If the users do not agree to pre-pay, Nanjing Electricity Supplier will refuse to supply electricity to them.   
2. Requiring the counterparties to deal with the designated vendors;
In Tianjin Tap Water Supply Group (“Tianjin Water Group”),8 decided by SAMR in July 2019, Tianjin Water Group was sanctioned due to requiring real estate developers to use intelligent frequency conversion control cabinets and remote monitoring substations manufactured by its subsidiary in the construction of real estate developers’ secondary water supply facilities. If developers choose another vendor, then the water supply facilities construction will not be approved by Tianjin Water Group. 
3. Requiring the counterparties to exclusively deal with the company or sell back all final products to the company.
In Calcium Gluconate API Distributors,9 decided by SAMR in April 2020, the three API distributors were penalized for imposing unreasonable trade conditions, including on one hand forcing the APIs manufacturers to sell all products to them (via purchasing in a large volume, and requiring exclusive supply rights), and on the other hand forcing preparation manufacturers to sell all the final products back to them or act as their exclusive OEMs in accordance with their instructions. Otherwise, these three distributors will refuse to supply the API to the non-compliant preparation manufacturers.
We noticed that some of the “unreasonable trade conditions” found in these cases may also be considered as “exclusive dealing” which is another specific type of infringement listed in the AML. It may also be more difficult to distinguish other types of unreasonable trade conditions conduct such as “forcing pre-payment” from legitimate business arrangements. Therefore, when designing and negotiating the trade terms, companies with comparatively strong deal position or bargaining power need to be cautious with imposing restrictive requirements to the counterparties, and assessments of its market position and the effects of such conditions are recommended.
3.2 Tying
Since the first tying investigations in 2013, there have been 13 investigations against tying arrangements. The business models investigated in those cases are all similar (and not complicated), i.e. companies were found to tie the unpopular products to popular products, to enhance the sale of the unpopular products.
One observation is that, in most of the 13 cases, companies tried to defend their tying arrangements by “justifications,” such as previous transaction practices, or public health and safety concerns. For example, in Qinghai CNPC,10 the Qinghai CNPC Company required its users to install wall-hanging ovens that it manufactured, and argued that this tying arrangement was due to public safety reasons. In the Tetra Pak Case,11 Tetra Pak argued that tying the packaging materials into its equipment and technical services is for the purpose of ensuring public health and food safety. However, in neither of these cases, did the authorities accept such public health and safety concern arguments, because the authorities consider the tying arrangements were not necessarily relevant to the public health and safety, and there is no factual or legal basis to prove that the tying product has better performance than the third parties’ products in terms of compliance with the mandatory safety or quality requirement. Therefore, while these “justifications” are provided in the regulations, the authorities have not actually accepted this argument in any of the 13 tying cases and it appears that the bar to proving the existence of this “justification” may be quite high.
3.3 Excessive Pricing
There have been 9 investigations involving excessive pricing, 5 of which were focused on API suppliers and 2 of which are relevant to IP licensing arrangement (i.e. the investigations into Qualcomm and InterDigital). There has been a lasting debate on whether “excessive pricing” should be considered an abusive conduct or market participants should have the freedom to set their own prices. The statistics show though that Chinese authorities have not hesitated to take actions in cases of “excessive pricing.”
API suppliers (5 of 9) have been a focal point for excessive pricing investigations as such investigations are usually caused by a substantial increase in the APIs’ prices, which easily raise the excessive pricing concern. In addition to APIs, the authorities are also concerned about whether there are any excessive pricing issues in charging licensing fees to domestic licensees by the licensors (e.g. in the Qualcomm Case12 and InterDigital Case13).
When determining whether the price is excessive in an administrative investigation, the business operator’s historical price, the price of other business operators, the cost and whether the increase of price is comparable to the increase of cost are key factors to be considered, and the authority usually will assess these on a case-by-case basis. Based on the previous investigations, we noticed that the authorities are more inclined to use the business operator’s own historical prices and the cost of products (including the increase of the cost) as a benchmark to assessing whether the price is excessive. For example, in the Calcium Gluconate API Distributors Case issued by SAMR in April 2020, the API distributors were challenged for excessive pricing, because (i) compared to the cost, the selling price was  9.5 to 27.3 times higher than the price at which they purchased the products from API manufactures; (ii) compared to the historical cost, the selling prince in 2017 was 19 to 54.6 times of that in 2014; and (iii) there are internal price increasing between the manufacturers and the distributors for selling its product. Therefore, it is recommended that companies holding a strong market position be very careful about the price increasing issue, especially the reason for price increases, and whether there is a cost increasing in the similar arrange in parallel.
3.4 Exclusive Dealing
There have been 8 investigations involving exclusive dealing issues. Except for Tetra Pak and Eastman,14 all of the other investigations are relating to public utilities (such as water supplier, electricity supplier, gas supplier, etc.).
In Tetra Pak and Eastman, the Chinese authorities have shown that they have become more sophisticated in dealing with complicated business scenarios. For example, in Eastman, it was the first time that SAMR reviewed the “Most-Favorable-Nation” (“MFN”) clause, and assessed it in combination with other arrangements (such as the minimum supply requirement) to conclude it may bring the effect of exclusive dealing and foreclose competitors from effectively participating in competition. In Tetra Pak, the authority assessed the exclusive dealing based on the restriction of technology R&D arrangements with the third party, and concluded that such technology R&D restrictions will have the effect of exclusive dealing.
3.5 Other targeted conduct
In addition to the abovementioned types of conduct, there have been 5 investigations involving the refusal to deal issue and all of them are in relation to the APIs manufacturers/distributors, who refuse to supply APIs to the drug manufacturers. There have also been 4 investigations involving the discriminatory treatment, involving the companies providing internet access, salt, tobacco, and transportation services at the port.
In Tetra Pak, the authority also considered that Tetra Pak’s retroactive discount caused exclusionary effects, but eventually categorized it under the catch-all clause of “other abusive conduct,” rather than “exclusive dealing,” for reasons not specified in the final decision. However, this shows that business arrangements that may have exclusionary effects will likely catch the authorities’ attention, and SAMR is likely to look at conduct beyond the typical abusive types specified under Article 17 of the AML, and focus more on the effects of conduct.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
In general, the Chinese authorities have been relatively active in investigating abuse of dominant market position. While in terms of the number of investigations, most investigations focused on the public utility area and API suppliers, high-tech companies, IP licensing arrangements and internet companies have attracted close attention from the authorities in respect of the abuse of dominant market position issues. In particular, it is recommended that multinational companies should take a cautious approach with respect to IP licensing arrangements.
In practice, some abusive conduct (such as imposing unreasonable trade conditions) are very general and may cover various commercial arrangements, and thus authorities have applied a broad interpretation in assessing and determining abusive conduct. While the typical types of abusive conduct under Articles 17(1) to (6) of the AML continue to be the key enforcement targets, the authorities are more sophisticated and prepared to comprehensively review more complicated commercial arrangements, such as the discount policy (in Tetra Pak) and MFN clause (in Eastman). The authorities are more focused on the actual impact on the market competition of the conduct, rather than the form of the conduct. Certain business arrangement (such as MFN clauses) may still be caught for abuse of dominant market position, even if it is not an explicitly prohibited conduct under the AML. Therefore, companies are recommended to be cautious when assessing and negotiating the commercial terms with the counterparties, especially if those terms will add restrictions/onerous obligations on the other side.

617,"July 27, 2020",Report: Companies Say Amazon Accessed Proprietary Info To Make Its Own Products,"


Daniela Braga, founder and CEO of DefinedCrowd, a data platform for artificial intelligence (AI), has a beef with Amazon, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.
Four years ago, the eCommerce giant’s venture capital fund invested in the Seattle-based company and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information.
Earlier this year, Amazon launched A2I, an AI product that Braga told the newspaper mirrors the DefinedCrowd product. She said Amazon Web Services’ offering competes “with one of our bread-and-butter foundational products” that collects and labels data.
After seeing the announcement of A2I’s debut, Braga limited Amazon’s access to her company’s data and diluted its stake by 90% by raising more capital, The WSJ reported.
Braga is not the only executive who claims Amazon appeared to use the investment in their company to develop competing products.
In 2010, Amazon invested in LivingSocial, the daily deals website, gaining a 30% stake, the WSJ reported. Former LivingSocial executives said Amazon began requesting data.
Not long after, LivingSocial executives began hearing from clients that Amazon was offering them better terms.
“They are using market forces in a really Machiavellian way,” Jeremy Levine, a partner at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, told the newspaper. “It’s like they are not in any way, shape or form the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing. They are a wolf in wolf’s clothing.”
Amazon denied it uses confidential information companies share to construct competing products.
“Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build,” Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, told the WSJ. “Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”
In April, PYMNTS reported former Amazon employees said the company violated its own policies when workers took data from its independent sellers to launch competing products.
While Amazon has said it places restrictions on staff from accessing the data of its millions of sellers, more than 20 former employees said they accessed sellers’ information to determine which products they should make under its private labels.
Last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commenced an investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, and Microsoft over antitrust implications, and in February asked the companies to produce information regarding takeovers of smaller companies between the years of 2010 and 2019.

618,"July 27, 2020","Big Tech Goes on Shopping Spree, Brushing Off Antitrust Scrutiny","


By David McLaughlin, Bloomberg 
The biggest U.S. technology companies have gone on a buying spree this year, waving off intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs and critics who say they’ve bolstered their power by snatching up nascent rivals.
The number of acquisitions by the five largest companies — Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Facebook Inc., and Microsoft Corp. — came at the fastest pace through June since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tech deals are accelerating even in the face of stepped-up antitrust scrutiny under the Trump administration. Federal officials are investigating Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, and the Justice Department under Attorney General Willliam Barr is expected to file a monopolization case against Google in the coming weeks. Google and Facebook are also contending with investigations by state attorneys general.
A House panel is also conducting an inquiry into the state of competition in the technology sector and the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all slated to testify at a virtual hearing Wednesday.
Through June 30, the five companies announced 27 deals, according to Bloomberg data, up 29% from the same period last year, when they did 21 deals.
The speeding up of tech deals could give ammunition to economists, lawyers and lawmakers who warn that the tech companies have used their abundant cash to gain leverage over existing competitors and increase already high market shares.
“Until there’s some enforcement in this area, companies are likely to think they can get away with it, and if they can get away it, they’re likely to try,” said New York University law professor Scott Hemphill, who has written about deals that eliminate emerging competitors.
An even bigger worry is that the tech companies are potentially choking off competition by acquiring firms that, while small, could one day emerge as robust rivals. After all, the tech giants were all startups once.

620,"July 21, 2020",Comparable Agreements and the “Top-Down” Approach to FRAND Royalties Determination,"
By Haris Tsilikas, LLM (Max Planck Institute)1
 
I. Introduction
The development of innovative standards hinges on a vibrant ecosystem of standardization inducing private investment by allowing contributors to earn a fair return on investment through the licensing of their standard-essential patents (“SEPs”), and by providing implementers with enforceable assurances that those SEPs will be available on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and conditions. Voluntary collaboration organized by Standards Development Organizations (“SDOs”) has had a stellar record of success: rapid rates of innovation and some of the most broadly adopted technologies in human history that laid the ground for highly competitive markets.
The widespread adoption of wireless technologies over the past decades has brought about friction and disputes regarding the interpretation of FRAND. Courts in several jurisdictions worldwide have been called upon to flesh out FRAND terms or to assess conformity with FRAND principles. This body of case law provides insight and practical guidance for parties as well as policymakers seeking a better understanding of the situation — business and legal — on the ground.
This article outlines some of the emerging patterns in global SEP litigation, focusing on the judicial determination of FRAND rates. The common thread in judicial FRAND determination is reliance on evidence in comparable licensing agreements. Comparable licensing agreements, i.e. licensing agreements signed with similarly situated parties, provide for the most reliable evidence on how markets price SEPs. Courts aiming to simulate efficient market outcomes have good reasons to look at real-life agreements for guidance in setting rates in accordance with FRAND principles. An alternative approach to FRAND rate determination is the so-called “top-down approach.” Top-down FRAND-rate determination starts from extrapolating the aggregate royalty rate of all SEPs reading on a particular standard and then identifying a SEP holder’s exact portion of this aggregate rate. The top-down approach presents, however, severe informational challenges for courts and this, in large part, accounts for its far narrower appeal.
 
II. Comparable Agreements
A. The Case Law of European and U.S. Courts
In the EU, judicial review of FRAND rates adheres to the framework developed by the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) in its Huawei ruling.2 In Huawei, the Court established a safe harbor from antitrust liability under Article 102 TFEU for the SEP holder seeking injunctive relief, provided that it (a) notifies the SEP user of its acts of infringement and the rights infringed, and (b) makes a proper written licensing offer on FRAND terms, including the royalty rate and the way it was calculated.3 It is then for the alleged infringer to accept the offer or, in case of disagreement, to make a counter-offer on FRAND terms produce accounts of acts of use, and place an appropriate amount in escrow.4
The requirements under Huawei were further elaborated by national courts. In Germany, courts view the Huawei framework as a sequence of “steps,” with the fulfilment of each triggering the obligations in the next.5 German courts assess the compliance with FRAND of proposed royalty rates and other contractual provisions in actions for injunctive relief. There is, so far, no ruling by a German court directly setting the royalty rate in a FRAND dispute. In assessing compliance with the Huawei requirement for the SEP holder to make a concrete offer on FRAND terms, German courts view comparable licensing agreements as highly instructive on the “appropriateness of the license terms offered.”6 Comparable agreements can provide reliable evidence not only on the royalty rate, but also on the scope of the license. Moreover, the higher the number of concluded licensing agreements on similar conditions, the stronger the presumption that such terms are indeed FRAND.7 Where comparable agreements reflect an industry practice of licensing on a worldwide portfolio basis, it could be unreasonable for the implementer to refuse an offer on such terms.8
German courts attach particular importance to comparable licensing agreements in reviewing compliance with the non-discrimination prong of FRAND. In principle, the non-discrimination obligation calls for the SEP owner to present similarly situated putative licensees with a licensing offer on similar terms.9 However, patent holders are not obliged to offer identical terms to all their business partners to satisfy the non-discrimination prong of FRAND.10 In proposing licensing terms SEP holders enjoy a margin of discretion,11 provided that the diverging terms are not “significantly different” and are objectively justified “as a result of normal behavior on the market.”12
However, given that the SEP holder is generally in a better position to assess its compliance with its non-discrimination obligation possessing the relevant information regarding the terms offered to other licensees, plaintiff is required to produce in court comparable agreements establishing the non-discriminatory nature of its licensing offer and, in case of divergences in terms, to offer an objective justification.13 The SEP owner is expected to produce all the significant comparable agreements to ensure that courts are not presented with selective samples that might convey an incomplete picture.14 That said, the disclosure obligation of the patent holder does not arise already at negotiations.15
In the UK, the High Court, in Unwired Planet v. Huawei (Birss J.), set directly the (global) FRAND royalty rate for plaintiff’s portfolio of SEPs largely relying on comparable licensing agreements.16 Birss J. reaffirmed that a FRAND undertaking to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”) is, under French law, a binding contract enforceable by third-parties, implementers of standards.17 Birss J. held that FRAND obligations constrain both parties in their conduct during licensing negotiations.18
In terms of content, Birss J. opined that for any given set of circumstances there is only one set of FRAND terms and conditions.19 FRAND terms, are those that reasonable parties would agree to after good-faith bilateral negotiations.20 Comparable licensing agreements are highly instructive in this respect offering valuable evidence on the terms agreed by parties in actual licensing negotiations.21 Birss J. went on to examine, in depth, the terms observed in comparable agreements to extrapolate a FRAND rate that would fit the specific circumstances of the case.22
In the U.S., patent courts have long relied on comparable agreements to establish a reasonable royalty for damages.23 The Federal Circuit, in Laser Dynamics, held that comparable agreements are “probative not only of the proper amount of a reasonable royalty, but also of the proper form of the royalty structure.”24 In Ericsson v. D-Link, the court reaffirmed the value of comparable agreements for providing guidance to juries deciding on patent damages.25
Comparable licensing agreements have been relied upon by U.S. district courts in a number of rulings regarding infringement of SEPs to derive a FRAND royalty rate. More specifically, Judge Robart, in Microsoft v. Motorola, modified the Georgia-Pacific factors in the RAND context in order to arrive at the royalty rate a willing licensor and willing licensee would have agreed to in a hypothetical negotiation.26 Judge Robart relied extensively on pool licensing arrangements to assess Motorola’s compliance with its FRAND obligations and to determine a reasonable royalty rate. More recently, the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, in HTC v. Ericsson, held that comparable licensing agreements can be “highly probative, given the sophistication of the market and the amount of resources and time that the industry devotes to negotiations.”27 According to the court, comparable agreements are “the best market-based evidence of the value” of a SEP portfolio and a “reliable method of establishing fair and reasonable royalty rates that is consistent” with FRAND.28
B. Comparable Agreements: Challenges and Advantages
Given the complexity of real-life FRAND licensing agreements, courts have come across a number of practical challenges in assessing comparable agreements. One source of contention is which parties are “similarly situated.”29 In real life, companies rarely operate in identical conditions: firms differ in many ways, including their size, their bargaining power, the scale and scope of their operations, their ownership of relevant and valuable intellectual property, and their resources for and expertise in negotiating licensing deals. Moreover, companies across different sectors value patented technologies differently resulting in non-identical licensing terms. Disparities in licensing terms, however, do not necessarily imply that a party has breached its FRAND commitment. Although courts in most jurisdictions broadly recognize business realities and the possibility for some differentiation in licensing terms,30 the challenge remains in identifying those parties comparable to the case at hand.
Furthermore, while court determine damages awards are typically calculated as a one-way running royalty rate, real-life licensing agreements are more complex.31 First, the royalty structure might differ from a simple running royalty rate:32 Agreements may provide for lump-sum payment; or a running royalty rate may be calculated as a fixed-per-unit fee, or as a percentage of the end-selling price of the infringing product(s). Second, parties may agree to non-monetary consideration, such as technical assistance, transfer of patents or other forms of payment in kind. Third, many licensing agreements are cross-licenses,33 whereby the observed royalty rate derives from the relative value of the respective portfolios of the parties. The “unpacking” of comparables can be a source of uncertainty in the judicial determination of FRAND rates.
However, courts worldwide have good reasons to rely primarily on observed rates in comparable licensing agreements. In fact, it has been argued that courts should rely solely on comparable licenses to set FRAND rates.34 To begin with, comparable licensing agreements go a long way in addressing the information challenge faced by courts determining a reasonable royalty rate. Recourse to comparable agreements allows courts to benefit from the resources and expertise invested by private parties in collecting information necessary for a proper evaluation of a patent portfolio. Licensing negotiations typically involve intensive technical and business discussions and parties reach an agreement only after all the relevant arguments regarding the value of the patent(s) in question have been put forwarded and properly addressed. Thus, the terms finally agreed upon in a voluntary transaction can, in principle, be a relied upon as a safe indication of the patent(s)’s commercial value.
Moreover, comparable licensing agreements provide for the most informative evidence regarding a SEP owner’s compliance with its non-discrimination obligations. Courts can gain a more or less clear picture of observed market rates and conditions and reach an informed decision on whether the proposed licensing terms in a specific case would be discriminatory. One open issue — given the observance, in practice, of varied licensing terms — is how to distinguish a legitimate difference in terms reflecting disparities in market conditions from discrimination. A plausible approach might be examining whether the diverging terms would place the putative licensee above a benchmark rate established by examining comparable licenses as a whole.35
More importantly, reliance on comparable agreements reduces the risk of distortions in the operation of the price mechanism for standardized technologies. Courts relying on real-life transactions can better simulate market outcomes and set FRAND rates that reflect actual supply-and-demand conditions in markets for standards. Thus, market price signals based on which private parties make their investment decisions are not interfered with, contributing to efficient markets for standards and standardized technologies.
 
III. The Top-Down Approach
A. The Top-Down Approach in TCL and Unwired Planet
An alternative approach to the determination of FRAND rates is the so-called “top-down” approach, whereby a court estimates (a) the aggregate royalty rate of all SEPs reading on a given standard, and (b) the exact portion of a particular SEP holder’s portfolio to this aggregate rate. The top-down approach has thus far been relied upon by courts mainly in two cases: in the now-vacated TCL v. Ericsson District Court case and in the above mentioned Unwired Planet matter, though the courts made different use of the top-down approach in each case.36 An intriguing aspect of the two cases is that courts in both had to examine essentially the same portfolio of SEPs.37 Thus, the two rulings present a good illustration of the actual working — and shortcomings — of the top-down approach.
The top-down approach has been used as the primary method for calculating the FRAND royalty rate in TCL v. Ericsson, by the District Court for the Central District of California (Judge Selna), subsequently reversed by the Federal Circuit.38 As a first step, the court calculated the aggregate royalty rate for the standards in question based, to a large extent, on Ericsson’s past public pronouncements on its own estimations regarding the aggregate royalty rate it predicted for those standards.39 Following that, the court calculated Ericsson’s portion of the aggregate rate by estimating the sum of all patent families that were deemed essential for the standards at issue and then the number of Ericsson’s essential patent families for the specific standards.40 For its estimates regarding the number of essential patent families the court relied on declarations of potentially essential patents and patent applications submitted to ETSI and on evidence submitted by the parties.41 Having arrived at a figure for both the aggregate number of essential patent families for the relevant and Ericsson’s essential patent families for those standards, Judge Selna calculated the FRAND rate for Ericsson’s portfolio according to the principle of numerical proportionality: all SEPs were presumed of equal value and Ericsson’s share to the aggregate rate derived from the estimated Ericsson’s share of SEPs.42
The top-down approach was also followed by Birss J, in Unwired Planet. However, contrary to the TCL judge, Birss J. used this approach only as a check for the findings of his thorough examination of comparable licensing agreements. Moreover, the analysis and findings by Birss J. departed significantly from those in TCL. To begin with, Birss J. dismissed the arguments on the probative value of public pronouncements regarding the aggregate reasonable royalty for wireless standards—the very same pronouncements that formed the basis of the top-down calculation in TCL. According to Birss J., such pronouncements offer no reliable evidence on the actual aggregate rate for the standards in question, reflecting only the subjective estimations of those making the pronouncements at a prior point in time.43 Birss J. also arrived at markedly different findings regarding the number of essential patent families for wireless standards, rejecting the defendant’s 30-minutes-per-patent-family review as highly over-inclusive of what was actually essential and, accordingly, acknowledging as essential to wireless standards far fewer patent families than in TCL. Given the discrepancies in methodology and inputs, it is not surprising that, for a broadly similar set of facts, the two courts reached very different conclusions on FRAND rates in the respective cases.
B. The Shortcomings of the Top-Down Approach
A comparison of the findings in TCL and Unwired Planet may give one pause with regard to the precision and reliability of the top-down approach. Although, in theory, the top-down approach could result in a reasonably accurate estimation of FRAND rates, provided the inputs are also accurate,44 in practice, this may not be the case.45
First, there is no reliable data on the aggregate, one-way royalty rates for all SEPs reading on any given standard. To arrive at the average, one-way aggregate running royalty for a given standard one would have to unpack all the major licensing deals in an industry in force at the same period of time, and such data is confidential and unavailable to researchers and is unlikely all those agreements to be available to a court either (courts have access only to evidence/agreements submitted by the parties to the case, not to agreements between third parties). The “solution” to this conundrum by Judge Selna in TCL­, i.e. relying on pronouncements by stakeholders, is hardly satisfactory. Such pronouncements, made years in advance of the commercialization of a standard and before the commercial value of standardized technologies can be inferred by data on consumers’ willingness to pay for those technologies (and the features they enable) are inherently unreliable, as recognized by Birss J. in Unwired Planet.
Second, the apportionment according to the principle of numerical proportionality appears problematic in several respects.46 An initial hurdle is to estimate the aggregate number of essential patent families reading on a given standard. The TCL court made such an attempt by making use of data on declarations of possibly essential patents in the ETSI database. However, these declarations cannot be relied upon to provide an accurate picture of the actual number of SEPs for any particular standard.47 To begin with, providing accurate data on the actual number of SEPs is hardly the point of the declarations system. The aim of declarations is to alert implementers that patents might eventually read on the standard,48 thus signaling the need for negotiating licenses. Declarations also indicate to SDOs that the SEP holder is prepared to offer FRAND licensing terms. However, the actual number of SEPs can be safely assumed to be lower than declarations suggest. Declarations begin long before a standard is officially released or commercialized and represent the declarer’s subjective estimate at the time that those patents may be or may become essential. Yet, the standard might follow a different technical path than initially expected and initially declared patents may no longer read on the technical specifications. Moreover, declarations include pending patent applications that might be rejected, or narrowed down in a way that the standard is eventually outside the scope of the amended patent claims. Also, from a legal perspective, patent holders have strong incentives to declare broadly to be on the safe side: on the one hand, there is the risk of antitrust liability for “patent ambush,” and on the other hand, the recent Core Wireless case in the U.S. suggests that SEPs that are not declared in a timely fashion might, under certain circumstances, be unenforceable in this jurisdiction.49
Third, even if one were to assume an accurate estimation of the average aggregate rate, apportionment to a particular SEP holder is an exercise fraught with difficulties. It essentially calls for courts to render judgment on the relative value of the portfolio of the plaintiff in a given case, that is, on the value of plaintiff’s portfolio and the combined value of the portfolios of all other SEP holders. Judge Selna, in TCL, tried to bypass the task by assuming each SEP to be of equal value. This assumption is, plainly, unrealistic. SEPs and SEP portfolios are not equally valuable.50 Standards are lengthy complicated documents that include core features and optional features. A SEP reading on an optional feature is, strictly speaking, still a SEP for those implementing this feature. But it may not be of equal value as a SEP reading on a core functionality enabled by a standard. Moreover, standards are iterative: each new release introduces new innovations and technical improvements, and these improvements can make a big difference in performance and features. SEPs reading on later iterations might, thus, be more valuable than SEPs reading on earlier, more limited, versions of a standard. The assumption of equal value for SEPs misses these differences, and calculations based on that assumption can only produce inaccurate results.
To summarize, the top-down approach presents severe informational challenges for courts. It calls for estimations that can only be based on unreliable data and unrealistic assumptions. Data for a sufficiently precise top-down calculation could only be gathered at a prohibitive cost in resources and time.51 The task of calculating patent infringement damages and a FRAND royalty rate for SEPs is complicated enough and the top-down approach introduces another substantial layer of complexity. At some point, judges applying the top-down approach will have to speculate about some of the parameters of what is essentially a very difficult equation.52 More importantly, the complexity and uncertainties of the top-down approach seem gratuitous. Markets generate sufficient information regarding the commercial value of a given portfolio: real-life comparable licensing agreements executed by sophisticated parties following extensive, arms-length negotiations.
 
IV. Conclusion
Over the past years, courts in several jurisdictions have amassed substantial experience in dealing with issues of determination of FRAND rates. Although different approaches to determining FRAND rates persist, some noteworthy patterns have emerged. The present article focused on the increasing reliance by courts on comparable licensing agreements as a source of reliable information regarding the commercial value of SEPs. Indeed, the vast majority of judicial opinions on FRAND rates follow this approach in setting FRAND rates because of its substantial advantages in terms of judicial economy perspective and standardization policy: comparable licensing agreements alleviate the information asymmetry between industry and courts by allowing the latter to benefit from the resources and expertise of the former. Judicially determined rates, calculated on the basis of comparable licenses, simulate efficient, mutually beneficial transactions contributing to well-functioning markets for standards.
An alternative approach to the calculation of FRAND rates is the so-called “top-down” approach. Top-down calculations present severe informational challenges: they require reliable data-inputs regarding the average aggregate, one-way running royalty rate for a particular standard, and then an apportionment of this royalty to a particular SEP holder based on data relating to the relative value of its SEP portfolio. Such data is impossible to obtain at reasonable cost. It is also unnecessary: courts can rely on actually observed market rates for SEPs, without having to engage in highly speculative assessments.

Introduction
The increased importance of antitrust as a campaign issue and a political conversation raises long-standing troubling issues of whether antitrust enforcement (or non-enforcement) can, and is, being used for partisan political purposes. First, there were long standing rumors of White House direction to challenge the AT&T-Time Warner merger. Second, the President and other key officials have alleged that social media and tech giants have exhibited a political bias against conservative messages and that antitrust was one way to deal with such alleged abuses. Third, there have been press reports that the head of the Antitrust Division lobbied members of Congress in connection with the settlement of the Sprint-T–Mobile merger investigation and personally sought to broker the divestiture that was accepted to allow the transaction to move forward.1
Most recently, Congress also has heard recent testimony from a whistleblower that the Attorney General directed burdensome second requests, over the objection of career staff, to mergers posing few competitive risks in the cannabis industry out of a personal dislike for the industry.2 These second requests represented 29 percent of the total second requests during the fiscal year in question.3 The whistleblower also raised concerns about the Division’s now-closed investigation — also over the objections of career staff — of car companies lobbying the state of California to maintain state emissions control at a level in excess of what the administration sought to impose at the federal level.4
This essay begins a long overdue conversation about how the legal system should deal with issues of personal animus or political favoritism in the enforcement of the antitrust laws.5 We take no position on the merits of any of the current controversies, but instead focus on the broader issue of how animus and bias in the broadest sense should be dealt with, both when cases with some potential merit are brought against perceived enemies and when cases with some potential merit are declined to protect perceived allies.
We begin with distinguishing these situations of bias and animus from those of outright corruption and when antitrust considerations are set aside in favor of broader foreign policy and national interests. We then look at the limited tools within antitrust law to deal with issues of bias and political favoritism and survey related areas of the law which have been dealing with these issues more directly throughout their history.
A. Distinguishing Outright Corruption and Legitimate National Interest
The types of political bias in the news appear to be different from issues of outright corruption. Issues of bribery and quid pro quo corruption surfaced in the 1970s as an issue in the Watergate scandal when illegal campaign contributions were being used in part to influence antitrust merger decisions of the Nixon Justice Departments.6 Congress reacted in the post-Watergate era by passing the Tunney Act requiring all consent decrees settling government antitrust litigation by reviewed by a federal district court judge to determine whether the settlement was in the public interest.7
Similar troubling issues also arose in the Johnson Administration. As documented from transcripts of recorded calls and discussions in the Oval Office, President Johnson threatened to block a merger involving a leading Houston bank unless the head of the bank helped secure the endorsement of the leading Houston newspaper for Johnson’s 1964 campaign.8 Neither example requires sophisticated analysis to condemn on moral or legal grounds.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, it may be political, but hardly immoral or illegal, to refrain from an instance of antitrust enforcement because it threatens the broader national interest. This is the premise of virtually every immunity doctrine in antitrust law where the overall societal value of labor unions, agricultural cooperatives, certain regulated industries, export trading companies, certain research and development joint ventures, cooperatives activities to ensure adequate annual supplies of flu vaccines, and other forms of joint activities are deemed more important by Congress than the promotion of competition otherwise mandated by the antitrust laws.9 Whether the balance was correctly struck by Congress or the judiciary is a very different question from whether the right thing was done for an improper political motive.
A similar calculus by the executive branch of the value of the overall national interest at the expense of antitrust enforcement in a specific matter is an exercise that may be political, but rarely immoral or unlawful. Few would be interested in the bringing of an antitrust case that risked starting an armed conflict with a trading partner. A decision not to prosecute the members of the OPEC cartel, or private firms carrying out its bidding, may be political and may be prudent or imprudent, but it is neither immoral nor unlawful on its own.10
For example, one can question the correctness of President Truman’s decision to limit an investigation of middle eastern oil companies to a civil proceeding because of the political needs of the Cold War, or President Reagan’s decision to not bring criminal antitrust charges against various foreign firms in connection with the demise of Laker Airlines because of foreign policy concerns and the diplomatic efforts of the British Prime Minister.11 All are political in any normal sense of the word, but none are corrupt, immoral, or unlawful without more.
B. Bias, Animus, and Prosecutorial Discretion in Antitrust
The harder question is what to do when a public competition agency brings a non-frivolous antitrust investigation or case to punish a perceive political opponent or refrains from bringing a non-frivolous, but risky, case against a perceived political supporter. As outlined above, these are not hypothetical questions or thought experiments. Press reports abound that then-Candidate Trump and President Trump expressed his opposition to the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger as well as his dislike for the coverage he received from Time Warner’s CNN news network.12 Subsequently, the Antitrust Division unsuccessfully challenged that merger in the courts using valid, but unusual, theories that the Division had rarely used to seek to block a merger outright.13
Similarly, both Candidate Trump and President Trump expressed concern over the power of Amazon (and other tech companies) and his dislike for Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, a frequent critic of Trump.14 As of June 2020, Amazon remains under antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.15 Separate reports indicated that the Attorney General and his deputy were personally directing and pushing an investigation into Google, which is reportedly entering its final phase.16
This is a particular concern for public rather than private enforcement. The public antitrust agencies in the United States have powers and resources far in excess of private litigants in civil litigation. Only the U.S. Department of Justice (through the Antitrust Division or its other Divisions) can empanel a grand jury or use the resources of the FBI, IRS, and other law enforcement agencies to investigate a potential criminal case. Only the government can compel testimony before the grand jury through the granting of immunity, or grant amnesty or leniency to a business entity and its employees. Only the government can issue a criminal information or seek an indictment from a grand jury. Only the government can arrest a defendant and compel them to stand trial which could result in lengthy imprisonment for individuals and substantial fines for business entities and individuals.
Even on the civil side, the powers and resources of the government normally dwarf those of most individuals and businesses. The FTC and the Antitrust Division each have hundreds of professionals dedicated to antitrust enforcement and broad pre-complaint investigative powers that far exceed the limited pre-complaint discovery available to a private litigant.17

Antitrust Division and DOJ Policy

There are two main internal policy manuals and guidelines that govern the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity by the Antitrust Division and the DOJ more generally. All condemn prosecutions motivated by political considerations. All are rather anodyne, and none are binding if action is taken and none would suffice to address if the Division or the DOJ as a whole refrained from action on political grounds.
The introduction to the Justice Department manual begins with a ringing condemnation of political influence. It states:
“The legal judgments of the Department of Justice must be impartial and insulated from political influence. It is imperative that the Department’s investigatory and prosecutorial powers be exercised free from partisan consideration.”18
The Principles of Federal Prosecution section of the Justice Department also states that:
“In determining whether to commence or recommend prosecution or take other action against a person, the attorney for the government should not be influenced by:
1. The person’s race, religion, gender, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, or political association, activities, or beliefs;….”19
The Antitrust Division Manual contains several references to past litigation where the question of political considerations was considered by the court. One section covers objections to CIDs because of government motives such as political motivation and states:
“[I]t has been held that a CID may be quashed if it is issued for the purpose of intimidating or harassing the recipient. In Chattanooga Pharm. Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 358 F.2d 864 (6th Cir. 1966), the Government declined to answer the recipient’s allegations that the purpose of the CID was to intimidate and harass the recipient into terminating a pending suit for enforcement of a state fair trade act. Since the Government did not respond, the court held that the allegations were admitted and set aside the CID.”20
The Manual further discusses grounds for discovery of improper motives behind a subpoena stating:
“Recipients have challenged CIDs and asked for discovery on the grounds that they were allegedly issued in response to outside political interference and pressure or to pay off a political debt and were not in a bona fide attempt to determine whether a violation occurred. In In re Cleveland Trust Co., 1972 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 73,991, at 92,122 (N.D. Ohio 1969), the court applied grand jury standards applicable to issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to hold that the recipient was entitled to certain discovery to establish that the investigation was not a bona fide attempt to ascertain an antitrust violation.”21

Motivation in Noerr-Pennington and Sham Litigation

Antitrust law has rarely engaged with the question of bias or animus in the bringing of a complaint. One area that touches on this question is the sham litigation exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine hold that petitioning any branch of the government, including filing litigation, is immune from the antitrust laws as beyond the scope of the Sherman Act.22
The Supreme Court has also established an exception for the filing of baseless litigation where no special antitrust immunity would apply.23 Unfortunately, the Court has spoken in two very different ways about the nature of the sham litigation doctrine. In City of Columbia, the Court stated: “The sham exception to Noerr encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process – as opposed to the outcome as an anticompetitive weapon.”24 This suggests an analogy to the common law of abuse of process. However, two years later the Court spoke in terms more akin to the notion of malicious prosecution stating:
“First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits. … Only if the challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant’s subjective motivation, which must be a subjective intent to abuse the governmental process in order to interfere with a competitor’s business.”25
The closest the question of political bias or animus has directly come in an antitrust decision action was the previously mentioned ATT-Time Warner litigation, where the defendants sought discovery on potential communications between the White House and the Justice Departments about political influence in the decision to challenge the merger. There, the court denied the requested discovery request holding that “defendants have not made a ‘credible showing’ that they have been ‘especially singled out’ [by the DOJ].”26 Even it turned out that there were no such communications,27 how would one ever know whether officials eager to please their bosses brought a plausible antitrust (or other kind of case) because they believed it would make the White House happy? And what should one do (or conclude) if such information became available?
C. Analogies from Other Areas of the Law
The law deals in many areas with these questions of purpose versus effect, objectively baseless claims versus claims with evidentiary and factual merit but improper purpose, and cases where these issues of mixed motives and bases are intertwined.28 These areas provide mixed signals how best to approach questions of political bias and personal animus in the antitrust realm.

Selective Prosecution

A defendant in a criminal case has a very narrow window to successfully establish a claim of selective prosecution. A selective prosecution claim is not a defense, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought a charge for reasons forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. U.S. v. Armstrong required that a defendant claiming selective prosecution must establish both that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted and that the government’s selection was motivated by the type of invidious intent prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.29 This normally involves a decision to prosecute based on prohibited factors such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification in the constitutional sense.30
The Armstrong Court held that to obtain discovery of information relevant to a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must produce “some evidence tending to show” the existence of discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent including that “similarly situated defendants of other races could have been prosecuted but were not.”31 This chicken and egg problem dooms most selective prosecution claims, including the attempt by the defendants in the ATT-Time Warner merger challenge to seek discovery about the potential political motivations of the government suing to block this particular transaction. 32
Despite its superficial appeal, selective prosecution, or selective enforcement in a civil or regulatory action, remains an unappealing road in most antitrust litigation. Courts are reluctant to interfere with the special province of the prosecutor or enforcement agency. Claims of political bias would then have to shoehorned into one or more of the protected categories under the Equal Protection Clause. The defendants would have to establish most of the facts necessary for the claim before obtaining disclosure or discovery on this topic from the government in litigation, a burden even well-heeled defendants like AT&T and Time Warner could not meet. Finally, even the most egregious of political favoritism would do nothing to attack a biased decision not to enforce the antitrust laws to benefit an ally.

Civil Procedure Analogies

Civil procedure provides another method of dealing with such questions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 11 requires attorneys to sign pleadings, motions, and most other writings, attesting that they have made an investigation reasonable under the circumstances and certify that the pleadings and other matters have a reasonable basis in both law and fact and are not being brought for an improper purpose.33 Similar provisions dealing with discovery requests go even further and require written certification that each request is consistent with the federal rules of civil procedure, warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for changing the law and are:
“(i) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and
(ii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.”34
The limitations of FRCP 11 are also well known. The provision includes a 21-day safe harbor that allows a party to avoid violating the rule by withdrawing or modifying the pleading or other written submission.35 The provision only states that the court “may” impose “appropriate” sanctions for violations of the rule.36 Moreover, sanctions are limited to what is sufficient to deter repeated violations by the party or those in similar circumstances.37 The court also has wide discretion as to the type of sanctions that can be imposed.38

Professional Responsibility

The model rules of professional responsibility also address these types of issues. MRPC 3.1 requires a meritorious basis for bringing or defending litigation.39 At the same time, MRPC 4.4a states:
“In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.”40
These model rules only apply to members of the bar and would not apply to sanction a non-lawyer professional at either of the antitrust agencies. While the content of these rules is helpful, they only allow for the subsequent initiation of disciplinary proceedings with the relevant state bar authorities and those courts where the attorney in question is admitted to practice and provide little comfort to the litigants in the moment of responding to improperly motivated proceedings.

Tort Law

In tort law, a similar distinction plays out in the differences between the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Malicious prosecution is usually defined as the bringing of a prior civil or criminal legal action without probable cause, and with malice, that resulted in harm to the defendant in the original action.41 No amount of malice is sufficient if the original claim has merit.
In contrast, the tort of abuse of process does not require proof of a lack of probable cause in the prior litigation. In general, an abuse of process requires proof that a person deliberately misused a prior court proceeding for an improper collateral purpose, regardless of whether the original civil or legal case had probable cause.42 One common example would be a perfectly appropriate case brought at least in substantial part to harass the defendant, run up his litigation costs, damage his reputation, or pursue improper lines of discovery to obtain information unrelated to the otherwise meritorious suit.

Administrative Law

Administrative law requires an agency to support its decision with substantial evidence and prohibits arbitrary or capricious decisions.43 Courts will grant agencies substantial discretion in deciding complex mixed questions of law and fact under this standard.44 However, both the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious tests normally turn on a matching of the evidence in the record of the agency decision with the outcome, rather than a parsing of the motive behind the decision.
The Supreme Court has allowed a narrow role for motive in holding that a proven pretext for an agency decision may be grounds for overturning final agency action.45 The Court rejected most attempts to inquire into the motive behind an agency decision, holding a court may not set aside under the APA an agency’s policymaking decision solely because the decision might have been influenced by political considerations or prompted by an Administration’s priorities.46 The Court noted that agency policymaking is not a rarified technocratic process, unaffected by political considerations or the presence of presidential power, and such decisions are routinely informed by unstated considerations of politics, the legislative process, public relations, interest group relations, foreign relations, national security concerns, and other considerations.47
Nonetheless, the Court found a narrow exception to the general rule against judicial inquiry into the mental processes of administrative decisionmakers, such an inquiry may be warranted and may justify extra-record discovery, on a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior.48 It therefore remanded the case regarding questions about citizenship on the 2020 Census back for further proceedings in the district court stating that the question concerning citizenship status could not be adequately explained in terms of the proffered reason.49

Employment Law

Employment law has its own unique approach to the question of whether an employee was fired for permissible reasons, such as job performance, or for an impermissible reason such as of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or some combination of both. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination “because of” an unlawful discriminatory factor.50 The so-called McDonnell-Douglas test adopted a burden shifting approach to deal with situations where an employee asserts she was treated less favorably for an unlawful reason and the employer contends that the treatment was based on a permissible factor.51
In McDonnell-Douglas, the plaintiff alleged that he was not hired because he was African American, while the company contended that the decision was a result of the plaintiff’s participation in a prior disruptive protest on company property. The Court held unanimously that the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. This can include direct and indirect evidence that which he can satisfy by showing that: (i) she belongs to a racial minority (or other protected group); (ii) she applied and was qualified for a job the employer was trying to fill; (iii) though qualified, she was rejected; and (iv) thereafter the employer continued to seek applicants with complainant’s qualifications.52
The defendant (employer) must then produce evidence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions.53 If this occurs, then there is no presumption of discrimination. The plaintiff must then be afforded a fair opportunity to present additional facts to show discrimination. The plaintiff may do so either by showing that the defendant’s explanation is insufficient, and therefore a pretext for discrimination, or by otherwise proving that the defendant’s relied on one or more of unlawful discriminatory parameters.54

Civil Rights

In civil rights and constitutional litigation, the Supreme Court has wandered from approach to approach. In Mt Healthy v. Doyle, the Supreme Court considered whether a public school teacher could be fired or otherwise disciplined for constitutionally protected speech, where the same action might have taken place for other unprotected activities.55 Here, the Court adopted a different type of burden shifting approach from that in McDonnell-Douglas. In order to prevail, the plaintiff must first prove that the activity they were allegedly disciplined for was indeed protected speech.56 Then the burden shifts to the defendant who can prevail if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse action would have occurred anyway, even if the protected activity had never happened.57
In cases relating to pretextual traffic stops of defendants, the Supreme Court simply rejected any such burden shifting. In Whren v. United States, the Court held in a unanimous decision that if there is probable cause for a traffic stop there is no further inquiry into whether the stop was a pretext for other unlawful purpose.58

International Antitrust Norms

One of the few attempts within the antitrust community to grapple with these issues has come from the Trump Administration itself. The Antitrust Division has devoted substantial resources toward the development of a Multilateral Framework on Procedures in Competition Law Investigation and Enforcement through the International Competition Network (“MFP”). The MFP identifies what the Justice Department terms universal due process principles that are widely accepted across the globe, including commitments regarding non-discrimination, transparency and predictability, proper notice, access to information, meaningful and timely engagement, the opportunity to defend, timely resolution of proceedings, confidentiality protections, avoidance of conflicts of interest, access to counsel and privilege, written enforcement decisions and public access to decisions, and availability of independent review of enforcement decisions.59
The closest these principles come to addressing the questions of political influence on independent competition agencies comes in its conflict of interest principles. This section states:
Officials, including decision makers, of the Participants will be objective and impartial and will not have material personal or financial conflicts of interest in the Investigations and Enforcement Proceedings in which they participate or oversee. Each Participant is encouraged to have rules, policies, or guidelines regarding the identification and prevention or handling of such conflicts.60
It would be both interesting and ironic if an exercise designed to reign in the discretion of enforcement agencies around the world would have a similar salutary effect in the United States.
D. Beginning to Grapple with Political Bias
These limited examples from inside the antitrust arena, and other areas of the law, provide a smorgasbord of options for beginning to think about how to deal with these issues in the antitrust context. The task is complicated by the presence of two separate but connected stages where these issues arise. The first is the general issue of prosecutorial discretion and how potential issues of bias should be handled by a district court once the Antitrust Division or FTC file a case. The second is the even more complicated issue of dealing with politically charged decisions not to proceed.
The first stage has the best existing framework for dealing with these sorts of issues. As discussed above, the combination of the vigorous application of FRCP 11 and the rules of professional responsibility provide two avenues for asserting that a politically motivated civil case was brought for an improper purpose. However, the existing mechanisms do not address the chicken and egg problem of how to document bad motives if denied discovery to the information that would verify the assertion of bias.
The decision to settle a matter has some procedural protections from this type of political influence. The Tunney Act requires a public interest showing before a settlement can be accepted by the court.61 However, the Microsoft litigation has made this requirement more of a formality by focusing on limiting the inquiry to matching the nature of the relief to the civil complaint actually filed, rather than the scope of the case that should have been filed or the reasons why the agency acted or refrained from acting.62
The issue of a decision not filed because of political considerations is one where US law is silent, but EU law provides a partial answer. There is no mechanism in current US law for judicial review of a decision not to proceed with a civil or criminal matter. In general, there is no ability to challenge an agency’s exercise of its discretion not to bring an action.63 This latitude is inherent in the tradition notion of agency discretion. Prosecutorial discretion remains the great unanswered question of administrative law.64
Civil antitrust cases are brought by two different entities: the FTC, bound by the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, which is not. In neither case is the agency obliged to disclose the reasons behind not bringing a case although from to time both do so on an occasional basis.65 Likewise, in neither case can affected parties challenge the decision not to proceed.
Asa far back as 1969, Professor Kenneth Culp Davis in his book Discretionary Justice challenged us to do better.
In prescient discussions of both the FTC and the Antitrust Division, he argued that:
“Apart from the guidelines program … the Antitrust Division can move toward greater clarification of its prosecution policies by announcing findings and reasons whenever it takes action of any kind that is based upon significant policy. When it prosecutes a case, when it decides not to prosecute, when it decides to dismiss or to nol pros, when it enters into a consent arrangement, and when it grants a clearance, it can and should state publicly the policy reasons for its actions, and the policy statements should be treated as precedents which normally will not be retroactively changed.”66
Not only did he include the FTC in proposing these important safeguards, he also highlighted the issue of inappropriate political influence as one of the main dangers requiring change.67
We can also strive for a system akin to that in place in the EU and similar administrative type systems in other jurisdictions. Any determination of the European Commission, whether to proceed or not to proceed with a matter, is an official decision requiring a statement of reasons and which can be challenged by an affected party.68 While the Commission’s decisions are granted substantial deference, they are not immune from judicial scrutiny.69 Adopting such an approach would institute such long needed reforms for both enforcement agencies and begin the process of dealing with this aspect of the potential political misuse of antitrust nonenforcement.
 
Conclusion
Antitrust has always been political in nature. How could it not be? It stems from broad legal commands dealing with how governments and private individuals can challenge different types of market behavior. Antitrust has reentered the political electoral arena, general mainstream media, and everyday discourse. Once mostly the domain of technocrats, antitrust issues have been proposed and debated by Presidential candidates, pundits, journalists, and voters alike. There are also a flurry of serious proposals and investigations that would make significant changes to the current system if adopted.
Part of that engagement has been the exploration of the potential political misuse of antitrust investigations and enforcement for political motivations and other types of animus and bias. The changing institutions and norms in the United States holding back authoritarian tendencies have begun to erode for antitrust enforcement and other aspects of law enforcement. There is real reason to be concerned that the enforcement agencies are consciously or unconsciously beginning to tailor aspects of their decision making to the stated, or perceived, political needs of the White House. Other areas of the law have been dealing with these issues far longer and provide potential solutions for consideration in the antitrust field. Regardless of which combination of tools we use to address these concerns, it is urgent that we start this discussion.

Focusing in particular on the impact of algorithms, this essay demonstrates ways in which the peculiarities of the digital economy are reflected in the practice of the Bundeskartellamt (BKartA). In light of the increasing importance of algorithms, it elaborates on the BKartA’s practical experiences in this regard and points out conclusions drawn from past proceedings. These practical experiences are complemented by conceptual considerations on pricing algorithms and collusion as well as on potential interdependencies between algorithms and market power, which inform future enforcement. In view of the challenges posed by the implications of algorithms on competition, but also more broadly by the ongoing digital transformation, the essay finally points to the current discussions on adjusting the legal toolkit and highlights that digitalization, as a global phenomenon, calls for international collaboration and exchange.

I. TURNING DIGITAL
The global trend towards digitalization poses unique challenges for both competition policy and enforcement. Considering the digital economy in particular, many business models rely on positive network effects as customers often prefer services which many others use. The more a service is used – e.g. social networking websites – the more customers it attracts and the more attractive it becomes, potentially resulting in a winner-takes-all dynamic. A further important trait of many popular businesses in the d...

This article considers how algorithms affect competition and what their implications are for competition policy. With the economy going digital a huge number of great innovations have materialized. Consumers have greatly benefitted from these innovations. However, a number of antitrust issues have emerged. This article looks at both the consumer benefits as well as the antitrust issues. It examines whether algorithmic innovations raise any novel concerns competition law concerns.

I. INTRODUCTION
What do algorithms have to do with antitrust? Nothing intrinsically, but algorithms feed of data and data is an issue for antitrust enforcers. The ability of a firm to collect extremely large amounts of data and process them through sophisticated algorithms to reveal patterns, trends and associations (collectively known as “big data”) adds a new dimension to market power, which ought to be of interests to competition authorities. Having a data advantage can lead to great innovations, but it can also create huge concentrations in certain markets. Data can affect entry conditions by making it more or less difficult for a firm to enter or compete, in particular for firms needing data as an input in order to compete in a specific market.  There is a belief that simple algorithms with lots of data outperform sophisticated algorithms with little data partly because of the opportunity for algorithms to learn through trial and error.2 According ...

625,"July 7, 2020",The New Antitrust Revolution,"

By Kayvan Hazemi-Jebelli (Computer & Communications Industry Association)1
 
You may not have noticed, but there’s a new antitrust revolution brewing in Europe. In February, the European Commission formally announced its intention to update competition rules to ensure that markets where large technology companies are present remain “fair and contestable.” I must confess that I assumed this meant accelerating the Commission’s ongoing revision to decades old guidance on assessing market power, or the safe-harbor rules for vertical and horizontal agreements, or perhaps that the Commission would facilitate strict enforcement of the recent, but still yet to apply, Platform-to-Business Regulation.2 I was wrong. In June the Commission revealed what it meant, with three major antitrust “pillars” towards fairness and contestability:

Vigorous enforcement of existing competition laws;
Ex ante regulation of digital platforms; and
A new market investigation tool with the power to impose structural and behavioral remedies absent any finding of competition infringement.

One might call such far-reaching proposals ambitious reforms. But a critical look under the hood suggests a return to form-based antitrust presumptions; a counter-revolution to 50 years of jurisprudence focused on consumer welfare, economic effects, and causality.
  
Vigorous (Burden-Shifted) Enforcement
Vigorous, a-political, objective, and evidence-based antitrust enforcement is good, and should remain the standard that each jurisdiction expects from its global trade partners. It’s what we’ve worked decades to achieve and what we push for in international trade agreements. But the European Union has been criticized for sometimes putting the interests of its businesses ahead of consumers. At the ABA Spring Meeting this year, which had to be delivered virtually due to the COVID-19 crisis, many astute ears justifiably pricked up during the enforcer panel with European Commission Executive Vice President for “A Europe Fit for the Digital Age,” Margrethe Vestager. She stressed that investigators shouldn’t face excessive hurdles to proving their cases. Rather, they should be able to rely on presumptions that certain kinds of behavior were likely to harm competition. It’s not the first time the Commission has advocated for shifting the burden of proof. Presumptions and burden shifting can promote sound judicial and administrative efficiency, if supported by economic theory and a history of enforcement experience confirming the pernicious effects of the underlying conduct. But as some have pointed out, where the existing burden of proof is on the Commission to show only a capability of anticompetitive effect, is such burden shifting efficient?
More likely, it would be counter-productive, chilling competition by presuming consumer harm for a range of ostensibly procompetitive conduct. The Commission’s self-preferencing case against Google’s shopping comparison service is the most prominent example. In that case, the Commission condemned Google’s decision to improve product search results by drawing from its own quality-controlled product comparison database instead of from competitors’ unknown, inaccessible and unverifiable databases. For any product developer, Google’s decision would seem eminently more reliable, consistent and straightforward. Or, as the Commission itself once said “a company’s production of its own requirements is not in itself an abnormal act of competition.”3 When closing its related investigation, the FTC warned that “[p]roduct design is an important dimension of competition and condemning legitimate product improvements risks harming consumers.”4 The Commission nevertheless found Google’s conduct discriminatory, and imposed an eye-watering multi-billion euro fine. This has led to a series of follow-on damage claims, even though an appeal of the Commission decision is pending at the European Court of Justice,5 and despite courts in the UK and Germany having already rejected similar claims on similar facts. One might think it too early for a broad presumption of  consumer harm under the “self-preferencing” banner, particularly where it encroaches on legitimate product design choices. One might consider that opening up such conduct to antitrust liability would chill procompetitive conduct and reduce consumer welfare. But this chilling effect is just one aspect of this drift towards “fairness and contestability.”
  
Ex Ante Regulation (of Bigness)?
The second pillar of the new antitrust revolution is a new ex ante market regulation for “very large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.”  Unsurprisingly, the Inception Impact Assessment (“IIA”) launching the consultation states as one policy option an outright prohibition on self-preferencing, citing it as an example of conduct that is “potentially market-distorting or entrenching economic power of the large online platforms.” But confirming the Commission’s existing posture is not as revolutionary as what appears to be a new policy objective to limit bigness.
The IIA identifies particular obstacles facing its overarching policy objective to “increase the innovation potential and capacity across the online platform ecosystems in the EU’s single market.” In particular, it aims to tackle market dynamics that “reduce the social gain from innovation,” pointing to the variety of ecosystem services, platforms operators’ resources and scale, and their ability to enter adjacent markets as factors that are “keeping innovative market operators from expanding or entering the market in the first place.” The IIA notes that “Europe’s estimated 10 000 online platforms are potentially hampered in scaling broadly and thereby contributing to the EU’s technological sovereignty, as they are increasingly faced with incontestable online platform ecosystems.”
The IIA states that increasing the “contestability” of online platform ecosystems “would have a positive impact on innovation and research, technological development and growth of the digital economy.” It is based on an assumption that increasing “contestability” would mean better outcomes for consumers. But an overbroad interpretation of “contestability,” i.e. limitations on ecosystem growth, would more likely have a negative impact on the innovation, research, technological development, and digital economy growth that the Commission seeks to support. As discussed further below, this is because (a) large digital ecosystems drive aggregate demand upon which adjacent innovations can flourish; (b) their size contributes positively to the impact of innovation; and (c) their size is inherent to their innovation producing business models.
First, large digital ecosystems have driven the growth of the digital economy. Network effects happen because consumers and/or businesses prefer to be on platforms that other consumers or businesses are using. In the digital environment, where choices are abundant, consumers often prefer convenience, consistency, and a one-stop-shop experience. These efficiencies lower transaction costs, increase consumer welfare, and drive overall technological adoption. In the words of one well-known technologist, “it just works,” and it’s this intense focus on user experience and customer satisfaction that has dramatically increased adoption of new technology around the world. As the CMA’s recent market study acknowledged, “[i]Integration of a wide range of products and services can deliver efficiency savings and can also improve the consumer experience overall, by increasing the ease with which a range of different services are accessed.”6 A digital ecosystem that offers reliable solutions to a variety of user needs, that does a number of jobs conveniently and well, will often be more important to the marginal user considering a digital alternative than the “social gain” of having to navigate through a swamp of “innovative alternatives” as foreseen by the IIA. That’s why attempts to fragment these ecosystems are likely counterproductive, a result of overlooking the value that broad digital ecosystems provide to their users, and their contribution to the overall growth of the technology industry.
Second, larger platform ecosystems make it easier for innovators to reach massive scale, to the benefit of consumers. According to Apple, the App Store ecosystem supported $519 billion in billings and sales globally in 2019 alone. That’s a lot of opportunity for innovators. Network effects mean not only that users benefit from the size of a network, but also that innovations are more quickly disseminated throughout that ecosystem. New tools, features, and functionalities, new solutions to existing problems, spread more quickly through large ecosystems than fragmented ones.
Lastly, digital intermediaries often need size. Even if in specific cases increasing “contestability” were to increase investment incentives on the edges, it could also dramatically reduce the investment incentives of the platforms and their competitors. That’s because the business model of large digital intermediaries, particularly those based on software, is premised on significant up-front capital costs, very low marginal costs, and massive scale. Start-ups and SMEs in this sector often operate at a loss while attempting to achieve sufficient scale to become profitable. Sometimes that scale comes from expanding into adjacent markets. And allowing this has led to massive innovation in a very short period of time. According to the Commission’s own estimates, the five largest “gatekeeper platforms” (Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook), spent a combined €72.8 billion in R&D in 2018, nearly twice the amount spent by the entire EU ICT sector (approx. €42 billion).7 These companies are competing to create revolutionary new technologies and push the boundaries of innovation in computing devices, entertainment, mobility, productivity tools, the retail experience, and more. Efforts aimed at increasing ecosystem contestability that would result in reducing potential scale or scope (or increasing marginal costs) could make such ventures terminally unprofitable. This would ultimately result in less up-front investment, less technological development, and less growth for the digital economy.
The Commission’s apparent suspicion of bigness and market structure signals a departure from the existing antitrust framework. As Furman Inquiry Panel member, and antitrust rapper, Philip Marsden has said “the way forward is not by making non-evidence based decisions condemning market structures.” But it is this very suspicion of the efficiencies of scale and scope that lies at the heart of the Commission’s ex ante proposals. In this context, the Commission’s desire for “contestability” could risk much of what has gone right with the existing competition framework. One can legitimately wonder whether the proliferation of technological innovation that surrounds us would be as prevalent under a system that prioritized “social innovation” or “contestability.”
  
Ex Ante-Ante Intervention (or, the “New Competition Tool (‘NCT’)”)
The third pillar of the new antitrust revolution is a new market investigation tool to address “certain structural risks for competition” with a particular emphasis on markets with network, scale, and data effects (e.g. technology markets). However, the NCT consultation identifies several “structural competition problems” which do not, under the traditional framework, appear to be competition problems at all. In particular:

“Tipping markets” are not problematic. Many investments are made in start-ups on the basis that they can be recovered once sufficient scale is achieved. The characteristic of “tipping” is itself related to the increased value that users derive from the network effects. Where such characteristics are present, preventing tipping would mean worse outcomes for consumers.
“Leveraging” into adjacent markets is not inherently problematic. Where a firm has transferable skills and resources, leveraging those for market entry leads to increased efficient competition in those adjacent markets and hence better outcomes for users. The Commission offers no distinction between procompetitive and anticompetitive leveraging.
“High entry barriers” are a characteristic common to several industries and are not inherently problematic unless a competitor with a superior business model or product cannot contest an incumbent, or when the threat of such entry is insufficient pressure to ensure efficient market outcomes.

By raising these three as “structural” concerns, the Commission again appears to presume anticompetitive effects from conduct or market circumstances that would normally be part of a case-by-case assessment and require some showing of causality. Under the traditional competition assessment, unilateral conduct by non-dominant undertakings is unlikely to be problematic by definition. This is because a company that has the ability to harm competition is likely dominant, and a company that is not dominant is unlikely to have the market power sufficient to unilaterally cause an anticompetitive effect on the market. Also, the concept of dominance is flexible, and increasingly applied to narrow market segments such that most firms can be found dominant where their anticompetitive conduct is liable to harm competition. The on-going revision to the pre-Google Market Definition Notice will no doubt help in this respect. So why go after non-dominant companies specifically?
The basis for this new intervention power not only presumes that certain unilateral conduct can cause harm (as in the ex ante tool), but it makes a further presumption that such conduct would cause harm even absent market power. This form of treatment has usually been reserved only to the most “hardcore” categories of restraints. So, not only does the Commission make an ex ante assessment of the conduct and presume harm, but it would make a further ex ante assessment of future impact, presuming a future effect. Such broad discretionary power to impose structural and behavioral remedies on speculative future oriented presumptions signals a revolutionary return to form-based antitrust enforcement over economic assessment and causality. That is of course, if legal certainty is to be expected. The alternative would be the Commission picking winners and losers via speculative predictions of future harm.
  
Concluding Remarks
The Commission’s shift to a new “fair and contestable” paradigm is as yet undefined. The substance of the Commission’s proposals, and the nature of the presumptions incorporated therein, suggest a shift away from the existing international and multilateral framework focused on economic efficiency and an evidence-based assessment of causality, towards one more focused on market structure, on “fairness,” “choice,” and “contestability,” and the Commission’s predictions as to the future. This revolution certainly appears to be aligned with the push from certain Member States who advocate for a competition policy facilitating the creation of “European Champions.” After all, who will benefit when bigness is punished on the grounds of supporting “innovative alternatives”?
Of course, there’s no need to be overly alarmed by the possibility of this new antitrust revolution. We are still in the early stages of an open consultation and the Commission is meeting with industry representatives and considering their views alongside the enforcement experience of the Commission and national competition authorities, “findings and proposals from the worldwide reflection process on the need to amend the competition law framework” including “dozens of recent reports on platform power by regulators as well as by academic experts,” advice from DG COMP’s Economic Advisory Group on Competition Policy, consumer associations, the EU’s Platform Observatory and related work on platform regulation, and additional research papers commissioned by the EC “concerning the economic power of large online platforms.” The Commission will weigh all the available evidence and at the end of summer, once the consultation period closes, quickly have to finish its proposals to complete the intra-Commission review and approval, before formally proposing it in Q4 2020. Those who are concerned by the more revolutionary aspects of the Commission’s proposals will have their opportunity to speak, though there are clear political winds pushing the Commission to “do something” and only limited time for experts to engage in the debate before the main window of opportunity closes.. Ultimately, we will have to wait and see how much the Commission’s proposals will be able to preserve the more economic approach, and thereby competitive incentives and efficiencies of scale and scope.
To the extent that policy makers intend to preserve innovation and consumer welfare as policy objectives, they will need to hear the nuance, and reflect on their presumptions. Technology advocates will do our best to convey these points in the time allowed, because we all benefit from a system that rewards efficiency, investment, and vigorous competition.

The US Justice Department is nearing a lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google for antitrust violations and a coalition of states that are conducting a parallel investigation are divided over the best strategy for taking on the Internet giant, according to Bloomberg.
While the multistate investigation into Google’s dominance of the digital advertising market is in its final stages, some state attorneys general are advocating to take more time to investigate Google’s conduct in other markets and potentially bring a broader case against the company, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.
The disagreement could affect whether states join a Justice Department complaint about Google. Like the states, federal antitrust enforcers have been investigating whether Google is thwarting competition in the digital advertising market, where it holds a commanding position.
The Justice Department, which is coordinating with the states, wants to move quickly, two of the people said, and is on track to file a complaint this summer, another person said, though it wasn’t clear what conduct the complaint will ultimately target. The Department declined to comment.
“While we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is on creating free products that lower costs for small businesses and help Americans every day,” Google said in a statement.
State attorneys general can play a pivotal role in enforcement cases against companies when they band together in group investigations. They joined the Justice Department in suing Microsoft  in 1998 for antitrust violations. The case nearly led to the break-up of the company when a judge sided with the government. After an appeals court reversed the ruling, the Justice Department under the George W. Bush administration settled the case.
Two people familiar with the states’ investigation said the split among the states reflects normal tension about the best litigation strategy. A broad complaint would cover more conduct, but would take more time to complete.

627,"July 5, 2020",When Code is Law: Bargains Between News Publishers and Platforms,"
By Rob Nicholls*
 
I. Introduction
In July 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) published the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry.1 In that report, the ACCC made two findings of a substantial degree of power. It considers that Facebook has substantial market power in the supply of display advertising and that Google has substantial market power in the supply of both general search services and search advertising services as well as substantial bargaining power in its dealings with news media businesses in Australia.2 Under section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), a business with a substantial degree of power in a market is not allowed to engage in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.
The ACCC has not found that there has been misuse of market power. However, it expressed concern about market structure and bargaining power imbalances in some of the 23 recommendations made in the Digital Platforms Inquiry report. These included wide-ranging reforms to consumer protection and privacy laws. In December 2019, the government supported six of these recommendations in their entirety and ten “in principle” (with plans for further reviews). It “noted” five others and rejected two.3
One of the six supported recommendations was to:
The Government will address bargaining imbalances between digital platforms and news media businesses by asking the ACCC to work with the relevant parties to develop and implement a voluntary code to address these concerns. The ACCC will provide a progress report to Government on code negotiations in May 2020, with codes to be finalised no later than November 2020. Any code will be considered binding on the parties who elect to sign up to it. If an agreement is not forthcoming, the Government will develop alternative options to address the concerns raised in the report and this may include the creation of a mandatory code. 
After the ACCC had conducted initial meetings with Facebook and Google, it reported back to the Australian Government. As a result, on 20 April 2020, the ACCC was directed to develop a mandatory code of conduct.4 The direction included the requirement that the:
draft mandatory code will be released for consultation by the ACCC before the end of July, with a final code to be settled soon thereafter.5
On May 19, 2020, the ACCC released a Concepts Paper seeking views on each of the issues to be covered in a mandatory code to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media business and each of Google and Facebook. There was an unusually short time allowed for responses and they were due by June 5, 2020.6
This article considers the nature of the value relationship between news publishers and platforms. It provides a context for industry codes and analyses the platform position in respect of that value relationship. It also notes the likely next code on “fake news.”
 
II. The Value Arguments
One of the issues that is most difficult in dealing with this is defining “news.” Indeed, it is considered by the ACCC to be a threshold issue which is why it’s question number one in the Consultation Paper. One of the important concepts that drives this is a definition of “Public Interest Journalism:”7
journalism with the primary purpose of recording comma investigating and explaining issues of public significance in order to engage citizens in public debate and informed democratic decision making at all levels of government. 
The challenge for the ACCC is that although this is a useful definition it does not address where there is an imbalance of bargaining power between, on the one side Google and Facebook and on the other side news media businesses. This leads to an issue as to how content of news can be readily identified for the purpose of any code. It brings up the usual challenges of issues such as whether a blog is news or whether material produced for example by WikiLeaks would also fall into the news category.
At the heart of the issue that the ACCC needs to deal with is the two-way exchange of value between the platform and the news publisher. If news is identified on the platform, a “click through” to the new publisher’s website means that the news provider can gain revenue for advertising on its site. The fact that news is available within the platform’s ecosystem adds value by keeping the customer in that ecosystem and able to be targeted with advertising.
The issue of two-way value exchange is not new to competition regulators. As an example, in telecommunications the interconnection of networks creates value to consumers by allowing them to communicate with others on different networks. In most jurisdictions, this is based on “calling party network pays.” That is, the receiving party network receives a terminating payment from the calling party network. The calling party pays a retail price to its network operator. In practice, there is likely to be symmetry between the networks so the terminating charge acts as a price signal, but the net value tends to zero. As a result, if the price signal is not required, then symmetry can be assumed and there is no wholesale charge. This is called “bill and keep.”8
In telecommunications networks, there is symmetry, which is absent from the interaction between news publishers and platforms. This means that any payments made under the code will need to reflect the net exchange of value. This value exchange is highly contested. Google argues that the driver for search results to include news is “societal and not economic.” Facebook also takes the view that there should be no net payment. On the other hand, the chair of a major Australian media company (Nine), Peter Costello suggested that the fee payable should be 10 percent of annual Australian revenue and estimated this amount to be $A600 million (about $420 million). Costello is a former Commonwealth treasurer9 for the party currently in government.
However, the likely net value exchange will be significantly lower than the amount proposed by the chair of Nine. The referral by the Treasurer does not stop Google and Facebook from proposing prices to the ACCC as the ACCC is drafting the mandatory code. Indeed, this is to be expected from both the news publishers and the platforms. In the debate about value flow, the effect of Google’s exit from providing news search in Spain in 2014 will likely be discussed. There is some evidence, albeit from news publishers, that the effect of the Google news exit was to drive news seeking web users directly to publisher’s websites.10
 
III. Codes in Australia
A. Legislative Background
The ability to make and enforce codes by the ACCC is provided in Part IVB of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“CCA”). Unless otherwise directed or as determined by the ACCC, section 51AE of the CCA provides that the ACCC can make regulations that “declare the industry code to be a mandatory industry code or a voluntary industry code.” The Government direction in this case means that the code will be mandatory.
In order to understand the implication of a mandatory code of conduct it is worthwhile reviewing the legislative and regulatory arrangements which allow a code of conduct to be enforced. There are two types of code which can be administered by the ACCC. The first is a voluntary code which is typically one made by an industry association and which provides a level of harmonization of the activities of members of that association. Such voluntary codes have also been associated with authorizations provided by the ACCC. These authorizations permit conduct which might be otherwise anticompetitive provided that it is in the public interest. Industry codes contain an internal dispute resolution scheme as well as provisions for monitoring conduct and enforcing industry compliance.
One of the issues that flows from the code process is that the ACCC has a right of audit of businesses which are part of a code. Essentially the ACCC gives notice and the business has 21 days to comply with that notice. The ACCC can use that documentation to ensure that compliance with the code is enforced.
B. Other Sectors Other Regulators
The ACCC enforces mandatory codes in the franchising sector, the energy sector and ports for bulk wheat. It also enforces voluntary codes in sectors from horticulture to groceries. In the mandatory code space, there is a part considered to be weaker and in a negotiating power imbalance. For franchising, the weaker parties are the franchisees. In energy, the weaker party is the consumer and in ports, the weaker parties are the farmers.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (“ACMA”) also deals with sector specific industry codes. Industry bodies develop codes and submit them to the ACMA. Once they are approved and registered, the ACMA enforces the codes. One of the critical codes managed by the ACMA is the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (“TCP”) Code. Enforcement under this code is by way of an infringement notice and the ACMA considers that each affected consumer is a separate infringement.
The ACMA has also introduced its views on fake news. This has been done by publishing an “expectations” note on what would form part of a voluntary code on disinformation.11 It outlines the ACMA’s expectations for a voluntary code of practice on misinformation and news quality to be developed by digital platforms. The ACMA paper, “Misinformation and news quality on digital platforms in Australia: A position paper to guide code development,” includes a model code framework. It sets out the ACMA’s views on objectives and outcomes to be achieved from a code that it considers would benefit Australian users of digital platforms. The ACMA has the power to enforce industry codes and an example is the TCP.
C. Enforcement
The chair of the ACCC, Rod Sims has pledged that Australia’s mandatory code of conduct will feature “heavy penalties” for Facebook and Google if they fail to comply, involving fines that are “large enough to matter.”12
Breach of a code is a civil offense and an industry code may prescribe maxim pecuniary penalties of about $45,000 for civil penalty provisions of the industry code. This does not sound like the “heavy penalties” mentioned by the ACCC chair. In practice, when a code is breached the ACCC chooses to enforce using more than the code provisions. The ACCC will typically take an action under each of
section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (“ACL”), which is Schedule 2 to the CCA for misleading or deceptive conduct for which damages is a remedy; and section 29 of the ACL for misrepresentation.
In the latter case, the penalty is up to the greater of $A10 million or 10 percent of annual revenue.13 The ACCC can also ask the court for directions including corrective advertising and a requirement that the business give an undertaking not to repeat the conduct. These undertakings are enforceable by the Federal Court.
This approach has been used by the ACCC in each of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. Geowash Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) (No 4) [2020] FCA 23. The absence of major pecuniary penalties in the code is unlikely to reduce the effectiveness of ACCC enforcement. The cases cited above are in the car wash and mobile mechanic sectors. These have a far smaller interaction with consumers than Facebook or Google.
The audit power may well be used in respect of changes to algorithmic processes. The ACCC was particularly concerned that news publishers may be disadvantaged by changes in algorithm by either Facebook or Google:14
The ACCC understands that digital platforms make very frequent changes to their ranking and display algorithms, which vary from minor alterations to significant changes. A bargaining code mechanism requiring advance notice would need to include a threshold of significance that would trigger the obligation to provide advance notice. 
Additionally, such a mechanism would need to specify the length of time required for advance notice of significant changes. This period should be set to provide news media businesses with sufficient time to amend their business strategies to address the effects of the algorithm change. 
The audit provision may well be used to determine whether there had been a change, whether notified or otherwise.
 
IV. Reaction
A. Facebook’s Response
Facebook provided its response in the form of a blog and a copy of its submission.15 It makes the argument that the symbiotic relationship between news publisher and platform creates value for the news publisher:
Between January and May this year, Facebook’s News Feed sent 2.3 billion clicks back to Australian news organisations – for free. These referrals were worth approximately AU$195.8 million for publishers, based on what the average costs would be for similar activity through our paid advertising tools. In all, we delivered billions of opportunities for publishers to monetise their stories, gain new paying subscribers, serve ads, and keep Australians on their websites.
We’ve also invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through COVID-19 relief funds, paying publishers directly for content, coaching and grant programs and industry sponsorships. With an effective Code, we’d like to continue to collaborate and increase our partnerships and investments in Australia.
That is, Facebook is positioning the two-way value exchange as one which benefits news publishers to the same extent that it benefits Facebook. A precursor to a “bill and keep” argument.
B. Google’s Response
One of the areas which has had most interest from the ACCC is Accelerated Mobile Pages (“AMP”). These enable near instant loading of content and content as the pages are cached. The AMP are preloaded so when a user clicks on a hyperlink to the AMP it loads quickly on the user’s device. One of the issues is that although there are three potential providers of an AMP (Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare), the fact that Google has control of both the AMP cache and its own servers provides some concern to the ACCC. This concern has been expressed in both the Consultation Paper and the Digital Platforms Inquiry report. Google has not made recent comments on AMP. The ACCC regards AMP as a platform in its own right and the Concepts Paper sought stakeholder on whether the bargaining code should apply to AMP (among others) in addition to Google Search and Facebook News Feed (original emphasis).16 These additional services are also supplied by Google and Facebook and include WhatsApp and YouTube. The ACCC has indicated that the bargaining power imbalance should also be considered for these services.
Google has not published its submission and the ACCC has not published any of the submissions. However, Google has entered into licensing arrangements to license some forms of news in Australia and other countries.17 This has included licensing news from local and national publishers in Germany Australia and Brazil. However, it is also important to note that Google’s licensing does not extend to snippets. The blog emphasizes the potential for monetization by news publishers:
This program will help participating publishers monetize their content through an enhanced storytelling experience that lets people go deeper into more complex stories, stay informed and be exposed to a world of different issues and interests. 
Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read paywalled articles on a publisher’s site. This will let paywalled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.
This blog was written in the context of another Google position, also published as a blog.18 This sets out a similar argument to that of Facebook. Namely, that the flow is two-way and in favor of news publishers:
Sending people to publishers’ news sites—not keeping them “walled” up on Google products, as some claim—is a key way we provide value to the news industry. Every month we send Google users to news sites 24 billion times, providing an opportunity for publishers to grow their audiences and show Google’s users ads or offers for subscriptions. Deloitte puts a value of each click for large publishers at roughly between 4-7 U.S. cents. 
We also invest in ad technologies that thousands of news publishers around the world choose to use to grow their digital advertising businesses. We analyzed the revenue data of 100 news publishers globally with the highest programmatic revenue generated in Google Ad Manager. On average, we found news publishers keep over 95 percent of the digital advertising revenue they generate when they use Ad Manager to show ads on their websites.
  
V. Conclusions
Industry codes are designed to provide protection to the weaker party its bargaining with a stronger one. The ACCC has found that Facebook and Google have substantial market power in relevant markets associated with news publication but has not found that there has been misuse of market power. A voluntary code would have addressed this imbalance, but a failure to negotiate a voluntary code led to an Australian Government direction to the ACCC to impose a mandatory one.
There is a two-way value interaction between platforms and news publishers. Publishers have argued that this should lead to payments by Facebook and Google to news publishers. The ambit claim was $420 million. The response from the platforms is that the value received by the news publishers is high already. The ACCC must draft a mandatory code which addresses these issues. The code will be in force before the end of 2020. It is likely that the ACMA code on misinformation and news quality will be implemented in a similar timeframe.

The payments by Alphabet’s Google to Apple to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari web browser create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market, the UK markets regulator said in a report released on Wednesday.
Apple received the “substantial majority” of the 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) that Google paid to be the default search engine on a variety of devices in the United Kingdom in 2019, according to the report.
The UK Competition and Markets Authority, in its final report investigating online platforms and digital advertising, said the arrangements between Apple and Google create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market. Those rivals include Microsoft Corp’s Bing, Verizon Communications Inc-owned Yahoo and independent search engine DuckDuckGo, all of which also make payments to Apple in exchange for being search engine options on its devices, the report said.“Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles,” the regulators wrote in the report.

629,"June 24, 2020",Self-Preferencing: Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"
Following Google Shopping, competition authorities in Europe – supported by a flurry of reports on digital competition – have wasted little time establishing self-preferencing in competition law’s lexicon. But while self-preferencing looks here to stay, there is little clarity over the legal test which applies and how self-preferencing fits within the established canon of “leveraging” abuses. This article considers where self-preferencing should fit in light of “prior beliefs” as to its likely efficiencies and potential for competitive harm. It further considers how arbitrage of different legal standards by regulators (reverse regulatory arbitrage) can be avoided. These are critical questions as regulators and courts weigh up how to address the alleged harm from self-preferencing without undermining the dynamic efficiency of digital markets.

By Christian Ahlborn, Will Leslie, & Eoin OReilly1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the first Statement of Objections on Google Shopping was announced, competition practitioners, commentators and academics have grappled with the concept of “self-preferencing.”2 What harm is it intended to address? What is the correct legal test? And how does it fit into the established canon of abuses under Article 102 TFEU?
Much ink has been split on whether “self-preferencing” is even an abuse or, as some have suggested, merely an inventive way of circumventing the (high) legal standard for “refusal to supply.”3 Others h...

630,"June 24, 2020",Hybrid Differentiation and Competition Beyond Markets,"
Hybrid differentiation occurs when a platform discriminates among businesses in a related market in which it is not active itself with the aim to increase or maintain its competitive advantage elsewhere. An example is a platform blocking an app that interferes with its ability to gain revenues through advertising. Hybrid differentiation is particularly relevant where a platform builds an ecosystem or conglomerate around its main activity. As a competitive strategy beyond vertical integration that serves to protect the platform’s overall activities and business model, hybrid differentiation is different from the self-preferencing at stake in Google Shopping. This paper submits that the assessment of hybrid differentiation requires attention for the broader competitive strategies of dominant platforms going beyond traditional forms of leveraging and the relevant markets in which they operate.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Google Shopping saga has led to a fierce discussion about the theory of harm condemning self-preferencing by vertically integrated dominant firms as anticompetitive. This paper reflects on another type of discrimination, namely hybrid differentiation, whose effects are maybe even more complex and problematic than those of self-preferencing.

By Mike Isaac, New York Times
Even as Facebook grappled this month with an internal revolt and a cascade of criticism over its refusal to take action on President Trump’s inflammatory posts, the social network was actively making other bets behind the scenes.
Late one Tuesday, as attention was focused on how Facebook might handle Mr. Trump, the Silicon Valley company said in a brief blog post that it had invested in Gojek, a “super app” in Southeast Asia. The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed a $5.7 billion investment it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.
The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile undersea fiber-optic cable encircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebook confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.

632,"June 9, 2020","Antitrust and Tech: Europe and the United States Really Do Differ, and It Does Matter","

By Gregory J. Werden (U.S. Department of Justice, Retired)1
 
In Antitrust and Tech: Europe and the United States Differ, and It Matters (CPI Antitrust Chronicle, October 2019), Luke Froeb and I identified ten “hard-wired differences between the European and American enforcement regimes” that “make different outcomes easy to understand” and explain why “EC officials have not been inhibited in doing what they think best, but U.S. officials have been.” We noted that no single difference “is decisive, and some might not matter much.” Maria Coppola & Renato Nazzini have tried to minimize the differences and their significance, but they did not deny that outcomes differ or that EC officials have been less inhibited than U.S. officials.2 Coppola & Nazzini noted substantial “transatlantic convergence” but did not deny that convergence is limited by hard-wired differences.
1. The European system is driven by competitor complaints. Coppola and Nazzini rightly observed that enforcement of EU competition law is not driven by complaints alone, but they also acknowledged that “complainants may choose to focus their efforts in Brussels.” The reason is that complaining pays off much better in Europe than in the United States.
2. The European system is run by politicians. Luke Froeb and I observed that many EC Commissioners are career politicians. Coppola and Nazzini counter that we did not show that this “had a systematic, or indeed any, impact on past cases,” but training, experience, and career aspirations are bound to have an impact. Placing U.S. state competition law enforcement in the hands of elected officials seeking higher office had a pronounced impact. Although the U.S. federal enforcement agencies are not insulated from politics, they are not run by politicians.
3. The European system was conceived of as regulation, not as law enforcement. The Sherman Act clearly was “conceived of” as law enforcement in that it condemned mala in se crimes and was meant to be enforced by generalist prosecutors, while the EU created an administrative system run by experts. Coppola and Nazzini objected to describing “the EU system of competition enforcement as ‘regulation,’” but a system in which courts review administrative decisions is materially different from one in which courts adjudicate the cases in the first instance.
4. The European system is grounded in a skepticism of markets. Coppola and Nazzini ultimately concluded that Americans have “a greater faith in market forces” than Europeans, which is the point Luke Froeb and I were making. Coppola and Nazzini’s protestation that “that enforcement in Europe is not guided by a skepticism of markets” is a semantic quibble.
5. The European system lacks the process of U.S. court proceedings. Coppola and Nazzini suggested that de novo court review in Europe negates the clear differences in enforcement proceedings. Court review in the EU, however, is profoundly affected by the absence of robust discovery rights, opposing experts, and cross-examination. Coppola and Nazzini pointed out that many U.S. cases are settled, but settlements reflect expected litigation outcomes. Companies have a right to adversary proceedings before a remedy in the U.S., but not in the EU.
6. The European system lacks the burden of proof of an adversarial system. Coppola and Nazzini seemed to agree with the claim Luke Froeb and I made that the burden of proof “means little” in the EU “because the EC need not satisfy a neutral fact-finder that it has met its burden.” Coppola and Nazzini note that the EU way of doing things is normal for an administrative system, but the point remains that U.S. plaintiffs must overcome heavy burdens, while the EC need not.
7. The European system does not impeach unsound theories. Coppola and Nazzini insisted that the EU does impeach unsound theories, but they identified no court decision focused on the soundness of economics. Nor are the Legal Service, Advocate Generals, and General Court equipped to detect unsound economics. Only the use of opposing experts, cross-examination, and a neutral arbiter provides assurances that unsound theories are impeached.
8. The European system maintains a low bar for anticompetitive effects. Coppola and Nazzini argued that Luke Froeb and I ignored the fact that EU law sets the bar differently for different conduct, but they did not suggest that the EU bar is ever set as high as the U.S. bar. Coppola and Nazzini also observed that the EU cases are inconsistent and unclear on the nature and height of the bar. That is so, and further convergence is possible.
9. The European system is receptive to leveraging theories. Coppola and Nazzini asserted that the EC’s past tying cases involved instances of threatened monopolization of the tied product market, but that is difficult to accept as to the incorporation of Microsoft’s media player. Nor do Coppola and Nazzini refute the contention Luke Froeb and I made that: “Whenever a tech giant seeks to monetize a platform by offering a related service, it can easily be found in violation of Article 102 TFEU because its dominant platform is seen to treat its own related business more favorably than it treats an independent business competing with its related business.”
10. The European system does not recognize competition on the merits. Luke Froeb and I opined that EU court “references to competition on the merits appear to have been a rhetorical device,” while Coppola and Nazzini similarly opined that EU courts only say “what is not competition on the merits.” Coppola and Nazzini argued that change in product design can be scrutinized in the United States, but they did not deny the point Luke Froeb and I made that “any genuine product improvement is lawful competition on the merits.” Coppola and Nazzini cited the judgment of the High Court of England and Wales in Streetmap, but Mr. Justice Roth certainly did not hold that the product improvement at issue was privileged conduct requiring no justification.
Coppola and Nazzini confirmed the prediction Luke Froeb and I made that our “characterization will be seen by many as overly simplistic,” but they have not called into question our explanation for different outcomes in single-firm conduct enforcement.

Critics allege Google bundles its ad tools in a way that rivals can’t match, and its combination of search results, YouTube, Gmail, and other services are killing competition.
The AGs, and separately the US Department of Justice (DOJ), have been investigating Google’s business practices. They are considering a lawsuit against the 22-year-old Menlo Park, California, global technology giant. If successful, it would break up Google’s ad technology business, sources told CNBC.
It’s possible the AGs could lobby for alternatives for its ad technology business, such as imposing restrictions on how it runs its business, CNBC reported. But a suit may also include both options.
Some lawyers said breaking up Google’s ad technology business could be tough because it’s not a stand-alone unit.
“Courts are very concerned that by ripping a company apart, it hurts consumers and make[s] it worse for people that don’t have the expertise to do that,” Stephen Houck, one of the government lawyers in the Microsoft antitrust case two decades ago and now a Google advisor, told CNBC.
Still, big technology companies are under scrutiny. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to crack down on the liability protections for internet companies like Google. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed, if elected, he would establish a new department within the Justice Department to reexamine mergers and those under consideration.
Google has defended itself. In a blog post last year, it argued the ad technology industry is a crowded one with competitors including Telaria, Rubicon Project, and The Trade Desk, CNBC reported.
A Google spokesperson told CNBC the company continues discussions with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and it doesn’t have any updates or comments on speculation.
“The facts are clear,” she said. “Our digital advertising products compete across a crowded industry with hundreds of rivals and technologies, and have helped lower costs for advertisers and consumers.”
A spokesperson for Paxton, who is leading the ad tech part of the probe, declined to comment to CNBC, and a spokesperson for the DOJ did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

634,"June 8, 2020",In Defense of Class Actions: A Response to Makan Delrahim’s Commentary on the UK Mastercard Case,"

By Michael D. Hausfeld, Irving Scher & Laurence T. Sorkin1
 
I. Introduction
Few would argue with the proposition that, in the antitrust context, indirect purchaser class actions raise more difficult questions of commonality, impact, and manageability than direct purchaser class actions even though there may have been harm sustained at both levels.  As a result, indirect purchaser class actions in the United States often are not certified for class treatment under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule 23”) or comparable class action rules in state courts.
This does not mean, however, that indirect purchaser class actions can or should never be certified.  Nor should they be summarily dismissed without first carefully analyzing the nature of the underlying violation, the number of levels in the distribution chain involved, the size and composition of the purported class, the particular features of the industry and products involved, and the economic models proffered by plaintiffs’ economic experts in support of class treatment.  Some cases will satisfy the requirements for class certification, and others may not, but in all cases, the decision on whether to certify a class should be made on the basis of the record developed in that case, not on the basis of preconceptions of whether some class actions are legally inappropriate.
 
II. The Division Article
In a recent article, Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General in Charge of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Division”), provided a commentary on the decision of the English Court of Appeal in the Mastercard case, which is now on appeal before the UK Supreme Court.2  While the ostensible focus of the Division’s article is on a comparison between the treatment in the U.S. and UK of  class certification issues in indirect purchaser cases, particularly as related to the UK Mastercard case, most of the article focuses on class actions generally.
Although we agree with the general overview of Rule 23 provided by the Division, we disagree with a number of specific assessments in the article, starting with the Division’s comment that the U.S. experience demonstrates that courts should be wary of class actions because they create a risk of “in terrorem” settlements, meaning that once a class is certified, defendants are under enormous pressure to settle potentially meritless claims in order to avoid the risk of an unwarranted, exorbitant judgment if they should go to trial and lose.3  This comment disregards the facts that unlike the U.S., there is no treble damage risk in the UK, and the UK has a “loser pays” rule.  Additionally, in the UK, but not in the U.S., a defendant can seek contribution from co-defendants in the event of an adverse judgment.  Moreover, many of the class actions brought in the U.S. and UK are follow-on actions, where the defendants have already pled guilty or otherwise have been found guilty of the underlying offense giving rise to the private suit.  Such follow-on class actions in particular cannot be automatically dismissed as meritless.
More specifically, we question the relevance of the Division’s comments addressed to the narrow questions before the  Court of Appeal in the Mastercard case, because unlike Rule 23, there is no requirement that common issues predominate in collective proceedings in the UK, and because unlike Rule 23 practice, where motions for class certification are not generally decided until after there has been discovery on class issues, including damage methodology, the collective proceedings order at issue in Mastercard was decided before the class representative took any discovery whatever.  In fact, the U.S. approach to discovery prior to certification has been specifically disavowed in the UK.4
Significantly, the view advanced by the Division’s discussion of potential difficulties in calculating individual damages after an aggregate award has been made5 ignores the requirement of Section 47C(2) of the Competition Act of 1998 to the contrary:  “The Tribunal may make an award of damages in collective proceedings without undertaking an assessment of the amount of damages recoverable in respect of the claim of each represented person.”6
While the views of the Division can be instructive on particular aspects of U.S. antitrust law, and unquestionably would be entitled to a measure of deference if presented to a U.S. court in an appropriate submission, it is not clear how the Division’s views on the proper application of Rule 23 would be of assistance to the UK Supreme Court in deciding the Mastercard appeal.  Certification in a collective proceeding in the UK is entirely different from certification in the U.S.   The questions before the UK Supreme Court are questions of procedure under UK law, and UK procedure does not distinguish between direct and indirect actions.  The UK court is not being asked to apply U.S. law, and from a comity perspective, even if U.S. law were implicated, a forum  generally is entitled to apply its own procedural rules—in this instance the collective action  regime established under the UK Consumer Rights Act of 2015—without regard to the law of any other jurisdiction, particularly  in the UK, unless it chooses, in its discretion, to do otherwise.
Convergence, if that is the goal of the views expressed in the Division article, makes little sense with respect to procedural rules precisely because they are procedural, reflecting the cultural and legal traditions of a particular jurisdiction, which normally is respected by other jurisdictions.  While it is true, as the Division article says, that the UK Supreme Court’s Mastercard decision “may . . . have important effects on U.S. companies like Mastercard and their opportunities to compete globally,”7 limiting remedies, including collective redress, for harms caused by the anticompetitive behavior of any company, American or not, cannot in any view be in the interests of the wider global economy, nor the societies in which such companies operate.
The UK Supreme Court might give little, if any, weight to the views expressed in the Division’s article for yet another reason. The Division does not bring class actions in the U.S. courts. Class actions are not part of its enforcement tool kit, and institutionally it has no particular experience or expertise in class action litigation.  U.S.  government enforcement actions, whether brought to enforce Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, are not brought as class actions.  In fact, most of the Division’s enforcement resources are devoted to criminal enforcement and merger actions under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.  And when the Division expresses its views in private antitrust cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, it generally does so by joining in amicus briefs filed by the Solicitor General when the views of the government are requested by the Court.
The views expressed in the Division article on the utility of the class action remedy in antitrust cases are troublesome for another reason as well.  None of the billions of dollars collected by the Division each year in antitrust fines goes to victims in the criminal antitrust cases brought by the Division.  For most victims, class actions are the only realistic remedy for obtaining justified monetary compensation for their losses.  In that regard, the Division does not generally seek restitution or any other form of collective redress for victims of antitrust violations, even when defendants have pled guilty in criminal antitrust cases and when restitution can be required under the relevant federal restitution statutes and sentencing guidelines.8   As the Division’s Antitrust Manual for its attorneys makes clear, private antitrust damages are the preferred method of providing monetary damages to victims of antitrust violations:
Restitution has not been ordered (directly or as a condition of probation) in many cases brought by the Division as the result of several factors: in many of our criminal matters, civil cases have already been filed on behalf of the victims at the time of sentencing, which potentially provide for a recovery of a multiple of actual damages (plus costs and attorneys’ fees); the complexity of antitrust cases; the resulting difficulty of determining damages; and the per se nature of antitrust criminal violations, which relieves the prosecution from having to introduce evidence of harm resulting from the violation to secure a conviction.9
In 2007 the Antitrust Modernization Commission, a bipartisan group of antitrust experts variously appointed by the President, the House and the Senate—and which included Mr. Delrahim as a Commissioner—issued its final report, in which it concluded that current private antitrust enforcement, including class actions, effectively furthered five important antitrust enforcement goals–deterrence, punishment, disgorgement of gains, compensation to victims, and incentives for private attorneys general.10  Indeed, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, the statutory right to bring such suits expresses Congress’s “belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.”10
As to damage awards, in the United States, antitrust damages need not be proved with mathematical precision in cases brought by individual plaintiffs in their own name. The courts extend individual plaintiffs latitude in proving such damages, recognizing that it would be inequitable to allow a wrongdoer to defeat recovery by insisting on an impossibly high burden of proving the amount of damages.  “The vagaries of the marketplace,” as the U.S. Supreme Court has observed,  “usually deny us sure knowledge of what a plaintiff’s situation would have been in the absence of the defendant’s violation.”12   Accordingly, U.S. courts have not established impossibly high or unduly complex damage standards in individual cases.  A different rule should not apply in class actions if a procedural framework exists for proving damages on a basis that closely, although imperfectly, approximates the loss that any individual class member may suffer.  The Division provides no convincing justification for requiring any greater burden of proof on a class and its members.
The issues raised on the Mastercard appeal are governed entirely by UK law and involve the interpretation of provisions of a collective proceeding under the Competition Act and Competition Appeal Rules of 2015 that markedly differs from Rule 23 in numerous material respects.  The UK statute has entirely different standards for certification,  including different rules on:  the showing required of the plaintiffs’ experts at the certification stage of a proceeding; determining aggregate damages in the first instance; then addressing the distribution of aggregate damage awards to individually injured members; and finally, allocating any portion of a class recovery that may remain after all identifiable injured class members have been compensated.
One of the principal differences between the UK collective proceedings rules and Federal Rule 23 in the U.S. is that there is no requirement of preponderance of common questions in a UK collective proceeding.  All that is required is that there be some common issues among the class members.13  Despite this fundamental difference, the Division article repeatedly refers to U.S. cases that rely on the predominance of common questions requirement of Rule 23.14  If anything seems clear, it is that Parliament has decided that predominance of common questions has no place in UK collective proceedings analyses.
 
III. Class Actions and Effective Civil Redress 
Regardless of jurisdiction, all class action regimes seek to balance two at times seemingly contradictory interests—the interest in providing effective redress for parties injured by antitrust violations whose claims might be too small to proceed individually (the compensatory or restitutionary interest), and the interest in protecting the legitimate interests, due process and otherwise, of defendants whose conduct gave rise to these claims. Different jurisdictions will balance these competing interests differently. Some will conclude, as the UK Parliament has apparently decided, that a top-down approach of deciding aggregate damages first, and then later considering the distribution of damages on an individual basis, is preferable to the bottom-up approach now followed by some U.S. courts, requiring formulaic proof of individual loss with mathematical exactitude.
The UK appears to have decided for public policy reasons that, if given the choice between denying any recovery to claimants with potentially small value claims because of possible imprecision in the calculation of some claimants’ individual damages, and allowing such claims to proceed beyond the certification stage, the better approach is to accept a modicum of imprecision and allow the collective action to proceed, rather than to refuse to certify the action and therefore rule out recovery altogether. Such an approach, after all, would, under appropriate rules, recover the overall damage to the market, provide compensation to actually injured victims, and by providing for the distribution of unclaimed damages, deprive wrongdoers of their ill-gotten gains from the marketwide harm they have caused.  This is particularly so in follow-on cases where there has been a guilty plea or fine or both, and liability is clear. This, of course, reinforces the deterrent effect of the sanction imposed by the government competition authority with respect to the same misconduct. From an apparent public policy point of view, there is much to commend the UK approach.
Class actions have existed in the United States for more than 100 years,15 and have been recognized as serving a number of important societal functions, as well as contributing to the efficient operation of the judiciary.  From a societal point of view, class actions permit the aggregation of claims which, often because of their comparatively small size, would not be brought as individual claims for economic reasons—the inability to find capable counsel to take on the case, or the inability to afford experts needed to provide expert testimony to support the claims.  Thus, from the perspective of compensatory justice, class actions often provide the only mechanism by which large numbers of purchasers suffering similar damages from a common wrong can realize any sort of recovery.  From the point of view of the courts, class actions provide a mechanism for bundling such claims of many in a single action, thus assuring that the courts are not overwhelmed by an avalanche of virtually identical claims, all of which might have to be needlessly adjudicated separately.
Class actions thus preserve scarce judicial resources by offering the prospect of efficient litigation, as well as the potentially early and dispositive end to litigation because of the binding effect of any judgment or settlement on all class members, including absent class members, after a class has been certified.  Indeed, from the perspective of a defendant seeking “global peace” with its customers, the class action mechanism can be a more attractive alternative than the prospect of litigating individually with all who are able to bring suits separately.
This is particularly sensible in the case of a follow-on action such as Mastercard, where guilt has already been established in an action by an antitrust enforcement authority, and the defendant should not be able to fully relitigate the legality of its conduct.  In such a case, the issue of illegality is established not by plaintiffs’ counsel in a private suit, but by independent enforcement authority prosecutors who have no economic interest in the outcome of their investigation.  In most investigations that result in guilty pleas, certainly in the United States, the enforcement agencies may lack the investigative resources to ascertain or quantify the amount of overcharge or the degree of consumer harm resulting from the violation found.  They typically recognize that defendants should be required to make restitution, and that the preferred restitutionary mechanism is a class action brought under Rule 23.  Indeed, under the antitrust laws of the majority of U.S. states, the concept of restitution applies to both direct and indirect purchasers, generally limited only by the pragmatic considerations identified by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Associated General Contractors case.16  Indeed, in EU competition decisions, consumers are advised to consider seeking restitution in matters where enforcement agencies have found violations.
 
IV. UK Collective Proceedings
Opt-out collective proceedings in the UK under the Competition Act of 1998 (as amended by the Consumer Rights Act of 2015) proceed on an opt-out basis for UK residents, but non-UK-domiciled class members may opt-in to the proceedings.  Such claims are heard before the Competition Appeal Tribunal (the “CAT”), a specialist tribunal composed of judges and so-called Ordinary Members who are expert in economics, law, business, accountancy and other related fields.
In collective proceedings in the UK,  as previously noted, the equivalent of class certification takes place early by way of an application for a collective proceeding order (“CPO”), at which point the CAT may grant a CPO only if it would be just and reasonable for the applicant to be authorized as the class representative and the claims which the applicant seeks to combine are eligible for inclusion in collective proceedings.17  The eligibility requirement is satisfied if the CAT finds that the individual claims raise the same, similar or related issues of fact or law and are suitable to be brought in collective proceedings.18  In assessing suitability, the CAT can take into account all matters it thinks fit, including whether the claims are suitable for an aggregate award of damages.19
The question as to the factors relevant to an assessment of suitability for an aggregate award were the subject matter of the Tribunal’s refusal to certify the Mastercard case in 2017 and the Court of Appeal’s subsequent remand of the case back to the CAT for a second hearing.
To date only two certification hearings have taken place before the CAT and both were refused.  Further applications for CPOs have been made but none have yet been heard as the Tribunal chose to pause all certification hearings pending the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Mastercard Case.
 
V. The Mastercard Case
The Mastercard case is an opt-out collective proceeding brought before the CAT in 2016 seeking approximately £14 billion (roughly $18 billion) on behalf of a class of 46 million UK consumers.  It is a follow-on  claim  based on a 2007 decision of the European Commission finding  that Mastercard’s multilateral interchange fees (“MIFs”) applicable to cross-border payment card transactions  violated Article 101 of the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union by restricting competition between acquiring banks and raising the price of card acceptance charged to retailers. Mastercard appealed the EU Commission decision to the General Court and ultimately to the European Court of Justice, and was unsuccessful in both appeals.
At the time that the collective action was commenced, Mastercard had also been sued in the UK courts in individual actions by some of its largest retail merchants using the reasoning in the Commission Decision to claim for UK interchange fee damages.   Mastercard notably lost the first trial resulting in a £68.6 million judgment to Sainsbury’s, the UK supermarket chain.  This was upheld in the Court of Appeal, and the case is now on appeal to the UK Supreme Court.
The collective proceeding brought against Mastercard is thus a follow-on action, where Mastercard’s liability for market-wide price fixing had been established by way of an infringement decision, and could not be relitigated again.   The proposed class representative argues that the merchants passed on Mastercard’s overcharge to their customers in the form of higher retail prices.
In July 2017, the CAT refused to grant a CPO to Walter Merricks, the proposed class representative and former financial ombudsman with a long career of public service,20 for two principal reasons:  first, the CAT found  that at the hearing Mr. Merricks had not pointed to sufficient data to facilitate the use  of the methodology proposed by his experts to determine how the overcharges may have been passed on to consumers;21 and, second, the CAT ruled that Mr. Merricks had not put forward any plausible means of calculating the losses sustained by class members on an individual basis so as to allow for the distribution of an aggregate award of damages.22
However, the Court of Appeal overturned the CAT’s ruling and remanded the case back to the CAT for a second certification hearing.  The Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that the CAT had applied too strict a test at the CPO stage, and that the class representative only had to demonstrate that the claims have a “real prospect of success.”23  In essence, the Court of Appeal held that the CAT had erroneously required too much of the proposed class representative at the certification stage.24
With regard to the calculation and distribution of an aggregate award of damages, the Court of Appeal held that there was no requirement under Section 47C(2) of the UK Competition Act
to approach the assessment of an aggregate award through the medium of a calculation of individual loss and the appellant’s experts have not attempted to do so.  In that they have the support of the Canadian authorities which in cases like Microsoft have approved a top-down method of calculation on the basis that the level of pass-on to the class as a whole will be a common issue for all individual claimants.25Insofar as the distribution of an aggregate award is concerned, the Court of Appeal saw no reason to depart from the approach employed for the purposes of calculating the award. In the Court’s view, a loss-based method of distribution is not mandated by the rules. The Court also held that distribution is not a matter for certification but rather determination following trial.26
Mastercard’s appeal of the Court of Appeal’s ruling was heard by the Supreme Court in May of this year, and the Supreme Court’s ruling will set the standard as to the test to be applied by the CAT at the certification stage in the Mastercard case and in the further collective cases which will proceed to certification hearings.  If the Mastercard case is remanded to the CAT, then it may be certified and permitted to continue to trial.  Alternatively, the CAT could refuse to certify the action for a second time, or may certify only part of the proposed class.  If the claim is permitted to continue to trial, it can be expected that factual discovery will be taken from Mastercard and third parties, including retailers, in order to develop data relevant to damages.
Courts should be cognizant of the difficulties that claimants in competition cases face in attempting to determine what a price would have been in a hypothetical world “but for” a competition infringement.  As the European Commission noted in its damages guidance document to national courts: “Quantification of harm in competition cases has always, by its very nature, been characterized by considerable limits to the degree of certainty and precision that can be expected.  Sometimes only approximate estimates are possible.”27
If a CPO is granted, Mastercard will then have had a full and fair opportunity to present evidence of its own, cross-examine plaintiffs’ experts, and dispute the aggregate amount claimed on behalf of the class.  But once questions of overcharge and pass-on are determined, and the value of an aggregate award of damages determined by the CAT, it seems both reasonable and appropriate  for the CAT  at that point to determine to whom and in what amounts damages should be allocated and distributed to individual class members.28
 
VI. Conclusion
In providing its views of U.S. class action law, the Division’s commentary exalts damage analysis above the importance of recovery for misconduct, and allows economic opinions to control class certification determinations that are fundamentally legal in nature.   The Division’s approach fails to acknowledge any of the interests served by meaningful collective redress in competition cases.
Price fixing involves serious harm to the market. It is not directed at any specific victim, but rather to the price setting function of the market as a whole. While the unlawful conduct may cause different magnitudes of injury throughout the chain of distribution, those differences do not alter the fact of the aggregate impact on the market.  Indeed, the 2014 European Commission’s Damages Directive
provides that courts should adopt a rebuttable presumption of injurious impact on the market following a Commission determination of unlawful price fixing.29
The Mastercard case presents the UK Supreme Court with the opportunity, early in the life of the UK’s young collective proceedings regime, to ensure that the test for proposed class actions is set at an appropriate level.  That level ought to be one which takes into account the complexities of calculating loss in competition law claims and the unequal position of class representative and defendant from an evidentiary point of view.  It ought also be one that does not prove unduly burdensome for would-be representatives such that valid claims fail, rights to compensation are not vindicated, and the proceeds of anticompetitive conduct remain with the wrongdoer.
It is certainly within the province of the UK courts to choose an approach that fulfills the purpose of the enabling act—ensuring that there is an effective means of consumer access to compensation, collectively and individually, for violations of the UK competition laws.

By Zoë Hitzig (Harvard),Michelle Meagher(University College London), Andre Veiga (Imperial College London) & E. Glen Weyl(Microsoft)
The original motivations of antitrust suggest an alternative remedy for market power: changes to corporate governance to include stakeholders who are subject to this power. In contrast to structural and behavioral remedies, “stakeholder remedies,” as we call them, have several desirable features. Stakeholder remedies allow corporations to harness benefits of scale while blocking their ability to exploit market power and avoiding cumbersome direct regulation by nation states. Thus, such remedies have the potential to resolve the key tensions in existing competition policy, and could stimulate a new inclusive democratic paradigm for corporate governance.

US federal and state authorities are asking detailed questions about how to limit Google’s power in the online search market as part of their antitrust investigations into the tech giant, according to rival DuckDuckGo Inc.
Bloomberg reported that Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive officer of the privacy-focused search engine, has spoken with state regulators, and talked with the US Justice Department as recently as a few weeks ago.
Justice Department officials and state attorneys general asked the CEO about requiring Google to give consumers alternatives to its search engine on Android devices and in Google’s Chrome web browser, Weinberg said in an interview.“We’ve been talking to all of them about search and all of them have asked us detailed search questions,” he added.Weinberg’s comments shine a light into how the inquiry is examining Google’s core business — online search. 
Bloomberg has reported that the Justice Department and Texas are already examining Google’s dominance of the digital advertising market. The Justice Department and a coalition of states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton have been investigating the company for a year, and the DOJ has begun drafting a lawsuit, which could be filed in the coming months. It would kick off one of the most significant antitrust cases in the U.S. since the government sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.
The investigations have been wide-ranging and are looking into various parts of Google’s business. States including Utah and Iowa are focusing on search, according to people familiar with the matter. Texas is looking at the digital ad market and related technology.

637,"May 28, 2020","Google, Amazon And Other Big Tech Making M&A Deals Amid Pandemic","


Giant tech companies are seeking deals at their fastest pace in years, fueled by COVID-19 despite an increase in scrutiny by regulators.
The Financial Times reported Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have made 19 deals so far this year, according to Refinitiv, the London-based global provider of financial market data. This represents the fastest pace of acquisitions and strategic investments since 2015.
On Wednesday, May 27, PYMNTS reported Amazon is negotiating to purchase the California self-driving car company Zoox. Two years ago it was valued at US$3.2 billion, FT reported. 
Last month, Facebook closed a US$5.7 billion deal for a minority stake in Indian telecom startup Reliance Jio, giving the social media giant a larger foothold in the region.
These coronavirus pandemic deals represent a different world compared to the 2001 recession and the financial crisis of 2008, when tech companies stayed on the sidelines as the stock market tumbled, the news service reported.
“One big difference between now and the last financial crisis is the cash balances of the tech majors are in the hundreds of billions, all effectively onshore, due to the Trump tax changes,” John Gnuse, a tech M&A adviser at Lazard Asset Management, a New York financial advisory firm that engages in investment banking, told FT.
These deals also solidify the tech giants’ deep pockets amid the COVID-19 crisis, as they seek to take advantage of their record valuations and become the dominant players in emerging sectors, FT reported.
The transactions come as some lawmakers have called for more scrutiny and a pause on mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
Late last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts) and US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrat – New York) proposed legislation to halt harmful mergers, that they say will protect Americans from further consolidation and concentration during the COVID-19 crisis. 
The lawmakers introduced the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act. If approved, the measure would curb M&As during the pandemic by companies with more than US$100 million in revenues.
“This crisis threatens to further entrench the power of Big Tech,” Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington, DC, think-tank, told the news service. “These companies are already extraordinarily powerful, but they’re well-positioned to emerge as the biggest winners of COVID-19 unless some legislative action is taken.”

638,"May 26, 2020","“Killer Acquisitions,” Big Tech, and Section 2: A Solution in Search of a Problem","
Since the term “killer acquisition” was coined last year, many have moved quickly to declaring a killer-acquisition problem in tech and proposing Section 2 of the Sherman Act as a solution.  In this article, we urge caution before extending conclusions about killer acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry to an entirely different industry where product development is less regimented and innovation is more opaque.  And we argue that the benefits of Section 2 as a merger enforcement tool are overstated and the added complications, significant.

I. INTRODUCTION
“Killer Acquisition.” It’s an evocative term, particularly for such a technocratic field as antitrust law. Perhaps because it is so evocative, the term sometimes has been stretched well beyond its original meaning to refer to “acquisitions I think are anticompetitive.” But the term “killer acquisition” was originally coined by Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer, and Song Ma to describe something quite specific: an acquisition – in the pharmaceutical industry in the Cunningham study – in which an incumbent acquires an innovative company that is developing a competing product and shuts down that product development.2
Cunningham and her colleagues estimate that 6 percent of all acquisitions in the U.S. pharmaceutical sector (or 45 of acquisitions each year) are “killer acquisitions.”3 Their study gives rise to the obvious question wheth...

639,"May 26, 2020",“How Tech Rolls”: Potential Competition and “Reverse” Killer Acquisitions,"
Competition agencies are pivoting towards “loss of potential competition” theories of harm, especially in acquisitions by highly dominant companies of smaller/nascent players offering a product or functionality in related spaces. The concern is broader than implied by the recent debate on “killer acquisitions.” Many say “What’s not to like?” We argue that it’s time to be more cautious. Large platforms have exceptional abilities to enter new spaces but also to “roll up” (willing) startups, buying instead of putting their own effort into rival innovation. Foregoing such effort is rarely good for society. We call these “buy vs. build” cases a form of “reverse” killer acquisitions that allow the incumbent to do away with its own innovation effort. Can we trade off the benefits of integration against this potential loss of organic expansion or should we adopt simplified policy rules to minimize the type of error we think matters most, requiring economists to pursue productive analyses of integration efficiencies, rather than the normal advocacy?

640,"May 26, 2020",Beyond Killer Acquisitions: Are There More Common Potential Competition Issues in Tech Deals and How Can These Be Assessed?,"
How common are killer acquisitions in tech and are there alternative theories of harm that are likely to arise more frequently? We apply a set of filters to 409 acquisitions by the “GAFA” between 2009 and 2020 to identify transactions where the target firm could have plausibly threatened the acquirer’s “core” business and the valuation was large enough to plausibly mask a market power premium. We find that at most 14 percent of reviewed transactions pass these filters and conclude that killer acquisitions, while important when they arise, are likely rare. Further analysis suggests that the theory of harm with broader application is that the purchaser would, but for the transaction, enter the same space as the target organically, flipping the traditional “killer” acquisition narrative on its head. We discuss key questions and trade-offs which arise in such transactions and the extent to which they require a change in the standard of proof applied in merger investigations.

641,"May 26, 2020",Remember Stacker? Another Look at “Killer” Acquisitions in the Digital Economy,"
Many acquisitions of startups by incumbents in the digital economy have resulted in a significant boost to marketplace recognition and interest in innovative, but frequently unknown and resource-constrained companies. However, some have argued that these acquisitions, far from accelerating the pace of innovation and the quality of products available to consumers, are instead “killer acquisitions” made to eliminate potential competitors. Whether these acquisitions enhance or prevent competitive innovation is a question often raised, despite the fact that they rarely result in the disappearance of the innovative products. The difficulty of this question is heightened in the digital space. In this article, we use an economic framework and two illustrative examples of acquisitions in the digital space to examine these issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1990, a small software corporation, Stac Electronics, released a drive compression software called Stacker that doubled PC hard drives’ volume. At that time, hard drives had limited capacity and were expensive. Unsurprisingly, the drive compression software was hugely successful. In 1993, Microsoft released version 6.0 of its flagship operating system, MS-DOS, which included its own compression software. This led to a long legal battle between Microsoft and Stac Electronics, at the end of which Microsoft had to remove its drive compression feature from MS-DOS ...

I. INTRODUCTION
Killer acquisitions have come under the eye of the entire antitrust community. The topic has been very much in vogue at conferences2 and in the wide range of expert panel reports on competition law and digitization produced by antitrust authorities and academic institutions around the world.3 However, the issue has not always been approached in a systematic way, and there is still no emerging consensus.4 Therefore, this paper sets out a general framework to evaluate killer acquisitions by tying together the various strands in the existing literature. Section II makes some conceptual clarifications. Section III outlines possible ex ante and ex post mechanisms for capturing killer acquisitions. Section IV advocates for a set of criteria for their substantive analysis.

643,"May 25, 2020",Challenging Consummated Mergers Under Section 2,"

By Douglas H. Ginsburg & Koren W. Wong-Ervin*
 
In the last year, officials at the U.S. Antitrust Agencies have taken a number of troubling positions with respect to what is required to challenge consummated mergers under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. These include: (1) the contention that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 of the Clayton Act in that Section 2 requires mere proof that the merger was “reasonably capable of” contributing significantly to the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power;1 (2) suggestions that evidence of intent may be used as a proxy for probable harm;2 and (3) the idea that Section 2 can be used to challenge a series of acquisitions no one of which by itself was problematic but which together form an anticompetitive course of conduct.3 In this Article we explain why these contentions are unfounded.
  
Section 2 as a “Lower Bar” Than Section 7
In the Fall of 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the first time took the position that Section 2 imposes a “somewhat relaxed causation requirement (as compared to the causation requirements imposed under Section 1 of the Sherman Act or Section 7 of the Clayton Act).”4 Earlier that year, Bruce Hoffman, then Director of the Bureau of Competition, had claimed that, under the D.C. Circuit’s Microsoft decision, Section 2
doesn’t turn on the actual effects in the specific case at issue. It’s a matter of general tendency: the kind of effects that can broadly be expected from conduct of this kind across the great run of cases. Second, even through this lens of generalization, a plaintiff need not show but-for causation of the monopoly. What matters is that conduct is reasonably capable (in general) of making a significant contribution to monopoly: that is, that it would tend to make the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power more likely, or more durable, or more substantial, by some meaningful amount. That is enough.5
These contentions are flawed for four reasons.
First, the assertion that Section 2 does not require proof of anticompetitive effects is based upon a misreading of the D.C. Circuit’s decision in United States v. Microsoft.6 The assertion conflates the Microsoft court’s standard for proving competitive effects with its standard for establishing causation. The claim ignores the court’s explicit statement that “the plaintiff, on whom the burden of proof of course rests . . . must demonstrate that the monopolist’s conduct indeed has the requisite anticompetitive effect.”7 The court went on to devote fully 20 pages to a careful analysis of the actual effects of each type of Microsoft’s allegedly anticompetitive conduct.8 Only after finding that each type of conduct indeed had an anticompetitive effect did the court turn to the separate and distinct question of causation: Was there a causal link between Microsoft’s anticompetitive conduct and the alleged maintenance of its operating system monopoly? It was in addressing this question that the court said it was appropriate, in a government enforcement action, to “infer causation when exclusionary conduct is aimed at producers of nascent competitive technologies as well as when it is aimed at producers of established substitutes.”9 Of critical importance is that the court’s causation standard was conditioned on its having found anticompetitive effects.
There is some debate over what the court meant by anticompetitive effects. In his 2019 speech, Hoffman acknowledged that, in addition to monopoly power, “Section 2 also requires anticompetitive conduct—often referred to as ‘exclusionary,’ ‘anticompetitive’ or ‘predatory’ conduct, or, as it’s sometimes known, conduct that isn’t ‘competition on the merits.’”10
Hoffman’s contention that Microsoft does not require actual effects appears to be based upon his conclusion that what the court described as the “requisite anticompetitive effects” analysis really amounted to a determination of whether the conduct was exclusionary in that it was likely to harm competition. But this ignores the court’s findings that, as a matter of fact, most of the alleged conduct resulted in substantial foreclosure, thereby “keeping rival browsers from gaining the critical mass of users necessary to attract developer attention away from Windows as the platform for software development.”11 The court found that Microsoft’s conduct “help[ed] keep usage of Navigator below the critical level necessary for Navigator or any other rival to pose a real threat to Microsoft’s monopoly.”12 The court inferred harm to the competitive process from these findings, in essence recognizing that minimum-efficient scale is the mechanism by which exclusionary conduct harms competition.13 For other conduct, Microsoft “acknowledged” the anticompetitive effects, arguing only that there were offsetting procompetitive justifications, an argument rejected by the court.14 No quantification or other assessment of the magnitude of that harm was necessary given Microsoft’s lack of cognizable business justifications. Therefore, there was no need to balance anticompetitive effects against procompetitive effects to determine the net effect of the conduct.
Second, even as a pure causation standard (which we have shown is not a substitute for Microsoft’s anticompetitive effects standard), it is important to understand the limited applicability of the “reasonably capable of” standard. The court fully explicated its reasoning on causation in the course of rejecting Microsoft’s argument that, “as to § 2 liability in an equitable enforcement action, plaintiffs must present direct proof that a defendant’s continued monopoly power is precisely attributable to its anticompetitive conduct”15 The court pointed out that “neither plaintiffs nor the court can confidently reconstruct a product’s hypothetical technological development in a world absent the defendant’s exclusionary conduct.”16 Given this “underlying proof problem,”17 the Court may infer causation. “To some degree, ‘the defendant is made to suffer the uncertain consequences of its own undesirable conduct,’”18 i.e., the practices that had been shown to have had anticompetitive effects. In these carefully limited circumstances, the questions were “(1) whether as a general matter the exclusion of nascent threats is the type of conduct that is reasonably capable of contributing significantly to a defendant’s continued monopoly power and (2) whether Java and Navigator reasonably constituted nascent threats at the time Microsoft engaged in the anticompetitive conduct at issue.”19
In Rambus v. FTC—a Section 2 case the D.C. Circuit decided after Microsoft—the court held that the agency failed to prove that “but-for” the defendant’s conduct, there would have been harm to the competitive process.20 As in Microsoft, the “but-for” world in Rambus was highly uncertain. In both cases, one could reasonably find the defendant’s conduct may have caused the defendant to acquire or maintain its monopoly power. At the same time, it was also possible that the defendants in those cases would have acquired or maintained their monopoly power even absent their anticompetitive behavior. The court in Rambus held the government must bear the burden of that uncertainty. This burden applies in all Section 2 cases, whether the allegations involve conduct or acquisitions.
As former FTC Chairman Tim Muris and former FTC General Counsel John Nuechterlein explain, the Microsoft court’s more lenient “reasonably capable” standard applies by its terms only to exclusionary conduct lacking any procompetitive justification—and, therefore, not to the typical merger, particularly if it was reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice (“DoJ”) or the FTC itself before consummation.21 Recall that Microsoft was a case of attempted monopoly maintenance involving allegations that the company had engaged in several types of exclusionary conduct with no efficiency justifications solely in order to suppress nascent technological threats to its Windows operating system monopoly.22 Reading Microsoft and Rambus together, the key takeaway is that only when anticompetitive effects are shown (as required by Microsoft and Rambus) does the “reasonably capable of” causation standard apply to allegations that exclusionary conduct killed a nascent threat. Only when these conditions are met may the government avoid having to show that the threat would have become a real competitor but for the alleged exclusionary conduct. 2
Without requiring proof of but-for causation, there is great risk of erroneously condemning acquisitions that may be procompetitive. Consider, for example, Herbert Hovenkamp’s proposal presumptively to condemn acquisitions by a monopolist of “any firm that has the economic capabilities for entry and is a more-than-fanciful possible entrant, unless the acquired firm is no different from many other firms in these respects.”24 “More-than-fanciful” is an invitation to speculate, not a standard of proof.
Third, the contention that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 ignores the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown Shoe v. United States, in which the court held that “the tests for measuring the legality of any particular economic arrangement under the Clayton Act are to be less stringent than those used in applying the Sherman Act.”25 The Court explained that the Clayton Act was enacted to lower the burdens in merger cases, quoting the Senate Report on the original Act: “The intent here . . . is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency, and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act proceeding.”26
Fourth, in a consummated merger setting, the focus naturally should be on the real-world evidence of what happened in the market following the acquisition (e.g., effects on price, output, and innovation). Such real-world evidence was relied upon by the DoJ in its 2008 complaint against Microsemi Corporation, a case in which the government alleged that, post-acquisition, Microsemi significantly raised prices.27 In contrast, evidence that post-merger prices decreased or output expanded would suggest a procompetitive outcome. As former FTC economist John Yun stated in his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony: “To treat the success and associated exponential output expansion of an acquired product as evidence of an anticompetitive acquisition severely twists the meaning of ‘anticompetitive.’ When properly formulated, the central forces driving anticompetitive conduct are reductions in output, quality, innovation, and transfers away from consumers to producers.”28 While one could argue that the but-for world without the acquisition would have exhibited even lower prices or greater output, the burden would be on the challenger to make that showing. In other words, the plaintiff would need to prove that the but-for world absent the merger would likely be more competitive than the actual world with the merger.
In addition, it seems the DoJ and the FTC want to combine the causation standard of Microsoft and the efficiency standard of Section 7. In contrast to Section 2 cases, in which procompetitive or legitimate business justifications, as in Microsoft itself,29 may defeat liability,30 efficiencies have rarely been credited in Section 7 cases.31
  
Intent Evidence as a Proxy for Probable Harm
In a 2019 speech, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Wilder proposed Section 2 as a “solution” to the difficulties of bringing nascent and potential competition cases under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.32 Wilder suggested the presence of network effects, along with substantial barriers to entry, “could be useful in proving such a case.”33 Wilder went on to say that when evaluating a firm’s acquisition or series of acquisitions, strategic documents “may well suffice to show a specific intent to monopolize and block future entry.”34
The FTC has arguably gone further, suggesting in its 2017 complaint against Mallinckrodt that intent can serve as a substitute for probable harm.35 In that case, the FTC’s only allegation of an anticompetitive effect was that, but for Mallinckrodt’s acquisition of a drug, another bidder would have acquired the license and developed a competing drug. The remainder of the complaint involved allegations of anticompetitive intent, including that the company viewed its target as a “possible future competitor” and “feared that if another company were to acquire [the target] . . . it could decimate its business.”36 The claim is, in other words, that unlike Section 7, Section 2 makes it unnecessary for the plaintiff to show that a consummated merger actually created monopoly power—i.e., enabled the company to raise prices or reduce quantity—and instead permits a court to rely upon evidence of anticompetitive intent.
Relying solely upon evidence of intent is inconsistent with Section 2, which requires proof that the merger had anticompetitive effects. Indeed, more than 30 years of case law makes clear that “[a]nticompetitive intent alone, no matter how virulent, is insufficient to give rise to an antitrust violation,”37 and that “[a]nimosity, even if rephrased as ‘anticompetitive intent[,]’ is not illegal without anticompetitive effects.”38
This is not to say evidence that the acquirer viewed its target as a viable threat is wholly irrelevant. Evidence to that effect could be combined with other evidence to show the only plausible explanation for an acquisition was the suppression of potential competition. “Such an acquisition might well fall within the scope of the Microsoft standard for purely ‘undesirable’ conduct. But such cases would be very rare and are unlikely to involve mergers that were subject to and survived HSR scrutiny.”39 Of course, the government would still have to prove the merger had actual anticompetitive effects for, as the Supreme Court has held, plaintiffs “must allege and prove harm . . . to the competitive process, i.e., to competition itself.”40
In backward-looking cases there will be post-merger facts and data from which to determine what actually happened in the marketplace. For example, “post-merger market statistics may indicate what the actual situation was at the time of merger, and post-acquisition evidence might show that anticompetitive threats that seemed probable at merger time were not, in fact, probable.”41 Indeed, it may well be that nascent or potential competitors engage in strategic behavior to make themselves look like actual or potential competitors in order to make themselves attractive as acquisition targets. But when their intentions and incentives are tested, it may become clear that they lacked the ability to mature into truly viable competitors.
 
Course of Conduct Theories
DoJ and FTC officials have also taken the position that Section 2 may be used to overcome the difficulties of challenging serial acquisitions involving targets with market shares of as little as 5-10% and acquisitions by platform companies of start-ups operating outside their core market.42 Wilder explained that the DoJ “is concerned about acquisitions of nascent competitors in platform industries because these markets are prone to tipping, and with tipping comes the potential for durable market power and substantial barriers to entry.”43 He went on to say that using Section 2 to challenge acquisitions in platform markets is a possible “solution” because it would allow the government to “put greater emphasis on a pattern of conduct.”44
A focus on a course of conduct essentially amounts to a “monopoly broth” theory, which, as Professor Daniel Crane has explained, “is susceptible to misuse, particularly if applied to species of conduct whose legality depends on a developed conduct-specific test.”45 More specifically, “[i]n such cases, the prima facie legality of the conduct should be determined on a practice-by-practice basis. Any conduct that does not meet the relevant conduct-specific test should not be allowed to count toward liability or any other issue. In particular, plaintiffs should not be allowed to invoke ‘monopoly broth’ rhetoric in order to defeat established legal tests applicable to different kinds of conduct.”46 In other words, while the aggregation principle may correctly be applied to a series of exclusive-dealing arrangements that in combination resulted in foreclosure, it should not be used when the allegations involve disparate types of conduct. Disparate allegations, such as refusals to deal and predatory pricing or separate and distinct acquisitions, will each have its own conduct-specific test.
A number of circuits have rejected the argument that disparate types of conduct, none of which is anticompetitive by itself, can be combined to create antitrust liability. For example, the Fifth Circuit in Retractable Technologies. v. Dickinson held that “[e]ach of the[] theories must be separately analyzed in light of settled principles of antitrust law.”47 Similarly, the Second Circuit in City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power held that, “[e]ven though many of the issues the [plaintiffs] raise are interrelated and interdependent, however, we must . . . analyze the various issues individually.”48 The Federal Circuit in Intergraph v. Intel adopted the Second Circuit’s approach, stating: “we reject the notion that if there is a fraction of validity to each of the basic claims and the sum of the fractions is one or more, the plaintiffs have proved a violation of section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act.”49
And, it is not as if the Agencies are wholly without recourse for dealing with a series of acquisitions; they can challenge the last deal in the series that “tipped” the market to monopoly.
  
Conclusion
To rely upon the causation standard in Microsoft for the proposition that the government in Section 2 cases is absolved of its obligation to prove that a merger resulted in actual anticompetitive effects is to ignore both the explicit wording and the factual context of that decision. Similarly, to claim that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 ignores both the historical relationship between the Clayton and Sherman Acts and the more defense-friendly efficiency standard of Section 2.
Going even further to suggest that evidence of intent is a substitute for evidence of effect, i.e., of actual harm to competition, ignores over 30 years of case law making clear that antitrust is concerned about the actual effects of a merger (or other conduct) in the relevant market. Relying upon intent evidence is particularly problematic in a challenge to a consummated merger because the government should be able to produce actual evidence of what happened in the market; there is no reason to speculate about what could have been possible.
Lastly, relying upon a course of conduct theory to say that two innocuous mergers add to one problematic merger is, at best, a misuse of the theory in that it would apply it to disparate conduct as opposed to conduct such a series of exclusive dealing arrangements. A proper enforcement action would seek to block—or, if consummated, to undo—the last merger in the series that tipped the market into undue monopoly power.

23 During a May 19, 2020 panel discussion, Ian Conner, the Director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, relied upon two cases—Realcomp v. FTC and McWayne v. FTC—as support for the propositions that the government need not prove actual effects in a Section 2 consummated merger case, and that post-Rambus cases have not relied upon the but-for causation standard. Realcomp, however, is a Section 1, not a Section 2, case. In McWayne, the court concluded that substantial evidence supported the government’s allegations of actual anticompetitive effects and the defendant failed to put forth any legitimate business justifications. As such, McWayne falls within the narrow exception created in Microsoft for the application of the “reasonably capable” standard. Realcomp II, Ltd. v. F.T.C., 635 F.3d 815, 836, 834 (2011); McWane, Inc. v. F.T.C., 783 F.3d 814, 835, 841 (2015).

644,"May 11, 2020",Potential and Nascent Competition in FTC Merger Enforcement in Health Care Markets,"
Continuing calls for more vigorous enforcement against mergers and acquisitions by digital technology platforms increasingly focus on deals involving potential and nascent competitors.  The FTC has been applying future competition theories in the healthcare sector for years, including litigating the government’s first merger challenge on actual potential competition grounds since the mid-80s. It also challenged mergers under Section 2 “nascent competition” theories, a close cousin of an actual potential competition, in two recent matters. This paper examines Agency’s experience in these cases, highlights some of the differences between the two approaches, and suggests how the FTC may apply this thinking in other contexts, including acquisitions by technology platforms.

I. INTRODUCTION
Popular interest in antitrust has been growing significantly in recent years, fueled in large part by a concern about what (if anything) can or should be done about “big tech.” Critics argue that these companies owe their dominance, at least in part, to “hundreds of mergers,” most of which involve what they term “nascent competitors.”2 While acquisitions of future competitors are gaining attention in the technology sector, the FTC has been scrutinizing these types of deals in the healthcare sector for years. Experience with the FTC’s approach to these transactions may provide a roadmap to how the agency may evaluate transactions in othe...

645,"May 11, 2020",Rethinking Pharmaceutical Product Reformulations,"
This piece discusses pharmaceutical product reformulations and product hopping strategies, along with the impact that antitrust scrutiny may have on innovation incentives. The main thesis presented is that for the sake of preserving innovation incentives, antitrust analysis should not focus on whether the innovation examined is deemed as an “incremental” one according to antitrust enforcers; on the contrary, the overall economic and strategic context of the product reformulation should play the central role in the case-by-case antitrust analysis.

By Amalia Athanasiadou1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Product reformulations are not per se problematic from an antitrust perspective. Introducing a new reformulated version of a pre-existing drug is not in itself anticompetitive. Brand-name manufacturers may legitimately design their product life-cycle management strategies and have serious economic and strategic incentives for focusing on pharmaceutical products which have already been successful in the treatment of patients. Knowing how risky, costly, time-consuming and uncertain an endeavor pharmaceutical R&D is, it is not surprising that brand-name manufacturers invest resources in developing further versions of successful products and in expanding existing technology and know-how.
The main thesis of this piece is that in order to preserve innovation incentives for pharmaceutical companies, such product reformulations should be examined by antitrust enforcers irrespectiv...

646,"May 5, 2020",Merricks v. Mastercard: “Passing on” the U.S. Experience,"

By Makan Delrahim (Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice)1
 
 I. Introduction
The mission of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice is to promote and protect competition in the American economy. As mergers, collusive agreements, and exclusionary conduct cross national borders, the Antitrust Division must keep an increasingly close eye on developments in competition law around the world in order fully to discharge its responsibilities. Economic globalization has also led us to work more closely with other competition agencies and to deal more frequently with the competition-law regimes of other nations.
The importance of dialogue with other competition agencies and our shared interest in the appropriate enforcement of competition laws has led the Antitrust Division to engage internationally to promote cooperation and convergence in the development of competition law. We work bilaterally with our counterparts around the world and through multilateral organizations such as the Competition Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) and the International Competition Network (“ICN”) to facilitate international discussions of important issues common to competition law enforcement. Over the past few years, in addition to cooperating with our international counterparts on many of the cases, we have participated in an international effort to further common understandings on a variety of substantive issues, including competition analysis in digital industries, leniency programs, algorithms and collusion, and a number of questions associated with merger analysis and remedy selection. Our engagement with foreign competition law is not limited to substantive law, however; procedural devices are paramount to how competition-law regimes are implemented. For example, we are proud to be the impetus for the 2019 Framework on Competition Agency Procedures (“CAP”), designed to strengthen and promote due process in competition law proceedings globally. Participants commit to a set of substantive due process principles and, though not legally binding, CAP includes accountability and review mechanisms to ensure meaningful compliance.
Of course, developments in competition law, both substantive and procedural, can be driven as much by courts as by competition agencies, particularly in countries that allow for private antitrust enforcement in the form of class actions. A court’s decision on class certification can, for example, determine as a practical matter whether certain competition-law claims proceed at all.
The upcoming decision of the UK Supreme Court in Merricks v. Mastercard is of interest to competition enforcers around the world for this reason. The case involves novel questions on the proper approach to certification of an opt-out collective action — akin to a class action in the United States — brought by indirect purchasers. Whether the UK Supreme Court properly aligns the incentives for these new private collective-action proceedings2 can affect consumers everywhere; its decision may also have important effects on U.S. companies like Mastercard and their opportunities to compete globally.
The two central issues before the UK Supreme Court in Merricks are:
(a) The “legal test for certification” of a collective proceeding by indirect purchasers, including what the class representative is required to show to offer “a realistic prospect of establishing loss on a class-wide basis,” and
(b) The “approach to distribution” of damages among individual purchasers, including whether it was premature for the Competition Appeal Tribunal to consider distribution of damages.
This Essay aims to share the United States’ experiences confronting similar questions. The use of comparative material, which contextualizes experiences within each legal system, is not itself novel.3 Targeted insights from U.S. courts deciding whether to certify indirect purchasers, however, are not readily gleaned from existing commentary or scholarship. We therefore hope this Essay will be informative for the international antitrust community and the UK Supreme Court.
The Essay begins with a brief description of the procedural history of Merricks and acknowledges key differences between the U.S. and UK legal regimes. It then explores how U.S courts consider class-certification questions in cases brought by indirect purchasers, organized to mirror the two questions before the UK Supreme Court in Merricks: Part V discusses the standard of proof and Part VI the distribution of damages.
As described below, U.S. courts subject proposed methodologies to estimate pass-on proffered by indirect-purchaser plaintiffs to a “rigorous analysis” at the class-certification stage, which often requires some consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs’ underlying claims. After the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding in Comcast v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27 (2013), some courts have engaged even more closely with the plaintiffs’ proposed expert methodologies, rejecting class certification if the plaintiffs cannot show they can offer common evidence that the defendant’s alleged anticompetitive conduct caused loss to all or almost all putative class members. Of relevance to the issues in Merricks, U.S. courts sometimes cite the unmanageability of determining and distributing individual damages as a reason to deny class certification, especially in cases involving a lack of reliable data and other complexities.
In making determinations on the standard of proof, U.S. courts recognize that improperly low standards for class certification create a “risk of ‘in terrorem’ settlements,” that is, settlements agreed to in order to avoid the “small chance of a devastating loss” from potentially large aggregated damages rather than due to the likelihood that plaintiffs will succeed in establishing liability. See AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 (2011).
  
II. The Proceedings in Merricks
In 2016, Mr. Walter Hugh Merricks CBE applied before the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring collective proceedings against Mastercard on behalf of 46 million consumers. He alleged Mastercard’s decision prior to 2008 to set an interchange fee applicable to cross-border payments — which the European Commission held in 2007 to be a violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union — caused merchants to pay higher fees to acquirers, i.e. banks or financial institutions that provide payment services to merchants. This overcharge, Mr. Merricks contends, was subsequently passed on by merchants to the consumers comprising the putative class.
The Tribunal rejected Mr. Merricks’ application after a hearing in July 2017. It held his claims were unsuitable to be brought in collective proceedings as two issues were not common: (1) the degree of pass-through from merchants to claimants and (2) the amount each claimant spent at each merchant.4 The Tribunal also found there was no “plausible way” to distribute damages to each individual in a way that estimates the loss s/he suffered.5 In reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal emphasized that although in theory “calculation of global loss through a weighted average pass-through … is methodologically sound,” applying that methodology “across virtually the entire UK retail sector over a period of 16 years is a hugely complex exercise requiring access to a wide range of data.”6  The Tribunal was unpersuaded that such data were available.7
Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had “demanded too much” from Mr. Merricks to show pass-on at the certification stage, and that the Tribunal’s decision to consider a proposed method of distribution was “both premature and wrong.”8 The Court of Appeal expressed  it was not necessary at th[is] stage for the proposed representative to be able to produce all of that evidence [for assessing the level of pass-on to the represented class], still less to enter into a detailed debate about its probative value.”9  In the Court of Appeal’s view, the proposed methodology needs only be “capable of or [offer] a realistic prospect of establishing loss to the class as a whole.”10  The Court of Appeal then remitted the application in April 2019 to the Tribunal for reconsideration.
In July 2019, the UK Supreme Court granted Mastercard permission to appeal the Court of Appeal’s judgment.
 
III. Comparative Study of Procedures in the UK and the U.S.
As a threshold matter, we acknowledge the legal systems of the U.S. and the UK have both similarities and differences, including as regards their procedures for class actions. Recognizing parallels and material distinctions between the two systems provides a broader context for the often fact-specific cases and may render the analogy between class-certification law in the U.S. and in the UK more illuminating. For example, plaintiffs in the U.S. can seek discovery prior to the class-certification stage, which can inform the court’s analysis of whether a case is appropriate for class proceedings that would bind all putative plaintiffs at future stages of litigation, including summary judgment and trial.
The substantive law on whether indirect purchasers can sue for damages in antitrust suits differs as well. Unlike UK competition law, U.S. federal antitrust law generally does not permit recovery by indirect purchasers, following the Supreme Court’s decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977). Numerous U.S. states, however, have declined to follow Illinois Brick through legislation and by common law. Approximately two-thirds of U.S. states and the District of Columbia currently permit the use of pass-on analysis to apportion damages in federal or state courts based on violations of state antitrust law.11
An indirect purchaser suing under state antitrust law nonetheless may face certain hurdles: Several courts have held the indirect purchasers in the cases before them lacked “antitrust standing” to sue because their injury was too derivative or remote under the multifactor test from Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31 (1983). The AGC factors include: “(1) whether the plaintiff is a consumer or competitor in the allegedly restrained market; (2) whether the injury alleged is a direct, firsthand impact of the restraint alleged; (3) whether there are more directly injured appellants with motivation to sue; (4) whether the damages claims are speculative; and (5) whether the plaintiff’s claims risk duplicative recoveries and would require a complex apportionment of damages.”12  Based on these concerns, courts have dismissed state-law antitrust claims involving tying of credit card and debit card services at the “motion to dismiss” stage — comparable to a strike-out in the UK — before the cases even reach the class-certification stage.13
  
IV. Legal Standards for Class Certification in the United States 
The first issue before the UK Supreme Court in Merricks is what legal standard a court should apply in certifying a collective proceeding by indirect purchasers. The Court of Appeal held the Tribunal applied an unduly stringent test in evaluating the evidence and expert methodology before it; in the Court of Appeal’s view, Mr. Merricks needs only demonstrate “a real prospect of success” at the certification stage.14
Within the United States, courts evaluate questions on the standards for class certification by looking to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the corresponding state rule. These rules set forth criteria to determine when the class-action device is appropriate, and a party seeking to bring a class action “‘must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance’ with [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 23.”15
Under Rule 23, a court cannot certify a class action unless it finds the plaintiffs have satisfied the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a) — often referred to as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation — as well as one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Of relevance here, Rule 23(b)(3) provides that in suits for damages actions, class certification is appropriate only if “the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members …”  Certification of indirect-purchaser classes often turns on this “predominance” inquiry.
In deciding whether to certify a class, a U.S. court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” of requirements in Rule 23, which will inevitably “entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim,” Comcast, 569 U.S. at 33 (citation and internal quotation omitted). Questions on the merits, however, may be considered at this stage “only to the extent [] that they are relevant to determining whether Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013).
To be sure, applying these legal standards in practice often turns on the specific facts and evidence of the case. Class-certification proceedings typically involve extensive evidentiary presentations by the parties, and courts assess whether plaintiffs meet their burden of proving each requirement for certification by a “preponderance of the evidence” — that is, whether “the evidence more likely than not establishes each fact necessary to meet the requirements of Rule 23.”16 To make this determination, U.S. courts analyze not only whether plaintiffs have made a sufficient evidentiary showing on their own, but also whether evidence and counter-arguments from defendants defeat certification.
  
V. Rigorous Analysis of Pass-on and Damages in the United States
In U.S. antitrust class-action suits brought by indirect purchasers, how plaintiffs establish the aggregate amount of pass-on damages — a question at the heart of Merricks — is secondary to a threshold question for certification on whether there is predominance of common proof over individual issues on the question of class-wide impact. Specifically, to assess whether plaintiffs meet the predominance standard, U.S. courts ask whether and how plaintiffs intend to show:
(a) Class-wide proof of “antitrust impact” or “antitrust injury” — that is, whether all or nearly all class members were in fact injured from the alleged anticompetitive conduct;
(b) Class-wide proof of damages; and
(c) For each of these inquiries, that class-wide proof of impact and damages predominate over individualized issues, such that class treatment of damages claims is appropriate.
Although there is no explicit requirement of predominance under UK law, the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal considered related inquiries in the proceedings in Merricks. The Canadian Supreme Court opinion on which they rely,17 Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd v. Microsoft Corp. [2013] SC 57, requires indirect-purchaser plaintiffs at the class-certification stage to show “a realistic prospect of establishing loss on a class-wide basis so that, if the overcharge is eventually established at the trial of the common issues, there is a means by which to demonstrate that it is common to the class….”18  As the Court of Appeal noted, Pro-Sys relies in turn on the U.S. conception of common impact:
“The requirement at the certification stage is not that the [expert] methodology quantify the damages in question; rather, the critical element that the methodology must establish is the ability to prove ‘common impact’, as described in the U.S. antitrust case of In Re: Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, 305 F.3d 145 (3rd Cir. 2002). That is, plaintiffs must demonstrate that ‘sufficient proof [is] available, for use at trial, to prove antitrust impact common to all the members of the class’ (ibid., at p. 155). It is not necessary at the certification stage that the methodology establish the actual loss to the class, as long as the plaintiff has demonstrated that there is a methodology capable of doing so.”19  
This conception of common impact, including what a methodology capable of establishing the actual loss to the class must show, underpins the relevant reasoning in Pro-Sys and hence informs “the quality of the expert evidence needed” in Merricks “to establish loss on a class-wide basis as an issue common to the class.”20  The predominance inquiry under U.S. law incorporates these questions and also requires courts to conduct a rigorous analysis of whether common proof of impact predominates over individual issues among putative class members.
Moreover, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s instruction in Comcast, class-wide proof of damages must be “tied” to the class-wide proof of impact. In Comcast, the putative class of direct purchasers, comprising over two million current and former Comcast subscribers, brought antitrust claims against the cable-television services company for its “clustering scheme,” which concentrated operations within particular regions. In holding the plaintiffs could not meet the predominance standard of Rule 23, the Supreme Court first emphasized the importance of conducting a “rigorous analysis” which “will frequently entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”21  The district court and the court of appeals thus erred by refusing to decide whether the proposed “methodology [is] a just and reasonable inference or speculative” for fear of “inquir[ing] into the merits.”22  The Supreme Court then determined the plaintiffs did not meet the predominance standard for class certification because their expert’s calculation of damages — which assumed the validity of the plaintiffs’ four theories of antitrust impact rather than the validity of the single theory accepted by the district court — was not “tie[d]” or “attributable” to the one accepted theory of liability.23
A. Class-wide Proof of Impact
Any plaintiff bringing antitrust claims for damages in the United States must establish the fact of injury resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws.24 At the certification stage, then, U.S. courts conduct a “rigorous analysis” of whether this element of the plaintiffs’ claim — antitrust impact or injury — is common among class members, and whether such commonality predominates over individualized inquiries.
(i) Evidence of Pass-on of Injury 
Problems with proving antitrust injury at the certification stage are typically more present in suits brought by indirect purchasers than in those brought by direct purchasers, because causation is more attenuated. Whether indirect purchasers suffered injury on a class-wide basis often depends on whether an alleged overcharge was “passed on” to the indirect purchasers through each chain of distribution by which the putative class members made purchases. As one court expressed:
“Courts have recognized that proof of injury in fact in indirect purchaser suits can be problematic since, notwithstanding economic theory, it cannot be presumed that intermediaries will, in fact, always pass through antitrust overcharges or that price increases by middlemen to ultimate consumers might not be attributable to upstream overcharges …”  Ren v. Philip Morris Inc., 2002 WL 1839983, at *5 (Mich. Cir. Ct. 2002).
Consistent with the Tribunal’s view that Mr. Merricks cannot simply “address the problem of pass-through by submitting that the Tribunal can arrive at an aggregate award of damages, which would then be distributed to the class members,” U.S. courts typically require indirect-purchaser plaintiffs to show more than an estimate of aggregate damages to show pass-on and thus antitrust impact.25 The plaintiffs must introduce models from their economic expert demonstrating injury on a class-wide basis, accounting for variations among class members. The expert methodology must indicate class-wide that the indirect purchasers’ condition in a hypothetical “but-for” world — one without the alleged anticompetitive conduct — is better than their present condition.
Indeed, in deciding whether to certify an antitrust class action, U.S. courts have rejected methods of inferring class-wide injury from only aggregate damages and generalized statistical averaging; instead, direct proof is necessary.26 In other words, it is not sufficient for plaintiffs to proffer a methodology purporting to show that the average class member suffered injury based on an average overcharge from a statistical model and then assume that the average overcharge applied to all transactions made by indirect purchasers.
In addition, federal courts of appeal have generally endorsed the view that certification is inappropriate if a proposed class includes more than a de minimis number of uninjured plaintiffs because their presence defeats predominance.27
(ii) Rigorous Analysis of Class-wide Impact
The manners in which U.S. courts “rigorously analyze” common proof of impact, including pass-on, following the Comcast ruling can shed light on the present disagreement between the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal about the appropriate standard for reviewing Mr. Merricks’ proposed methodology. As described below, U.S. courts may also sometimes vary in what they require plaintiffs to show for class certification.
In some instances, courts have certified indirect-purchaser classes after conducting a rigorous analysis and determining the proffered expert methodology appropriately accounted for potential variations among class members. In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., 777 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2015) provides one example of the sort of rigor with which courts analyze plaintiffs’ proposed methodologies and engage with challenges from defendants. There, indirect purchasers brought an antitrust suit against drug manufacturers that allegedly delayed the launch of generic versions of heartburn medication.28 In considering defendants’ argument that more than a de minimis number of class members were uninjured, the court “conduct[ed] a detailed inquiry into the parties’ and experts’ economic analyses.”29  It determined the defendants’ challenges could not overcome the plaintiffs’ showing of predominance due to various logical and factual errors.30 The court then concluded the plaintiffs met their burden to show “the vast majority of class members were probably injured,” after reviewing whether prices to each of the allegedly uninjured groups would be lower in a but-for world absent the illegal conduct.31 The court’s inquiry in cases like Nexium parallels an important question in Merricks:  As the Court of Appeal described, a “critical issue in deciding whether the proposed methodology is a suitable and effective means of calculating loss to the class is to determine whether it is necessary to prove at trial that each member of the proposed class has in fact suffered some loss due to the alleged infringement.”32
Courts in other instances have refused certification after conducting a rigorous analysis and finding the methodology for determining class-wide injury did not account for indirect purchasers that did not suffer injury — i.e. indirect purchasers to whom injury was not passed on. In In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., 2018 WL 1156797 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2018), the district court refused to certify a class of indirect purchasers who alleged defendants engaged in a multi-year price-fixing conspiracy of lithium ion battery cells. The district court denied the request for class certification because the plaintiffs’ expert’s “estimate of 100% pass-through at each level of the supply chain does not adequately account for the effects of focal point pricing [set by sellers without overt communication], and therefore fails to yield reliable conclusions.”33  In the court’s view, by failing to address putative class members who purchased at focal point prices — and hence, according to defendants, suffered no overcharge attributable to the alleged anticompetitive conduct — the plaintiffs’ expert left “too much uncertainty as to whether pass-through can be estimated reliably at 100% as to retailers or distributors farther down the supply chain, and ultimately to the consumers who make up the proposed class.”34
Likewise, the court of appeals in In re Rail Freight Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, 725 F.3d 244, 253, 255 (D.C. Cir. 2013) characterized the “rigorous analysis” requirement in Comcast as requiring the court to undertake a “hard look” at the proffered expert methodology for class-wide antitrust impact. It then vacated class certification in a price-fixing antitrust case where, among other reasons, the plaintiffs’ expert methodology failed to filter out class members who suffered no damages.35
Certain district courts since Comcast have continued to apply a more relaxed standard of proof, however, creating some uncertainty about precisely how much a court should engage with an expert’s proposed methodologies on class-wide impact.36 There may be some tension between these rulings and the Supreme Court’s holding that a court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” of Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement, and we are aware of no federal court of appeals decision since Comcast that has adopted a more lenient certification test for analyzing methodologies on class-wide impact.
B. Class-wide Proof of Damages
In deciding whether indirect-purchaser plaintiffs should proceed as a class, a U.S. court also considers whether computation of damages for putative members of the class is susceptible to common proof. In certain circumstances, courts rely on plaintiff measures of aggregate damages to help meet this burden.37 Indeed, the class-action mechanism itself contemplates the use of aggregate damage calculations, which is well-established in federal courts.38
Still, proving aggregate damages alone is insufficient for class certification because courts must conduct a “rigorous analysis” into the question of whether common proof of such damages predominates over individualized questions of damages.39 To answer this question, courts analyze expert methodologies for calculating damages to individual class members, though such methodologies are often subject to a more relaxed standard than that required to show the fact of injury. “Calculations need not be exact,”40 and to make an initial showing, a “plausible” estimate of each class member’s damages will typically suffice as long as it does not rely on “speculation or guesswork.”41 The concern of U.S. courts with whether individual damages can be proven by common method is comparable to the Tribunal’s consideration in Merricks of whether there is a “plausible way” at the class-certification stage “of reaching even a very rough-and-ready approximation of the loss suffered by each individual claimant from the aggregate loss.”42
Further, although estimates of class-wide damages need not be proven with certainty, courts are becoming more willing to subject damages methodologies to greater scrutiny in order to confirm all or almost all class members are injured.43 In this regard, although class-wide impact and class-wide damages are two distinct inquiries, the analyses and supporting expert methodologies often overlap.
 
VI. Distribution of Damages 
The second key issue before the Supreme Court in Merricks concerns the proper approach to distribution of damages:  Specifically, whether the Tribunal was “both premature and wrong … to have refused certification by reference to the proposed method of distribution” because, as the Court of Appeal put it, “[d]istribution is a matter for the trial judge to consider following the making of an aggregate award.”44 In the Court of Appeal’s view, the Tribunal is not required at this stage to consider any “more than whether the claims are suitable for an aggregate award of damages which, by definition, does not include the assessment of individual loss.”45
Although U.S. courts do consider whether individual damages can be proven according to a common method across the whole class during the class-certification phase,46 they generally conceive of the “distribution” of aggregate damages as occurring in a later phase of litigation, such as after a determination of liability.47 In addition, courts rarely use “manageability” of the class action as a ground to deny certification under Rule 23.48
Some courts have nevertheless taken an approach more similar to the Tribunal’s and have been much more exacting in reviewing the plaintiffs’ proposed methods to distribute damages at the class-certification stage.49 Indeed, the availability of reliable data — which animated the Tribunal’s concerns in Merricks ([2017] CAT 16, [77]-[78]) — may be pertinent both to calculating individual damages and to distribution of those damages.50
The opinion by the Circuit Court of Michigan in Ren v. Philip Morris Inc., 2002 WL 1839983 (Mich. Cir. Ct. 2002) interprets a state-law rule on class certification and provides a helpful illustration of this principle. There, a proposed class of smokers sought to recover damages for the inflated cost of cigarettes due to price-fixing by cigarette manufacturers. Although the court found the plaintiffs’ expert had a valid methodology to establish class-wide impact, it held the plaintiffs failed to provide a method to determine damages for each consumer on a “formulaic basis.”51 The court noted that in some instances, “ascertainment of damages for each individual plaintiff … [is] amenable to formulaic treatment,” such as where “the number of products and number of purchases by any one plaintiff … is very limited, and the range of retail price a finite quantity” or “where the number of purchasers … are readily identifiable and reliable records for individual purchases exist.”52 It then compared cases which involved “computerized records of individual transactions” to the case before it, which implicated a “dizzying number of products, retail prices, individual transactions and purchasers over a multi-year period.”53 The court thus held the plaintiffs could not show predominance as it was unlikely that “any sort of ascertainment of individual damages can be made under some systematic or formulaic basis that avoids the necessity of individualized proofs…”54 The court further noted that these “considerations also would lead to the finding that the class action would not be manageable.”55
In contrast, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico certified a class of smokers on similar facts in Romero v. Philip Morris Inc., 109 P.3d 768 (N.M. Ct. App. 2005). In so doing, the court placed its faith in the jury to make a “just and reasonable estimate of the damage based on relevant data.”56 In its view, although “some minimum amount of individualized proof will be at the very least required for class members to receive any amount of damages,” the court “do[es] not see problems of such an intolerable or insurmountable character to cause [it] to pause at this stage and prevent certification on manageability grounds.”57 Instead, the court of appeals emphasized the district court has “numerous management tools at hand” to assist later in the “management and processing and or adjudication of the claims of individual class members.”58
To be sure, difficulties involved in distribution are heightened in complex antitrust cases, and courts tend to look more suspiciously upon proposed methods of distribution that would “require individual trials.”  See In re Rail Freight, 934 F.3d at 625 (explaining the plaintiffs did not have a “winnowing mechanism” “short of full-blown, individual trials” to separate the uninjured from the injured, and noting that any questions presented in later individual challenges “would be … complex.”).59
Some jurisdictions therefore remain skeptical that distributing damages for individual class members can truly be separated from determining common antitrust injury during the class-certification phase. These courts reason similarly to the Tribunal in Merricks, which required at the certification stage a “practicable means for estimating the individual loss which can be used as the basis for distribution.”60
 
VII. Conclusion
Whether to certify classes of plaintiffs in antitrust suits can be a challenging question to resolve in any jurisdiction, and those challenges can be heightened where the harmed purchasers are indirect. In complex markets where transactions are affected by numerous factors, tracing and measuring injury after it has occurred is often a central point of dispute between the parties in class certification. Of relevance to the issues in Merricks, two trends in the United States may be of particular note to the UK Supreme Court:
(a) After the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding in Comcast, U.S. courts are engaging more deeply with the plaintiffs’ expert methodologies and, just as importantly, with the defendants’ challenges to these methodologies. Although the effects of Comcast continue to percolate through lower courts, courts have been willing to deny class certification to indirect purchasers if their proffered methodologies are unsound or fail to offer common evidence of class-wide antitrust harms that predominates over individual issues of injury. Of course, as noted in the cases cited above in which courts have certified indirect purchaser classes, the evidentiary complexities associated with pass-on analysis have been and can be surmounted in U.S. litigation.61
(b) Calculation of individual damages and administrability in distribution may also present a hurdle for some indirect plaintiffs at the class certification stage. Although many U.S. courts continue to conceive of distribution for a later stage of trial, some have denied class certification precisely because of a lack of reliable data for calculating individual overcharges and of complexities in distribution. For these skeptical courts, bifurcating impact and distribution simply delays the need eventually to adjudicate these individualized claims.
The UK Supreme Court’s decision in Merricks will affect not only the UK, but all nations that share the UK’s goal in promoting competition across the globe. We at the Antitrust Division therefore hope the new procedural option is implemented with care, balancing the many interests at stake in class proceedings and benefiting from the experience of nations that have considered similar questions.

35 On the other hand, some courts analyzing whether there is predominance on the question of damages interpret Comcast’s damages analysis as applying only to situations where the plaintiffs advance multiple theories of impact.

49 Certain requirements under Rule 23 are concerned with administrability and require consideration of the practicalities of distribution. For example, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(4)(D) asks courts to consider the “likely difficulties in managing a class action” as part of determining whether a “class action is superior to other methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.”  This manageability requirement has been interpreted leniently. See William Rubenstein, Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions (5th ed., West 2011) § 4:72. Some courts of appeal also consider the administrative feasibility of separating the uninjured from injured class members in deciding whether to certify a class. See Byrd v. Aaron’s Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 163 (3d Cir. 2015); In re Asacol, 907 F.3d at 52; William Rubenstein, Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions (5th ed., West 2011) § 20:33 (referring to ascertainability of the class as an “implicit requirement” of Rule 23). But see In re Petrobras Sec., 862 F.3d 250, 264 (2d Cir. 2017) (“We conclude that a freestanding administrative feasibility requirement is neither compelled by precedent nor consistent with Rule 23, joining four of our sister circuits in declining to adopt such a requirement.”). In general, U.S. courts may be less receptive to class certification if there is no comprehensive record of relevant transactions and if purchasers would find it difficult to determine on their own whether they are in the proposed class. See William Rubenstein, Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions (5th ed., West 2011) § 20:33.

The European and U.S. Approaches to Antitrust and Tech: Setting the Record Straight – A Reply to Gregory J. Werden and Luke M. Froeb’s Antitrust and Tech: Europe and the United States Differ, and It Matters1
By Maria Coppola & Renato Nazzini2
 
In the October 2019 CPI Chronicle, Greg Werden & Luke Froeb identify ten differences between the European and American approaches to single firm conduct enforcement. These differences, they claim, explain how Europe systemically differs from the United States in ways that affect enforcement against the tech giants. Werden & Froeb “lift the hoods on the antitrust enforcement machines in US and EC” in order to identify “hard-wired differences” in each jurisdiction’s approach to single firm conduct. While acknowledging that their article may be seen as overly simplistic, they identify ten meaningful differences as “essential truths.”
There is no doubt that competition agencies in Europe have brought many single firm conduct enforcement cases against the tech giants, and some of the cases would be unlikely to be brought under U.S. law.3 While Werden & Froeb make some key points with which we agree, in unpacking the “meaningful differences” to identify their asserted “essential truths,” Werden & Froeb’s selective viewfinder results in a mischaracterization of important areas of European law and court decisions. This reply addresses, in order, all ten differences identified by Werden & Froeb.4 This reply is not a line by line rebuttal, nor a refutation of every point that Werden & Froeb have identified. Instead, it offers a more fulsome discussion of the issues they raise, with the goal of providing a more accurate and complete view of European competition law and policy as it compares with U.S. law and enforcement practice.
 
Difference 1. The European system is driven by competitor complaints 
Werden & Froeb posit that complaining to the European Commission pays off, and that the European Commission is driven by competitor complaints, whereas the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies often leave it to the complainants to bring cases on their own. The differences between the U.S. and the European private enforcement systems, which remain significant even after the implementation of the Damages Directive in the European Union,5 and material cultural divergences in understanding the role of government in policing the economy, undeniably influence the allocation of resources between public and private enforcement.6 Some observers argue that the U.S.’s particular system of private rights that are afforded in litigation, including the availability of treble damages, fee shifting, contingency fees, liberal discovery, and class actions, has increased the bar for bringing monopolization cases precisely because the judiciary seeks to limit the availability of these powerful rewards by modifying doctrine governing liability standards to evaluate the worthiness of private claims.7
However, it is not clear what Werden & Froeb really mean by “driven” by competitors. If it means that enforcement action often starts with one or more complaints against an allegedly dominant firm, this is arguably a feature showing that the European system is working well. Particularly in an environment without an active culture of private actions, it is necessary for complainants to “police” the business environment and bring potential infringements to the attention of the competition authorities. This is why formal complainants have been given important rights in the European Union (“EU”), including access to evidence and a non-confidential version of the European Commission’s charge sheet (statement of objections), appearance at oral hearings, and, most notably, standing to challenge the European Commission’s final decision (or the European Commission’s rejection of the complaint). Incentives to become a formal complainant are influenced by these rights. This, however, works in the public interest. Complainants report alleged infringements that may be impossible or excessively difficult for the competition authorities to detect without any input from competitors or customers.
If, however, “driven” by competitors purports to suggest that the European Commission is “captured” by complainants or that the European Commission cannot run cases unless there are well resourced complainants, we believe this is incorrect. Suggesting complainants are the driving force for the cases against the tech giants ignores much of the European Commission’s experience with these cases. In the AdSense case, for example, Microsoft withdrew its complaint more than two years before the European Commission issued an infringement decision. Cases such as Qualcomm had no formal complainants, nor, to our knowledge, are there formal complainants in many of the current tech investigations. It is also worth noting that in some of the tech enforcement actions, the European Commission’s decision bore little resemblance to the original complaints.
Many of the European Commission’s tech cases are ex officio, driven by the Commission’s enforcement agenda; or they began, as many U.S. investigations do, with grievances by competitors, and then are developed by the enforcers who are informed by engagement with the target and third parties, including competitors.
Anecdotally, it appears that informal complaints involving conduct that affects the U.S. and the EU are frequently lodged with agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. However, complainants may choose to focus their efforts in Brussels because Article 102, the EU’s single firm conduct provision, makes a broader swath of conduct illegal.
 
Difference 2. The European system is run by politicians 
Werden & Froeb claim that the European decision-making structure seems “calculated to elevate politics above technical merit.” The European Commission ultimately takes enforcement actions, acting upon the recommendation of its Competition Commissioner, who has sworn an oath of impartiality, and other Commissioners almost never interfere with the recommendation of the Competition Commissioner. The Competition Commissioner’s recommendation is based upon the work of and submissions by the Competition Directorate, DG Competition, as well as review by a cabinet partially staffed by very senior career competition officials from DG Competition. However, we do not deny that the Competition Commissioner, who could be compared to the head of an antitrust agency, may well be, effectively, a politician, which is the case of the current Commissioner, and that, formally, enforcement decisions are taken by a college of politically appointed Commissioners with different portfolios and different agendas. The position is different in the Member States, where most competition agencies are, and all will soon be required to be, independent of the government, though the heads of authority and commissioners are sometimes political appointees without any technical competition expertise. This position, which we agree may not be entirely satisfactory, is not, however, specific to single firm conduct or tech markets. It applies across the board, including to merger control. Furthermore, in practice, historically Competition Commissioners have shown repeatedly a willingness to stand up to parochial interests. Most recently, in 2019, the European Commission, at the recommendation of Commissioner Vestager, blocked the Siemens/Alstom merger against the wishes of the two national EU heavyweights, France and Germany.8
Looking at the history of the federal enforcement agencies in the U.S., most, but not all, agency decision-makers had strong antitrust backgrounds, but many also came from the political world (more frequently from the legislative branch but also the executive), and others without antitrust expertise were nonetheless excellent at their jobs.9
While there is a degree of “politicization” in EU institutional arrangements, on a closer analysis this is not unique to the EU, nor have Werden & Froeb provided evidence that this has had a systematic, or indeed any, impact on past cases.
 
Difference 3. The European system was conceived of as regulation, not as law enforcement
Werden & Froeb state that the European system was conceived of as regulation, not as law enforcement. It is unclear whether the debate as to whether competition enforcement is law enforcement or regulation sheds insight on understanding the differences between the U.S. and the EU approaches to tech. The debate appears to us to be academic, at least to a large extent, but we nevertheless believe that it would be inaccurate to describe the EU system of competition enforcement as “regulation.”10 Like U.S. legal prohibitions, the EU antitrust prohibitions are general in terms of their fundamental structure. Article 102 TFEU, for example, prohibits “any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it.” It is true that Article 102 goes on to set out four examples of abuse, but the EU case law unequivocally states that this list is illustrative, and what matters is whether conduct is, or is not, an abuse of a dominant position, not whether it fits one of the four categories of abuse.11 Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits any “monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize.” If one compares the prohibition of “any abuse of a dominant position” with the prohibition of any “monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize,” the prohibitions are similar in terms of their generality. Under EU law, the key concepts are “abuse” and “dominant position,” whereas in the U.S. the test is what “monopolize” means. 12 The way the case law has construed and applied the prohibition is also, on both sides of the Atlantic, broadly similar in method: the U.S. and the EU Courts have interpreted broad, open-textured prohibitions in light of the policy and economic thinking prevailing at the time, while being responsive to counsel’s arguments on the facts of each individual case. Of course, U.S. and EU case law differ in their approaches to given problems. We provide two examples to illustrate this point: predatory pricing and margin squeeze. In the U.S., for a predation claim to succeed, the plaintiff must show a dangerous probability of recoupment,13 whereas in the EU recoupment is a relevant factor in the assessment of a predatory strategy, but not an element of the infringement.14 Also, in the U.S., margin squeeze is not a standalone infringement,15 where in the EU it may be, under certain circumstances.16 What one could draw from these differences, however, is not any support for the claim that U.S. antitrust law was conceived of as “law enforcement” and EU competition law was conceived of as “regulation.” These differences show, rather, different perceptions and underlying beliefs about the relative importance of type 1 versus type 2 errors and, more generally, different doctrinal approaches by different courts in different jurisdictions.
It is also instructive to recall, from a historical perspective, that in one of the drafts of the Treaty of Rome, the section on competition opened with a general prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality. That prohibition was then removed from the draft on the request of the German delegation, with the agreement of the other delegations, because the view was taken that discrimination on grounds of nationality had nothing to do with competition law.17
It would also be inaccurate to say that EU competition law is “regulation” because it is enforced by the European Commission and national competition authorities (“NCAs”), which are, by and large, administrative authorities rather than courts. The European Commission and the NCAs are required to enforce the competition laws through individual enforcement mechanisms, not to regulate markets. Furthermore, courts have jurisdiction to apply the very same prohibitions regardless of any prior decision by an administrative authority. A firm aggrieved by an alleged abuse of dominance may complain to the European Commission or go straight to court. The European Commission or the court will apply the law, and the decision-maker should not affect the result. Also, when the European Commission or an NCA adopts an infringement decision, that decision is reviewable by a court of full jurisdiction, that is, by a court having the power to review all aspects of the decision, in fact and law.
Finally, to extrapolate – as Werden & Froeb do – that EU competition law is regulation because it prohibits exploitative abuses, including excessive prices, and excessive pricing cases turn the enforcer into a price regulator, is methodologically incorrect. Exploitative abuses are uncommon, as Werden & Froeb rightly recognize, and very much the exception rather than the rule.18 One cannot draw a general conclusion from an “exception.” Furthermore, while we recognise that the very idea of an exploitative abuse is controversial,19 as a matter of principle the test remains a legal test. It is not the case that the European Commission or NCAs can intervene in markets when they believe there is a market failure and regulate the price. What the agencies can do is to determine whether a given price falls afoul of the prohibition or not. This may be complex and certainly debatable as a matter of policy and economics – but does not necessarily turn EU competition law into price regulation as a general proposition, although it is theoretically possible to argue that the exploitative abuse branch of EU competition law has elements of regulation. It is noteworthy, however, that none of the enforcement cases against tech companies is an exploitative abuse case. Werden & Froeb’s argument on this point is, therefore, in any event moot.
 
Difference 4. The European system is grounded in skepticism of markets 
Werden & Froeb argue that the European system is grounded in skepticism of markets. In fact, the European system is grounded in the creation of a single market, a concept firmly grounded in the belief that free trade and an open and competitive economy maximize overall welfare, against the background of a social and economic history that reflects a wariness of conduct by former state monopolies within their traditional areas of dominance. In the EU, from the outset, state monopolies, state-granted benefits and privileges, and state power coopted by private interests posed serious challenges to free and competitive markets. This history of state-run or directed economies impacts the European Commission’s enforcement priorities: more than half of the European Commission’s single firm conduct cases of the past two decades involve telecom, financial services, rail, and electricity, reflecting this economic past. This difference identified by Werden & Froeb is generalized, explaining that the U.S. protects competition, leaving unsaid the decades-old refrain that inevitably follows this statement: that Europe protects competitors at the expense of consumers. Scholars have noted that EU competition law protects the competitive process, stressing market access and the right to contest markets on the merits.20 Guided by Post-Chicago school economics,21 as Professor Eleanor Fox notes, EU competition enforcement reflects the belief that lowering barriers to entry and keeping a clear path for challengers is likely to make the market more dynamic and thus serve consumers better.22 We believe that enforcement in Europe is not guided by a skepticism of markets, but by a marginally different set of beliefs about what rules and forms of intervention make markets work better and tend to optimize overall welfare.
It is also noteworthy that while U.S. law exempts certain forms of state action from the reach of antitrust law, by contrast, the activities of public entities in the EU are fully subject to competition law. EU competition law, through Articles 106 and 107, does not exempt state-owned enterprises or state granted privileges from the application of competition law. In the Greek Lignite case, for example, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) repeated its well established case law, according to which a Member State may be found to have infringed Article 106(1) if its measures create a situation in which a public undertaking or an undertaking on which it has conferred special or exclusive rights, merely by exercising the preferential rights conferred upon it, is led to abuse its dominant position, or when those rights are liable to create a situation in which that undertaking is led to commit such abuses.23 For state action to be compatible with EU law, the exclusive or special rights must be proportionate and not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the public interest objective.
In general, in the area of single firm conduct, the European Commission and Member States have been more inclined to intervene against single firm conduct, whereas in the U.S., single firm conduct enforcement has been more influenced by concerns about the effects of erroneous government enforcement. This does not mean, however, that Europeans are driven by a skepticism of markets or that, in the U.S., government enforcement against single firm conduct is absent. 24
 
Difference 5. The European system lacks the process of U.S. court proceedings
The institutional structure and enforcement process in the EU and the U.S. differ significantly, but both systems allow for a full review by independent courts. In the EU, the European Commission investigates a case, issues a statement of objections, and gives the targets the right to access to evidence the European Commission has relied upon (access to file), the opportunity to submit a written defence, and to request a hearing. The hearing before the European Commission is, of course, nothing like a trial before an impartial court. There is no cross-examination of fact and expert witnesses and no adversarial arguments. The hearing is before the same body that started the investigation, issued the statement of objections, and will ultimately decide the case. However, under EU law, this system requires that any aggrieved party must have a right of appeal before a court of “full jurisdiction,” with the power to review the correctness, not just the lawfulness, of the decision on the facts and on the law. This is not the same as a common law trial, but it is a de novo review.25
At the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), when the Commission finds “reason to believe” that a party has engaged in an “unfair method of competition” and that a proceeding would be in “the interest of the public,” staff can litigate cases either through administrative adjudication before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) and the Commission (“Part III”),26 or through federal court litigation before district courts. In the case of Part III adjudication, the first appeal, available to either complaint counsel (FTC staff) or respondents or both, is an appeal from the ALJ’s initial decision to the Commission. The Commission reviews the ALJ’s decision de novo, meaning that the Commission is not bound by the ALJ’s evidentiary rulings, findings of fact or conclusions of law. The next appeal is only available to the respondent, who can appeal the Commission’s decision to the federal courts. The Commission’s findings of law are reviewed de novo, but they may be given some deference to the extent they involve interpretation and application of the FTC Act. The Court of Appeals is bound by the Commission’s findings of facts, so long as the facts are supported by evidence. The courts have interpreted this language to mean that a “substantial evidence” test applies. This test asks whether the Commission’s findings are supported by “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate,” not whether the reviewing court “making its own appraisal of the testimony, picking and choosing for itself among uncertain and conflicting inferences” would reach the same conclusion. The test is deferential to the FTC.
At the Antitrust Division, the Division acts only as a prosecutor, going to federal court to seek enforcement action. Unless the parties choose to settle the case before trial, enforcement actions will require trial in a federal court. Under the Tunney Act, federal courts review proposed consent decrees in civil antitrust cases filed by the DOJ to ensure that the remedy proposed in the consent is in the public interest, but this does not usually involve a full trial on the merits.
Thus, the U.S. and the EU procedures differ, although it is notable that these differences are not specific to antitrust. They reflect the different legal systems of continental Europe and the United States. They share in common, however, that competition decisions are subject to a full review by independent courts.
One aspect not addressed by Werden & Froeb in this section, but referred to only in passing near the conclusion, is the length of the European Court proceedings. The authors reference the European Commission’s Intel case, with the original decision in 2009, and, as of this writing, is still waiting for a final decision by the General Court after being remanded in 2017 by the ECJ. We note that it is possible for U.S. cases to be lengthy. In the FTC’s Actavis matter, the FTC filed its original complaint in January 2009, which was dismissed by a district court, a decision then reversed by the Supreme Court in 2013, and remanded. The case concluded with a consent decree in February 2019, on the eve of trial, which was scheduled to begin in March. However, while we have not done an empirical examination to compare the timing between the original enforcement action and the final appeal in all cases, we agree that it appears in general to be considerably longer in the EU, which can impact a defendant’s decision on whether or not to pursue an appeal, and thus may impact how defendants view, as a practical matter, their rights of defense.
 
Difference 6. The European system lacks the burden of proof of an adversarial system
As Werden & Froeb accept, the EU system does have a doctrine of the burden of proof,27 even if, as they correctly state, in the administrative proceedings it is the European Commission itself that needs to conclude whether its own burden of proof has been discharged or not. From the perspective of a common law trial, this appears puzzling. In an administrative system, however, it is not unusual for the administrative authority to decide whether, following its own investigation, there is sufficient evidence that allows a determination whether the law has been infringed. The enforcer still must be satisfied to the required legal standard that an infringement has occurred, mindful that the evidence must be persuasive to the courts since the decisions can be appealed to the General Court, and then, on points of law, the ECJ.28 If a decision is appealed, while it is for the applicant to raise specific grounds of appeal, it is for the European Commission to satisfy the court that it has discharged its burden of proof. If the court, at the end of the appeal, believes that there is a doubt as to whether the applicant has infringed EU competition law, the appeal is allowed and the European Commission’s decision annulled.29 One may, of course, prefer a common law trial as the best method to test the evidence and arrive at the truth – as we do –  but it is necessary to recognize that more than half the world, including, but not limited to, the EU and most of its Member States, has administrative authorities that are empowered to find law infringements, not only of antitrust law but of many other sorts of laws, subject to review by the courts. Introducing a common law-style trial at the EU level only to address competition infringements would be out of kilter with the legal system overall. As the U.S. adversarial system is not specific to antitrust, neither is the EU administrative system. Both are well embedded in their respective legal frameworks and traditions and both have advantages and disadvantages. The EU system may have disadvantages, but one of them is not that it lacks the burden of proof of an adversarial system. It lacks a common law trial, but this is not the same thing.
  
Difference 7. The European system does not impeach unsound theories
In Werden & Froeb’s article, this criticism of the European system boils down to the proposition that in the EU there is no mechanism to exclude unreliable economic evidence as there is in the United States under the Daubert rule.30 It may be that all the world should adopt the Daubert rule, and we are open to a debate about its pros and cons. But the jump from being enthusiasts of the Daubert rule to saying that the European system does not impeach unsound theories is itself unsound. Many common law systems do not have a rule similar or equivalent to Daubert. For example, England, the country of origin of the common law, does not have it. Under English law, the reliability of the evidence, including expert evidence, is a matter for the jury or the judge if the trial is by a judge alone. Whether evidence is reliable or not is an issue of fact, not an exclusionary rule. It is not surprising, therefore, that an administrative system such as the European one does not have a Daubert-type of rule. But unsound theories can be and are impeached.
There are several stages in the administrative procedure that provide an opportunity for parties to challenge the European Commission’s economic theories. There are internal checks and balances, such as advice by the Legal Service of the European Commission (completely separate from DG Competition), or by the Chief Economist’s office (which provides an independent view). But, more importantly, whatever economic theory the European Commission relies upon, it must be able to withstand judicial review. While judicial review of matters of complex economic assessment has, historically, been deferential, it is now accepted that the General Court has unfettered jurisdiction to review economic evidence and assessments and set aside the decision under appeal if it disagrees with the assessment of the European Commission. This has happened, recently, in the Servier pay-for-delay case, in which the General Court disagreed with the European Commission’s market definition and set aside the decision in part.31 And it happened, famously, in three mergers cases in the early noughts, when the EU Courts set aside three merger decisions in short sequence in Airtours, Schneider, and Tetra Laval.32
There is also the important role of the Advocate General (“AG”) in criticizing what might be considered to be “unsound” ideas. In many cases, for example in the AG opinions in Coty and Intel, the AG provided trenchant analyses of the state of the literature in order to attack specific ideas, and to guide the ECJ toward a better line of reasoning. While the Court is ultimately free to disregard the opinion, the AG is nonetheless an influential voice about arguments that should be retained and those that should be discarded.
Finally, in some Member States, economic experts retained by the parties have a special duty to the court to present their views in a way that improves the court’s understanding of the matter and not to engage in simple advocacy. Put another way, the expert has a responsibility to the court and not simply to the client. European judges and economic consultants explain that this tempers advocacy, and discourages the presentation of arguments and interpretations that might in some sense be considered “unsound.”33
While cross examination in court may be a more effective mechanism for impeaching unsound theories (as Werden & Froeb argue), it is not the only way to ensure that enforcement action is economically sound. There are a number of ways in which agencies and courts in Europe can weed out unsound theories.
  
Difference 8. The European system maintains a low bar for anticompetitive effects
We accept that the effects threshold required to prove an infringement is a difference between the U.S. and the EU systems.34 The EU generally requires a lower bar for foreclosure, but there is a diversity among the types of conduct that Werden & Froeb ignore. For example, in Generics (UK) Ltd v CMA, the ECJ found that a branded pharmaceutical company’s overall contractual strategy could be capable of restricting competition and of producing exclusionary effects going beyond the specific anticompetitive effects of the individual agreements. The Court in essence said that the cumulative effect may be greater than the individual parts: the Court accepted that an abuse of a dominant position could occur even if the dominant firm’s agreements did not, individually, breach Article 101.35 In the Intel case, the 2017 ECJ decision clarified the role of effects in an analysis of rebate schemes, holding that the dominant firm can overcome the presumption of illegality with substantiated arguments and evidence that the conduct was not capable of restricting competition.36
The effects required depend on the type of conduct at issue. In Google Shopping, the European Commission applied a test of conduct “capable of having, or likely to have, anticompetitive effects,” finding liability based on a demonstration of anticompetitive effects focusing on traffic diversion away from third-party comparison shopping websites, and discussed in less detail the potential anticompetitive effects in the national markets for general search services.37 In Google Android, the European Commission’s decision explains that it is sufficient that the conduct tends to restrict competition or is capable of having that effect, regardless of its success.38 The European Commission’s recent approach in tech cases is, however, not the final word on the matter. There is case law from the Grand Chamber of the ECJ that establishes that, at least in certain circumstances, the anti-competitive effects test should be likely foreclosure of as efficient competitors causing consumer harm. In Post Danmark I, the Court ruled on the standard of foreclosure in predation and held that when the price applied by the dominant undertaking is lower than its average total costs but above its average incremental costs, “it is necessary to consider whether that pricing policy, without objective justification, produces an actual or likely exclusionary effect, to the detriment of competition and, thereby, of consumers’ interests.”39 The European Commission presumably interprets this case as applying only to pricing practices. This is not, however, the only possible interpretation, and it remains to be seen what the EU Courts will say in the Google appeals, for example.
The test for anticompetitive effects under Article 102 is still unclear, and while arguably problematic for some types of abuses, the case law is moving in the direction of an effects-based approach. We agree with Werden & Froeb that the standard in the EU, at least insofar as it is only “capability” to foreclose in certain cases, is low. But we disagree in that the EU case law is much more complex and other tests are applied as well, such as a test of actual or likely foreclosure of “as efficient competitors,” to the detriment of consumers.
 
Difference 9. The European system is receptive to leveraging theories 
Werden & Froeb discuss leveraging in the European tech cases, arguing that leveraging theories in the U.S. are legally cognizable only when monopoly is threatened in the second market, whereas in Europe it is sufficient that competition is distorted in the second market. Most European Commission tech cases involving leveraging theories involve refusals to deal or tying. For the former, the standards for finding liability are demanding.40 For tying cases, the description of the EU standard as only requiring a distortion of competition without any threat of monopolization of the tied market creates the wrong impression that the European Commission intervenes on the basis of a low threshold. In tying cases, the rationale for intervention is concern about potential monopolization in the tied market. While under case law the European Commission needs only to show foreclosure in the tied market, if one examines the cases actually brought, they are consistent with a likelihood of monopolization of the tied market. While a Section 2 tying case in the U.S. may be more demanding with respect to requirements for the secondary market, in the Microsoft cases (2004, tying of media player; 2009, tying of Internet Explorer) and the 2018 Android case, the European Commission considered market power in the tying market (i.e. where the conduct takes place) and the effects in the tied market (i.e. where the effects occur and the likelihood of foreclosure needs to be established).
 
Difference 10. The European system does not recognize competition on the merits 
The European Courts have not defined in a conclusive way what competition on the merits means, and instead use it as a benchmark to define what is not competition on the merits. While there is no hard-edged definition of competition on the merits, the ECJ’s 2017 Intel decision explains that competition by dominant firms has to be efficiency related, which means, for example, lower costs or better quality. The Court relies on the “as efficient competitor” test, concluding that a dominant company can engage in conduct that is more efficient than its competitors and EU competition law does not protect less efficient competitors.
In describing the U.S. approach, the authors claim that in the U.S., courts hold that product improvement is “lawful competition on the merits.” For this claim authors likely rely on cases such as the Ninth Circuit’s Allied Orthopedic v. Tyco. However, while, in the United States, the Microsoft Court noted that U.S. courts “are properly very skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm’s product design changes,”41 the court also refuted the idea that product design is a safe harbor from antitrust rules.42
In Europe, product improvement arises in Article 102 cases as an objective justification. While this justification has failed generally before the EU Courts, it has proved successful in Article 102 cases in Member States, for example, in Streetmap.com v. Google.43
 
Concluding Remarks
In addition to these ten differences, Werden & Froeb also note other aspects that could influence Europe’s ability to bring tech cases: the transparency of decision-making when the agencies decide not to take action and the possibility of a challenge to that decision;44 the length of time for court decisions; and the inability for the court’s decisions on remedies to reflect new facts. These elements certainly can influence the cases against the tech giants. They conclude their article, however, noting that in the U.S., the judicial acceptance of a singular focus on consumer welfare guards against the calls for action against tech companies that invoke myriad social issues. We applaud the focus on consumer welfare in the U.S., but question the implication that the European Commission’s actions against the tech companies – the focus of the article – has succumbed to anything other than its two enforcement goals: consumer welfare and market integration.45 On the contrary, so far the European Commission has been a staunch advocate for keeping other goals separate – cautioning against the use of antitrust enforcement for other purposes, such as environmental protection, labor considerations, consumer protection, or data protection violations.46
This reply does not seek to suggest that Europe and the U.S. apply the same law or have the same procedures, particularly as regards to single firm conduct. At the margin, in the United States, there is a greater faith in market forces, and U.S. antitrust doctrine recognizes narrower circumstances in which dominant firms can be held liable for competitive abuses. At the same time, we acknowledge that the past two decades have seen greater transatlantic convergence, including the movement away from a form-based approach to a greater focus on effects in European law.47

5 Directive 2014/104/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Member States and of the European Union [2014] OJ L349/1 (“Damages Directive”), now implemented in all Member States.
6 Standalone private enforcement actions under Article 102 have been rare. One reason is that national jurisdictions, except for the UK and to a lesser extent Germany and the Netherlands, did not provide for discovery. However, in 2014, the European Commission adopted the Damages Directive, which seeks to create an effective European private enforcement regime through the pursuit of damages actions before EU Member State courts. The Directive requires all EU member states to provide for the recovery of damages in competition cases, and several provisions in the Directive, such as those concerning the binding effect or evidentiary value of NCA’s decisions and other provisions related to discovery, may facilitate the bringing of single firm conduct private actions. The Directive required Member States to transpose the Directive into national law before the end of 2017 and has now been implemented in all Member States. As noted in the American Bar Association’s Antitrust Law Section Final Report of the Task Force on International Divergence of Dominance Standards (September 1, 2019) (hereafter “ABA Report”), “Given the dearth of Article 102 private enforcement cases litigated before national courts, it is too early to tell whether the European Union’s push for more private enforcement might in the future also impact the development of substantive competition law doctrine, similar to what some have observed in connection with Section 2.” The lack of a culture of private rights in most EU countries suggests this is unlikely to happen in the near future.
7 Kovacic has explained “U.S. antitrust doctrine would have assumed a more intervention-oriented character if the power to enforce the American competition statutes were vested exclusively in public enforcement authorities, or if the private right of action had been circumscribed…”: William E. Kovacic, Private Participation in the Enforcement of Public Competition Laws, speech at British Institution of International & Comparative Law’s Third Annual Conference on International and Comparative Competition Law: The Transatlantic Antitrust Dialogue, May 15, 2003. He has specifically addressed how private rights have shaped the standards for single firm conduct cases in the U.S. in William E. Kovacic, The Intellectual DNA of Modern U.S. Competition Law for Dominant Firm Conduct: The Chicago/Harvard Double Helix, 1 COLUM. BUS. L. REV. 1-80 (2007). In that article, Kovacic argues that judicial fears that the U.S. style of private rights of action – with mandatory treble damages, asymmetric shifting of costs, broad rights of discovery, class actions, and jury trials – excessively deter legitimate conduct and have spurred a dramatic retrenchment of antitrust liability standards, most evident in the progression toward more lenient treatment of dominant firm conduct.

9 From the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, Chairman Jon Leibowitz (2009-2013, also Commissioner from 2004-2009)  joined the FTC after a long career in the U.S. Senate, and Chairman Janet Steiger (1989-1995) did not have an antitrust background when she joined, and she ably led the FTC.
10 Regulation may be defined as “imposition of rules by government, backed by the use of penalties that are intended specifically to modify the economic behaviour of individuals and firms in the private sector”: Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law, compiled by R. S. Khemani and D. M. Shapiro, commissioned by the Directorate for Financial, Fiscal and Enterprise Affairs, OECD, 1993. At a very general level, all law may be “regulation” but, generally, regulation refers to sets of rules that are either sector specific (e.g. telecoms or energy markets) or aimed at addressing a particular, well-defined problem (e.g. money-laundering). Law is a more general concept, which encompasses and authorizes regulation, but includes all norms that purport to have a given form of authority over their addressees.

It is sympathetic to access to networks. It is hostile to dominant firms’ using leverage to take advantages for themselves at the expense of competitors, thereby “unleveling the playing field.” It does not aim to protect inefficient competitors. Rather, EU precedents safeguard a clearer path of the outsider to access markets on the merits, free from obstructions by dominant firms. Nonetheless, from the point of view of detractors who worry about excessive enforcement against dominant firms, the EU approach does protect competitors.” Id at 8.

44 Many scholars and members of the antitrust community have suggested the U.S. agencies should consider adopting additional transparency measures to explain why the enforcer declined to take action. See, for example, former FTC Chairman William Kovacic’s recent article on the FTC’s Google decision: “By too often saying nothing, or very little, the US agencies have missed important opportunities to improve public understanding of, and confidence in, how they formulate antitrust policy.” William Kovacic, Roads Not Taken: The Federal Trade Commission and Google, in The Concurrentialiste, March 9, 2020, available here. The U.S. agencies do occasionally issue statements about the decision to close an investigation or not to challenge a merger, but these are few in number and not as detailed as the European decisions.
45 Following an e-commerce sector study, the European Commission has brought a series of cases against conduct involving restrictions on online businesses, invoking the single market imperative, an essential element of its mandate. We do note that some of the recent tech enforcement actions by the Member States involve novel application of national antitrust laws (which can be more restrictive of single firm conduct than Article 102) that is arguably a move away from traditional antitrust, including the Bundeskartellamt’s case against Facebook, and the Autorité de la Concurrence’s recent cases against Google and Apple.
46 We note that in the Von der Leyen Commission there have been increasing calls to expand the boundaries of competition law enforcement, as there has been in the U.S. Whether and how Executive Vice President and Competition Commissioner Vestager and DG Competition respond to these calls remains to be seen.
47 As the ABA Report (supra) notes, “The Task Force finds far more similarity than difference between the current U.S. and EU approaches to competition enforcement against dominant firm behavior. To a large extent, convergence is reflected not only in agency and court enforcement actions but also frequent consensus among competition agencies not to act against conduct over which many have jurisdiction. It is now reasonable to treat recent U.S. and EU enforcement against dominant firm behavior as somewhat of a singular “modern mainstream” approach, although with some important divergent currents.” ABA Report at 18.

648,"May 3, 2020",The Immunity of the Tech Giants,"
By Kara Swisher, New York Times
If power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, how can we best describe the kind of power Big Tech will wield when the coronavirus crisis is over? How about this: The tech giants could have all the power and absolutely none of the accountability — at least all the power that will truly matter.
This is the conclusion that many are coming to as the post-pandemic future begins to come into focus. Wall Street sure is signaling that the power lies with tech companies, vaulting the stock of Amazon to close to $2,400 a share earlier this week, from $1,838 at the end of January. While the price fell on Friday to $2,286 a share, after Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he would spend future profits on the coronavirus response, that still gives the company a value of $1.14 trillion.
And all the other Big Tech stocks, which were hit in the first weeks of the pandemic, also are on an upward march to the top of the market-cap heap. Microsoft at $1.32 trillion. Apple at $1.26 trillion. Alphabet at $900 billion. And Facebook at $577 billion.  This group now makes up just over 20 percent of the S.&P. 500, which is a flashing yellow signal of what is to come.
That is to say, we live in a country in which the very big tech firms will be the very big winners in the economy of the future, which still does not look like it will be so pretty for most people and many companies, too. In a column about a month ago, I wrote about a problematic trend that would develop after the world had been turned upside down by the pandemic. “There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,” I wrote about tech’s leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. “This is obviously not a good thing in the long run.”

Esports or professional video gaming, is taking the world (of sports) by storm. So far, this relatively new and booming sector has not received much antitrust attention. In an era where both Big Tech and traditional sports undergo a tougher antitrust scrutiny than ever, this will no doubt change soon. With structures and actors similar to traditional sports, esports is widely expected to raise analogous antitrust issues. However, the very status of esports as “sports” under Union law is contested. Moreover, the absence of sports governing bodies in the traditional sense and the fundamental role played by game publishers and their IP rights in shaping virtually all aspects of the esports industry means that the competition-IP interface is likely to play a very prominent rule in future antitrust enforcement in this sector.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electronic sports (“esports”) or professional video gaming is taking the world (of sports) by storm. Since the first chess game was developed for computers in the 1950s, competitive video games have evolved, and now sell out world-leading venues such as the Staples Center, and are being taught in schools and universities. Most importantly, esports has become an industry in its own right, with a global annual revenue estimated at $1.5 billion in 2019. So far, this relatively new yet booming sector has not received much antitrust attention. In an...

650,"April 28, 2020",Antitrust in Times of National and Global Emergencies,"

By Reiko Aoki (Japan Fair Trade Commission)1
 
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is being compared to the Spanish flu and other pandemics of the past. Past experiences predict that society and the economy after the pandemic, when it subsides, will look very different from how it did at the start of 2020. We should anticipate structural change in the economy and society, and antitrust (and other policies) should keep this in mind. In this paper, I draw on the experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 and past pandemics to suggest how antitrust during and after pandemic should be.
The road to the post-pandemic world will be long and winding. Antitrust during the pandemic will be different from before and after. During the pandemic, the threshold for antitrust enforcement should be different to account for changes in both demand and supply capacity (i.e. production and distribution). However we should not forget that the crisis will be resolved by innovation such as new technologies, new goods and services provided by new entities, as well as simply new ways of doing things. Antitrust should promote this process and not get in the way. Once we overcome the pandemic, the economy will have changed, but the application of antitrust will be surprisingly unchanged.  The new technology developed as we face the pandemic, and the digital economy and digital platforms, will contribute to the recovery. There will also be new players providing novel solutions that we need to make sure will not be excluded.
 
Experience from the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011
The Great East Japan Earthquake refers to the sequence of disasters that started in 2011 with the earthquake off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku at 2:46 pm on March 11th. This was followed by tsunamis overcoming cities and villages along the coast. One of the tsunamis destroyed nuclear power plants belonging to Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings) in Fukushima prefecture. The earthquake and tsunami affected a large area in northeastern Japan, but the electricity blackout affected Tokyo and the surrounding six prefectures served by the power plants. The disaster resulted in losses of human life and of physical capital including roads, railroads, factories, storage facilities and retailers in a very large area.  Factories destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami included subcontractors in the electronics and automobile parts industries. The physical damage to factories and the transportation system was limited to three prefectures near the epicenter, but the production shutdown had national and global consequences. This was in addition to effects on producers of food and other final goods that sold nationally and globally. The electricity shutdown affected factories in a very wide area around Tokyo area for months.
The Japan Fair Trade Commission (“JFTC”) published “Examples of Antimonopoly Act Applications during the Earthquake Disaster and other Emergencies”2 to clarify situations where coordination among competitors would be tolerated during emergencies.  The examples focus on how firms may coordinate production of critical inputs when factories or supply routes have been disrupted. Such coordination could be organized either by central or local governments or by industry and trade associations. The JFTC stressed the need to adjust the trade-off between public benefit and efficiency losses in the short run.
During the months after the earthquake and the other disasters that followed, the distribution networks of convenience stores, which are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, became very important. Convenience chains, with their extensive 24 hour national networks that distribute goods to all their stores, became indispensable to consumers. This is because the shortage from factories closing down not just from earthquakes but from scheduled electricity blackouts in some areas required redistribution of goods at the national level. At the same time, national calls to reduce electricity consumption allowed convenience stores to reduce their lighting. Keeping a store well-lit throughout the night is critical when your rivals are also brightly-lit. The convenience stores’ profits increased, and came out stronger after the crisis. I note that the three major convenience franchises (Seven-Eleven, Family Mart and Lawson) continued to compete during the emergency.3 I also note that some of them have been under investigation for violation of subcontracting law since.
Japan has been engaged in “fukko” reconstruction since March 2011. The word “fukko” has two characters, “fuk” meaning to revive and “ko” meaning to promote. Some people have stressed the “ko” aspect, that the goal is not to rebuild everything as it was before, but to go further. In fact, taking years to rebuild former production capacity has sometimes been misplaced effort, because the relevant demand or workers are no longer there. Buyers and workers had adjusted to the changed environment. While we grieve for the hardship workers, consumers and managers went through, we can also be comforted by the fact that they have moved on, and are now prospering in the new environment.
I believe this is what will happen with COVID-19. Consumers, firms, and workers are adjusting. This will be very painful for some. Public policy should focus on assisting them. At the same time, part of the pain will be relieved by new services and goods. Indeed, for some, the situation will be an opportunity to develop new services or goods markets, or enter existing ones. And society will be better off. It will never be better than if the pandemic never occurred, but will be better off than if it had not adapted.
The role of the antitrust authority will be to adjust to the COVID-19 situation. It may be necessary to change the level of coordination allowed for the good of society in extraordinary circumstances. It is important to make clear the limits of any such adjustments, including the relevant time horizon. This can be done by publishing examples, as the JFTC did following the 2011 disaster. Publication of such examples at an early stage will save time and effort by making individual inquiries unnecessary. We should always remember that society will also benefit from new entrants. The solution to a temporary problem may not be to save suppliers of current goods and services but to have them replaced by better goods and services.  Thus, exemptions from antitrust rules should not be automatic.
 
Past Pandemics
Unfortunately, there is no denying that losses from pandemics are never recovered. The economy would have been better off if no pandemic had occurred. However, the losses of human and physical capital were not uniform across regions, which meant pandemics changed their distribution. Past pandemics also led to the adoption of new technologies. Shortages of labor after the Black Death in the 14th century led to higher wages, resulting in higher demand for manufactured goods, and urbanization. Evidence from the Spanish flu pandemic shows that the demographic shock led to fundamental changes in economic structures.4
During the pandemic, production and distribution should focus on curing or correcting the damage. If there is a shortage of medical products or food, we should concentrate on adjusting the system to address this shortage. If there is a break in the supply chain, competitors that produce substitutes could step in. This may require coordination that in normal times could be anticompetitive. But we also should remember that a new alternative could step in. We need to avoid coordination among incumbents that would keep entrants or new technologies out.
This is particularly important because evidence from previous pandemics is that economic and social structures do change. Policy should take this into account, as the Japanese experience shows. We should not concentrate on reconstructing the pre-pandemic world. We should strive to build a better economy and society, including by adopting new technologies.
 
The Pandemic and the Digital Economy
Digital platforms are in a constant state of flux, and the pandemic has introduced new forces that will influence their direction. E-commerce provides a valuable service when physical contact must be avoided. They serve a function similar to how convenience stores provided valuable services after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Their market position was strengthened in the process.  Matching services for workers should help shift workers from unemployment to where they are needed.
Apple and Google have exchanged information in order to build a pandemic fighting tool. This coordination will provide a valuable weapon to fight COVID-19. Concerns have been raised about personal information and privacy. This may be the moment when existing digital platforms find solutions to overcoming such privacy concerns.  At the same time, I would also be concerned about coordination among incumbents leading to new OS being shut out in the future. There is no OS in the horizon that I am aware of, but there is no reason to believe there will never be a better one in the future. This could be an ideal time for a new OS that better addresses personal information concerns to enter the mobile OS market.  We need to be careful this is not hindered in the name of the emergency.
We have already seen the rise of a new communication platform, Zoom. It captured user share by being a service that had attractive new attributes at an attractive price. It has improved quality of life for those locked down at home. I cannot help but wonder if Skype changed its course after it was acquired by Microsoft, allowing it to be overtaken by Zoom.

The original motivations of antitrust suggest an alternative remedy for market power: changes to corporate governance to include stakeholders who are subject to this power. In contrast to structural and behavioral remedies, “stakeholder remedies,” as we call them, have several desirable features. Stakeholder remedies allow corporations to harness benefits of scale while blocking their ability to exploit market power and avoiding cumbersome direct regulation by nation states.  Thus, such remedies have the potential to resolve the key tensions in existing competition policy, and could stimulate a new inclusive democratic paradigm for corporate governance.

I. INTRODUCTION
Dissatisfaction with the present state of corporate capitalism has reached something of a boiling point. Global business elites are finally responding to years of simmering discontent, exemplified by social movements like Occupy Wall Street and by progressive presidential candidates’ proposals calling for more aggressive antitrust and regulatory policies. The fundamental purpose of the corporation – long defined by the shareholder value paradigm – is being revisited. Business leaders and policymakers seem to be summoning a reorientation of the corporation around stakeholders, rather than shareholders. The Business Roundtable, a group of nearly 200 chief executives of major U.S. corporations, brok...

In this short article, we evaluate the role of structural and behavioral remedies in big tech sectors. First, we highlight the prominence of structural solutions in recent policy debates, discussing both their limitations and their potential role in light of the economic and technological features of digital markets. Then, we emphasize the importance of more behavioral solutions and the role that they may play out in future policy developments. In particular, we highlight the importance of instruments such as portability measures that can reduce entry barriers created by network externalities, as well as the role of other behavioral remedies that can exploit the reduced scarcity constraints of digital bottlenecks such as ranked-display of results on a platform.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the preoccupation about the state of digital industries intensifies across various areas of public policy – ranging from privacy, data protection, labor regulation, electoral integrity, and market power – the “break up big tech” slogan has gained growing centrality in competition policy and related debates concerned with the excessive levels of concentration and dominance of large digital platforms. In the U.S., for example, Elizabeth Warren has argued that tech firms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have accumulated too much power over the economy and democracy, and should be broken up.2 Chris Hughes, ...

653,"April 16, 2020",Verizon Buys Zoom Rival BlueJeans,"
Verizon announced on Thursday that it has entered into an agreement to acquire videoconferencing and event platform BlueJeans Network. The companies did not announce the terms of the deal in a press release, but The Wall Street Journal reports that Verizon will pay less than $500 million for the company, which has some 15,000 business clients.
The move comes as rival videoconferencing app Zoom has soared in popularity as more people work from home. But Zoom has been faced with continued security issues, including widespread instances of “Zoombombing,” where uninvited guests crash a Zoom meeting. It updated its iOS app late last month to remove code that sent device data to Facebook. Zoom also had to rewrite parts of its privacy policy after it was discovered that users’ personal information could be used to target ads.
Unlike Zoom and Microsoft’s Skype video calling service, BlueJeans doesn’t have a free version and is primarily aimed at business users, the Journal notes.
“BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work,” Verizon said in a statement announcing the deal.

Caitlin Chin, Brookings Institution
Two years ago, Brookings Institution scholars William Galston and Clara Hendrickson highlighted signs that U.S. antitrust enforcement was undergoing a “serious re-evaluation.” Around that time, members of both the House and Senate introduced antitrust bills, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to evaluate the consumer welfare standard, and the Department of Justice filed an appeal to the proposed AT&T and Time Warner merger.
But since then, even more signs have emerged. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent special orders to Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, requesting that each company submit detailed documentation regarding previously unreported acquisitions from 2010 to 2019.

655,"March 26, 2020",COVID-19 Could Delay Tech Antitrust Probes,"
The coronavirus pandemic could delay the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust investigation of tech companies because of workplace changes in both agencies. 
The FTC is conducting investigations into big tech companies, including reviews of a decade’s worth of acquisitions for Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These purchases were too small to warrant review at the time of acquisition. The DOJ is also looking at the practices of online platforms. Currently, work for these investigations will be occurring remotely. 
“It’s just impossible for FTC lawyers and economists to work at the same pace from home — and that’s necessarily going to slow the progress of the inquiries down,” former Federal Trade Commission chair and current George Washington University law professor, William Kovacic told Protocol. “I would expect all of the timetables that authorities have developed are going to be stretched out.” 
An FTC spokesperson stated it “is adjusting to these new and challenging circumstances” and the vast majority of employees are working from home. Agency employees, much like millions of others, are adjusting to the new normal, juggling work and other needs, such as taking care of children who are now home because schools are closed. 
Tad Lipsky, director of the Competition Advocacy Program at the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University, stated that the “ubiquity of digitization” indicates that “it shouldn’t be too difficult for many forms of antitrust enforcement to occur without requiring physical proximity of human beings.” However, “key points in the process” could be challenging to do from home, including tasks requiring physical access to records and offices.  
“Almost all internal and external meetings will be handled by telephone or videoconference, and parties should assume that meetings will be held remotely, rather than in person, until further notice,” FTC Executive Director David Robbins said. “Despite these procedural changes, the FTC will be conducting the business of the Commission without interruption.”
The FTC has canceled “noncritical” travel, prohibited unplanned visitors, and the vast majority of employees are working remotely with “limited exceptions.” There have also been some deadline shifts, such as postponing depositions to ensure they occur over secure videoconferencing and adding 30 days for pending or proposed mergers for review. The deadline shifts show this is impacting efficiency. “Agencies around the world are basically indicating that the various measures to keep people out of the office and in their homes will slow the efficiency of enforcement and investigation,” Kovacic said.

656,"March 24, 2020","5G, FRAND Licensing, and EU Competition Law: Analytical Rigor and Persistent Myths","
It is now undisputed that 5G and IoT will revolutionize many industries, from energy to healthcare, manufacturing, and mobility. The dissemination of 5G cellular technology, connecting devices to the Internet on the basis of technical interoperability standards, will generate very significant consumer benefits. However, as 5G technology is designed for many different uses and parties situated at multiple and different levels in the production chain may request licenses from SEP holders, the question arises whether antitrust law sets any limits to SEP holders’ discretion to offer FRAND licenses to interested parties. Not surprisingly, proponents of indiscriminate dissemination of 5G technology sometimes claim that there is an antitrust duty to offer licenses to all such interested parties. This contribution briefly discusses a number of necessary conditions that must be met to conclude that such an affirmative duty exists. Along the way it seeks to dispel a few popular antitrust myths in the area of SEP licensing.

The current contentions over SEP licensing in mobile telecommunications is primarily a result of the success of standardization to build a multi-trillion-dollar market. This success has generated a large economic surplus, whose distribution among different actors in the value chain is the focus of these contentions. This article illustrates the battle among market actors to define the meaning of FRAND through policy interventions that seek to change the rules of the game in alignment with their strategic interests. This article takes a first step towards building an operative model to describe the political processes behind the construction of the meaning of FRAND by defining the self-assertive interests, key normative concepts and claims, and legitimizing arenas where the concept of FRAND is actively socially constructed.

This paper explores where we stand after two decades of European Commission investigations, substantial patent litigation in national courts, and a major judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union devoted to SEP licensing and its relationship with EU competition law. As will be seen, while consensus has been reached over several issues, a lot remains to be done. This paper is divided in four parts. Part II describes the issues that have been addressed, albeit not always satisfactorily, by competition authorities and courts over the past years. Part III discusses some of the SEP licensing issues that still largely need to be solved with a focus on six questions: (i) what is the nature of the FRAND commitment?; (iii) what is a FRAND license?; (ii) should the gaps left by the CJEU in Huawei v. ZTE be filled and if so how?; (iv) can a court that finds that local SEPs have been infringed force the infringer to take a global license on pain of an injunction?; (v) access for all v. license to all: What are the obligations of the SEP holder?; and (vi) how should SEP licensing adapt the IoT context?

This paper recalls the EU antitrust provisions relating to patent pools and standard setting, the conclusions of an expert group tasked with the question of identifying what if anything the public sector should do to promote aggregation of patents to foster licencing of patents and reviews some recent academic papers of a theoretical and empirical nature. The broad observation is that patent pools remain pro-competitive and can foster licencing of technology in particular standard essential patents and that the possible drawbacks can be addressed by existing antitrust rules. This leaves open the open the question of how best to foster more participation in pools to facilitate licencing by small players on either side of the market.

I. INTRODUCTION
In certain technological areas, particularly those involving key enabling technologies in the ICT sector, ownership of technologies and the patents that read on them has become fragmented. This has created challenges in the technology market for both buyers and sellers or, as is more commonly the case, licensors and licensees. Licensees are faced with the challenge of negotiating licenses with several patent holders. This is particularly the case when the patents read on standards whose implementation inevitably involve the infringement of standard essential patents (“SEPs”) unless these are subject of a license agreement. Patent holders, depending on whether t...

In May 2019, Judge Lucy H. Koh of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a decision in FTC v. Qualcomm. She found that Qualcomm violated the Sherman Act by, among other things, refusing to offer a license to its standard essential patents (“SEPs”) to rival manufacturers of baseband processor modems. Some commentators have suggested that the effects of Judge Koh’s judgment transcend the litigation brought against Qualcomm and create for SEP holders a general duty to offer a license to SEPs to component manufacturers. However, Judge Koh’s conclusions about the existence of an antitrust duty to license have little support in either the facts of the case or in courts’ prior decisions. It is questionable whether they will survive the scrutiny of the Ninth Circuit or, upon further appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States.

The paper sketches a comparison between two main models for the “organization of innovation” in digital markets: the standard setting organization (“SSO”) and the silo/platform (“SILO”). The analysis focuses on four dimensions – price, speed, transparency/social accountability, and competition – of the innovation processes of these models, and aims at shedding some light on their relative value and efficiency in terms of the elusive concept of the “quality of innovation.” We argue that, whereas for two of the categories chosen for the comparison – speed and transparency/accountability – the superiority of one model over the other is relatively straightforward, as regards pricing and competition the related evaluation is more complex and the conclusions that can be drawn are more nuanced.

In this paper, we propose an analysis of how the “organization of innovation” may affect its ultimate “quality” in certain important dimensions. In general, we start by recognizing the existence of at least four institutionally stylized models for the organization of innovation along an industrial value chain. These models can be led back to (1) a traditional firm, (2) a standard setting organization (SSOs), (3) a silo/platform system, (4) an open source community.

Pressure has been rising on US officials to increase and improve testing for the fast-spreading virus, which has reached almost every U.S. state and infected more than 1,660 people in the country.
“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s gonna be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” Trump said.
“Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now, made tremendous progress.” 
An administration presentation showed a potential user would be asked several questions on the website and then given a recommendation as to whether they should get a coronavirus test.

I. BACKGROUND
China’s courts and antitrust authorities have increasingly played active roles in setting fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) royalty rates for the wireless communication industry. The Shenzhen court applied a very low rate in Huawei v. InterDigital back in 2014, which was vacated as a result of a settlement. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court and the higher people’s court affirmed the rate for China’s own WiFi standard in favor of a China-based technology company (IWNCOMM), in 2017. In September 2019, Nanjing Intellectual Property Court issued the China FRAND rates for Conversant’s 3G/4G patent portfolio. Of course, the most influential decision is the anti-monopoly enforcement authority’s de...

Powerful shareholders are lobbying SoftBank to help bring about an alliance between ride-hailing groups Grab and Gojek, south-east Asia’s biggest internet unicorns, which are bleeding cash in a bruising battle for market share, according to multiple people with knowledge of the discussions.
The talks centre on a tie-up in Indonesia. The world’s fourth-most populous country is the most lucrative market for Jakarta-headquartered Gojek, whose backers include Tencent and Google, and Singapore-based Grab, which counts SoftBank and Microsoft as investors. Both have intensified efforts to win customers there in the past 18 months. 
“The forces at play here are higher than simply what Grab or Gojek want — or indeed don’t want. This is about a number of long-term influential shareholders in both companies who want to either stem the losses or find a way to exit their investments,” said one Grab investor.  
There have been on and off talks between the two bitter rivals for at least two years, but in recent months there has been a new urgency, these people added.

Sen. Mark Warner has written several gig companies, including Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Postmates, Grubhub, and DoorDash, about financial help for workers as well as several ideas to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, according to a report.
“As the United States mobilizes to respond to the recent outbreak and spread of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, I write to urge you to publicly commit to prioritizing your workers’ economic security and the broader public health during this response,” he wrote.
“I strongly urge that you attempt to address the potential financial hardship for your workers if they are sick or have to self-quarantine during this time. In order to limit the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that platform companies lead by example by committing that economic uncertainty will not be deterrents to their workers following public health guidance during the response.”
The senator’s press release claimed that gig and contingent workers were the most vulnerable to an outbreak of the coronavirus. And due to their status, they generally don’t have paid leave or health insurance.
“As a result, many of these workers risk missing income or paying high out-of-pocket healthcare costs if they fully comply with public health instructions to be tested, self-quarantine or take other ‘social distancing’ measures,“ the release stated.
Uber stated it is exploring compensation for drivers who have been diagnosed with the disease, and that it will keep the senator updated. Lyft stated it is prepared to coordinate with government officials, and DoorDash stated it will talk to the Senator about “innovative solutions” to help workers.
Delivery company Postmates recently introduced a way for people to drop off items without contact, and stated it would “continue to encourage employees, merchants, consumers and all parts of our community to follow safety protocols, such as washing hands and staying in if you are sick.”
Microsoft stated it will continue to pay hourly workers their wages even if their hours are reduced due to concerns over the virus and Facebook stated it would pay those “contingent” workers as well.

668,"March 3, 2020",FTC Taking a 10-Year Antitrust Look-Back at Big Tech,"
Are These the First Steps Toward a New Approach to Merger Control?
Big Tech mergers make big headlines, but there is much more to a deal than how much money changes hands. More important questions need to be answered, such as how much future innovation might be lost, how much healthy competition will be eliminated, and what volumes of consumer data will suddenly be controlled by one or only a handful of companies.
Some lower-cost acquisitions fly under the radar of antitrust law enforcement agencies. But should they?
Criticized for ignoring “killer acquisitions” and going too easy on Big Tech – approving more and more mergers but not taking more enforcement action – the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has decided to revisit all Big Tech deals consummated during the last 10 years.
Specifically, the Commission has demanded information about acquisitions not reported to antitrust agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. The FTC’s recent orders require Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft to provide information and documents on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of transactions that each company consummated between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019.
The FTC issued the orders under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which authorizes it to study matters even if they do not have a specific law enforcement purpose. The FTC said the information it seeks will deepen its understanding of Big Tech’s acquisition activity, including how the companies report their transactions to federal antitrust agencies, and whether they are making anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors that fall below HSR filing and reporting thresholds. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said this effort will help evaluate whether federal agencies are getting adequate notice of anticompetitive transactions.
According to the orders, each company must identify acquisitions that were not reported to the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice under the HSR Act and provide information similar to that requested on the HSR form. The FTC demands the companies provide information on their acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment agreements, agreements to hire key personnel from other companies, and post-employment covenants not to compete. The FTC has also demanded more information about post-acquisition product development and pricing, including “whether and how acquired assets were integrated and how acquired data has been treated.”
“The Commission plans to use the information obtained in this study to examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals, including whether acquisitions not subject to HSR notification might have raised competitive concerns, and the nature and extent of other agreements that may restrict competition. The Commission also seeks to learn more about how small firms perform after they are acquired by large technology firms,” the FTC press release said.
Supporters of this action say Big Tech has been able to gobble up innovative competitors at the expense of consumers. Critics call it a fishing expedition, question the Commission’s motives, and fear it could lead to the unwinding of deals as old as 10 years.
Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra issued a statement praising the study of the Big Tech competitive landscape and urged the Commission to next turn its sights on the healthcare sector.
“During the last three decades, the share of independent dialysis facilities has shrunk drastically and two national chains now own the majority of dialysis facilities and earn nearly all of the industry’s revenue, with most acquisitions occurring below the HSR thresholds. Similar patterns of ‘stealth consolidation’ have been observed in pharmaceutical and hospital markets,” Wilson and Chopra said.

The Internet Accountability Project (IAP) started last year and quickly joined the growing crusade against big tech. At the time the non-profit group refused to say who was financing it. Now according to a new report from Bloomberg, one of its benefactors is Oracle.
Oracle donated between US$25,000 and US$99,999 last year to the internet project, according to a new political-giving report Oracle posted on its website. The group calls itself a conservative non-profit advocating for tougher privacy rules and stronger antitrust enforcement against the internet giants.
The IAP financing is just one part of an aggressive, and sometimes secretive, battle Oracle has been waging against its biggest rivals, including Amazon and Alphabet’s Google.
Oracle spent years fighting to unseat Amazon as the front-runner for a lucrative Pentagon cloud contract, which was awarded to Microsoft in October.
The Redwood City, California, company has also been locked in a decade-long legal dispute with Google, claiming the search-engine giant violated Oracle copyrights by including some Java programming code in the Android phone. Oracle acquired Java’s developer, Sun Microsystems, in 2010.
Earlier this month, IAP filed an amicus brief supporting Oracle’s position in the case. IAP stated it wants to “ensure that Google respects the copyrights of Oracle and other innovators.” The US Supreme Court on March 24 will hear oral arguments in the Google v Oracle America case.

671,"February 26, 2020",Diagnosing “Killer” Acquisitions: FTC Market Study to Review Past M&A Deals in Big Tech,"
John Eichlin, Marie-Marie de Fays; Linklaters
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a rare market study to investigate whether non-reportable past acquisitions by the major tech companies included “killer” acquisitions of nascent competitors. The study is intended to determine if changes to merger control rules are appropriate to cast a broader net and ensure that potentially problematic deals are reviewed proactively. The initial focus of the review is on the tech sector, but it potentially has much broader implications for the merger rules across industries. And the FTC may turn next to healthcare and other innovative sectors.
Merger
reportability rules in the spotlight
The FTC has sent information requests to five large tech companies (Alphabet / Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft). These requests reportedly ask the recipients to document their acquisition strategies and outline the details of the transactions they completed over the past decade. In addition to focusing on potential “killer acquisitions” that fell short of the notification thresholds, the requests also target other arrangements, including voting and board appointment agreements and agreements to hire key personnel. Consistent with the FTC’s parallel focus on employment-related issues, the requests also call for information on related post-employment non-competes for key employees.
The FTC has special authority to conduct studies separate from its law enforcement authority. Under this process, the FTC can issue legally-binding orders to companies to obtain information and documents. Typically, the outcome of such studies results in a report summarizing findings, and sometimes including recommendations for further actions. Based on this study, the FTC could explore possible measures to expand reportability requirements or introduce notification rules, without needing congressional involvement, and with implications beyond the tech sector…

In this month’s edition of CPI Talks we have the pleasure of speaking with Paul Gilbert and Maurits Dolmans, of the London office of Cleary Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton LLP. Maurits recently wrote articles entitled “Should We Disrupt Antitrust Law?” and “Pandora’s Box of Online Ills.” Paul has given presentations on “Competition Law and Big Data.” Both have extensive experience in the IT sector. They have advised various clients in this area, but speak here on their own behalf.
Thank you, Paul and Maurits, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
1. Recent months and years have seen intense discussion on “big data” and its role in competition in the digital economy. Much of this discussion relates to the question of whether, in the language of the competition rules, “big data” are a mere asset, a “barrier to entry,” an “essential facility,” or all of the above. Is the classic terminology misleading when applied to this new phenomenon? Rather, does this debate merely underline the need for a careful case-by-case approach to competition issues involving complex technological questions?
We don’t think the terms need changing. They are part of a framework that is used to differentiate those situations where competition intervention is needed from those where it is not. Intervening in the wrong cases will only undermine incentives to invest in collecting and analyzing data.
In most cases, data are an input for a product or service. It is not the service itself. So, is it right to ask whether data are an essential facility? Put another way, do competitors need access to that particular set of data for competition to exist in a downstream market?  If not, intervention is unwarranted, and could do more harm than good. There may, in theory, be cases where data are an essential facility, because the data are indispensable and the source is no longer available. But they will be the exception rather than the rule.
Holding data is not like owning a harbor or controlling the electricity network. In those cases, anyone trying to operate a shipping service or supply electricity may have to have access to the infrastructure. Data are not “owned” or controlled in that way. I could record the color preference of every car buyer if I thought the information was going to be useful, and I may be only person to “own” that data. But that doesn’t make that database an essential facility, and it doesn’t stop anyone else doing exactly the same thing. Many types of data are “non-rivalrous goods,” in the sense that they can be duplicated and recreated without limit.
It is also tempting to treat all types of data as the same, when they are not. Personal data are different from observed data, for instance. Observed data often has a short lifespan. For my car-color database to remain useful, I would probably have to repeat the exercise regularly. Otherwise the data will become stale and worthless. And I may not collect it at all if I had to give it away to all my competitors.
Personal data are different. If a consumer uploads their photographs and contacts to a social media platform, they could become locked in. If many users are locked in, that may create a barrier to entry for new social media platforms – in the sense that gathering an equivalent set of data is going to be more difficult or more expensive for the new entrant than it was for the first mover. In such a situation, ensuring that consumers can transfer their information freely and easily between different platforms can be pro-competitive. This, in turn, may require standard setting to ensure that data can be easily ported to new service providers.
So, the terminology is right. It just needs to be applied carefully, and seen in context.
2. Information scientists famously refer to the so-called “DIKW pyramid.” In short, mere raw “data” provide “information” that experts can use to produce “knowledge” and (hopefully) “wisdom” that can yield valuable results. This leads some commentators to suggest that, at least in certain circumstances, data should not be considered to be a true “barrier to entry”: the real barrier would be the technology and expertise needed to extract “wisdom.” To what extent should competition practitioners, enforcers, and courts rely on expertise from the sciences to assess these and other questions in individual cases?
We agree. In this information pyramid, data are merely raw measurements, whereas information is an understanding of the relations between the data, knowledge is an understanding of the patterns that emerge, and intelligence or wisdom is an understanding of the principles that allow judgment, better decision making, and prediction.
Data are useless without the ability to analyze them intelligently and creatively. Take away the data from any online service provider (but leave the engineers) and they will quickly be back in business. Take away the engineers (but leave the data) and they will soon be in trouble.
There are lots of examples. Start-up companies such as WhatsApp, Hailo, BlaBlaCar, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest have all been able to build successful and innovative products with access to little or no data at the start. If data are a barrier, it can certainly be overcome.
Studies have shown that data quickly loses its incremental value after a certain point. According to the law of diminishing returns, once a critical volume is reached, the marginal value of additional data for statistical analysis is limited. There is no value in simply collecting more and more data.
Competition authorities and courts should take this into account. They need to ask what data is really needed, how much is needed, and how easily it can be collected. Data is everywhere, it is cheap to collect, can be bought and sold, and is non-rivalrous – it is not used up like oil.
So, it is right to think of intelligence and creativity as the real drivers of competition. As to whether they could become barriers to entry, it seems unlikely. There seems to be no shortage of either.
3. Recent reports (including the UK Furman Report, the EU Commission’s Crémer Report, and the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Report) discuss the treatment of data under the competition rules in some detail. Specifically, the Crémer Report underlines the need to adopt a careful approach to the “essential facilities” concept if applied to data. In your view, are there grounds for a modified approach to the “indispensability” and “new product” criteria under the classic essential facilities rules should they be applied to data?
Many competition authorities and regulators are grappling with the question whether we should be quicker to intervene in digital, data-driven markets. Should companies that collect data be required to give access to that data as a way of helping their competitors, even if they have not done anything that would otherwise be considered anticompetitive?
This is market engineering rather than antitrust, and is a risky path to follow. It means forcing Firm A to support Firm B even if Firm B does not need that support to compete. Forcing data-sharing in this way would pervert the normal competitive incentives of both. Firm A will be less inclined to invest in collecting data and designing innovative ways of doing so if it has to share the results with its competitors. Firm B will not have incentives to invest either, because it can free-ride on the efforts of Firm A.
The Crémer Report recognizes precisely this concern. It recognizes the risks that a lower threshold for intervention would have on commercial incentives. It says that “a thorough analysis will be required” to determine whether access to data is “truly indispensable” in order to compete in neighboring markets. It also recommends that competition law principles should be central to any sector-specific regulation that is designed to mandate data access. 
We agree. It is easy to lose sight of the benefits that come from companies investing in collecting and analyzing data in ever more inventive ways. Undermining these incentives could be hugely damaging. As we said before, with respect to personal data, the better option is to give individuals the right to port their data between different services providers, so as to encourage the latter to keep improving their offering to persuade the users to stay with them.
4. One of the most controversial forms of “big data” relates to personal information used to provide services such as online social media, search, and advertising. Individuals’ rights concerning such data are regulated separately under rules such as the EU GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Certain competition remedies (notably mandated access) would raise obvious potential conflicts with these specific regulations. How should this circle be squared? Is this an argument for non-intervention by competition enforcers in cases of such potential conflict, or at least careful remedy design (e.g. anonymization of user data if disclosure is mandated)? Is enough being done by data protection regulators and competition enforcers to coordinate in this regard?
It would be perverse for competition law remedies to override data protection. Central to GDPR and other data protection rules is the principle that individuals should be able to control what happens to their personal data – information about them.
I may be happy to share my personal information, health records and banks details with one company that I trust, but not with others. That is undermined if the company is then forced to share my details with someone else that I don’t trust, or have perhaps never heard of. When a consumer shares their personal data, they have to be confident that it will be protected and won’t be shared without their consent.
A good example of how the system can work is in Open Banking. If I want to use a new service – perhaps a FinTech start-up company – that company will be able to access my bank account details securely, but only if I give my consent.
Many of the largest technology companies (including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter) are currently working on a similar initiative, called the Data Transfer Project. The purpose is to allow consumers to transfer their information freely between providers using open source coding. It will mean that users do not have to download their data from one service before uploading to another. This is procompetitive. It helps users to switch even more quickly between providers and try out new services, as well as backing up their data on multiple services. And the user always remains in control. This approach to “portable data” creates new opportunities for intermediary services or portals that help users transfer data, or manage multiple platform settings.
This type of initiative facilitates competition and new entry, while still respecting consumers’ rights and data protection rules.
5. A common complaint levied against companies possessing large datasets is that their existing “scale” renders it impossible for new entrants to compete. Are there alternative means that regulators, policymakers, and industry could use to make large-scale data available to new entrants (e.g. databases of photo, video, or anonymized personal data that could be used to train machine learning algorithms)? Would such an approach be feasible as a remedy in a hypothetical competition case? Or is such an approach best left to bespoke industry or government-mandated initiatives?
It is wrong to assume that scale is necessarily critical or a barrier to entry. This idea ignores the law of diminishing returns. Experience in many areas where data are used as an input, like machine translation, image processing, speech recognition, or teaching artificial intelligence systems, the first million data are much more important than the second and so forth. Huge amounts of open source datasets are increasingly available for AI training (from sources as various as kaggle.com, FiveThirtyEight, Google Public Data Explorer, or from EU Open Data Portal, Data.gov. WHO Open Data repository, and World Bank Open Data, etc.). Open source software and cloud computing makes it easier for start-ups than ever before to run complex computations on these open data.
We have already mentioned several examples of companies that have been able to grow quickly without having access to large datasets when they started. In each of these cases, “scale” was not a barrier. If anything, they show that innovation is critical and that data are easy to gather.
The European Commission has also considered this question many times in merger cases. Whenever it has looked at markets in detail, it has found that rivals are able collect the data they need.  In Facebook/WhatsApp, for example, it found that “there will continue to be a large amount of Internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes.”
In Microsoft/Skype, it found that barriers to entry were low, pointing to the “immediate success” of new entrants Viber, Fring, and Tango. Viber was downloaded more than a million times within three days of its launch, 10 million times within two months, and 15 million times within six months.
There may be cases where access to an existing database is critical for competition to exist. It will depend on the type of data and whether the database is replicable. In the UK, for example, the National Health Service provides access to huge amount of anonymized healthcare data for analysis. That data wouldn’t be available otherwise and cannot be replicated. But this is an exception. Online user data are very unlikely to fall into this category.
In the EU, we have a tendency to blame U.S.-based online firms (ignoring China for the time being) for the lack of EU online powerhouses, and for the difficulties of digital disruption. They are conveniently big targets. But a focus on data sharing is not the solution. The societal problems resulting from digital disruption should be solved by targeted and proportional regulation, rather than forcing firms to share data across the board. If we want to grow EU-based innovative powerhouses, the answer is a policy of creating an environment where innovation can flourish: innovation hubs combining academic centers of excellence and existing technology businesses with carefully targeted Government-sponsored open projects, which together can fertilize start-up businesses by providing talent and risk capital, a culture of entrepreneurship, critical thinking, and creativity, nurtured in an environment of fair and balanced tax laws, IPRs strong enough to encourage innovation but not so strict as to block new entry, and competition rules that preserve opportunities for new entrants without punishing them once they become successful. There is plenty of big data; what is scarcer is technical talent and business creativity, and wise regulators. ",Microsoft
673,"February 24, 2020","Essential Facilities Fallacy: Big Tech, Winner-Take-All Markets, and Anticompetitive Effects","
There have been calls to treat data as an essential facility to reduce barriers to entry in the digital economy where a “winner-take-all” dynamic is often present. In such markets, traditional enforcement may fail to enjoin conduct, or an acquisition, that lowers welfare in expectation because anticompetitive effects, regardless of their magnitude, are given no weight if deemed unlikely to occur. The authors consider several proposals to fine-tune competition law and argue that calls to regulate Big Tech companies like public utilities should be viewed with skepticism because they ignore dynamic competition, the complexity of micromanaging a rapidly evolving sector of the economy, and the very purpose of competition law – to protect competition, not competitors.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Big Tech superstar firms, which is a term used by many to refer to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and sometimes Microsoft, have grown to be among the largest companies in the world principally through innovation, data harvesting and the popularity of their products. Over the past few years, there have been calls for action by populists, the press and politicians to reduce the power of the so-called “dataopolies.”2

Alphabet’s Google has reached a settlement with state attorneys general over the states’ use of consultants in their antitrust investigation of the internet search giant, reported CNBC. 
Google in October went to court to restrict the Texas Attorney General’s office from disclosing sensitive information to consultants who have worked for competitors and other companies such as News and Microsoft Corp that have complained about Google to regulators. Both sides reached a settlement that places some restrictions on how the experts can access confidential business information, Google announced on Friday, February 21.
The settlement means that potential roadblocks to the states’ probe may be cleared for now, allowing the attorneys general to continue digging into Google’s business. A delay to the investigation could hinder the states’ ability to uncover important information about Google’s competitive practices. Though antitrust investigations are notoriously slow and fact-intensive, the rapid pace of change in the tech industry makes it especially important for investigators to move swiftly in order to impose remedies before they are no longer relevant.
Texas is leading the the probe into Google’s digital advertising business, which is backed by 49 other attorneys general from US states and territories. The investigation is expanding into other areas of Google’s business as well, including search and Android.

675,"February 19, 2020",Europe Wants To Grown Its Own Tech Giants,"
The European Union outlined proposals to bolster its digital economy and keep it from being overly reliant on foreign companies, while cracking down on those companies.
Apple, based in California, and Samsung, from South Korea, make the most popular phones in Europe. Facebook owns the most widely used social networks, Google dominates online search and advertising, and Amazon controls e-commerce. European companies run their businesses on cloud infrastructure from Amazon and Microsoft. The region’s wireless networks are largely made with equipment from the Chinese giant Huawei, reported The New York Times.  
The European Union on Wednesday, February 19, outlined an attempt to restore what officials called “technological sovereignty,” seeking tougher regulation of the world’s biggest tech platforms, new rules for artificial intelligence, and more public spending for the European tech sector.
Officials said the effort is a “generational project,” and the ideas reflect a growing concern among European leaders that countries in the region are overly dependent on services provided by companies based elsewhere. With the global economy becoming ever more centered around technology, European countries would have a harder time creating jobs and generating tax revenue to fund government services.
“We want to find European solutions in the digital age,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union that is crafting the policy, said at a news conference in Brussels.

676,"February 18, 2020",EU Will Look At Smaller Acquisitions Made By Big Tech,"
Europe’s top competition authority will look into smaller acquisitions made by big technology giants after a “shopping spree” in recent years by American firms, as regulators in the region look to ramp up pressure on major US players.
According to CNBC, the continent has been a hot bed of technology acquisitions by major US firms over the last decade, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence.
High-profile purchases like the US$8.5 billion Microsoft paid for Skype in 2011 or the US$19 billion Facebook bought WhatsApp for in 2014 often make the headlines, but there are dozens of other smaller acquisitions that have happened.
Last year for example, Apple bought Spectral Edge for an undisclosed sum. It’s a UK-based start-up working on photography technology. Twitter meanwhile acquired Fabula AI, another UK-based artificial intelligence firm. There are many more examples like this involving other technology giants such as Alphabet and Facebook.
These smaller acquisitions haven’t warranted much attention from the European Union’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager, though that could change.
“What we will try to do is to find ways to make sure that we see these acquisitions because sometimes these businesses are quite small, and maybe the sums, the turnover will not meet our thresholds,” Vestager told CNBC’s Silvia Amaro in an interview on Tuesday, February 18.
“What we would like to see (is) if that would … make an entrenched position even more entrenched. So we are developing methods to make sure that we actually see these acquisitions, to make sure that it is pro-competition, it is pro-innovation, and not the opposite,” she added.
Vestager did not expand on what these “methods” would be.
The EU’s competition commissioner said big tech firms have gone on a “shopping spree” in Europe, calling it a “positive.”
“One could see that as a kind of distributed innovation that happens here, but then being bought and integrated in giant companies. And that of course is … positive to see that the ecosystem works,” Vestager told CNBC.

677,"February 17, 2020",Google’s Waze Acquisition Likely Target Of FTC Scrutiny,"
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating acquisitions made by big tech firms in the past 10 years and has a special focus on Google’s US$1.1 billion purchase of mapping app Waze, Bloomberg reported on Friday, February 14.
In June 2013, the FTC approved Google’s acquisition of the Israeli company behind the crowdsourced navigation app Waze. It was different from Google’s own Maps, in that users could exchange information about police in the area or traffic-causing construction. Waze was considered by some to be part social media site, part navigation app.
Antitrust experts said the FTC is now looking back on the acquisition because it put the two most popular mapping apps under the ownership of the same company: Google. The FTC stated owning both gave Google control over and access to even more user data. Further, by purchasing Waze, Google got rid of its main competitor. 
Bilal Sayyed, the FTC’s director for the Office of Policy Planning, told reporters on Tuesday. February 11, that it is taking another look at several deals from the past. 
“Certainly, Waze is one of them,” said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and former Justice Department antitrust official. 
Google’s many acquisitions led to it becoming the leader in search, mapping, and advertising, which has now global watchdogs asking whether this dominance hurts businesses and customers. Reviewing earlier acquisitions can help answer any questions. The agency stated the Waze deal is a clear case that needs review.
“It was literally Google acquiring its number one competitor in maps,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, which is pushing for a crackdown on big internet platforms. “It was a bad deal that should have been blocked.”
When Google announced the deal, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the “move eliminates Waze as a potential acquisition target for competitors who could use the app’s collection of data and 50 million users to bolster their own location-based products.”
The FTC’s investigation into the biggest five tech companies in the US expanded into an inquiry about acquisitions last week. The FTC is investigating Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, and Microsoft over antitrust implications, and it recently asked the companies to turn over information regarding takeovers of smaller companies between the years of 2010 and 2019.

678,"February 16, 2020",Jay Carney Blasts Politicians For Accusing Amazon Of “Taking Over Grocery In America”,"
Amazon’s top spokesman on Wednesday, February 12, accused lawmakers and and “elite newspapers” of creating the illusion that Amazon would be “taking over grocery in America” when it acquired Whole Foods.
“When we announced that we were going to acquire Whole Foods, you would have thought based on television commentary and commentary in both Washington, DC among government officials as well as in the elite newspapers that we were taking over grocery in America — that we were going to be the largest grocer in America — because we were in fact buying the grocery store that a lot of those folks shop at,” Jay Carney, Amazon’s head of public relations and policy, said in an interview on CNBC. “But as you know, Whole Foods is one of the smallest known grocery chains in America.”
Carney made the remarks after the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday announced an antitrust probe into acquisitions made by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google parent company Alphabet.
Carney said Wednesday that Amazon, including Whole Foods, accounts for about 3-4% of the grocery market.
“Many, many of the chains you know, the big names you know, are just significantly bigger than we are,” he said. “So the competition matter is hard to argue because I don’t see the argument that we are somehow anticompetitive in grocery at 3 or 4% of the market.”

The current academic and policy initiatives to address competition concerns arising from digital platforms rely on a model of competition for the market. That model is presented as a better account of market processes around these platforms than the traditional model of competition in the market. Yet competition for the market has not taken hold in enforcement despite having been around for more than 20 years. This contribution puts forward a model of competition on the market, where market definition is a competitive parameter and is therefore endogenous to the competitive process.

680,"February 13, 2020",Google Says EU Antitrust Regulators Holding Back Innovation,"
Google defended its business model on Wednesday, February 12,claiming that making innovative products was at its core rather than helping rivals, as it sought to overturn a €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion at the time) EU antitrust fine at Europe’s second-highest court.
The legal fight comes as European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager gears up to take on US tech giants and Chinese companies with legislation in the coming months, on top of ongoing antitrust investigations.
“Competition law does not require Google to hold back innovation or compromise its quality to accommodate rivals. Otherwise, competition would be restricted and innovation would be stifled,” the company’s lawyer Thomas Graf told a panel of five judges on the first of a three-day hearing at the General Court.
“The decision’s case is, at its core, that Google should not have introduced these innovations, unless it gave competing CSSs (comparison shopping services) the same access,” Graf said, laying out the arguments for the world’s most popular internet search engine in a decade-long battle with the European Commission over its business practices.
The company did not favour its own service, but competed on its merits, he said.
The EU competition enforcer handed the fine to Google in 2017 for favouring its own price-comparison shopping service against those of smaller European rivals.
Two further decisions for different issues since then have lifted the total penalty to €8.25 billion, four times more than Microsoft’s EU fines of €2.2 billion.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan swatted away Google’s arguments, saying this was a clear case of a company using its dominance to give itself an advantage in other markets.
“What Google engaged in was leveraging conduct of the type found to be abusive many times under EU competition law. Conceptually, there is nothing esoteric about this case,” he told the judges.
He criticised Google for cherry picking elements of the EU decision to challenge.
“It is as if Google has applied a ranking algorithm to the decision and decided that parts of it just aren’t relevant,” Khan said.
Lawyer Thomas Vinje for British price-comparison shopping service Foundem, whose complaint triggered the EU investigation, said Google’s product would never have gained prominence if Google had treated it the same way as rival products.
“But instead of being prone to being demoted, Google’s comparison-shopping service is systematically promoted to the most visible spots in Google’s search results,” he said.

681,"February 13, 2020",Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg to Receive DOJ’s 2020 John Sherman Award,"
The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice will present Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg with the John Sherman Award for his lifetime contributions to the development of antitrust law and the preservation of economic liberty. Judge Ginsburg will deliver remarks and receive the award during a ceremony on May 8, 2020, in the Great Hall of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building.  
“Judge Ginsburg’s role in the advancement of antitrust law and policy cannot be overstated,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “It is a privilege for the division to recognize his career and achievements with this award.  Judge Ginsburg’s leadership in the Antitrust Division, as well as his incisive and cogent scholarship, has brought sound economic analysis to the forefront of antitrust law. His contributions have greatly improved the ability of antitrust law to protect consumer welfare and to spur economic growth.”
Created in 1994, the John Sherman Award is presented by the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to a person or persons for outstanding contributions to the field of antitrust law, the protection of American consumers, and the preservation of economic liberty.
Judge Ginsburg received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University and his J.D. from the University of Chicago.  Following law school, Judge Ginsburg clerked for Judge Carl McGowan of the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and for US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.  He joined the faculty at Harvard Law School from 1975 to 1983, before serving as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Regulatory Affairs, Antitrust Division, US Department of Justice, from 1983 to 1984; Administrator, Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, from 1984 to 1985; and Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, US Department of Justice, from 1985 to 1986.  Judge Ginsburg was appointed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November 1986 and served as Chief Judge from July 2001 until February 2008. Concurrent with his service on the federal bench, Judge Ginsburg has taught at the University of Chicago Law School and the New York University School of Law. He is currently a Professor of Law at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University, and a visiting professor at the University College London, Faculty of Laws. 
Judge Ginsburg’s efforts to incorporate economic analysis in antitrust enforcement is instrumental to how agencies and practitioners approach antitrust law today.  Of his many notable contributions, Judge Ginsburg elevated the role of economic analysis in antitrust enforcement by expanding the Division’s economics section and by creating the position of the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economic Analysis during his tenure as the Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division.  Through his work with the Global Antitrust Institute at the Antonin Scalia Law School, Judge Ginsburg is renowned for helping international enforcers and judges apply economic insights in competition law. Judge Ginsburg’s jurisprudence and scholarship further reflect the intellectual rigor that has marked his distinguished career.  He was an influential judge on the landmark United States v. Microsoft case in 2001, and the case remains foundational to understanding competition in high-tech markets. Judge Ginsburg’s scholarship is widely admired, and his academic works — ranging in topic from the application of antitrust law in a changing economy to the effects of extra-jurisdictional remedies — tackle complex questions and continue to influence students, enforcers, and practitioners alike. 
The award is named for the author of the Sherman Act of 1890, the nation’s first and foremost antitrust law. John Sherman, a former congressman and senator, also served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1877 to 1881 and as Secretary of State from 1897 to 1898. Previous recipients have included Diane P. Wood (2015), James F. Rill (2012), Robert Pitofsky (2010), Herbert Hovenkamp (2008), Robert H. Bork (2005), Richard A. Posner (2003), Milton Handler (1998), Thomas Kauper and William Baxter (1996), Phillip Areeda (1995), and Howard Metzenbaum (1994).

682,"February 13, 2020",Google Finalizes $2.6B Purchase Of Looker Data,"
Google has completed its US$2.6 billion acquisition of Looker Data Sciences after receiving approval from the UK’s competition authorities. The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) review, which follows similar probes by the US Department of Justice and the Austrian Federal Competition Authority, found that the deal would not increase prices or harm rivals’ access to data. 
Looker, which makes business intelligence analytics software, is Google’s biggest acquisition for many years, alongside its planned US$2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit. “Together, we’re excited to offer customers a comprehensive analytics solution that integrates and visualizes insights at every layer of their business,” said Thomas Kurian, chief executive of Google Cloud, in a blog post on Thursday, February 13, announcing the deal’s completion. 
He added that customers would retain “complete control of their data”. Getting the go-ahead on Looker from the CMA relieves Google of at least one antitrust battle, as it faces off against the EU in court in Luxembourg this week over a €2.4 billion fine for allegedly promoting its shopping search engine at the expense of smaller rivals. Still, dealmaking is getting more difficult for big tech companies as regulators have become increasingly concerned that M&A has been used by the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon to stifle competition. 
This week, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it would review hundreds of smaller start-up acquisitions made over the past decade by the five largest US companies, including Microsoft and Apple. Google’s Fitbit deal is facing regulatory challenges in Europe and the US over how it will handle the fitness tracker maker’s store of health data from some 28m users. 
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, is seeking tougher powers, such as the ability to impose fines, to use against tech companies.

684,"February 5, 2020",Texas AG Accuses Google Of Delaying Antitrust Investigation,"
The state attorney general leading a broad antitrust investigation into Google is accusing the tech giant of delaying the case and vowed to see it through to the end.
In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, February 5, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton pointed to Google’s attempts to prevent the state from using certain outside consultants as one delay tactic. And Paxton said he’s willing to take a more aggressive stance as a result.
“They’re pushing us towards a fight,” Paxton told CNBC. “We don’t necessarily want one. But we won’t back off if they’re not going to cooperate.”
Google has stated it objected to three consultants because they worked for competitors, including Microsoft and News, and that it wants to ensure any documents they review remain confidential.
“We have been working constructively with the Texas attorney general and have produced a substantial volume of information in response to his inquiry even as we seek assurances that our confidential business information won’t be shared with competitors or vocal complainants,” a Google spokesperson said. 
Texas announced its investigation into Google in September of last year on the steps of the US Supreme Court, backed by 49 attorneys general from nearly every state and territory in the country. Paxton told CNBC his team is focused on Google’s ad business, while other states are looking into a range of additional anticompetitive complaints. CNBC reported last fall that some state attorneys general have expanded their probes to look into Google’s Android and search businesses.

685,"January 21, 2020",EU: Antitrust & technology for good’ headline World Economic Forum in Davos,"
The technology sector is set to maintain its dominance at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this year, reported The Financial Times. 
Technology is still where much of the action is in Davos, and the tech companies will still be occupying the best venues on the promenade, a good indicator of who dominates. 
The large public companies will divide their time between acknowledging controversies over a range of issues, from privacy infringements to antitrust violations, and participating in the WEF’s “Tech for Good” content, say analysts, (with delegates expecting to hear much about how fintech can help the unbanked and what cloud computing is doing for small business, along with individual corporate announcements such as Microsoft’s 30-year plan to become carbon negative).
They will also face pressure from regulators such as Rohit Chopra, US Federal Trade Commissioner, who will headline a session covering antitrust issues on Wednesday, January 22, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who is in Davos and talking about the need to curb the power of Silicon Valley giants such as Google and Facebook. 
But the WEF has also invited an unusually large number of the biggest private technology companies, some of them business-to-business groups rather than consumer brands. This reflects a turning point in the technology sector, where money has become more concentrated in private hands.
“You can think of it in terms of ‘before SoftBank’ and ‘after SoftBank’,” said Christian Lanng, chief executive and chairman of Tradeshift, a Silicon Valley-based supply chain platform. Mr Lanng was referring to the Japanese conglomerate that suffered billions of dollars in writedowns after bidding up valuations of companies such as Uber and WeWork. 
“There’s going to be a lot more focus on value over growth and seeing who is actually profitable,” said Mr Lanng. “I think you’ll see more suits and ties on the promenade and fewer hoodies.”

686,"January 9, 2020",China’s Warning to Big Tech: You’re Not Bulletproof,"
 By Tim Culpan, Bloomberg
Antitrust is a relatively new concept in China and has been used most notably against foreign companies. Now, a draft update to China’s existing law puts local internet giants firmly in regulators’ sights. That should keep even the most ambitious executives from getting too big-headed as President Xi Jinping keeps power where it belongs — with the ruling Communist Party.
China’s first antitrust law was passed in 2007, a decade after the U.S. sued Microsoft Corp. over its then-dominant web browser and operating system in what remains one of the largest such cases in history. In 2009, local regulators blocked the Coca-Cola Co.’s $2.3 billion purchase of China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. Six years later, U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc. narrowly escaped being labeled a monopolist in the market for smartphone chips. It was fined $975 million and forced to lower the royalties it charged handset makers.
Today, big names like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. already attract government scrutiny because of their huge size and the role they play in China’s consumer, content and financial sectors. While Beijing’s policy of promoting competition is more than just window-dressing, broadening the anti-monopoly laws gives authorities another tool with which to keep them in line. Penalties could be stiff: up to 10% of a violator’s revenue from the previous year.

687,"December 18, 2019",Australia’s Digital Platform Inquiry: We’ve Only Just Begun…,"
BBetween 2017-2019 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission conducted a “world first” inquiry into digital platforms and their impact on media and advertising services markets. Its focus was Google and Facebook reflecting, their “influence, size and significance” in Australia. Concluding that these platforms have market power, the Final Report makes a raft of recommendations traversing competition, consumer, privacy, media, and broader public interest concerns. In the competition space, minor recommendations were made with respect to Australia’s merger laws and processes and a targeted recommendation is made that Google remove default search and browser preferences from Android devices. The Report also calls for the establishment of a specialist ACCC branch tasked with pro-active monitoring and enforcement and armed with compulsory information gathering powers to conduct market inquiries and make recommendations to government. Many of the Report’s recommendations call for further consultation, including the development of several “codes of conduct.” It is clear that the focus on addressing the rise of the digital platforms in Australia has only just begun.

688,"December 12, 2019",Brazil: Antitrust regulator fines IBM over Red Hat deal,"
Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE) has issued a BRL 57 million (US$13.9 million) fine on IBM for completing the purchase of Red Hat before approval by the country’s antitrust agency Cade, reported Valor Economico. The value, based on an agreement with the company, was very close to the maximum penalty applicable, which is BRL 60 million (US$14.6 million). 
The deal, worth US$34 billion, was completed in July, but only approved by CADE last month. With Red Hat, the most expensive deal in IBM’s history, the company hopes to gain on competitors in cloud computing, where users store information remotely instead of on their own machines.
IBM was an early proponent of the cloud more than a decade ago but fell behind asAmazon.com and Microsoft gobbled up the majority of the now-booming market.
IBM’s counterpunch has been to court companies that want to use the cloud but keep their most sensitive data locked down on internal computers, a model dubbed the “hybrid cloud.”
“I view this as a defining moment in IBM’s cloud journey,” IBM CEO Gina Rometty said. “This puts us in position in hybrid cloud.”

689,"December 10, 2019",US: AG Barr wants Big Tech probe finished next year,"


US Attorney General William Barr has signaled he wants to finish the antitrust investigation into US technology giants next year.
“I think it’s important to move quickly on these things as they have a cost to companies,” Barr said. “I’d like to have it completed sometime next year.”
The news may come as a relief for investors in some of America’s biggest tech firms who have been concerned about the damage of a protracted probe. The names of the firms being investigated haven’t been revealed. Some of the biggest tech firms in America are Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook.
Barr was speaking at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council summit in Washington, DC, on Tuesday.
A few months ago, the Justice Department said it would initiate a review of tech firms including social-media giants, online retailers and search platforms. Barr has acted swiftly on President Trump’s wish for tech investigations. “We started in earnest in July. It’s been moving very quickly and we have a very ambitious schedule,” He said.
Barr indicated that the Justice Department is looking into areas beyond anticompetitive practices that could be prosecuted under antitrust law. Other issues include potential bias in search results by Google.
“We are also looking at behaviors across the board and that means other laws,” he said.

690,"December 8, 2019",China: Beijing orders gov offices to remove all foreign computer,"


China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years, the Financial Times reports.
The government directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft and mirrors attempts by Washington to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a tech cold war.
The Trump administration banned US companies from doing business with Chinese Chinese telecommunications company Huawei earlier this year and in May, Google, Intel and Qualcomm announced they would freeze cooperation with Huawei.
By excluding China from western know-how, the Trump administration has made it clear that the real battle is about which of the two economic superpowers has the technological edge for the next two decades.
This is the first known public directive from Beijing setting specific targets limiting China’s use of foreign technology, though it is part a wider move within China to increase its reliance on domestic technology.
The FT reported that the directive would result in an estimated 20m- to 30m pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would begin in 2020. Analysts told the FT that 30% of substitutions would take place in 2020, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022.

691,"December 3, 2019",Dethroning the Digital Platform Champions,"

By John Pecman (Fasken)1
One has to applaud the success of the so-called “Tech Superstars”, often referred to as “GAFA” (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple). The great innovations they have developed for consumers and businesses alike contribute significantly to Canada’s gross national well-being. Their collective success should be admired both by those of you who believe in the power of capitalism to grow the economy and by those of you that believe the most innovative and efficient companies, those that invest and take risks, should reap the rewards, along with their shareholders, for having tipped the “winner takes all” race. These companies are the champions of today’s digital markets.
Competition Authorities around the world encourage and promote competitive races where there are winners and losers. A fundamental principle of antitrust doctrine is that success ought not to be condemned, even when it leads to large firms which possess market power. To do otherwise would destroy the incentives that drive our free and open economies. It is understood by knowledgeable industrial organization economists that many markets in our economy are naturally concentrated (in Canada, competition laws are monopoly friendly by design, but that is a subject for further commentary). Market concentration is often the result of the competitive process. Increasing concentration in many sectors is a result of growing economies of scale which results in larger, more efficient firms as opposed to smaller ones. Quite rightly, competition authorities worry about, and are empowered to take action against, companies with market power who engage in anti-competitive behavior to maintain or enhance their market power.
Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, once said, “Competition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.”2 Warren Buffet invests in companies which have built impenetrable moats to protect their dominant market positions.3 The major digital platforms are highly concentrated. Notable policymakers around the world, led by Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, and Elizabeth Warren, Democratic presidential nominee in the US, believe this concentration will persist with detrimental consequences for consumers and business. Ms. Warren has famously vowed to break up the so-called ‘Big Tech’ companies as a solution to the market power problem.4
By tipping the platform markets in their favor, Big Tech companies have built moats around their core product lines that are deep and wide. Recently published international studies and reports, such as the final report of the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms have confirmed this view. Digital platforms are winner-take-all markets on account of traditional economic factors which create durable barriers to entry. These factors include: (i) economies of scale and scope (ii) network effects, (iii) consumer behavioral biases, (iv) incumbent data advantages, and (v) strong brands and access to capital.
In view of these powerful winner-take-all factors in the digital platform markets, it would seem unlikely that one or more of the Big Tech incumbent champions can be beaten by newer, deeper-pocketed or even more innovative competitors. For example, Microsoft’s accumulated losses in search have been estimated in the billions of dollars with minimal gains on Google’s dominance. Despite the fact that many dominant technology companies and platforms in the past seemed unassailable (e.g. Microsoft’s dominance of operating systems and browsers), Google overtaking Yahoo in search, and Facebook displacing MySpace in social media, has many politicians, competition authorities, and scholars believing that Big Tech’s platform markets require government intervention, outside the realm of antitrust law, to restore competition.
The Stigler Report has proposed mandating not only an open, but also a common, Application Program Interface (“API”) which would allow different messaging systems to connect to one another – a common API guarantees interoperability and eliminates the network externalities that drive the winner-take-all nature of the social media market. It also proposes changing merger guidelines for digital platforms, strengthening antitrust enforcement and creating a new Digital Authority which would oversee all aspects of digital platforms, similar to the UK’s proposed Digital Markets Unit. Furthermore, the Stigler Report proposes empowering the FTC to: (i) have access to digital platforms’ internal databases and studies, (ii) perform their own independent research on how platforms impact different areas of our society, and (iii) moderate independent researchers’ access to these databases. And if all other solutions fail, it proposes the introduction of fiduciary duties on digital platforms.
In Canada, the application of competition law and policy to Big Tech platforms is slowly making its way on to the government agenda. In September 2017, the Competition Bureau released a discussion paper to engage stakeholders in the topic of big data and competition law to contribute to the debate. In February 2018, the Bureau released its final report, Big Data and Innovation: Key Themes for Competition Policy in Canada, which summarizes the Bureau’s enforcement approach. In its internationally awarded final report, the Bureau, based on its own experiences, noted that firms’ use of big data may raise challenges for competition law enforcement. The Bureau identified the need to adapt its tools and methods to this evolving area, while its antitrust investigations and analysis will continue to be guided by its traditional framework for market definition, market power and competitive effects.
A few days following the Bureau’s pronouncement that the Competition Act5 was fit for purpose to tackle Big Tech, the Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada called for a modernization of competition policy with respect to big data.6 Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development announced a new Digital Charter in May 2019 including among its 10 principles “Transparency, Portability and Interoperability.”7 A Government white paper to reform Canadian privacy law proposes a new general data portability right.8 In addition, a recent report from the Senate Committee on Banking Trade and Commerce specifically recommended that a consumer data portability right be added to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act9 and examines the merits of Open Banking.10
Competition authorities and experts, including the Bureau in its report recommending Open Banking,11 the UK’s Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel,12 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,13 and the Stigler Report suggest personal data portability encourages new entrants, enables innovation and enhances consumer welfare. In the EU, a regulatory approach has been taken to consumer data rights through the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation14 which creates a legal right for consumers to port their data.
It appears that the Tech Superstars have developed and maintained their dominant positions principally through innovation and popular products. A regulatory approach which mandates data-sharing with competitors or other companies in the ecosystem is the first step being taken, or proposed, by governments to temper their durable market power. Interestingly, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Twitter launched their own Data Transfer project in 2018 to allow data portability between multiple online platforms.15
Will data mobility designed to level the playing field chill innovation and investment by the incumbent firms? Will consumers benefit from lower prices, quality improvements, expanded choices, and accelerated innovation as the economic textbooks suggest will transpire with increased competition? As the championship belts are being removed from Big Tech and governments ponder improved antitrust laws to address the market power challenge, policymakers must strike the right balance between taking steps to prevent anti-competitive behavior and over-regulation that chills innovation and dynamic competition.

692,"November 24, 2019","You Say You Want a Revolution in Digital Merger Enforcement:  Evolution Shall Suffice, For Now Merger Working Group Teleseminar on Digital Mergers, October 1, 2019","

By Joseph R. Neely (United States Federal Trade Commission)1
To say that much has been written about digital mergers would be an understatement.2 Around the world, competition enforcers are evaluating how their competition laws can be best utilized—or improved—to address some of the analytical challenges involved in digital markets.
Last month, the ICN’s Merger Working Group held a teleseminar on digital mergers.3 Moderated by Professor Douglas Melamed of Stanford Law School, panelists from the European Commission (“EC”) Directorate-General for Competition (“DG COMP”), the U.K. Competition & Markets Authority (“CMA”), and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) expressed their views regarding the evaluation of digital mergers and credited the importance of international engagement in improving their analytical methods.4 The panelists provided an overview of recent case studies and addressed some of the key findings from recently commissioned reports on merger review in digital markets. While competition enforcers on the panel largely agreed that current merger control laws and tools are fit for purpose, they agreed that there may be a need to evolve and augment potential theories of harm and take into account additional data and non-price criteria that are particularly relevant in digital mergers.
Eleonora Ocello and Marc Zedler, case handlers at DG COMP, provided an overview of EU competition law with respect to digital markets and presented the Microsoft/LinkedIn and Apple/Shazam investigations. As the focus in digital mergers often involve zero-price markets, DG COMP has placed less emphasis on market definition and market shares, stressing a more dynamic, case-by-case assessment and a greater focus on non-price effects (e.g., innovation, quality, and choice). In addition, DG COMP’s competitive effects analysis of data—the sine qua non of the digital economy—evaluates whether aggregating datasets results in increasing market power and raising entry barriers as well as whether the merged entity has the ability and incentive to engage in a foreclosure strategy regarding access to the data at issue. The DG COMP panelists also provided a partial summation of the European Commission Special Advisers Report, Competition Policy for the Digital Era,5 with respect to merger review. Ms. Ocello noted that EU competition law is generally fit for purpose in the digital era, but there is potential for refining theories of harm to address acquisitions by dominant platforms of potential competitors, including smaller companies in adjacent markets, through looking at the “technological space” or “user space” rather than the dominant company’s core market.6
Richard Romney, Director of Mergers at the CMA, focused his presentation on two recently commissioned reports in the United Kingdom. First, he provided an overview of the Furman Report’s key areas of examination as it relates to mergers in digital markets.7 The Furman Report concluded, inter alia, that there might be under-enforcement of digital mergers and that “killer acquisitions” may be occurring that require greater scrutiny. The Furman Report’s key recommendations include an increased prioritization of digital mergers, particularly focusing on harm to innovation and potential competition, and updating the Merger Assessment Guidelines in the context of the assessment of digital mergers, which is occurring now. The Lear Report,8 a CMA-commissioned independent review to evaluate past merger decisions in the digital sector, recommended that the CMA evolve its approach to merger counterfactuals and enrich the information relied upon when investigating digital mergers. The CMA has already begun implementing some of these recommendations in its casework (e.g., Experian/ClearScore, TopCashback/Quidco). Mr. Romney concluded by stating that, through the learnings from the Furman and Lear Reports, the CMA has determined that its merger control tools are largely fit for purpose. He also noted that there are areas of refinement—such as gathering a greater quantity of information, exploring all relevant theories of harm, accepting a higher degree of uncertainty in the counterfactuals—that do not require legislative change.  
Joint General Manager of the Digital Platforms Branch at the ACCC, Morag Bond, presented the key findings and recommendations of the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report.9 The Commission conducted a broad, eighteen-month inquiry to evaluate, among other things, the impact of search engines, social media, and “other digital content aggregation content platforms” on the state of competition in media and advertising markets and its implications on journalistic content, media content creators, advertisers, and consumers. With respect to merger control, the Final Report made several key recommendations. Of particular relevance, the Report recommended legislation to incorporate new factors that address the likelihood that an acquisition may result in the removal of a potential competitor as well as factoring in “the nature and significance of assets, including data and technology, being acquired directly or through the body corporate.” Second, the Report recommended requiring large digital platform companies to provide advance notice of potential acquisitions, as Australia has a voluntary notification regime. The legislation incorporating these new factors would not change the overall merger test requiring a substantial lessening of competition. It would serve, however, as an important signal to merging parties and courts that these factors are relevant to a merger assessment. Ms. Bond stressed the importance of the ACCC’s extensive international engagement in the course of the Digital Platforms Inquiry, and that such engagement was critical to its findings and recommendations.
Professor Melamed concluded the panel with a few questions concerning how the proposed recommendations from the Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (ACCC), the Furman and Lear Reports (CMA), and the Special Advisers Report (DG COMP), might impact digital mergers going forward.

From the ACCC’s perspective, Ms. Bond stated that there will be closer scrutiny of vertical and conglomerate issues in digital mergers and, due to the Digital Platforms Inquiry, the ACCC now has a greater understanding of digital markets. In addition, Ms. Bond noted that additional potential theories of harm and the role of data will be taken into account, and the Commission has increased the range of data points to consider in its merger control regime.
Mr. Romney stressed that the CMA has been scrutinizing digital markets for years, but they are evolving to become more sophisticated in their analysis of digital mergers. He indicated that the CMA may take into account more dynamic counterfactuals as well as consider a range of potential theories of harm that contemplate loss of potential competition and innovation as well as vertical and conglomerate concerns.
DG COMP’s Mr. Zedler stated that the Special Advisers Report was conducted by independent experts and neither necessarily reflects the views of DG COMP nor will the EC necessarily implement all of the Report’s recommendations. Mr. Zedler emphasized the importance of a case-by-case analysis and noted that it is difficult to predict where, and to what extent, the EC’s merger control regime will become stricter. Further, he noted that the manner in which DG COMP evaluates data in digital mergers has evolved, and the Apple/Shazam case represents how the EC has most recently evaluated data issues in a merger context. Mr. Zedler also commented that mergers involving data aggregation and dominant platforms acquiring smaller companies in adjacent markets will be of particular interest.

As the title of this article indicates, the panelists from the ACCC, CMA, and DG COMP acknowledge that their merger control assessments are evolving to take into account more pertinent competitive factors such as innovation and quality in digital markets as well as ensuring that all potential theories of harm are evaluated and exhausted. In response to a suggestion that more arbitrary assessments will occur due to greater weight being placed on qualitative, non-price factors in digital markets, some panelists remarked that the necessity of establishing a well-reasoned substantial lessening of competition remains and must still be proven in—or can be appealed to—a court or tribunal.

Amazon, which has faced increasing antitrust pressure this year in the US and European Union, may have to spin off its lucrative cloud business, Oppenheimer warned investors on Monday, November 18.
According to CNBC, Oppenheimer’s note comes as Amazon protests the Pentagon choosing Microsoft for the military’s “JEDI” contract, which could span a decade of cloud services and be worth as much as US$10 billion. The contract marked a major win for Microsoft’s cloud business. Amazon claimed “the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias,” a move that is unlikely to take regulatory heat off Amazon.
Amazon’s recent roll out of AWS Data Exchange was intended to put Amazon further in the cloud scene. Notably, the new service provides quick access to the data offered qualified data providers to AWS customers.
Further, all third-party data is available for subscription in AWS Marketplace. Customers can utilize the subscribed data across various AWS cloud services by leveraging AWS Data Exchange API or console that will help in absorption of data within Amazon Simple Storage Service.
Yahoo noted that data from brands such as Reuters, Change Healthcare, TransUnion, Foursquare, and Pitney Bowes, among others, are available on AWS Marketplace, due to AWS Data Exchange.

694,"November 18, 2019",The Limits of Australia’s Digital Platforms Inquiry,"
By Dirk Auer (International Center for Law and Economics)1
In July of 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) concluded its high-profile 1.5-year investigation into the effect of digital platforms on competition in media and advertising markets.2
The ACCC’s Final Report3 claims that competition is “not working” in the media, communications, advertising and other markets it investigated,4 and that substantial regulatory and legislative changes are necessary to solve — and would solve — the problems caused by ineffective competition.5 These changes include mandated “platform neutrality” obligations,6 tighter merger rules,7 firm- and industry-level codes of conduct over which the ACCC would have a discretionary oversight,8 and the adoption of more stringent privacy rules.9 The ACCC’s proposals would thus tilt the scales of competition and regulatory enforcement in its favor.
However, as discussed below, the premise that markets are failing is not well supported by the ACCC’s report.10 Moreover, even if the ACCC’s premise were accurate, its conclusions miss the bigger picture:: Government intervention is appropriate only if it produces net social benefits. The fact that a market does not satisfy some idealized benchmark (for instance, because firms have some degree of market power) is irrelevant if regulation merely exacerbates the perceived failure or creates new and greater costs.11 Yet the ACCC Final Report almost entirely omits consideration of possible regulatory failure. It is thus of little practical value in evaluating the merits of potential regulatory interventions.
The Overlooked Costs of Enforced Platform “Neutrality”
The ACCC Final Report puts forward many recommendations to address perceived competitive concerns in digital platform industries. These include merger law reforms, and changes to search engine and internet browser defaults.12 In doing so, it disregards traditional tools of competition policy in favor of a much looser approach. Most notably, the ACCC relies upon a piecemeal market definition exercise and departs from established competition law theories of harm. This methodological frailty also ripples through the report’s recommendations. Indeed, the report does not sufficiently defend its conclusions that mandated platform neutrality and the establishment of a digital platforms branch would alleviate the concerns identified by the ACCC.
The report notably claims that Google controls a large share of the “general search advertising” and “vertical search advertising” markets.13 It similarly asserts that Facebook commands a 51 percent share of “display advertising.”14 However, the report fails to put forward a coherent — let alone quantitative — argument that these are indeed relevant markets for competition policy purposes (as opposed to, for example, a market encompassing all online advertising). Readers are left to guess why it is that large players, such as Amazon, as well as the massive range of offline advertising and marketing outlets, are excluded from this analysis. It is true that the report mentions — and then dismisses — the possibility of competition between online and offline advertising.15 But the report’s means of distinguishing between the two markets does not turn on the competition-relevant criteria of demand and supply substitution; rather, it turns on the differences between the specific matching mechanisms employed by each.16 Further gradations (e.g. between online search and display advertising) turn on similarly inapposite characteristics.17
Likewise, the ACCC’s “theory of harm” amounts to little more than an observation that digital platform markets have features that purportedly complicate market entry by rivals. For instance, the ACCC concludes that “consumer inertia” and “default bias” cause users to stick with Google’s search engine and browser, rather than switch to its rival’s products.18
In fact, it is likely that a majority of consumers simply prefer Google’s browser and search offerings. In the desktop environment, Google’s ChromeOS has less than 1 percent market share in Australia, whereas Microsoft’s Windows has a market share of 69 percent and Apple’s iOS a 24 percent market share.19 The default browser on Windows is Edge, while the default browser on iOS is Safari, yet Chrome is chosen by about 70 percent of users in Australia.20 Meanwhile, about 90 percent of desktop searches in Australia are performed using Google.21
Given the demonstrable preference for Google’s browser and search engine, forcing consumers to go through a choice screen may at best be a waste of time, and at worse a paralyzing choice between indiscernible options.22
In spite of having failed to demonstrate actual harm to competition or consumer welfare, the ACCC calls for the imposition of stringent “platform neutrality” obligations. Most notably, it would require Google to provide users of the Android platform with a choice of internet browsers and search engines, rather than make its own services the default option.23 The ACCC would also investigate whether similar obligations should be imposed upon other digital platforms, via a newly established digital platforms branch.24
Unfortunately, the ACCC mostly ignores the potential costs of platform neutrality obligations, as well as the potential rent-seeking opportunities created by a branch dedicated to digital platforms. From an error-cost perspective, it is thus unlikely that the ACCC Final Report achieves the right balance between over and under-enforcement.
Micromanaging the News Industry
Much of the same can be said about the ACCC’s analysis of platforms’ dealings with traditional news outlets. In a nutshell, the ACCC is concerned with the bargaining power of small media firms (or lack thereof) relative to global internet platforms, and the potential effect that these platforms may have on the market for journalism.25 To address these alleged problems, the report recommends that platforms should be made to establish regulator-approved codes of conduct that would bind them in their future dealings with media outlets.26 It also recommends the introduction of fiscal policies that would prop up Australia’s struggling local journalism industry.27
Even if one accepts the ACCC’s assertion that there is a market failure in the provision of certain kinds of content, it is far from certain that its recommendations would produce the desired outcome. Take the ACCC’s rosy view of local journalism. The report hardly considers the possibility that the relative decline of local journalism has not been caused by online platforms (correlation is not causation).28 Nor does it envisage that local newspapers may no longer be the optimal way to stay informed about local events. Finally, it is not clear that shifting additional revenue towards Australia’s struggling local news industry will necessarily lead to the type of content that the ACCC deems essential for Australian consumers.
To make matters worse, the report also fails to grapple with the risk of regulatory failure. Subsidizing local news and favoring public broadcast channels raises the prospect of “white elephant” spending — that is, of public expenditures that exceed the social value they create.29 The ACCC’s fear that local news is being underprovided is not set against a relevant economic benchmark. Instead, the report merely observes that local news coverage has declined compared to its previous highs.30 But this is hardly a convincing argument. All industries go through ebbs and flows. Nor is there any basis for presuming that previously established practices were optimal — especially when they were established under very different technological conditions. Accordingly, if the government acts on the ACCC’s calls to subsidize local news and boost public broadcasting, the resultant expenditures may well harm taxpayers through waste rather than create socially valuable pieces of news.
Finally, the ACCC’s plans create unavoidable incentives for rent-seeking. Rivals will surely attempt to game the approval process for platform codes of conduct. And decisions regarding the allocation of public funding will also be vulnerable to undue influence. Under the ACCC’s proposals, the assessment criteria for grants would be designed by a committee comprising journalists, academics, and former industry participants.31 But allowing industry insiders to play an active role in the allocation of grants is problematic. For instance, it is far from clear that these stakeholders will be willing to embrace the potential disruption that digital platforms may bring to the local news industry.
Privacy Regulation is No Free Lunch
The report also touches upon the topic of online privacy. But while its recommendations are very similar to the privacy regulations recently introduced by the European Union32 and California,33 the ACCC overlooks the tremendous compliance costs created by those regulations. Yet its own recommendations would likely entail proportionally similar costs.
For instance, it has been estimated that American S&P 500 companies and UK FTSE 350 companies alone spent a combined total of $9 billion to comply with the EU’s GDPR in the year running up to its entry into force.34 Likewise, a survey of American companies with over 500 employees found that three out of four planned to allocate over $1 million to GDPR compliance.35
Things are similar for California’s CCPA. One estimate places the upfront costs of compliance with the CCPA (including lost advertising revenue) at $24.5 billion — even as it identifies comparably modest benefits of roughly $6-9 billion.36 Another survey estimated that 70 percent of firms would pay at least $100,000 to comply with the CCPA, while a further 20 percent would spend more than $1 million.37
And compliance costs are not the only problem. One study found that, following the GDPR’s entry into force, weekly venture capital deals in the EU decreased by 17.6 percent, compared to the US, and the amount raised in an average deal decreased by 39.6 percent.38 Furthermore, it has been argued that data regulations may have a significant impact on competition between platforms, arguably limiting the entry of smaller firms, entrenching established incumbents, and disincentivizing increases in product quality on privacy dimensions.39
Conclusion: The Limits of the ACCC’s Digital Platform Inquiry
In his groundbreaking “The Limits of Antitrust,” Frank Easterbrook famously argued that the task of competition enforcers and regulators is not crudely to maximize certain policy preferences.40 Instead, their task is to maintain a delicate balance between the societal harms of anticompetitive conduct on the one hand and, on the other, the administrative and societal costs of unavoidable, if occasional, enforcement errors that invariably follow even modest enforcement activity.
The ACCC Final Report fails to grapple with this complex tradeoff. While it claims to show pervasive market failures throughout the digital economy, it ignores the specter of regulatory failure. This goes against a commendable trend that has seen Australian competition enforcement move towards a more effects-based system.41
The ACCC’s lackadaisical assessment of regulatory costs is all-the-more troubling given that its report focuses on an extremely dynamic industry. What is only a small regulatory cost today could severely hamper competition in the future. Yet, rather than reconsider how ham-fisted regulation might be throttling traditional media firms, or how it may further entrench today’s dominant technology platforms, the ACCC advocates more of the same.
Could excessive media regulation be preventing traditional media from competing against digital platforms (and might the ACCC’s recommendations have a similar effect in the future)? Has this type of regulation really produced net social benefits? And could ill-designed regulation act as a barrier to entry? By almost completely ignoring these questions, the ACCC Final Report all but guaranteed that its conclusions would be heavily skewed in favor of increased government intervention — and potentially ineffective or even harmful intervention, at that.

695,"November 17, 2019",The Rise of Precautionary Antitrust: An Illustration with the EU Google Android Decision,"
By Dr. Aurelien Portuese (St Mary’s University London)1
Introduction 
The Google Android decision2 issued by the European Commission is not only unique in terms of its punitive €4.34 billion fine – but most importantly for its atypical reasoning in a highly complex environment.3 The Decision concerns numerous and inter-connected products such as the following: smart mobile devices; operating systems (“OS”) for smart mobile devices; apps; smart mobile app stores; application programming interfaces (“APIs”); general search services; and web browsers.4 These products are developed in light of Google’s business model, which entails the interaction between online products and services offered (mostly) free of charge for end-users, and online advertising services.5 Google’s ad-funded products and services have shifted from a PC environment to a smartphone environment, illustrated by Google’s acquisition and development of the Android mobile OS,6 in order to effectively compete with Apple’s iOS ecosystem. Google’s business model involves tying Google’s dominant search engine (“Google Search”) with its proprietary mobile apps (the “Google Play Store” and “Google Chrome”), together with conditional licensing and exclusivity payments. Google’s business model has come under scrutiny7 and was found to violate Article 102 TFEU in the present Google Android decision.
The Abuses: Tying, Conditional Licensing, and Exclusivity Payments 
Two types of abusive tying were identified by the European Commission.8 First, Google tied Google Search, where Google is “super-dominant,” with its Google Play Store. Second, Google tied Google Chrome with the Google Play Store and Google Search.
The first instance of abusive tying (of Google Search with the Google Play Store) violated Article 102 TFEU because, absent any objective justification, “(i) the Play Store and the Google Search app are distinct products (…); (ii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores (…); (iii) the Play Store cannot be obtained without the Google Search app (…); and (iv) the tying of the Google Search app with the Play Store is capable of restricting competition (…).”9
The second instance of abusive tying (of Google Chrome with the Google Play Store and the Google Search) app was also found to violate Article 102 TFEU because, absent any objective justification thereof, “(i) Google Chrome is a distinct product from the Play Store and the Google Search app (…); (ii) the Play Store and the Google Search app cannot be obtained without Google Chrome (…); (iii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores and in the national markets for general search services (…); and (iv) the tying of Google Chrome with the Play Store and the Google Search app is capable of restricting competition (…).”10
Thirdly, Google made the licensing of the Google Play Store and Google Search app conditional on hardware manufacturers complying with anti-fragmentation obligations. This conditional licensing was found to constitute abusive conduct, because “(i) entering into the anti-fragmentation obligations is unrelated to the licensing of the Play Store and the Google Search app (…); (ii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores, and in the national markets for general search services (…); (iii) the Play Store and the Google Search app cannot be obtained without entering into the anti-fragmentation obligations (…); (iv) the anti-fragmentation obligations are capable of restricting competition (…).”11
Finally, the fourth type of abusive conduct the Commission alleged against Google consisted of having designed exclusivity payments in the form of granting revenue share payments to manufacturers conditional on the non-pre-installation of competing general search services on Android devices. Absent any objective justification by Google, the grant of portfolio-based revenue share payments constituted exclusivity payments for abusive default placements. These exclusivity payments were found to constitute abuses of dominant position capable of restricting competition12 and deterring innovation,13 with no objective justification.
These types of abusive conduct were all found to be aimed at protecting and strengthening Google’s dominant position in general search services, thereby increasing its revenues through search advertisements. Having lasted 2748 days,14 the single and continuous infringement led the European Commission to find Google liable, jointly and severally with Alphabet Inc. its holding company, for a fine of €4.34 billion.
The Atypical Reasoning: Relevant Markets and Precautionary Antitrust in Big Tech
The reality of these tying arrangements,15 as well as the absence of objective justification can presumably be disputed, since Google does provide, through Android, a genuine competitor to Apple’s historically incumbent iOS. Be that as it may, the Commission decision more fundamentally relies upon one simple, yet highly arguable, assessment: the relevant product market for Android is the narrow market for freely-licensable operating systems, rather than general operating systems.16 Indeed, on a number of occasions, the Commission’s decision denied that Apple’s iOS was the main competitor to Google’s Android OS.17
Nevertheless, as once noted by Prof. Nicolas Petit, the Commission may have had resorted to “antitrust gerrymandering” when defining Google’s relevant markets: it is “the idea that if antitrust watchdogs draw markets narrowly enough, every company can be made to look like an evil monopolist.”18 In the Commission’s decision, Google Android is said to represent 90 percent of the market for licensable smart mobile OS.19 The Commission, quite disputably, considered any competition between non-licensable mobile OSs (such as iOS and BlackBerry OS) with licensable mobile OSs (such as Android) to amount to nothing more than “indirect constraint[s].”20
Another fundamental aspect of the Google Android decision is the lack of proven consumer harm.21 Harm to end-users is mostly suggested and hinted at, rather than illustrated and proven. Instead, the lessening of competition is the focus of the alleged conduct: the reduction of choice to manufacturers and end-users as well as the deterrence of innovation are, the Commission considers, instances of such lessening of competition. In the Commission’s view, the reduction of choices entailed by Google’s practices constituted abuses of dominant position. Such alleged reduction of choice can be contested.22 It is no longer required to show consumer harm in order to be found to infringe Article 102 TFEU: a reduction of choice without demonstrated consumer harm appears to be sufficient. In light of the complex and highly innovative high-tech sector, such reduction of choice trumps welfare23 in order to conclude of the abusive nature of the conduct at issue.
The absence of demonstrated consumer harm in order to find antitrust injury is not fortuitous, but represents a fundamental alteration of antitrust enforcement, predominantly when it comes to big tech companies. Coupled with the lack of clear knowledge, a shift in the burden of proof, and the lack of a consumer harm requirement in order to find abuse of dominance all reveal the precautionary approach that the European Commission has now embraced. Underpinning EU law’s philosophical traditions,24 the precautionary principle is being surreptitiously transplanted into antitrust enforcement. This approach holds that the lack of clear knowledge25 and the lack of evidenced (or foreseeable) harm26 should not prevent regulatory interventions. These interventions are, from a legal perspective, enabled by both a shift in the burden of proof27 and ex ante measures. In the Google Android decision, it is noticeable that the potential for harm to innovation given a reduced number of choices resulting from Google’s contractual restraints suggests regulatory intervention is needed in order both to prevent irreversible damages and to design an ideal competitive environment more favorable to rivals and to downstream players who would be relieved from contractual restraints.
Whereas traditional antitrust enforcement relies on antitrust injuries demonstrated ex post, including proven consumer harm, precautionary antitrust28 represents a transformational shift to ex ante regulatory measures (interim relief,29 regulatory design) even in the absence of demonstrated consumer harm, together with a shift of the burden of proof in order to prevent future irreversible damages. Under precautionary antitrust, choice trumps welfare, ex ante regulatory interventionism trumps an ex post antitrust liability system, the shifted burden of proof prevails over non-presumed fault, and irreversible damages replace demonstrated consumer harm. To a non-negligible extent, the Google Android decision illustrates the coming to the fore of a form of precautionary antitrust whereby, even without proven consumer harm, competition authorities are not barred from ex ante intervention to protect what can be seen as irreversible damage – an “effective competitive structure”30 – enabling competitors to emerge and compete.

7 Meaning, the ability for Google to offer, through its two-sided ad-funded business model, a “Google experience” alongside an “Apple experience” or a “Microsoft experience.” Google’s business model relates to one of the ecosystems in the market for smart mobile devices and services. See Koerber who argues that “the (agreements) must be seen in the context of competition among “mobile device eco-systems” (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry and others). Most (manufacturers) install the suite of apps on their devices as consumers expect smartphones to come with functionalities and apps “out of the box”….The (agreements) ensures that users – who choose to buy a device with (Google Mobile Services) – get a device with a full set of apps that offer a “Google experience” similar to the “Apple experience” offered  by iOS devices or the “Microsoft experience” offered by Windows Phone device,” in Torsten Koerber, 2014, Let’s Talk About Android – Observations on Competition in the Field of Mobile Operating Systems, German Version: NZKart 2014, 378 – 386, July 4, 2014. 
8 Tying is existential to Android since not only the entire business model of zero-priced Android OS relies on tied revenue-raising services, but also because the alternative is not desired by customers or consumers. Indeed, “bare Android is not what consumers expect when they purchase modern mobile devices” as argued by Benjamin Edelman & Damien Geradin, 2016, Android and competition law: exploring and assessing Google’s practices in mobile.

15 The reality of tying can be contested since manufacturers can acquire bare Android – namely without contractual requirements. Indeed, Google’s General Counsel in April 2016 argued that Google’s “partner agreements are entirely voluntary – anyone can use Android without Google,” and Android founder Andy Rubin stated that “Google will include its apps suite with the platform, but since the platform is  open, a manufacturer or operator can remove some or all the applications,” cited in Benjamin Edelman & Damien Geradin, 2016, Android and competition law: exploring and assessing Google’s practices in mobile. European Competition Journal. Vol.12, pp.159-194, at p.166-167.
16 It can be indeed be argued that Google Android does compete with other operating systems, evidenced by the very competitive constraint Google Android exert to its competitors. For instance, because Android is offered for free to manufacturers, competing operating systems such as Symbian and Windows Phone moved from paid operating systems to freely available operating systems. Consequently, the price competition exerted by Android has pushed competitors to bring the price down up to zero in fierce competition with Google Android. See Andreas Constantinou, “Nokia and Symbian to Become One; Royalty-Free, Open Source Roadmap,” Vision Mobile (24 June 2008), available at https://www.slashdata.co/blog/nokia-and-symbian-to-become-one-royalty-free-open-source-roadmap. It can therefore be argued that Android has gained dominance worldwide, not only because of technical superiority and app availability, but mostly because of customers’ price sensitivity – free (yet contractually constrained) products are often preferred over paid-for products.

Moreover, this indirect constraint, exerted by end-users between smartphones and by app developers, is said to “insufficient” (at p.60) because 1) “there are significant price differences between Google Android and IoS devices”; 2) “users of Google Android devices would face substantial costs when switching to IoS devices;» 3) “user show a significant degree of loyalty to their existing smart mobile OS;» 4) “app developers are unlikely to stop developing for Google Android and develop exclusively for IoS,” Case AT.40099, Google Android, 18/07/2018, p.107-108.
21 Google Android does control prices since Android source code are available to manufacturers royalty-free or the level of output, since the Android source code is readily available to manufacturers and app developers.
22 Google has disrupted the operating systems, which was based on proprietary software code until it entered the market. The number of apps developed for Android is an illustration of choices created rather than reduced. Nevertheless, the requirement to pre-install and exclusively use key Google apps (such as Google Maps, Google Search, etc…) potentially came at the expense of potential competitors’ apps. This reduction of choice, justified by the very revenue-raising characteristic of these apps within the Android business model, needs to be counterbalanced with the enhanced choice generated by Android OS as the main competitor to Apple’s IoS.

25 Here, uncertainties about the level of innovation, the reality of any harm, and the internal functioning of ecosystems constitute the necessary lack of knowledge as fundamental criterion of the precautionary principle.
26 Here, no consumer harm was demonstrated – only harm to competition because innovation was allegedly deterred. For instance, the decision concludes that “Google’s conduct deters innovation, tends to harm, directly or indirectly, consumers of mobile web browsers and helps to maintain and strengthen Google’s dominant position in each national market for general search services,” in Case AT.40099, Google Android, 18/07/2018, at p.222. Innovation deterrence is presumably evidenced while consumer harm is only presumed.
27 See for instance, for the mood of the moment, Emily Craig, 2019, Vestager considers shifting burden of proof for big tech, Global Competition Review, 31st of October 2019, available at https://globalcompetitionreview.com/article/1210348/vestager-considers-shifting-burden-of-proof-for-big-tech. This looming shift has surfaced explicitly, yet applied implicitly occasionally, in the Digital Competition Report. For instance, this Report states that « in the context of highly concentrated markets characterized by strong network effects and high barriers to entry (i.e. not easily corrected by markets themselves), one may want to err on the side of disallowing potentially anticompetitive conducts, and impose on the incumbent the burden of proof for showing the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. This may be true especially where dominant platforms try to expand into neighboring markets, thereby growing into digital ecosystems, which become ever more difficult for users to leave,” at p.4. This burden of proof shift clearly refers to the Google Android decision in particular. Also, the Report argues that “(…)w e propose that, to the extent that the platform performs a regulatory function, it should bear the burden of proving that self-preferencing has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets,” at p.7 clearly referring to Google Shopping decision of 2017.

696,"November 10, 2019",Big Tech Acquisitions and the Potential Competition Doctrine: The Case of Facebook,"
By Mark Glick & Catherine Ruetschlin(University of Utah)
The Big Tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, have individually and collectively engaged in an unprecedented number of acquisitions. When a dominant firm purchases a start-up that could be a future entrant and thereby increase competitive rivalry, it raises a potential competition issue. Unfortunately, the antitrust law of potential competition mergers is ill-equipped to address tech mergers. We contend that the Chicago School’s assumptions and policy prescriptions hobbled antitrust law and policy on potential competition mergers. We illustrate this problem with the example of Facebook. Facebook has engaged in 90 completed acquisitions in its short history (documented in the Appendix to this paper). Many antitrust commentators have focused on the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions as cases of mergers that have reduced potential competition. We show the impotence of the potential competition doctrine applied to these two acquisitions. We suggest that the remedy for Chicago School damage to the potential competition doctrine is a return to an empirically tractable structural approach to potential competition mergers.

On Wednesday, November 6, Bill Gates suggested that Windows could have been the world’s dominant mobile operating system had it not been for the antitrust case the US Justice Department (DOJ) brought against Microsoft.
Speaking at the DealBook Conference hosted by The New York Times (via The Verge), Gates was asked about the impact of the DOJ’s antitrust case. He came out swinging against how harmful the investigation was and exclaimed how, “We were so close.”
“There’s no doubt that the antitrust lawsuit was bad for Microsoft. We would have been more focused on creating the phone operating system and so instead of using Android today you would be using Windows Mobile if it hadn’t been for the antitrust case.”
Gates’ comments suggest that major antitrust cases against today’s other large technology companies could have negative market implications.
In the third quarter Facebook became the subject of antitrust investigations and inquiries from the US House of Representatives, state attorneys general and the DOJ, and Alphabet started receiving civil demands from the DOJ regarding earlier antitrust investigations. The Supreme Court earlier this year said Apple iPhone users could bring an antitrust case against Apple regarding App Store commissions, and in July the European Union was reported to be beginning an antitrust investigation into Amazon.
“Oh, we were so close,” Gates said about the company’s miss in mobile operating systems. “I was just too distracted. I screwed that up because of the distraction.” He said the company was three months too late with a release Motorola would have used on a phone.

700,"October 24, 2019",The Antitrust Threat to National Security,"
By Jon Bateman, Wall Street Journal
Forty-six state attorneys general have joined Letitia James, their New York counterpart, in an antitrust investigation of Facebook. Every presidential candidate in last week’s Democratic debate agreed that big tech companies have grown too powerful and must be humbled or diminished, if not broken up entirely. This idea has gained popularity across the political spectrum, with two-thirds of Americans now saying they would break up Big Tech. Although still a long shot, the breakup campaign has spawned dozens of antitrust probes against Amazon, Apple and Google as well as Facebook. And it has started a long-overdue debate about Silicon Valley’s sweeping influence.
But there are dangers in restructuring any U.S. industry. One of the most serious remains largely unrecognized: national-security risk. Despite their faults, tech companies contribute directly to American military and intelligence operations. Their titanic scale can itself be an asset. Any responsible antitrust debate must address the national security risks of breaking up Big Tech—and the parallel risks of keeping these companies intact.
Consider cloud computing. The Defense Department is planning a massive global cloud called JEDI. Unlike corporate clouds, the “war cloud” must support life-or-death missions on austere battlefields despite virtual or physical onslaughts. The Pentagon found only two eligible bidders: Amazon and Microsoft. Three defense secretaries, a federal judge and the Government Accountability Office have upheld this bidding process.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the top US prosecutor investigating tech giants like Facebook and Google made clear Tuesday, October 22, that no measure is out of his reach.
Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department’s growing antitrust division, raised the spectre of breaking up big Silicon Valley names, calling such an action “perfectly on the table.” That is a chilling prospect for the largest companies, which haven’t faced such a threat since the government sought a breakup of Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.
Speaking at the WSJ Tech Live summit, Mr. Delrahim laid out what has to be considered the worst-case scenario for Silicon Valley as the Justice Department’s antitrust review, unveiled over the summer, takes shape. He said the technology revolution has brought improvements for consumers, but that questions remain about potential anticompetitive behavior.
“There’s no question consumers have benefited from technology. There’s no question we have a lot more conveniences at our disposal. The big question is: Are companies abusing the market power that they have gained,” Mr. Delrahim said.
He summed up his operating philosophy with a quip a few moments later. “Big is not bad,” he said. “Big behaving badly is bad.”

European enforcers have brought high-profile antitrust cases against the tech giants, and both activists and members of Congress are calling for action in the United States. This short note identifies ten hard-wired differences between the European and American enforcement regimes that make very it difficult for the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies to emulate their European counterparts. This note also identifies a few other points of contrast between Europe and the United States that affect antitrust enforcement against tech giants going forward.

The European Commission (“EC”) and some national competition authorities in Europe have taken on tech giants in high-profile cases, and more cases are in the works. Activists and members of Congress call for action in the United States, although their calls typically are vague about what action should be taken and by whom. Without criticizing any enforcement action, or the inaction of any enforcer, we explore how Europe systemically differs from the United States in ways that affect enforcement against the tech giants.
Our main point is that numerous hard-wired differences between the European and American enforcement regimes make it very difficult for the United States (“U.S.”) antitrust enforcement agencies to emulate their European Union (“EU”) counterparts. Generally speaking, we do not favor changes to the U.S. regime to...

By Svetlana Avdasheva
Competition enforcement towards digital platforms in Russia concentrates on the issues of multi-homing for inter-platform competition (competition between digital platforms) and non-discriminatory access for intra-platform competition (competition on digital platforms). Both in antitrust enforcement (Google-2015 and Microsoft-2017 cases in Russia) and under merger approval (Bayer/Monsanto-2018 and Uber/Yandex-2017) theory of harm is based on both anticompetitive exclusionary effects and exploitative effects in adjacent markets. Typical remedies are “non-discriminatory access” and a ban on any form of single-homing clauses. Under international merger approval, the competition authority may elaborate remedies to support the upgrading in adjacent markets. Russian competition enforcement towards digital platforms does not contradict the overall attitude to the platforms in competition law and economics (while being criticized for protectionist intent).

706,"October 8, 2019",The Transaction Value Threshold in Germany – Experiences with the New Size of Transaction Test in Merger Control,"

By Dr. Martin Sauermann, CFA (Bundeskartellamt)1
Introduction
The takeover of WhatsApp by Facebook in 2014 was widely perceived as an eye-opener in the global competition policy community. The case showed that there might be a gap in the system of international merger control regimes in the face of new business models of the digital world. Despite both firms’ undisputed market positions, the case proved challenging for typical turnover based merger control thresholds. In fact, the case was not notifiable in most European jurisdictions due to the companies’ turnover figures. Therefore, in 2017 German and Austrian lawmakers introduced new additional size of transaction tests in their competition laws. These amendments now require notifications of mergers and acquisitions above a certain value, even without requiring the merging parties to fulfill the former pure turnover thresholds. Thus, the amendments enable the German and Austrian competition authorities to control the takeover of low turnover unicorn firms in their infancy. As the European competition community had little experience with transaction value thresholds, the German and Austrian competition authorities published a joint guidance for their application in 2018. Now in 2019, for the first time the authorities have also published some statistics and experiences concerning the application of their law amendments.

707,"October 7, 2019",FTC v. Qualcomm: Origins and Problems,"

By Matthew Spitzer (Northwestern University)1
The
District Court’s opinion finding Qualcomm guilty of antitrust violations in a
case brought by the Federal Trade Commission2 is
on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. This post will show that the circumstances
under which the FTC chose to bring this case should lead everyone, including
the Court of Appeals, to view this case with skepticism.  
The
Federal Trade Commission’s case against Qualcomm for allegedly violating
Section 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization) was initiated in a most unusual
and troubling fashion.
The FTC is supposed to have five members. However, at the time the FTC voted to bring the case, there were only three sitting members. Gridlock between the President and the Senate had prevented filling the vacancies.The vote to bring the case was 2 to 1, along party lines.3There was a written dissent by Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen from the decision to bring the case.One of the two Commissioners who voted to bring the case (Chairperson Edith Ramirez) announced her resignation on January 13, four days before the vote to bring the case.4The vote was taken on January 17, 2017, three days before the inauguration of a new President, during the “lame duck” period. The new President represented a change of the party in power.
How
disquietingly unusual was this procedural setting? Very unusual and very
disquieting, as it turns out.
To
examine this question, I5
scraped the FTC’s website to gather all of the votes on bringing, settling, or
taking court action in antitrust monopolization actions (excluding Hart-Scott-Rodino
filings) since 1994.6
There have been 329 such actions, and the votes are summarized in the table
below. The numbers in the first row indicate votes for, votes against, and
recusals. Thus, 4-0 indicates four votes for, zero against, and no recusals.
And 4-0-1 indicates four votes for, zero against, and one recusal. Thus, the
4-0 vote also indicates that the FTC had only four members, while the 4-0-1
vote shows that the FTC was at full strength. Any row with a “lame duck” period
vote is shown in bold and italics. The category into which the FTC’s decision
to bring an action against Qualcomm falls (2-1) is highlighted.
The
columns may need a bit of explanation. The first column shows the outcome of
the vote in all the cases since 1994 detailed in that row. The second column
shows the total number of cases since 1994 that had that vote. And the third
column shows the total number of cases since 1994 that had that vote and
that were brought in the lame duck period. Thus, the entries in the third
column are also represented in the second column. 
The
first thing to note is that only 3 of the 329 cases were brought by a 2-1 vote.
That is less than 1%. And the only one of those to be brought during the lame
duck period was FTC v. Qualcomm.
Second, if we add in the 3-2 votes, the only others where there is a one-vote
margin, we get 11, or about 3%. Why focus on these? They are the cases where
the wisdom of bringing the case is most suspect. A multimember expert body,
such as the FTC, is supposed to apply its wisdom to the decision to bring a
case. Where the decision is brought on a razor thin vote, the wisdom is also
razor thin. Not surprisingly, only 3% of the cases brought are in this
category. 
To
turn this around, the typical way to bring a case is by unanimous vote. This is, by definition, where all Commissioners
agree. If we sum the 5-0, 4-0, and 4-0-1, 3-0, 3-0-1, and 3-0-2 (all of the
unanimous votes with at least 3 votes in favor) we get 270 of the 329 cases, or
82%. If we throw in the 27 cases with 2-0, 2-0-2, and 2-0-3, we have 297 of the
329 cases, or 90%. Thus, 90% of the cases are unanimous. These are the cases
where our belief is that the case is strongest. And the 4-1 and 3-1 cases lie
in between the unanimous cases and the “razor thin margin” cases in terms of
likely strength of case. 
What about cases brought in the “lame duck” period – between the date of the election of a new President from a different party and the inauguration?7 These are cases where we should be most suspicious that the case is politically motivated. After all, if there were no political motivation for the case, the Commissioners would just put the case on the back burner for a few weeks and allow the new President’s appointees to make the decision about whether to bring the case. There are only nine votes in the lame duck period in the data set, and only one of these had a dissenting vote –  FTC v Qualcomm.

Thus,
the vote to bring FTC v Qualcomm
provides the least wisdom and confidence of any vote to bring any FTC antitrust
case since 1994. The vote, 2-1, was the least likely to signal a meritorious
case in the data set, while bringing it in the lame duck period suggests
political considerations produced it. 
So,
what are the implications of all of this? Everyone – courts, journalists, law
professors, techies, and the general public – should view this case with a
great deal of skepticism. Or, to put the same point differently, there should
be a very high burden of proof on the FTC. 
What happened after the vote to bring the case? On November 6, 2018, Judge Koh handed down an opinion8 finding that Qualcomm violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and ordered far-reaching remedies. These remedies are so broad that they threaten to disrupt the worldwide modem chip business. The remedies have now been stayed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.9 While staying the remedies the court stated that “Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits.”10  The case is now before the Ninth Circuit. I am not surprised that there are serious questions on the merits. The circumstances of bringing this case in the first place virtually guaranteed that there would be questions. One can only hope that the Ninth Circuit will take a very close look at this case, and that the FTC will refrain from bringing any more cases under similar circumstances.

3 The FTC, after getting a full contingent of
Commissioners, reconsidered the wisdom of bringing the case. The FTC split 2 to
2, with the Chairperson recusing himself because Chair’s former law firm had
represented Qualcomm.
4 How often is the deciding vote in favor of bringing
the case cast by a Commissioner who had already announced her resignation? That
turned out to be more difficult to chase down than the other aspects of this. I
am still working on it.

Stephen D. Houck, Special Counsel to Offit Kurman, P.A., previously served as the Chief of the Antitrust Bureau in the New York State Attorney General’s Office. He also served as lead trial counsel in the government’s Section 2 monopolization case against Microsoft. Houck has previously contributed posts to DisCo on antitrust enforcement action against Android here and here. 
What antitrust enforcers should do about large tech companies, if anything, has been the subject of much recent commentary. The most widely publicized proposal is that of Senator Elizabeth Warren which calls for the breakup of all “platform utilities” with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more. In this blog post and in my new article, I consider under what circumstances government enforcement agencies should seek remedial relief and what form that remedy should take. 
The bottom line, for those who want to cut to the chase, is that the breaking up of companies is a logistically difficult matter with potential adverse harms to consumers. Given that such an extreme antitrust remedy could severely impair incentives to innovate and create economic inefficiencies, I present a modest procedural change that would have the effect of strengthening antitrust enforcement: allowing a trial court to request appellate review of its liability decision before a remedial hearing.

At issue was the software giant’s bundling of its Internet Explorer browser with Windows as a way to maintain its dominance in PC operating systems. Ultimately, Microsoft remained intact.
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft is one of the few big US technology companies not under regulatory scrutiny in Washington. The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and a congressional committee are all scrutinizing Big Tech companies from Alphabet’s Google to Facebook and Amazon, that Washington has concluded have gotten too big and too powerful.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, has made a forceful and detailed plan about how she would go about breaking them up.
Gates however said, “You have to really think; is that the best thing?” in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “If there’s a way the company’s behaving that you want to get rid of, then, you should just say, ‘OK, that’s a banned behavior.’ But splitting the company in two, and having two people doing the bad thing — that doesn’t seem like a solution.”

710,"September 9, 2019", US: Apple adjusted App Store algorithm as antitrust probes loom,"
In an interview with the New York Times, Apple executives Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue revealed that Apple has adjusted the App Store algorithm to “handicap” its own apps from appearing too much in search results.
Following press attention, Apple found that the App Store was deciding to show a lot of Apple apps for common search terms. For instance, a search for “music” would show not only Apple Music, but up to seven other first-party apps in the first ten spots.
Apple claims this happened due to a feature of the App Store ranking engine where apps from the same developer are often shown together. This feature can be helpful, for instance when customers search for “office” they can see most of Microsoft’s suite.
However, the outsized popularity of Apple’s stock apps was causing the grouping behavior to dominate too much. Part of the cause is that some iPhone and iPad customers apparently use App Store search to find apps that are already installed on their phones. When users would click on an Apple app, its popularity rises disproportionately to third-parties.

711,"August 27, 2019",US: New taxes loom for big tech,"
Will Big Tech face bigger tax bills on an international stage?
Beyond the debates on data privacy and compliance, marquee names in technology face greater scrutiny from various governments, and perhaps bigger tax bills, too.
In India, the Central Board of Direct Taxes, is looking at ways to bring new taxes to bear on companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, among others, according to timesnownews.com. The site reported that tax policymakers will hold meetings in September at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. At least one unnamed official has been quoted as stating that “all countries are trying to find a consensus on major tech companies.”
In other news regarding tax policy, in Egypt, the government, as reported by menabytes.com, is “close” to issuing new income tax regulations, in draft form, that would tax advertisements posted online across platforms and social media sites.
As reported, the tax imposed could be as much as 20% on social media and search ads. The tax would reportedly be levied on the total cost of the ads.
In Kenya, the country’s revenue authority has stated it will seek to introduce a digital tax on products and services that are delivered across digital platforms, through a Value Added Tax. The new digital tax may also apply to what are known as Over the Top (OTT) Services and streaming services, as reported by gadgets-africa.com.

712,"August 4, 2019",European Competition Policy in Digital: What’s Next?,"
August 2019

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
European Competition Policy in Digital: What’s Next? By Nicolas Petit (University of Liege & College of Europe)1
This short note is about the future of European Union (“EU”) competition policy in digital industries. It is somewhat patent that in the global division of labor, the U.S. (and China) have specialized in creating large digital firms, while the EU’s comparative advantage has been in producing competition policies to discipline them. In past five years, the European Commission (“EC”) has issued three decisions against Google, and collected close to 10 billion USD from its shareholders, i.e. Google Search (Shopping), Google Androïd, and Google AdSense. It fined Facebook in 2017 for breach of merger processes. The EC is currently investigating whether Amazon is using sensitive data from retailers to promote its own product offerings. And it is also looking at Spotify’s complaint against Apple’s 30 percent fee, as well as alleged foreclosure from the Apple Watch.
A draft Stigler Center report issued in May called the European Commission the “global enforcer” against digital platforms exclusionary conduct. And in a recent paper economist Carl Shapiro invites us to “look to Brussels for much of the action.”2
So the question seems not so much whether European competition policy will be activist. It will be. The recent adoption of a Statement of Objections in proceedings against Amazon suggests that the EC is not yet ready to loosen the grip on digital firms.3 That said, one may expect a progressive recalibration of the EC’s competition policy mix, with more balance between antitrust enforcement in particular cases and rule-making/guidance initiatives. Moreover, we should not forget the EU courts who will ultimately be called to shed light on the legal tests applicable in the abovementioned cases, as defendants have sought annulment of the EC decisions on substantive, procedural, and remedial grounds.4 Readers will recall that  some EC decisions like Google Shopping have been criticized for their alleged failure to articulate a clear theory of liability in support of the case.
With this background, the purpose of the present piece is to address two speculative questions: (1) what will be the focus of EU competition policy in digital ?; and  (2) can we expect this policy to deliver consumer welfare?

What will be the Focus of EC Competition Policy in Digital Industries?

We can get a sense of what future European competition policy will look like from a report entitled “Competition Policy for the Digital Era” from May 2019. The report was commissioned to a group of three experts, independent from the EC. Over its 132 pages, there are many ideas. But a handful of them are aligned with the legal and policy preferences previously expressed by EC officials in published papers. In fact, close observers of the Brussels antitrust scene read the report as a JV between the three independent experts and the EC policy units.5
The first one concerns abuse of dominance cases. It looks technical. But it could have significant impact on antitrust enforcement and litigation. The idea is that in highly concentrated markets characterized by strong network effects, the burden of proof should shift on the incumbent, who should be asked to demonstrate the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. Otherwise, and absent a defendant showing of procompetitive purpose or effect, conduct ought to be deemed unlawful. This proposition marks a deviation from the rule of reason, evidenced-based approach increasingly taken by the Court of Justice of the EU in this area of the law, and it will thus necessitate a test case in Luxemburg. The practical significance of that procedural modification is the following: It is often complained that startups subject to platform anticompetitive conduct do not have the resources necessary to bring evidence-hungry complaints before courts and agencies, and go bust due to litigation fatigue. If the shift in the burden of proof happens, this could lead to increased enforcement activity levels before national agencies and antitrust courts across Europe.
The second is stricter merger policy against startup acquisitions by dominant platforms. The EC seems interested in controlling deals like Facebook/Instagram, where an incumbent with a dominant ecosystem buys a quickly growing startup that operates outside of its market.6 To date, these mergers are looked at as “conglomeral” transactions. In the absence of clear horizontal overlaps or risks of input foreclosure, they are presumptively innocuous. The proposed novel theory of harm is to think of the target firm as a horizontal competitor active within a same “technological space” or “users’ space.” Under the new test, the merger ought to be prohibited even if the platform has the ability and incentives to grow the startup, as long as it can be shown that “the target can grow as a self-standing competitive force if not acquired by the incumbent, or if other companies may be realistically interested.” The counterfactual scenario assumes that there is more social value to stand alone growth or M&A with another competitor than with a dominant firm. Little is said though of the empirical basis for the assumption that merging with a dominant platform is a second best option from a social welfare perspective.
The third one is antitrust spirited data regulation. It is not a secret that the EC is not convinced by the economic idea whereby firms with market power can collect excessive data from users. It is well known that the EC was not particularly enthusiastic about the German 2019 case against Facebook, plausibly on the ground that firms without market power equally exploit users’ behavioral biases to coerce them into excessive terms of use (note that this economic perspective on data irks European privacy officials charged with GDPR enforcement, who believe that competition officials should take a more moral perspective on data minimization).7 By contrast, the EC seems to accept the notion that personal and non-personal data possession raise entry barriers for both competitors and complementors, and in turn necessitate data access, sharing, and interoperability remedies. Practicalities like monitoring of continuous data access or pricing disputes however plead against anything other than exceptional antitrust enforcement. The EC report logically proposes data regulation or soft law guidance through business review letters, though it does not demarcate clearly how to think of the division of labor between regulation and antitrust enforcement.
These are, in a nutshell, the priority items on the wish list of EC antitrust officials. Note that ideas often aired in the U.S. policy discussion have zero chance of success in Europe. Chris Hughes’ and others’ dream of a GAFA breakup will not come from Brussels. There are demanding legal tests to meet to dismember firms in European competition law.8 Nor do we see much demand for institutional reform or procedural innovation, beyond faster investigations.

Will Activist EC Competition Policy in Digital Deliver Consumer Welfare?

Can we assess the economic impact of the EC activist competition policy in digital industries? Short of clear remedial impact in the various closed cases to date, the EC’s motivation and justification have often boiled down to moral high ground antitrust rhetoric, like “fairness” or “trust.” In reality, the answer to whether activist competition policy delivers consumer welfare necessitates to discuss several hard questions.
The first is the following: Can we be confident that activist antitrust policy against platforms is socially beneficial, absent a clear understanding of the relationship between market structure, business models, and consumer surplus in digital markets? On this, a recent paper by Brynjolfsson, Collis & Eggers cuts new ground.9 The authors use choice experiments to estimate the consumer surplus created by digital goods with zero price. Concretely, their study asked users how much compensation they would require to forego the digital good. Though the study does not compare monopolized digital goods to competitive ones, it estimates the consumer surplus generated by platforms like Facebook or digital services like search engines. The study finds that the monthly median consumer surplus for a Facebook user is 48 USD. Emerging experimental work relativizes policy arguments that characterize users as unpaid data subjects. Moreover, it suggests that platforms that profit on other sides of the market earn Ricardian rents, not monopoly ones (otherwise, they would charge for the service).
Second hard question: Are Google, Facebook, and other digital platforms active in online advertising markets actually engines of intense non-price competition in the economy (and thus enablers of competitive markets)? In traditional economics, advertisement is modeled as a form of non-price competition. So, if demand (and supply) of online advertisement grows (as it has historically done), should we not consider (i) that this is a sign that there is increased non-price competition between advertisers; and (ii) that by providing the technological infrastructure that makes non-price competition possible, tech giants actually enable competitive markets? This, in turn, calls into turns on its head several sacred cows of European competition policy. For indeed, the argument could imply that tech giants’ rivalry is an instantiation of the “wasteful competition” argument, where excessive competition leads to oversupply of socially harmful activities, like excessive advertisement or personal data extraction.
Third hard question: What can we learn from past antitrust cases? Say we accept the commonly heard claim that big antitrust cases like U.S. v. Microsoft10 helped create firms like Google and other tech giants. We still fail to understand the causal, let alone, functional relationship between the antitrust case and subsequent social benefits like new firm entry, technological innovation, and dynamic efficiency. Did these firms enter on the expectation that Microsoft would be deterred (by antitrust litigation) to squash them? Or because of a corporate culture change at Microsoft? Or because Microsoft was distracted by protracted antitrust processes (in the U.S., but also most likely by subsequent proceedings elsewhere in the world)? On this, retrospective studies of past antitrust cases would certainly help improve the stock of expert knowledge, and assist the design of antitrust remedies, though we have to be aware that they will not yield unambiguous results.
Fourth hard question: What kind of policy can assist the creation of a European GAFA? Many in Brussels who support active antitrust enforcement in digital markets in their day job dream at night of a European Google or Facebook. Not long ago, a German minister talked of a European AI “Airbus.” Last time I checked, we had not found the recipe. But aren’t we faced with a puzzling natural experiment? For the past 30 years, the U.S. has given birth to GAFA under a weak antitrust enforcement paradigm; and in the past 20 years, China has given birth to BAT under a policy paradigm where centralized cooperation prevails over decentralized competition. Of course, it would be hasty to infer that deviations from mainstream antitrust policies help create superstar firms in tech.11 There are too many confounding factors: labor and capital market institutions, cultural and social norms, demographic and linguistic homogeneity, size of population sets, etc. At the same time, must domestic consumer welfare driven antitrust policy be sensitive or insensitive to the growth of large home tech firms when foreign incumbents enjoy first mover advantages?12 This issue could lead to original developments in Europe like M&A restrictions or forced data sharing against U.S. and China tech, as we hear increased calls for strong industrial policy and digital sovereignty.
Conclusion
One should expect sustained European antitrust policy in digital markets in upcoming years. And certainly more, beyond antitrust. Many of the previous European Parliament Members (“MEPs”) who worked on tech have just been reelected, and especially the German conservative group who were vocal supporters of the content industry and the press against Google. There is an expectation that they will push the envelope on a number of regulatory initiatives. Some of these reforms may have a much more adverse impact on tech platforms than the one-year-old GDPR. One that should already make the digital industry shiver is a possible attempt to discard the limited liability regime applicable to passive online intermediaries for illegal users’ activities under e-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.13 In her recently announced political platform EC president elect Ursula Von der Leyen announced an upcoming Digital Services Act that will upgrade “liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products.” As Carl Shapiro says, “look to Brussels.”

713,"July 30, 2019",Can Antitrust Enforcement Improve Privacy Protection? Privacy as a Parameter of Competition in Merger Reviews,"
By Mark MacCarthy (Georgetown University)
In principle, antitrust merger reviews can take steps to preserve privacy competition by blocking or conditioning proposed transactions that substantially lessen this form of competition. This essay focuses on the realistic prospects for making progress on privacy protection in this way. After some general remarks on the topic, it illustrates the way merger reviews can assess privacy competition through an examination of two recent merger reviews involving digital platforms, the European Commission’s decisions in their reviews of the Facebook/WhatsApp merger and the Microsoft/LinkedIn merger.
The implications of this assessment should not give us cause for optimism. Any exercise of competition law’s merger review mechanisms to address privacy concerns necessarily confronts a range of legal, factual and practical considerations that collectively amount to large and potentially insurmountable obstacles. These include the inability to apply or extend privacy law directly, the unresolved conceptual knots in clarifying the notion of privacy competition, the empirical difficulties in determining the existence and extent of privacy competition, and the requirement to show that any post-merger failure to satisfy privacy preferences results from a substantial lessening of competition, rather than from independent business judgments or the proper operation of competitive forces. Finally, merger reviews face a fundamental legal limitation in t...

The US ban on sales to China’s Huawei is expected to be a topic of discussion Monday, July 22, between White House regulators and tech executives.
Semiconductor and software executives were invited to a meeting by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, two sources briefed on the meeting told Reuters.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also expected to attend the White House event, along with Intel, Qualcomm, Google, and Micron, Reuters reported. Broadcom Inc and Microsoft Corp also received invitations.
The subject of Huawei was expected “to come up, but that it is not the reason why they are convening the meeting,” said the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
US companies’ ties to Huawei are shaky since the Trump administration blacklisted the world’s top maker of telecommunications equipment, citing national security concerns.
The  ban prevents American companies from buying parts and equipment from Huawei without the approval of the US government. President Trump also signed an executive order in May that prevents US companies from using Huawei equipment.
With US export blacklisting along with other actions against Huawei, founder Ren Zhengfei expects revenue to be roughly US$100 billion this year — down from last year’s approximately US$107 billion.
Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said in May that licenses would be issued where there is no threat to national security.

715,"July 16, 2019",The Record of Weak US Merger Enforcement in Big Tech,"
By Diana L. Moss (American Antitrust Institute)
The term “Big Tech” is often used to describe the five largest multinational online service or computer hardware and software companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. These companies hold five of the top six slots, by market value, for publicly traded firms. The growth of Big Tech over the past three decades is a function of numerous forces. These range from economic phenomena such as network effects and winner-take-all markets, organic growth resulting from innovative business models and technologies, to expansion through a series of acquisitions of smaller, potential, or nascent rivals.
While Big Tech has undoubtedly produced benefits, significant concerns have coalesced around it. The growth of Big Tech has created controversy over the companies’ role in our society and raised a suite of competition issues that are attracting attention from Congress and enforcers. These include effects on innovation and market entry; incentives to compete on price and non-price dimensions of competition such as privacy; and the potential for artificial intelligence-driven algorithmic pricing to facilitate coordinated conduct. The debate over the size and alleged dominance of Big Tech companies has promoted wideranging proposals to use the antitrust laws to break them up. But few of these proposals are driven by a methodological, fact-based analysis. Such analysis would explore the strategic competitive abilities and in...

With Red Hat, the most expensive deal in IBM’s history, the company hopes to gain on competitors in cloud computing, where users store information remotely instead of on their own machines.
IBM was an early proponent of the cloud more than a decade ago but fell behind asAmazon.com and Microsoft gobbled up the majority of the now-booming market.
IBM’s counterpunch has been to court companies that want to use the cloud but keep their most sensitive data locked down on internal computers, a model dubbed the “hybrid cloud.”

Navigating through Merger Control Review in China – Challenges for U.S. Companies during a Time of Uncertainty By Cheng Liu, Audrey Yumeng Li, and Jeff Liu (King Wood Mallesons)1
Escalating tensions between China and the United States (the “U.S.”) over the China-U.S. trade war since early 2018 have led to growing concerns that it may become more challenging now for deals involving US companies to obtain antitrust approval under China’s merger control regime.  Under these circumstances, parties involved in a global merger almost always ask whether the China merger control review is impacted by geopolitical factors, and if not, what are the issues which may lead to greater scrutiny. This article will try to answer these questions, and offer some practical guidance for U.S. companies to better prepare for their merger filings in China during this uncertain time of China U.S. trade tensions.
 
Background 
The China U.S. trade tensions have lasted for over 450 days.2  In the last round of tariff increases, the U.S. increased tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on May 20, 2019, following which China raised tariffs on US$60 billion worth of American goods from June 1, 2019.  Thus far, the U.S. has already slapped tariffs on US$250 billion worth of Chinese products, and has threatened tariffs on US$325 billion more, while China has set tariffs on US$110 billion worth of US goods.3

718,"July 7, 2019",Letting the Internet regulate itself was good idea — in the 1990s,"
It’s time for lawmakers to step back in, carefully.
By Margaret O’Mara, New York Times
Tech regulation may be the only thing on which a polarized Capitol Hill can agree. “We should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, and perhaps we will,” President Trump recently declared. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has made the breakup of tech companies a central plank of her campaign. Even Silicon Valley-friendly contenders like Pete Buttigieg have called for curbs on the industry’s power.
If Americans buy into the idea that the tech industry is an entrepreneurial, free-market miracle in which government played little part, then the prospect of stricter regulation is ominous. But that isn’t what actually happened. Throughout the history of the tech industry in the United States, the government has been an important regulator, funder and partner. Public policies — including antitrust enforcement, data privacy regulation and rules governing online content — helped make the industry into the innovative juggernaut that it is today. In recent years, lawmakers pulled back from this role. As they return to it, the history of American tech delivers some important lessons.
Advocates of big-tech breakup often point to precedent set by the antitrust cases of the twentieth century. The three biggest were Microsoft in the 1990s, IBM in the 1950s through the 1980s, and the moves that turned AT&T into a regulated monopoly in 1913 and ended wit...

719,"July 3, 2019",EU: EC investigates Apple’s GDPR compliance,"
Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) announced that it has launched a third privacy investigation into Apple.
The tech giant’s main regulator in the European Union (EU) stated it is looking into whether Apple has complied with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy law regarding an access request from a customer. Under GDPR, regulators can hit companies that do not comply with the regulations with fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue or €20 million (US$22 million), whichever is higher.
Last year, the DPC opened an investigation into how Apple processes users’ personal data for targeted advertising on its platform and whether its privacy policy on how that data is processed is transparent enough. The agency currently has 20 investigations into tech companies open, with Facebook in the lead with eight individual probes and with two into its WhatsApp subsidiary and one into Instagram.
In addition, Twitter is under three different investigations, while Google, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, and US digital advertising company Quantcast each have one probe.
Despite the scrutiny, Apple CEO Tim Cook called on the US government last year to embrace privacy laws similar to the EU. He said it was time “for the rest of the world” to take a page from the EU, and create a comprehensive framework to protect the personal information of consumers.
“We are in support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the US,” he said at the time, ad...

What does it mean about wiretapping authorities that let you find out what’s going on financially or drug money laundering, things like that,” the Microsoft founder said at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, on Monday, June 24. “So, yes, the government needs to get involved.”
Gates discussed everything from the early days of Microsoft, to his investments in clean energy during the talk. But his thoughts on government interference in the tech sector were particularly relevant given recent government scrutiny of the size, influence, and privacy practices of tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google by both antitrust enforcement agencies and political candidates.
Gates said he expects “there will be more regulation of the tech sector,” particularly as it relates to privacy issues. The protection of user privacy and use of user data has been a flashpoint especially for Facebook, which has been criticized for multiple data scandals.

The Alignment of Evidence and Economics: A Rebuttal to Ginsburg and Wright By Joseph Kattan & Timothy J. Muris1
Introduction
In a March article in CPI’s Blog O’ Blogs, Judge Douglas Ginsburg and Professor Joshua Wright (“G&W”) criticized the Nash bargaining model of the Federal Trade Commission’s economic expert in the agency’s case against Qualcomm, Professor Carl Shapiro, as “contrary to real-world evidence.”2 In an April response, we analyzed the trial evidence in that case and demonstrated that it fully supported Shapiro’s economic analysis.3 We showed that consistent testimony from numerous Qualcomm customers established that Qualcomm’s “no license no chips” regime, under which Qualcomm threatens to stop supplying its monopoly modem chips to customers that do not agree to its patent licensing demands, significantly increased the royalties that customers pay Qualcomm. We also explained that the economics of Shapiro’s Nash bargaining model, with which G&W did not quarrel, demonstrated that Qualcomm’s elevated royalties served as a direct tax on Qualcomm’s competitors.

Makan Delrahim, the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust chief, said that low prices and free products would not shield digital monopolists from scrutiny to group of tech experts, reported the Financial Times.
The remarks by Mr Delrahim at a conference in Israel followed moves by US antitrust enforcers to prepare competition investigations into Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. The speech, which referenced US trust busting from Standard Oil to AT&T and Microsoft, was the latest sign of the shifting attitude in Washington towards Silicon Valley.
“There are only one or two significant players in important digital spaces, including internet search, social networks, mobile and desktop operating systems, and electronic book sales,” he said. “This is true in certain input markets as well. For example, just two firms take in the lion’s share of online ad spending.”
Delrahim said the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department looks for rising prices, lower quality, loss of privacy, and collusion when looking to see if a company violated antitrust laws. He said it also looks for cases in which there are exclusive deals that hurt rival companies on purpose. The DOJ official also said tech companies need to stop getting bigger by engaging in mergers. “Acquisitions of nascent competitors can be pro-competitive in certain instances and anti-competitive in others,” he said. “I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition ...

723,"June 10, 2019",US: Salesforce to buy Tableau in $15.7bn deal,"

Salesforce has agreed to pay $15.7bn for Tableau Software, in the biggest deal to date for the highly acquisitive cloud software group run by Marc Benioff. It said on Monday it would buy Tableau, which makes data analytics software that turns raw data into visualisations, in an all-share deal.
The valuation is net of cash. Salesforce has bought dozens of companies since it was founded in 1999 by Mr Benioff, a former Oracle executive. Last year, it paid $6.8bn for Mulesoft, a data integration platform.
Mr Benioff has attracted attention for aggressive acquisitions, even mulling a bid for Twitter. Outside Salesforce, he and his wife bought Time Magazine for $190m last year.


Salesforce’s move comes at a time when the San Francisco-based cloud computing company has been forced to ramp up investment because of mounting competition from Oracle, Microsoft and other large rivals.

Google’s parent company Alphabet announced on Thursday, June 6, that it is buying data analytics company Looker for US$2.6 billion, according to a report from Reuters.
The acquisition will be the first under new Google Cloud Chief Executive Thomas Kurian. The company’s cloud computing sector trails Amazon’s and Microsoft’s when it comes to revenue and methods. However, analysts say Google Cloud’s BigQuery, which handles large datasets, is an attractive system in terms of customer attraction.
Kurian said focusing on analytics makes sense, as he aims to close some gaps in the cloud unit. He also said that Looker and Google Cloud are similar in a cultural sense. They share some customers as well, like Blue Apron and Hearst Communications.
“When we looked at how do we broaden our portfolio, (data and analytics) is a segment where we have strength,” Kurian said. Looker is “complementary and completes our analytics foundation.”
Looker was founded in Santa Cruz, California in 2012. It has about 800 employees and has raised US$281 million in venture capital. Last year, it was valued at US$1.6 billion.
Kurian’s plan for the cloud unit is to focus on specialized software rather than general tools. Looker’s software enables organizations to define calculations for important customers for things like revenue, and then show trends in the data without the need for complicated scripts. It can be compared to products like Tableau and Power BI by Microsoft.

By Dr Andrea Coscelli, CMA
Like many agencies around the world, the CMA has had a growing focus on digital commerce, reflecting changes in the economy and consumer behaviour. Much of our recent casework has had a strong digital flavour, and our policy and advocacy work is increasing in this area too.
But the effectiveness of merger control in digital markets has been the subject of particular discussion and attention recently and I want to focus on that today. Over the last decade, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft combined – the so called GAFAM quintet – have made over 400 acquisitions globally, with more than half of these – close to 250 – just in the most recent 5 years. Some of these acquisitions have had exceptionally high valuations.
However only a handful of these mergers have been scrutinised by competition authorities, and none have been blocked. As an economist, these statistics naturally lead me to question whether we as competition authorities have got the balance right. Is it right that across all 400 of these acquisitions, there has not been a single prohibition? On this basis, is it possible to argue that we’ve correctly balanced the risks of under- and over-enforcement?

Some big-name websites have issues with the new Chromium-based version of Microsoft Edge, including Google-owned YouTube, which is refusing to work with the new browser, reported Bloomberg.
Samuel Maddock created a browser that worked well, but because it was based on Chromium, he needed another Google product called Widevine to authenticate users and prevent video piracy. He sent Google a request, outlining the project, and waited.
“You have these gatekeepers like Google that decide which projects can work and if you’re not granted that permission you’re screwed,’’ Maddock said.
It’s the redesigned version of YouTube that’s causing problems. Visitors to the site using the Chromium-based version of Edge are greeted by the error message: “Your browser is not supported. Try it with the latest Google Chrome.” The old design of YouTube remains accessible.

EU antitrust regulators will decide by June 27 whether to clear US tech giant International Business Machines Corp’s US$34 billion bid for software company Red Hat.
The deal, IBM’s biggest, will help the company expand into subscription-based software offerings. IBM announced on Tuesday, May 21, it had sought EU approval the previous day. The European Commission confirmed the request.
Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.
The EU competition enforcer can either clear the deal with or without conditions, or it can open a full-scale investigation. US regulatory authorities approved the deal without demanding concessions earlier this month.

Fisher was born in New York City and received both his undergraduate degree and his PhD from Harvard University. He joined the MIT faculty in 1960, after a one-year post-PhD stint as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. Fisher spent the rest of his career at MIT. In 2000, he was appointed the inaugural holder of the Jane Berkowitz Carlton and Dennis William Carlton Professorship of Microeconomics. He became a professor emeritus in 2004.
Fisher was a versatile economist who made important contributions to economic theory, econometric methods, and the empirical analysis of firm and industry behavior. He was best known for his research on aggregation theory, estimation of simultaneous equation models, and the measurement and consequences of industry concentration.

Google AdSense for Search: Fines Always Come in Threes By Aurelien Portuese (St Mary’s University Twickenham)1
On June 26, 2017, the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service.2 On July 18, 2018, the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for having illegally strengthened the dominance of Google’s search engine via Android mobile devices.3 Thirdly and lastly, on March 20, 2019, the European Commission fined Google €1.49 billion for having illegally imposed restrictive clauses to third-party websites through AdSense for Search.4 Whereas the Commission sent the Statement of Objections simultaneously on July 14, 2016 for both the Google Shopping case and the Google AdSense case, the latter required more time for the Commission to issue the fine for “illegal misuse of its dominant position in the market for the brokering of online search adverts” said Commissioner Margrether Vestager.5

Antitrust Policy for Two-Sided Platforms: The Failure of American Express and the Path Forward
By John B. Kirkwood (Seattle University)
Two-sided platforms serve two sets of customers and enable them to interact with each other. The five most valuable corporations in America – Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft – all operate two-sided platforms. But despite their growing power, the Supreme Court made it more difficult to stop them from stifling competition. In American Express, the Court dismissed a challenge to Amex’s anti-steering provisions, which preclude merchants from steering their customers toward cheaper credit cards. Although these provisions suppress price competition on their face, the Court held that the plaintiffs had not shown that Amex had market power or that its conduct harmed consumers in the aggregate.
This article, the first comprehensive analysis of the decision, exposes the flaws in the Court’s reasoning. It shows that Amex did possess market power. Using a method I proposed in a recent article, it establishes that Amex’s conduct almost certainly enabled it to maintain its fees above the competitive level. It also shows, contrary to the Court’s analysis, that Amex’s repeated fee increases demonstrated market power. Finally, the Court was incorrect to insist that in a two-sided platform case, the relevant market must encompass both sides of the platform. That approach systematically unde...

731,"April 22, 2019",US: Warren faces pushback over calls to break up Big Tech,"
Elizabeth Warren’s call to break up giant tech companies like Google and Facebook is facing some opposition in California, reported wbur.com.
This time, however, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate’s proposal to check Big Tech may complicate her relationship with a state that has traditionally been a cash cow for her. California is home to three of the four companies Warren has explicitly targeted in her plan: Apple, Facebook, and Google. The state is also rich in wealthy political donors and primary delegates alike.
The Massachusetts senator has sworn off courting wealthy donors in the Democratic primary. Although delegates are awarded proportionately, the rewards in terms of momentum for the presidential candidates are potentially huge, especially as California has bumped up its primary date to early March of 2020.
Lisa Gritzner, a Los Angeles political consultant who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Uber, says Warren’s proposal might play well with some on the “extreme ends” of the Democratic Party. But, she says it’s unlikely to do well with the majority of Californians who fall on both sides of the political spectrum.
“This is where people come to start their companies, their startups, their dreams,” Gritzner says. “And so the idea that all of a sudden somebody decides you’re too big or they don’t agree with the way you’re conducting your business and the government comes in and takes over — that’s not exactly the kind...

Dear Readers,
Speaking at the 2005 IAB Engage conference in London, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said: “The future of advertising is the internet.”
With the advent of the digital economy, and advertising shifting from newspapers, radio, and television to the internet, we have also seen a shift in the regulatory approach of some governments from a focus on protecting consumers from “false advertising,” to considering online advertising from an antitrust lens.
The market power of online platforms is a hot, highly debated, topic in competition policy of late. Some argue that the debate about market power in online advertising has a lack of precision. Some authors argue that the complex online advertising ecosystem needs to be demystified and some common misconceptions need to be corrected. Others argue that antitrust enforcers, along with pursuing their consumer and competition protection missions, should consider a per se rule against advertising.
We hope this edition of the CPI Chronicle helps further foster this interesting debate.
As always, thank you to our great panel of authors.
Sincerely,
CPI Team

733,"April 1, 2019",Why Breaking Up Big Tech Could Do More Harm Than Good,"
By Herbert Hovenkamp
Earlier this month, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren solidified her party’s growing disenchantment with Big Tech by proposing to break up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,” the 2020 presidential candidate wrote in a March 8th blog post. “They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.”
Clouding the issue of breaking up Big Tech is that these firms arguably make consumers’ lives better by offering such things as free Google searches, social media connections on Facebook and low prices with fast, free shipping through Amazon. But Warren argues that they are impeding competition by buying up or squashing smaller rivals — and ultimately harming consumers. She cited the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s that tamed its ways and made room for an upstart — Google — to rise. “Aren’t we glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?”
But experts from Wharton and elsewhere challenge some of the basic premises of her proposal and warn that breaking up these three companies could result in unintended consequences that ultimately would harm consumers. The presence of Amazon, Google and Facebook in the market, they ...

Corporate restructuring of some of the parties to a Finnish cartel raises questions with regard to liability for damages
Between 1994 and 2002 a number of Finnish companies participated in a cartel. By the time the Finnish Supreme Court decided to impose penalties on the cartelists, some of the companies involved had been dissolved in voluntary liquidation procedures. However, their respective sole shareholders acquired their subsidiaries’ assets and continued their economic activity.
Under EU and Finnish competition law, penalties for anticompetitive conduct can be imposed on the legal persons continuing the economic activity of the infringer, under the principle of economic continuity.
Subsequently, a private action for damages was brought before the competent District Court against the companies that had been ordered to pay penalty payments, including the companies that continued the economic activity of the cartelists. These companies then contested the claim that they were jointly and severally liable for the cartel damage, inter alia alleging that they ...

Antitrust Returns to American Politics
By Tim Wu
Senator Elizabeth Warren’s announcement on Friday of a plan to break up major tech monopolies like Facebook and Google was critically important — not just as a policy proposal, but also as a sign of the return of antitrust to politics.
In the United States, economic policy is ostensibly a matter of democratic governance, but for too long antitrust has been viewed as a technocratic matter best left to experts. This is a mistake: Excessive corporate size and power can be linked to many voter concerns, including stagnant wages, the invasion of privacy, the rise of fake news, the demise of the middle class and an unresponsive democracy.
Antitrust is especially salient today because we witness the tremendous power of the tech monopolies firsthand, in our daily lives. Nearly everyone uses Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, and nearly everyone can see how smaller businesses have been hurt by their dominance. Nearly everyone has an opinion about whether they are too powerful, whether they know too much, whether they ought to be admired or feared.
Add to these concerns the dangers of agricultural monopolies, rising costs for cable and broadband, and anticompetitive drug pricing, and it is clear that for Ms. Warren and other presidential hopefuls in the Democratic field, the problem of monopoly power should be a central issue — perhaps the central issue — in the 2020 campaign.

By Elizabeth Warren

Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn’t exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It’s a great story — but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.
In the 1990s, Microsoft — the tech giant of its time — was trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government’s antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.
The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive — which pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services. Aren’t we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?

CPI EU News: FCO Facebook Quadriptych
In early February 2019, the German Bundeskartellamt (“FCO”) announced its highly anticipated and “ground-breaking” Facebook decision. CPI EU News is pleased to present a Quadriptych of four short articles on this hot topic from a great panel of authors.
The FCO concluded that Facebook infringed German competition law by violating the European General Data Protection Regulation. The case is the first to establish an infringement of competition law rules where the practices were in conflict with data protection principles… thus, “straddling the line between competition policy and data protection.”
Some authors argue that the decision “ultimately pushes competition law far beyond its natural confines.” Others opine that the case “may represent an important step into European competition law’s future in digital markets.” What consequences might this case have beyond Germany?

YouTube se ha opuesto vigorosamente a los cambios propuestos a las leyes.
El texto final de las normas debe ser confirmado formalmente por el Parlamento Europeo, que celebra elecciones en mayo, así como por el Consejo de la UE. Después, los estados miembros de la UE tendrán 24 meses para adoptar las nuevas normas dentro de sus leyes nacionales.
“Tener por fin reglas modernas de derechos de autor para toda la UE es un logro importante que se debió conseguir hace mucho”, dijo el vicepresidente de la Comisión Europea para el mercado único digital, Andrus Ansip, en un comunicado. “Las negociaciones fueron difíciles, pero lo que cuenta al final es que tenemos un resultado justo y equilibrado que es adecuado para una Europa digital: las libertades y los derechos que disfrutan los usuarios de Internet hoy serán mejorados, nuestros creadores serán mejor remunerados por su trabajo y la economía de internet tendrá reglas más claras para operar y prosperar “.

European Union negotiators agreed Wednesday on codified language in a new set of sweeping copyright-reform rules, including a provision that would mandate YouTube and other internet platforms block copyrighted material when it’s uploaded. YouTube in particular has been particularly vigorous in opposing the proposed changes to the laws.
The finalized text of the rules must next be formally confirmed by the European Parliament, which holds elections this May, as well as the Council of the EU. After that, the EU’s member states will have 24 months to adopt the new rules into their national legislation.
“To finally have modern copyright rules for the whole of EU is a major achievement that was long overdue,” European Commission VP for the digital single market Andrus Ansip said in a statement released Wednesday. “The negotiations were difficult, but what counts in the end is that we have a fair and balanced result that is fit for a digital Europe: the freedoms and rights enjoyed by internet users today will be enhanced, our creators will be better remunerated for their work, and the internet economy will have clearer rules for operating and thriving.”

Do such cases represent the outer extremes of how far behavioral thinking can and should be taken? Or do they represent baby steps towards the more comprehensive incorporation of behavioral economics into competition policy thinking? This article highlights the widespread influence of behavioral economics across other areas of policy and discusses a number of directions in which competition policy could potentially be transformed. Noting the existence of an extensive literature in behavioral antitrust, it focuses on a number of aspects which have been given less attention to date.

The recent EU Google decisions made waves around the world. In large part, this was because they involved a huge and innovative digital economy platform and were the highest fines yet imposed by the EU. However, the decisions are also notable for their reliance on key insights from behavioral economics.
Behavioral economics may not have been mentioned explicitly in the Google Shopping decision, but the Commission’s case hangs on the fact that the “more favorable positioning” of results on the Google search page leads to increased traffic and click-throughs. As such, the case effectively relies on a behavioral tendency called saliency...

Summary of FTC Hearing #7: Algorithms, AI, and Predictive Analytics By Norman Armstrong, Jr. and Albert Kim (King & Spalding)1
Introduction
The FTC continued its Hearings Initiative with a two-day hearing at Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. on November 13-14. In keeping with the FTC’s dual enforcement priorities, the panels and presentations focused on both the consumer protection and antitrust implications of algorithms, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and predictive analytics.
The hearing topics were complicated, broad and implicated many legal, regulatory and ethical issues. As Professor Andrew Gavil from Howard University School of Law noted in his introductory remarks, the hearing’s agenda was designed to take a more interdisciplinary approach than prior hearings.
The panelists, drawn from universities, corporations, non-profits, trade associations and law firms, discussed the substantial progress made in the fields of algorithmic decision-making and machine learning, particularly in the last twenty-five years. This progress has created and is continuing to create significant benefits and opportunities, but at the same time raises profound challenges in terms of data privacy and security, as well as concerning questions of fairness, accountability and inclusiveness.

CPI EU News Column edited by Thibault Schrepel, Sam Sadden & Jan Roth (CPI) presents:
Apple/Shazam: Data Is Power, But Not A Problem Here By Nicolo Zingales (Sussex Law School)1
Introduction
Is there a significant impediment to effective competition where a major provider of music streaming services acquires a leading application for automatic music recognition, particularly insofar as the latter enables the identification and targeting of users of competing streaming apps? In Apple/Shazam,2 the European Commission answered this question in the negative, considering several ways in which the data collected through that application could lead to a competitive advantage. The Decision constitutes an important addition to the series of EU merger cases involving the use of customers’ personal data,3 as distinct from broader “big data” concerns.4
Facts
On March 14, 2018, the Commission received the notification of a concentration that would result in Apple’s acquisition of Shazam, a developer and distributor of music recognition apps for smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. The notification followed a referral pursuant to a request made on December 21, 2017 by the Austrian competition authority, to whom the acquisition was notified on December 12, 2017; competition authorities of seven more EEA Member States subsequently joined the request. On April 23, 2018, the Commission opened a Phase II investigation due to two distinct non-horizontal and non-coordinated effects:5 (a) the potential foreclosure of competing providers of automatic content recognition (“ACR”) software solutions as a result of conduct such as pre-installing Shazam on iOS, integrating Shazam with iOS, or degrading the interoperability of ACR solutions provided by Shazam’s competitors on iOS; and (b) the potential foreclosure of competing providers of digital music streaming apps as a result of Apple gaining access to commercially sensitive information on its rivals through the Concentration.
However, having conducted an in-depth investigation on the databases maintained by Apple Music, Apple Music’s competitors, and Shazam’s competitors and having examined several possible concerns arising from the concentration, the Commission concluded in its Decision on September 6, 2018 that the Transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in any of the following: (i) the licensing of music charts data at worldwide level, in the EEA or in any of the Referring States; (ii) online advertising services in any of the Referring States; (iii) digital music streaming apps in the EEA or in any of the Referring States; and (iv) ACR software solutions at worldwide level or in the EEA.
 
The Decision
The Decision takes a close look at the digital music industry, including digital music streaming services and ACR software solutions, and the role played by user data in generating insights, product development, and targeted advertising. It identifies five distinct relevant markets: (1) software solution platforms; (2) digital music distribution services; (3) ACR software solutions, including music recognition apps; (4) licensing of music data; and (5) online advertising.6 The Commission left open the possibility of further market segmentation, as there would be no impediment of effective competition under any of the plausible definitions. Nevertheless, what appears clear from the competitive assessment of these markets is that Apple has a considerable share (20-30 percent) both in software solution platforms and digital streaming apps; while Shazam has a prominent share (in excess of 30 percent) in the market for music recognition apps for smart mobile devices, and a more marginal position in the market for ACR software solutions (5-10 percent). Finally, although the investigation was inconclusive with regard to the market shares of the parties in the markets for licensing of music charts data and online advertising, the Commission confirmed in its investigation the existence of multiple alternative providers.7 That finding, along with the complementarity of the parties’ datasets, led to the conclusion that the merger would not give rise to horizontal effects.8
With regard to non-horizontal effects, the Commission considered potential foreclosure of competing providers of digital music streaming apps due to the acquisition of commercially sensitive information, compounded by two possible groups of practices that Apple could undertake post-Transaction, that is denial or degradation of access of Apple Music’s rivals to: (i) Shazam’s referral mechanism as a customer acquisition channel; (ii) Shazam’s referral mechanism as a functionality that boosts user engagement and enriches user experience; (iii) Shazam as an advertising tool; (iv) Shazam as a provider of in-app music recognition functionalities; (v) Shazam’s User Data as an input to improve existing functionalities, or offering additional functionalities, on music streaming services.
Thus, the first and main theory of harm reviewed by the Decision concerns the possibility that Apple would take advantage post-transaction of the information acquired by Shazam, including via its current API integration with Spotify, to derive commercially sensitive information. In particular, Apple could combine the Customer App Information (which includes information about the presence of non-pre-installed digital music streaming apps on the mobile device where Shazam is installed) with additional identifying information (such as email address, Facebook ID, mobile’s advertising ID, etc.) enabling it to draw up a list of customers of Apple Music’s and potentially target them with personalized offers. Here the Commission notes, “without prejudice to the assessment by competent data protection authorities” that such data aggregation seems to be permitted under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as Shazam’s terms of service “appear to inform” on the processing of the Customer Information processed by Shazam.9
Furthermore, Shazam is already able to access data about which apps are installed on a user’s Android device, because the Android Developer Guidelines allow all apps to do so. On the other hand, Spotify’s developer terms and conditions are quite stringent, imposing developers to: (i) only request from Spotify users the data they need to operate their app; (ii) not to email Spotify users without explicit consent; (iii) completely and accurately disclose the privacy practices and policies they apply on their app or website; and (iv) not use Spotify’s user data “in any manner to compete with Spotify.”10
Nevertheless, despite the existence of legal and contractual constraints on the use of Customer App Information, the Commission assessed whether the targeted advertising made possible by the combination of databases was likely to have negative impacts on effective competition, and concluded that it did not on three grounds.11 First, the ability to access the Customer App Information on Android is not limited to Shazam and would not be limited to Apple post-Transaction (unlike for iOS). Second, the market investigation clearly indicated that the digital music streaming service market in the EEA (and in the Referring States, including Iceland where Apple Music is active) has been growing considerably, and that there are already several providers with the capability of targeting “music enthusiasts.” Third, the Commission noted that Apple has stated its plans to change Shazam’s data collection practices in order to bring them in line with Apple’s industry-leading positions on privacy and, thus, to update the Shazam app for OSs other than Apple’s OSs so that it will “not send to Apple the Customer App Information unless the music streaming service of that user agrees to allow this information to be sent to Apple.”12
The second theory of harm contemplated by the Decision is one of denial and degradation of access by competitors to Shazam’s referral mechanism as a customer acquisition tool. The Commission here determined that, even if the merged entity were to have the technical ability and the incentives to engage in such practices, it is unlikely that they would have the ability to foreclose competing providers of digital music streaming apps and adversely affect competition.13 This is because Shazam’s market shares have not translated into a significant degree of market power. And in fact, given the low number of referrals for registration currently coming from Shazam, the effects of denial or degradation of access of competing providers of digital music streaming apps to Shazam’s referral mechanism are unlikely to be sufficient to reduce their ability or incentives to compete.
A third and related theory considered by the Decision concerns the denial and degradation of competitors’ access to Shazam’s referral mechanism as a functionality boosting engagement and enriching experience. Here again, the Commission notes that the merged entity would lack the incentives to foreclose competition simply because of Shazam’s limited market power,14 and the limited relevance of referral mechanisms in competition between digital music streaming apps. The Commission notes that already pre-Transaction, the referral tile to Apple Music has a more prominent position on iOS devices (due to an existing partnership between the merging parties), which has failed to produce significant results in user engagement. And in any case, nothing would prevent users, post-transaction, from “shazaming” songs and listening to them on rival digital music streaming apps.15
A fourth and important theory of harm in the Decision explores the possible “big data” advantage arising from the acquisition of Shazam: Shazam’s data could be exploited to improve existing functionalities, or offer additional functionalities, on digital music streaming apps. Here, the Commission concludes that Shazam User Data does not appear to be unique and, thus, be able to confer a significant “data advantage” to Apple post-Transaction.16 The Commission’s assessment is based on an in-depth investigation of data available on users of digital music services using four relevant big data metrics: that is the variety of data composing the dataset; the speed at which the data are collected (velocity); the size of the data set (volume); and the economic relevance (value). In particular, it finds that Shazam’s data are not more comprehensive than other datasets available in the market, they are generated at a lower speed and with lower per user engagement, and have never been considered as a strategic asset by the merging parties.
A fifth theory of harm was that Shazam could be used to serve more effective ads, for instance through push notifications that promote Apple Music on Android devices. However, this theory was quickly dismissed on grounds that Shazam’s strength in the advertising market is relatively low; and that users always remain free to choose not to receive any of the notifications in question.17
Yet perhaps the most elaborate theory of harm examined by the Commission has to do with the possible foreclosure of competing providers of ACR software solutions, including music recognition apps, by the adoption of two different types of strategies: first, by providing different levels of integration of ACR functionalities between Apple Music apps and competing digital music streaming apps; second, by leveraging of Apple’s strong market position in other products or services, most notably in the hardware space.
The Commission rejects the first scenario, noting the existence of several alternative ACR providers, and endorsing the view gathered during the investigation that the concentration may have the positive effect of encouraging digital music distributors to partner with providers of ACR technology.18
As to the second scenario, the Commission acknowledges the theoretically possible impact on competition of the following three practices: (a) pre-installation of the Shazam app on Apple’s PCs, smart mobile devices, and other platforms; (b) deeper integration of Shazam’s app on Apple’s products and services; and (c) reduction of interoperability between Apple’s products and services (and, specifically, Apple devices’ microphone) and third parties ACR apps and software solution.19 However, it finds the concerns not to be merger-specific, as there is already a partnership and integration is in place between Apple Siri and Shazam’s ACR technology.20
Furthermore, preventing hardware integration by competing ACR software solutions providers would be against Apple’s interest to have a multitude of apps in its ecosystem, ultimately affecting its competitiveness vis à vis other platforms.21 In any case, the Commission rules out any likely competitive impact of such integration in light of the fact that the parties do not have a sufficiently strong position in the market, respectively, for ACR software solutions platforms and ACR software solutions.22
 
Author Opinion
This Decision offers food for thought to the ongoing discussion on the reform of competition law in a data-driven environment.23 One takeaway is the difficulty of assessing market power in the presence of non-monetary pricing. The Commission also expresses discomfort in using market shares as a proxy for market power in fast-growing sectors characterized by frequent market entry and short innovation cycles,24 while also noting that Shazam is not a startup company and there is no history of disruptive entry or innovation.25 Absent from this discussion, however, is a hands-on examination of the ACR technology and business models, which could have arguably shed light on the relative quality of the products offered by competitors and the scope for entry.
First, the Decision only provides an introduction to the technology in question, distinguishing between fingerprinting and watermarking: in the former, quality depends on algorithms extracting recognizable data for audio signals and a large reference database, which is built upon the source fingerprints given by music labels and music streaming or download service providers and music aggregators. In the latter, quality depends on algorithms aimed at inserting data into the audio signal, and a smaller reference database that is likely to require closer cooperation with music publishers and record companies. While we are told that providers of ACR software solutions rely on both technologies, it appears difficult to assess the effects of the concentration without a clear picture of the relative importance of those algorithms and reference databases. This is disconcerting as ACR software solutions are destined to become crucial gatekeepers for the flow of information in the EU, particularly in light of recent legislative and policy proposals to require the adoption of on the installation of content recognition technologies to prevent the circulation of illegal content.
Second, a measurement of market power as the ability to reduce quality in this market can hardly overlook the significance of in-service advertising. This arguably implies the need for an assessment of the elasticity of demand in reaction to an increase in advertising, and of the frequency and intensity of advertising across providers of ACR software solutions. It is somewhat disappointing that, although the Commission perceives the existence of a problem with its estimation of market power, it fails to conduct the holistic inquiry that would enable it to reach more solid conclusions. This is all the more problematic considering that Shazam’s limited market power was a core reason for dismissal of the second, third, and sixth of the above-mentioned theories of harm.
Another aspect worth noting in this Decision is the interaction of competition and other policy goals. Specifically, one of the concerns that led the Commission to open a second phase investigation was inextricably linked to data protection law: would it be possible for Apple to use information collected through Shazam in order to identify customers of Apple Music’s rivals, and ultimately target them with advertising or marketing campaigns? While data protection law does not a priori prevent such targeting, the assessment in that context depends on the specific conditions of processing of personal data, including its transparency and the safeguards available to data subjects.
The Commission did not conduct such detailed assessment, however,26 which could potentially mean that by approving a concentration that raises data protection concerns it failed to fulfill its duty to protect EU Charter rights. For this reason, a welcome development in connection with this Decision is the effort by the European Data Protection Board to initiate inter-institutional dialogue, through an unprecedented statement issued during the investigation calling for the consideration of the data protection and privacy interests of individuals where one or more companies have accumulated “significant informational power.”27
In line with recent initiatives by the European Data Protection Supervisor,28 the Statement goes beyond data protection: it demands the assessment of “longer-term implications for the protection of economic, data protection and consumer rights whenever a significant merger is proposed, particularly in technology sectors of the economy.”29
Whether the European Commission and other competition authorities are indeed ready to take that challenge remains to be seen. In this regard, it is worth exploring the suggestion made in the Statement that such assessment be “separate to and independent from, or integrated into, the competitive analysis.” Should a digital rights impact assessment be one of the measures proposed in the reform package for competition law in the digital age? If so, what form should it take? Given the competition authorities’ lack of competence in making data protection determinations, this would arguably require the institutionalization of a dedicated cooperation mechanism between digital regulators.30

Themes and Takeaways from the FTC Hearings on the Intersection of Big Data, Privacy, and Competition By Elena Kamenir (Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe)1
On November 6-8, 2018, the U.S. FTC held hearings on privacy, big data, and competition as a part of its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century series.2 The hearings covered a wide array of issues, including whether privacy concerns affect competition analysis, how to evaluate conduct and mergers involving big data, which remedies are appropriate to address antitrust harm involving certain datasets, and the policy recommendations and implications surrounding these issues. This article first summarizes common issues discussed on the panels. Although there was much consensus among panelists, differences emerged regarding the intersection of competition, privacy, and big data. This article concludes by outlining three issues on which antitrust and consumer protection practitioners will continue to focus on and debate.
 
Common Issues Discussed During the Hearings  

 What Makes Data Valuable? 

One of the threshold questions when analyzing the impact of big data is whether the data is valuable. Panelists generally agreed that the value of data is highly dependent on how the data will be used and analyzed. Florian Zettelmeyer identified three categories exemplifying how data analytics can be useful. Data analytics can: (1) enable business initiatives; (2) enable idea generation; an...

754,"November 19, 2018",Android Remedies: Tearing Down the Wall?,"
November 2018

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
Android Remedies: Tearing Down the Wall? By Simonetta Vezzoso (Trento University)1
Introduction
The control of abusive practices has long been touted as the most arduous area of competition law, fittingly compared to climbing Mount Everest.2 Once the anticompetitive practices have been proven, though, devising appropriate remedies might at times vividly recall the challenges posed by another mythical mountain, namely the K2. While not the highest mountain in the world, climbing the K2 is generally considered harder.
The two recent Google Decisions might well exemplify many of these difficulties. Following long and complex investigations, the European Commission (“Commission”) imposed on Google a whopping total fine of €6.7 billion. While Google has already applied for annulment of both infringement decisions, the antitrust eyeballs are now fixated on the respective remedial phases of the proceedings. Neither in the Google Shopping Case, nor in the Android Case, the Commission dictated a specific remedy but instead left it up to Google to propose measures that can effectively bring the infringements of Article 102 TFEU to an end.
The Google Shopping decision was issued in July 2017.3 The Android Decision has been announced on 18 July 2018, and while the public is still waiting for the pleasure of reading it, Google has already started implementing significant changes to the Android ecosystem as a consequence of its proposed remedies to the alleged anticompetitive practices.
The legal framework for remedies to abuses of dominance under EU law is set by Council Regulation 1/20034 and the relevant case law. The Commission can impose behavioral or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed. Moreover, the purpose of a remedy in an infringement decision is “to bring the infringement effectively to an end.” When it comes to effectiveness, it is of course a matter of degree. A remedy worth its name should at the very least put an end to the types of conduct considered abusive. Put differently, the dominant undertaking should be prevented from continuing to engage in the future in the conduct that has been found to be abusive (the “sin no more” remedy). While this is obviously crucial, a more comprehensive and effective remedy should also consider stopping the effects of the abusive behavior and therefore, truly eliminating the consequences of the competition law infringement. This would require restoring the competitive process that would have prevailed but for the abusive practice(s). This does not mean trying to go back in time, especially in rapidly changing markets. Efforts should be made, however, to ensure that the market is as competitive as it would have been, if not for the legal violation. Depending on the circumstances of the case, this could mean re-creating the conditions for smaller competitors to compete and innovate. In the most extreme scenarios, structural remedies could be necessary, like divesting parts of the business of the dominant undertaking to substitute for the competitive threat successfully eliminated by the abusive practices of that dominant undertaking. The undeniable challenge here is how to construct a suitable counterfactual. While difficult, this should not be a suitable excuse for tying one’s hands and not engaging the enforcer’s best efforts aimed to the accomplishment of the all-important task of restoring the competitive process in the interest of consumers. This is also to avoid a dangerous externality in the form of the otherwise credible message that infringing competition law pays, especially in winner-takes-all markets.5
 
The little we know about the Android remedies
Competition Commissioner Vestager made clear that Google was required to bring the conduct effectively to an end within 90 days of the decision.
At a minimum Google has to stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices considered abusive, namely the tying practices, the exclusivity payments and the obstruction to the development of Android forks.6 “In other words,” explains the Commissioner “our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can pre-install on Android devices, or which Android operating system they can adopt.” Moreover, the Decision imposes Google an obligation “to refrain from any measure that has the same or an equivalent object or effect as the practices found abusive”.7  Finally, the Commission specifies that the “decision does not prevent Google from putting in place a reasonable, fair and objective system to ensure the correct functioning of Android devices using Google proprietary apps and services, without however affecting device manufacturers’ freedom to produce devices based on Android forks.”
If the Google Shopping Decision can serve here as a template8, Google in the Android case had until the end of September (60 days) to come up with a remedy proposal. After that, it is realistic to suppose that a number of substantial exchanges between the Commission and Google took place.9 On 28 October 2018 Google started implementing its chosen remedy.
Following Google’s public announcement illustrating the core of the proposed remedies on 16 October 201810, many external commentators have strongly criticized them (but the complainants in the Android Case have remained remarkably quiet).11
Google’s public announcement focuses on a series of changes to the contracts with device manufacturers. First, Google unbundles the Google Search and the Chrome browser apps from the group of other Google mobile applications (G-Suite). This means that, for instance, if the device manufacturer decides to install Google Play (Android’s app store) on her devices, she does not need to install Google Search and Chrome. She is required, however, to install the other apps comprised in the G-suite.
What has also attracted much attention, and early criticism, is another aspect of Google’s proposed remedy package, namely Google’s intention to introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets wanting to use Google mobile applications. As Google puts it, “(s)ince the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we will introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped into the EEA.” How much handset manufacturers will have to pay is still unclear. According to documents purportedly seen by some journalists, Google will charge handset makers wishing to use its mobile application package as much as $40 in Europe, depending on the country and the device’s pixel density. Fees would apply to devices activated on or after February 1, 2019.12
On the other hand, the Google Search app and Chrome will be licensed separately and do not foresee a licensing fee. At the same time, Google offers new commercial agreements to device manufacturers for the non-exclusive pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome. In its offering to device manufacturers Google will now compete with app developers in the browser and search markets. This means that a device manufacturer can choose, based on a number of commercial considerations, to pre-install browsers and search apps alternative to Google Search and Chrome, like for instance Bing, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Firefox Focus, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, Puffin and Opera.
Another modification in the contracts with handset manufacturers relates to the forking restriction. Manufacturers selling handsets that carry the G-suite may also build and distribute forked smartphones. This means, for instance, that Samsung, Motorola, Sony, HTC, LG could start offering Android forks. In this respect, the Commission wrote that it had “found evidence that Google’s conduct prevented a number of large manufacturers from developing and selling devices based on Amazon’s Android fork called ‘Fire OS.13’”
Besides the modifications to the contracts with handset manufacturers succinctly described by Google in its blog post, further bits and pieces of a broader reshuffling of the Android ecosystem are starting to emerge from the ever attentive business press. Thus, for instance, Google will be offering in the European Play Store ‘Google Voice Action Services’. While this app shares the same voice-based capabilities of Google Assistant, it does not provide any web search capability. Users who buy devices from handset manufacturers that do not pre-install Search will still be able to use it.14 It is also interesting that Google is introducing for the first time into its contracts with handset manufacturers the requirement that manufacturers install security patches in a timely matter. It is not clear, however, if the contracts foresee penalties if manufacturers fail to meet Google’s security requirements.15
Of castles and fortresses
For all the current digital hype, the Android case brought by the European Commission is still largely Old School. In particular, the conduct considered anticompetitive by the EU competition enforcer was not embedded in complex code, or black boxes, but was in rather plain sight, namely in the written contracts between Google and device manufacturers.
One of the possible narratives of the theory of harm in the Android case is that Google built a moat around its castle, the search engine, and that some of the tactics and constructions employed were abusive under Article 102 TFEU. Some of those tactics, apparently, comprised extending the fortification to reinforce the castle’s defences.16 Restoring competition in the markets affected by the abusive types of conduct would seem to require reducing some of those defences, like lowering the walls of the fortress,17 including lowering barriers to entry. While promoting competition and innovation within the ecosystem, this could benefit some actual or potential competitors of Google. The fact that these competitors may or may not choose to take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by the remedies is not in the competition enforcer’s control, especially in fast moving digital markets. In some instances, however, the fact that new competition does not emerge and grow is a clear indication that the remedy package could have been better engineered. Ideally, consumers should benefit directly from remedies carefully devised to increase competition and choice, and not only from the overall “distraction” that antitrust enforcement causes to the dominant undertaking.18
The Google Cases, as well as the still to these days passionately debated Microsoft Cases19,make it abundantly clear that, going forward, the remedial phase of a competition law proceeding deserves increased attention.
For once, remedies need to be proportionate, meaning among other things that they must be suitable in addressing the harm at issue.20 In markets where technology changes rapidly, however, addressing the “harm at issue” is rarely straightforward. Thus, for instance, an adequate remedy21 in these markets is necessarily forward-looking, and directly addressing the harm as it materialized in a drastically different technological environment is unlikely to be effective. In this respect, an intrinsic tension may emerge between remedies that are proportionate, or suitable, in the sense that they address the conduct that is found to be illegal, and remedies that are truly effective in restoring competition. This is especially the case in today’s entrenched digital markets, where attacks that do not merely weaken the fortress defenses but that may be successful in breaching the walls of the fortress are notoriously rare.22 This is another significant, albeit often disregarded, way in which competition law is challenged in the era of digitization.
A further remedy-related aspect that needs careful attention is that the two engines driving the current economic and societal changes, namely software and data, are highly malleable and transformative. It follows that competition authorities might encounter serious difficulties in devising mechanisms allowing for their full potential to be preserved in the interest of consumers, while providing effective remedies against anticompetitive practices. Moreover, there might be an ever increasing information asymmetry between high tech-savvy undertakings and competition enforcers, entailing a serious risk of successful strategizing and gaming by the former, especially in the remedial phase. Understandably, competition authorities are reacting to this and other new challenges by increasing their in-house technological competence. This not only might improve the detection of anticompetitive behavior, but also strengthen later phases of competition enforcement, including the restoration of competitive processes where their functioning has been hampered by anticompetitive effects.

The Consumer Welfare Debate Comes to the FTC Hearings: Who’s on the Right Side of History? By Joseph V. Coniglio (Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati)1
Introduction
One of the greatest virtues of a consumer welfare standard is the ability to distinguish harm to competition from harm to competitors using an objective and empirical framework rooted in economics.  This is in contrast with standards that embody normative judgments about how many firms should exist in an industry to realize goals of furthering democracy or fairness.  Unsurprisingly, the FTC’s much anticipated hearing on the consumer welfare standard, which took place on November 1st at Georgetown University Law Center, put on display a fundamental and ongoing debate among commentators about the merits of welfarist antitrust policy.  Unlike disagreements concerning the application of a consumer welfare standard to evaluate a particular category of business conduct, the FTC’s hearing may come to represent a sea change in the consumer welfare debate from the economic framework of error costs and administrability to a larger normative discourse in which reference to these types of economic decision criteria risks begging the question against non-welfarist standards.2
Within this latter modality, appeals to history emerged as somewhat of a theme amongst several panelists critical of a consumer welfare standard.3  That is, continued adherence to such a standard was not so implicitly suggested t...

A panel of three federal appeals court judges named by former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will hear the Justice Department’s appeal of a ruling allowing AT&T Inc to acquire Time Warner, court records show.
Judges Judith W. Rogers, Robert L. Wilkins and David B. Sentelle will hear arguments on December 6th.
The government argues that AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition will lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law, while AT&T says the government offered no basis for second guessing key conclusions of a lower-court ruling allowing the transaction to proceed.
Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, and Rogers, who was named to the bench by Clinton, were among seven appeals court judges in June 2001 that issued an opinion tossing out an order that Microsoft Corp should be broken up but found that the company possessed monopoly power and agreed that the company had behaved anticompetively.
The company ultimately agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department and an agreement to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software.

Platforms in the Spotlight at the FTC Hearings
By Joshua D. Wright and John M. Yun (George Mason University)1
The Spotlight on Platforms
Over a series of three days, from October 15 to 17, 2018, the Global Antitrust Institute (GAI) hosted the third session of the FTC Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University. After introductory remarks by Scalia Law School Dean Henry Butler and Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra, the panels broadly focused upon three topics: (1) multisided platforms, (2) nascent/potential competition, and (3) labor policy. The overarching focus of the hearings was clearly multisided platforms, which accounted for seven of the twelve panels.
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Ohio v. American Express, platforms are rightly the subject of significant attention and discussion ranging from the economic tools and methods to evaluate platforms to the correct legal framework for capturing and shaping that analysis. The economic research on platforms began in earnest fifteen years ago with pioneering work from Evans (2003) and Rochet and Tirole (2003).2 Much of the important economic learning over the past fifteen years—economic concepts such as cross-group effects, the interrelationship of demand, and the difference between transaction and non-transaction platforms—are becoming part of the antitrust lexicon. Much of the discussion at the hearings mi...

Recommendations Following the FTC’s October 2018 Hearings on IP and Innovation
By Koren W. Wong-Ervin & Dr. Georgios Effraimidis1
On October 23-24, 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) held hearings on intellectual property (IP) and innovation as part of its broader ongoing hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century.2 The hearings focused on the role of IP protection in promoting innovation, as well as the foundational question of whether the FTC (and the government more broadly) should play a role in advancing or supporting innovation and, if so, what role. The Commission is seeking further public input through its consultation process on this important (and commendable) inquiry, including asking whether the FTC currently uses its enforcement and policy authority to advance innovation, and what factors it should consider in attempting to achieve this objective.3 The hearings also included sessions on the role of IP in business and investment decisions, emerging trends in patent quality and litigation, and industry and economic perspectives on current U.S. IP and innovation policy.4
This short article summarizes some of the major themes from these hearings and provides an economic and legal analysis of the relevant testimony. We conclude with recommendations for the FTC to consider when evaluating possible future enforcement and policy work in this area. Our recommendations focus primarily on certain concerning positi...

759,"October 24, 2018",US: Steve Hilton: Rewrite antitrust law to deal with tech monopolies,"
According to a report from Recode, author Steve Hilton says that to effectively regulate the tech sector, we first have to unlearn a lot of things we take for granted.
“[There’s a] story we used to tell, a true story, about whether Facebook knocked out Myspace and Google knocked out Microsoft, and these tech companies don’t stay powerful for too long,” Hilton said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. “It feels like that’s not really true anymore.”
On top of that, he told Recode’s Kara Swisher, not-very-old axioms about corporate regulation no longer apply. He cited the example of onetime Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, who argued that “the size of a company is only a problem” if it prevents customers from getting “decent-quality products and services at a reasonable price.”
Today, multiple tech giants operate in parallel to one another, giving away high-quality products for nothing, which prevents most competitors from challenging their dominance.
“When I was learning economics at university, we had this notion of predatory pricing, which is when you price your product below marginal cost in order to shut out the competition, and that was seen as a problem,” Hilton said. “Well, now, predatory pricing is the business model, which is we give it away free.”

The end of competition?
By Robert J. Samuelson
Competition is dying. That’s the latest complaint against American business. We have too many supersized firms, excessively large and unnaturally profitable. Dubious mergers, permitted by toothless antitrust laws, boost companies’ market power and squash rivals. The lifeblood of a dynamic economy is competition; its erosion — if true — would be a momentous event.
But is it true? Let’s see.
Superficially, there’s ample corroborating evidence. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and some other tech firms are massive and have dominant market positions in their chosen fields. Google — to take one obvious example — has about 90 percent of the Internet search market.
Mergers and acquisitions among large firms are also common, with antitrust laws providing only limited restraint. Just recently, the Justice Department (which shares antitrust enforcement with the Federal Trade Commission) approved the $69 billion health-industry merger between CVS and Aetna. Earlier, Justice challenged the $85 billion merger between Time Warner and AT&T, but a federal court backed the companies.
A number of studies indicate that economic consolidation — fewer firms providing goods and services — is occurring in many industries. The best-known report came in 2016 from President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). It found that all U.S. corporate mergers and acquisitions totaled about $2....

The New Brandeis Movement (“NBM”) initially appeared to constitute a broad policy platform aimed at replacing antitrust law’s consumer welfare standard with a structural paradigm that would reanimate the purported political content of the Sherman Act.2  After receiving criticism from many in the antitrust bar, the NBM appears—at least as a practical matter—to have both abandoned a political reinterpretation of U.S. antitrust law and emphasized Section 5 of the FTC Act, which is already generally understood to reach at least some business conduct that is beyond the scope of the Sherman Act, as a vehicle for its enforcement program.3  Still, a structural theory of antitrust divorced from the consumer welfare standard—and thus distinct from the Harvard School—appears to remain central to the NBM’s competition policy.4
Separated from both broader political goals and the consumer welfare standard, however, the question arises as to what rationale the NBM would now employ for its structure and process paradigm, which ultimately appears to reduce to a “big is bad” approach to antitrust that would condemn at least some increases in market concentration without any presumption or case-specific evidence evincing a reduction in consumer welfare.5  To answer this question, it...

At a conference hosted by Georgetown Law in Washington, DC, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Joseph Simons said that the Commission is “thinking about what to do and how to bring cases” regarding big tech companies buying up small startups.
YouTube and Instagram were both young startups when Google and Facebook bought them. More recently, Microsoft proposed to buy GitHub for US$7.5 billion and Amazon bought online pharmacy PillPack for US$1 billion.
“These types of transactions are particularly difficult for antitrust enforcers to deal with because the acquiring firm is, by definition, not a full-fledged competitor,” Simons said. “And also the likely level of competition with the acquiring firm is frequently, maybe more than frequently, not apparent. But harm to competition can nonetheless be significant.”
The FTC has had a series of hearing this month to examine “whether broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies, or international developments might require adjustments to competition and consumer protection enforcement law, enforcement priorities, and policy,” according to the FTC’s website.

AT&T, Twitter, Alphabet’s Google and three other major web and internet service companies plan to testify before a US Senate panel later in September to lay out their consumer data privacy practices.
According to a report in Reuters, the companies – which also include Amazon, Apple and Charter Communications – will appear before the Senate on September 26 to explain their approaches to privacy, said John Thune, the Republican senator and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The senator said they will also testify as to “how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation.”
Those expected to testify, according to the report, include Google’s chief privacy officer, Twitter’s global data protection officer and Apple’s vice president of software technology.
The comments from the senator come a day after The Internet Association, a group that represents Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, among other technology and internet companies, said it supports data privacy rules in the U.S. that are more modern, but urged lawmakers to approach the issue nationally. According to a different report in Reuters, the trade group wants the rules to preempt a new regulation on the books in California that comes into effect in 2020.

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
How to Reform the Law on Abusive Practices: The study that will serve as a basis for reform in Germany (and Europe?) By Rupprecht Podszun (Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf)1
Germany is starting to prepare the next major reform of its competition law. While the 9th amendment of the national Act against Restraints of Competition in 2017 introduced a couple of new norms for the digital age that were partly of clarifying character, it now looks as if there would be more substantial shifts. The first step in the process (expected to take up to two years) was to commission a study by renowned professors on the need to reform the norms on abusive practices. Rupprecht Podszun, professor for competition law at the University of Düsseldorf, gives a first impression of what new tools may come up in Germany – and on the EU level.
Politicians in Germany have always been more critical of the rise of the MAGAF-companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook) than elsewhere. As early as 2014, then Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel called for a tough European initiative against the power of Google. Yet, it took the Commission another three years to come up with Google Shopping (a decision that probably fell short of what Gabriel had wished for). The German national competition authority, the Bundeskartellamt,...

Amazon’s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea
By David Streitfeld
The dead books are on the top floor of Southern Methodist University’s law library.
“Antitrust Dilemma.” “The Antitrust Impulse.” “Antitrust in an Expanding Economy.” Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.
At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. “This is my command post,” said Lina Khan.
It’s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.
The retailer overwhelmingly dominates online commerce, employs more than half a million people and powers much of the internet itself through its cloud computing division. On Tuesday, it briefly became the second company to be worth a trillion dollars.
If competitors tremble at Amazon’s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon’s customers,...

The senator is right to demand a renewed antitrust investigation of the tech behemoth
By Rana Forooh 
Every twenty years or so, a major antitrust case reshapes the business landscape, curbing the inevitable excesses of the dominant corporate players and allowing the next generation of innovators to be born.
So, it’s worth noting three things in this edition of Swamp Notes.
First, Tuesday is Google’s 20th birthday. Second, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin might want to send a slice of cake to Bill Gates, since it was arguably the US v Microsoft antitrust case 17 years ago, in which Microsoft was ultimately disallowed from bundling Windows and Explorer, that allowed their search giant to become the behemoth that it is today. Had Microsoft been allowed to dominate the burgeoning internet ecosystem back then the way Google dominates search today, then we might not have reached my third point — which is that Republican Senator Orrin Hatch is right to call for the re-opening of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Google from 2013.
As anyone who read the original leaked documents from 2012 knows, the case — which was dismissed by the FTC — was a close call to begin with. Key FTC staffers wanted to sue the search giant, and no wonder — many of its top brass, like chief economist Hal Varian and former executive Marissa Mayer, come off as being quite happy to prioritise Google over competitors in ways that...

Android – Is There a Viable Monopolization Case?
By Stephen Houck

This paper considers the viability of a Sherman Act § 2 enforcement action in respect of Google’s Android operating system. It discusses the applicability of the D.C. Circuit’s 2001 Microsoft opinion in which Microsoft was found to have engaged in anticompetitive conduct to maintain its Windows operating system monopoly. The paper explains why, despite some superficial similarities, the facts that gave rise to liability in Microsoft are different in crucial respects from those pertaining to Android. The paper concludes 1) that Google lacks monopoly power in a properly defined market in which Android competes; and 2) that Google has not engaged in the type of anticompetitive conduct condemned in Microsoft. The facts underlying Microsoft and the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning strongly suggest that an enforcement action in the United States is unlikely to succeed notwithstanding the European Commission’s July 2018 Android decision.

Flipkart, the Indian eCommerce player being acquired by Walmart, has acquired Liv.ai, the Bengaluru startup working on speech recognition platforms using artificial intelligence.
According to a report in BGR citing Flipkart, once the deal is complete, Liv.ai will become part of Flipkart’s center of excellence for voice-based solutions, with the goal of creating a more personalized and conversational shopping experience for consumers. The report noted that Flipkart is aiming to use Liv.ai’s speech-to-text technology to give consumers in India a shopping environment that is in their own language.
“The next wave of growth of internet users is coming from Tier 2+ cities, and 70% of these current internet users are native/vernacular language speakers, and this proportion is only increasing,” Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy said in an interview. “Given the complexities in typing on vernacular keyboards, voice will become a preferred interface for new shoppers.”
The executive noted that building a voice interface is challenging in India, given the multiple languages and accents in the country. “The team at Liv has been able to solve this through multiple technological innovations, including deep neural net-based methods. This expertise is a big capability add-on for us, and we are delighted to welcome them to Flipkart,” said Krishnamurthy.

Vertical analysis may play an important role in antitrust policy for Internet-related markets. As anticompetitive effects are horizontal in nature, this paper proposes a three-step review process, first focusing on the core competitive effect, then the potential for exclusion and finally balancing of efficiencies and anticompetitive effects. Two illustrations are offered, one for the Microsoft litigation and the other for the consummated Facebook/Instagram merger. The Microsoft discussion highlights the complications of vertical analysis, and posits an expected value standard for anticompetitive effects. For mergers comparable to Facebook/Instagram, consummated transactions may be anticompetitive even with a comprehensive efficiency review.

The team at Facebook is not having a great week, as it seems all of its recent data scandal chickens have come home to roost. Last Wednesday, July 25, its market cap took a US$120 billion beating in the aftermath of earnings that fell short of revenue and earnings targets. Analysts say this is the first indication that the animus over the Cambridge Analytica issue could have a longer-term impact on three dimensions of its platform: advertisers, users, and the cost to run the platform.
Two days later, Facebook and its executive team found themselves named in a class-action lawsuit—actually, several of them—alleging that the social network made false and misleading statements related to the decline of monthly active users prior to the second-quarter earnings report.
Over the weekend, Last Week Tonight served up its own version of an “honest Facebook” ad—in a parody of the apology ad they offered up a few weeks ago—that was pretty brutal and immediately went viral.
And then on Tuesday, July 31, three-and-a-half months after Mark Zuckerberg spent about 10 hours testifying in front of senators and congress people to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica incident (and explaining the internet to our elected representatives), the other shoe dropped when it came to the long-speculated subject of the federal government regulating big tech.

Taking on big tech: where does Australia stand?
By Caron Beaton-Wells
Big tech is under fire in Europe. In its latest sting, the European Commission has slapped Google with an eye-watering €4.3 billion (US$5 billion) fine for anti-competitive tying of its Android operating system to its in-house search engine and web browser.
The decision follows the Commission’s €2.4 billion (US$2.8 billion) fine against the company for giving illegal advantage to its comparison shopping service, just over a year ago.
And the search company is not alone in feeling the heat from Brussels. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have all been on the receiving end of what some see as a “techlash” reflecting anti-US bias and protectionism.
So far, US competition authorities have taken a far more restrained approach. The Federal Trade Commission looked into various Google practices in 2012 and found it had no case to raise around search bias. Antitrust officials are instead encouraging vigilance but caution when it comes to intervening in data-driven markets characterised by high rates of innovation.
Closer to home, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is conducting an inquiry into the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising markets. It is attracting intense interest, not just here but abroad. There are also reports of the ACCC separately investigating Google’s data-harvesting practices.

Five Things European Antitrust Gets Wrong
By Sean Heather
Within the last month, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Makan Delrahim was reported to have said to a journalist:
I don’t measure the [DOJ] Antitrust Division’s success by the fines or convictions we get or how many cases in litigation we bring. I define U.S. antitrust law’s success as the fact that we have these innovators. We have the Googles and the Facebooks and the Microsofts and the Ubers and the Airbnbs coming out of the United States. How many of those innovative companies are coming out of Europe or Korea or China?
Much wisdom is reflected in this quote, and foreign antitrust authorities would do well to reflect on these issues. For Europe, there are five basic things that it continues to get wrong with its approach to antitrust enforcement.

Is a green light flashing for dealmaking in tech land, allowing large firms to easily snatch up smaller ones? There’s a verbal assent in place, according to the The Financial Times, that US Justice Department’s Antitrust Chief Makan Delrahim sees value from such transactions.
Delrahim said in an interview with FT that “great efficiencies” could be wrung from such mergers and acquisitions of that size and scale. The end result has been that consumers have been the ultimate beneficiaries of such activity. As examples, he cited Google’s US$1.7 billon deal to buy YouTube 12 years ago, and that same tech giant’s buyout of Waze for a little under US$1 billion, five years ago.
As quoted by FT, Delrahim stated, “You wonder would YouTube be as useful and as [much of] a competing force to music or in video had it not been enhanced and improved through the tech resources that Google had? … I think there’s [sic] great efficiencies that could occur from a lot of these. You can’t, you know, in retrospect try to second guess that.”
Delrahim made his comments in context against what might be a shifting regulatory landscape in the US and abroad, as lawmakers and regulatory agencies here and in Europe are looking at deals with more intensity. If antitrust laws do not meet the needs of a brave new digital world, and where business models have changed, they may need an overhaul. As an example, noted the FT, services are free for customers and are paid for by advertisers.

Before “After Consumer Welfare” — A Response To Professor Wu
By A. Douglas Melamed (Stanford Law School)1 and Nicolas Petit (Hoover Institution)2
Introduction
In a short article After Consumer Welfare, Now What? The “Protection of Competition” in Practice, Professor Tim Wu proposes abandoning the “consumer welfare” (“CW”) paradigm in favor of a “return to the ‘protection of competition’ as the recognized goal of American antitrust law”.3  Wu reasons that the CW paradigm is not faithful to Congress’ intent in enacting the antitrust laws and is defended by its proponents, instead, on instrumental or policy grounds. But, Wu argues, the CW paradigm should be rejected even on those grounds.  Wu’s argument, however, rests on a misunderstanding of antitrust law under the CW paradigm and is wrong as a policy matter.
 
I. The Fundamental Flaw in Wu’s Analysis
The “fundamental and important difference between” the CW paradigm and the “protection of competition” standard, according to Wu, is that the former “seeks to maximize some value” while the latter “is designed to protect a process.”  As a result, Wu argues, antitrust law asks enforcers and judges to act as regulatory maximizers, rather than simply “calling out fouls and penalties.”
That distinction is not correct.  There is, to be sure, abundant rhetoric in antitrust literature about maximizing consumer welfare, but that is not how antitru...

Google’s and Facebook’s Dubious Bitcoin Bans






By Mark Epstein
If Calvin Coolidge’s observation that “advertising is the life of trade” remains true, the new bans by Google and Facebook on cryptocurrency ads threaten the fledgling industry’s existence. Coolidge in a 1926 address hailed advertising for spurring competition, but today these two companies control a large chunk of the digital-advertising market. A company or industry that has been shut out by Google and Facebook will find it nearly impossible to reach an internet audience.
Courts and regulators have limited the scope of rules involving “refusal to deal” arrangements, whereby a dominant company denies competitors access to essential products and services. But the anticrypto move by Google and Facebook still raises antitrust concerns. Google Pay and Facebook Messenger include peer-to-peer payment services, which compete against multibillion-dollar cryptoexchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Both Google and Facebook may soon enter the cryptocurrency market directly. Last month, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed that Google had approached him about helping to develop a cryptocurrency project. Facebook has also announced it will launch a group to explore blockchain technology.
The digital duopoly’s closest competitors in the online-ad market, Amazon and Microsoft , also have online payment systems and ban cryptocurrency promotions. In effect, four of the eight largest companies in the world control an online-advertising oligopoly and are denying competitors access to these services.
In Lorain Journal v. U.S. (1951), the U.S. Supreme Court held that while a business may usually “refuse to accept advertisements from whomever it pleases,” it may not refuse ads to harm its competitors. The case involved a Wisconsin newspaper that refused to sell ad space to anyone who also advertised over a local radio station. In 2016 the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against 1-800 Contacts for pressuring its competitors to withdraw advertising from certain online searches. The agency is still pursuing the enforcement, and an administrative law judge initially found in its favor.
These cases aren’t perfectly analogous to the cryptocurrency ad ban, but they point to key questions. If an advertiser can’t restrict its competitors from advertising on Google, how can Google itself do so? If a small-town newspaper can’t refuse ads to harm its competitors, why are the largest communications platforms in the world allowed to do the same?
Facebook and Google would likely respond that their motive isn’t to limit competition. Facebook claimed the policy was developed because cryptocurrencies are “frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.”

America’s antitrust apparatus prepares to act against big tech














A University of Chicago conclave of experts debates how far to go
The rise of the big tech firms is easy to spot in downtown Chicago. Apple’s minimalist store looms over the riverfront, close to a skyscraper carrying the name of another omnipresent brand—Trump. At a bus stop a Facebook advertisement promises that its new algorithm will combat fake news. On the Magnificent Mile’s digital hoardings Google urges pedestrians to swoon into the arms of its voice-activated assistant.
Inside the University of Chicago, a bastion of free-market thinkers and of free speech, tech has become more prominent, too. On April 19th and 20th most of America’s antitrust establishment—officials, economists and lawyers—as well as a smattering of Silicon Valley types, gathered to discuss whether big tech needed to be tamed. The conclave came just days after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief, testified before Congress.
One Facebook executive was brave enough to show his face in Chicago, bearing the smile of someone stuck at the dentist for two days without anaesthetic. The experts agreed that government intervention in big tech is needed. But debate raged about which institutions should do it, and about the trade-offs between innovation and regulation, between privacy and free flows of data, and between stopping manipulation and protecting free speech.
When you assemble a room full of intelligent critics, the dizzying scope of the complaints against the tech industry becomes clear. They come in three flavours. First, antitrust worries, which take in big tech firms’ high market shares, buying-up of promising competitors, and potential monopsony power over suppliers and vendors. The five biggest American tech firms together make about a tenth of all corporate profits. Second, the externalities they may impose on their users, including a loss of privacy and tech addiction. And third, their probable pollution of the public sphere with fake news, mass manipulation and lobbying.
The view in Chicago was that Facebook and Alphabet (which owns Google) are the most vulnerable to regulation given their surveillance-based models and high market shares. Apple was viewed as less problematic given that it does not sell ads and has big competitors such as Samsung. Amazon divides opinion: its stratospheric valuation suggests it will evolve into a price-gouging monopoly but at the moment it is lowering consumer prices. Microsoft, which faced an antitrust case in 1998-2001, is now seen as big tech’s harmless uncle, a label which should delight it.

Understanding the Driving Forces Behind OMO and M&A Wave By Hongjun Zhong1
The capital market experienced a boom at the turn of the year. There were many mergers-and-acquisitions transactions in the Chinese capital market in the past two months. Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent’s vigorous trading are drawing widespread attention. Tencent recently has taken a stake in Heilan Home (a leading enterprise in apparel industry), soon after that Alibaba has announced its RMB 5.45 billion ($866 million) strategic investment in leading home furnishing operator, Beijing Easyhome Furnishing Chain Store Group Co Ltd. Furthermore, Tencent Holdings, partnering with domestic supermarket operator Yonghui Superstores in which Tencent has bought a stake, strategically invested in Carrefour China. This act delivers a clear signal to market that the Internet giants intend to extend their online competitive advantages to offline markets through investments in traditional retailers. A key feature of recent investment boom is that it is not occurred within industry but across industry, and mixed vertical integration with both on- and offline, rather than the division of industries.
This trend of online giant’s merging or investing in offline corporates does not restrict to China. It also occurs in U.S. The most well-known M&A case in 2017 is the online retail giant Amazon bought the high-end grocery Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in cash. This is the largest acquisition deal ever...

Europe’s top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager, has made it her mission to stem alleged anti-competitive abuses by big American tech companies, threatening as recently as last month to break up Alphabe Google, reported Reuters.
But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google – this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Android-powered smartphones – is likely to show just how difficult it is, even for a committed trust-buster like Vestager, to dent the power of the U.S. giants.
The final ruling, expected within the next few months, will likely involve a multi-billion-dollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps, people familiar with the European Commission’s thinking say.
The decision, which is expected to hew closely to recommendations made in 2016 soon after the probe began, will almost certainly leave Google’s market dominance intact because the incentives to stick with the company are so strong, say industry executives, analysts and even its foes.
Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft’s mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital, said it was “virtually impossible” that any EU penalty would “change anything massively for Google.”

782,"April 9, 2018",US: Walmart steps closer to Flipkart acquisition,"
Walmart has completed a thorough due diligence process on Indian eCommerce firm Flipkart as it prepares to take a controlling stake in the company.
According to Reuters, the US retail giant wants to take a stake of 51% or more in the Indian online store.
Sources revealed that Walmart has already presented a shareholder agreement and is looking to offer about US$10 billion to US$12 billion for the stake, which would value Flipkart at around US$20 billion.
Talks between the two companies are ongoing. Both declined to comment.
In February, it was reported that Walmart was looking to acquire a 40% stake in Flipkart. But now, it seems the company is looking for a bigger piece, most likely so it can take on Amazon in India.
“As large as they [Walmart] are, Amazon has eaten away at a significant chunk of their revenues and I think … they view India as the largest market possibly for this [taking on Amazon],” a source said in February.
If the deal is completed, it would represent one of the largest overseas deals Walmart has ever contemplated.
Flipkart, which is backed by companies such as SoftBank, Tiger Global, eBay, Accel Partners, Naspers, Tencent Holdings and Microsoft, has been competing with Amazon for a bigger piece of India’s online retail market, which could be worth US$200 billion in a decade.
The deal with Walmart would give Flipkart additional funds, as well as the benefit of the retailer’s extensive experience in retailing, logistics and supply chain management.
Sources also said the acquisition could assist Flipkart in developing its private label collection. That news comes as Amazon has also been looking to expand its own private label offerings in India.
Amazon India VP Manish Tiwary said in February that the company is hoping to launch new product categories, but he would not name specific items. “We have selection gaps in every category … our large vendors on the private labels side, we’ll keep on filling the gaps using them,” he said.

783,"April 3, 2018","US: Analysts criticize Apple Pay nag, call it ‘antitrust behavior’","
In what The Wall Street Journal described as a form of nagging, Apple is prompting users of its iPhone to enroll in Apple Pay, which has created a mixed reaction from the public. Critics said the strategy may give rivals some opportunity against the tech giant. Analysts and user-interface experts are criticizing this describing it as as “antitrust behavior.”
The prompts to enroll in Apple Pay are tied to the iPhone’s most recent operating system update, yet they’re subtle, reported the WSJ. The strategy works thusly: Users who do not enter their credit card information for Apple Pay upon setting up their phones will see a red circle that denotes incomplete setup. Some users also get notifications that stop only after entering the data. Apple, it should be noted, hopes to bring its US$29 billion Apple Pay business line to US$40 billion by fiscal year 2020.
Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates said “it’s really antitrust behavior.”
Mr. Kay compared Apple Pay setup badges and notifications to Microsoft, bundling its Internet Explorer browser with Windows in the 1990s—a strategy the Justice Department successfully sued to stop on antitrust grounds saying it hurt rivals. “They used to have actual behavioral remedies and say you can’t do this,” Mr. Kay said.
The WSJ even highlighted that Apple’s guidelines dictate developers should use badges sparingly to “present brief, essential information and atypical content changes.”
In the meantime, the newspaper, citing 451 Research, said only 34% of iPhone users link their cards to Apple Pay upon setup, with 18% having used the function in the past 90 days.

784,"March 11, 2018",US: Amazon exec will replace Uber product head,"
Uber has named product head Daniel Graf’s replacement, and it’s Assaf Ronen, Amazon’s top voice shopping vice president. According to Thursday (Mar. 8) Recode reports, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi released a memo to staff confirming the personnel changes.
“I wanted to let you know about some changes in the Uber Product world,” wrote Khosrowshahi. “After nearly 2.5 years at Uber, Daniel has decided to leave. This was not an easy or quick decision. In true Swiss fashion, Daniel wanted to ensure that 2018 planning and perf[ormance] were done, the team was stable and [that] I had a plan for leadership of the team going forward.”
Graf joined Uber in late 2015 as head of marketplace dynamics, managing the algorithms that matched drivers with riders and set prices. He reported to then-vice president of product Ed Baker, whom Graf replaced in March 2017.
“I am so grateful to Daniel for all he has achieved,” Khosrowshahi added in the memo. “He is a brilliant product strategist, an enthusiastic evangelist for Uber’s products — while, at the same time, always taking a measure of our competition. He is never satisfied with ‘good enough,’ a fantastic team builder and is incredibly hard-working. Daniel has agreed to stay on as an advisor to the company and help get Assaf up to speed.”
Ronen has worked for both Microsoft and Amazon, serving as vice president of voice and natural user interface shopping.
The company’s latest announcement shows Khosrowshahi is merging his management team.While he hired a new chief operating officer and a top legal officer, other executives have departed the company, including culture head Frances Frei and head of driver product Aaron Schildkrout.
“As I’ve said, we’re going to lean in on product this year,” Khosrowshahi stated. “It’s the core of our service and will be key to our continued success in the future.”

785,"March 11, 2018",US: Antitrust critics ear winner-take-all DOD cloud contract,"
According to The Hill, antitrust critics fear that a winner-take-all contract for the Defense Department’s (DOD) cloud computing needs could help tech giant Amazon corner the government contract market even further.
The Pentagon opened a winner-take-all competition Wednesday, March 7, for a multibillion-dollar cloud services contract, dismaying Microsoft., International Business Machines (IBM) and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle, which worry the move will favor Amazon.com.
Amazon’s competitors like IBM and Microsoft have been pushing for a multi-party contract that would split cloud-computing services between several companies. They argue that leaving the contract in the hands of a single provider unnecessarily increases cybersecurity risks.
“It’s certainly an indication that Amazon has enormous political power,” said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research group that advocates for local businesses and tracks Amazon’s movements in government. “They have translated their corporate power and wealth into political power.”
Companies have been frustrated by what they see as procurement bias towards Amazon have also slammed the decision.
IBM called the move “flawed,” while Microsoft said it was “disappointed.”
The tech companies have voiced their frustration through their trade association, the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which also represents Amazon.
“We are concerned with reports regarding a single-award cloud contract for the Department Enterprise, as well as possibly canceling all awarded DOD cloud contracts leaving the Department with only one cloud solution,” the ITI wrote in a November letter to the Pentagon that was obtained by The Hill.

787,"February 20, 2018",Opinion By Former Senior Government Officials and Leading Antitrust Experts on the Significant Antitrust Risks Posed by Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm,"
Abstract:   There are material regulatory risks associated with any combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm. Given the parties’ competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the complexity of complying with a divestiture demand because of the difficulty the parties will have separating these businesses and selling them to an acceptable buyer, and the real risk that agencies (e.g., China’s MOFCOM) may demand significant restrictions on Broadcom’s post-merger licensing and distribution practices, the transaction presents significant antitrust risk.
See full PDF here 
February 20, 2018
Based on our experience as former senior government officials and practitioners with significant cross-border antitrust merger review experience, we write to share the significant antitrust risks posed by Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm.[1]
Broadcom’s February 9, 2018 proposed merger agreement states, in relevant part, that: (1) Broadcom agrees to use its “reasonable best efforts” to complete the process; (2) to that end, it is willing to divest Qualcomm’s network (but not mobile) WiFi and Radio Frequency Front-End (RFFE) assets or businesses (excluding integrated products such as Snapdragon) and any other Qualcomm assets, licenses, or other businesses so long as not material; and (3) Broadcom will pay Qualcomm a reverse break-up fee of $8 billion in the event that regulatory approval is not received, assuming that there has been no “material adverse effects” (MAEs) on Qualcomm’s businesses.
The proposed agreement further provides for the following limitations on Qualcomm during the period between signing and closing: (1) prohibitions on initiating litigation, including to enforce its intellectual property rights (IPRs) against infringers who refuse to pay; (2) prohibitions on entering into any license agreement or materially amending existing agreements; and (3) prohibitions on settling existing litigation without Broadcom’s consent. Based on public reports, we also understand that Broadcom has further stated that it is now willing to commit to additional divestitures, including its own connectivity businesses, but has not agreed to commit to accept conduct remedies such as prohibitions on bundling or tying products.[2]
Given these terms, shareholders should be aware of the following:

the real risk that foreign antitrust agencies will impose onerous remedies that either restrict the parties’ ability to engage in certain conduct or require them to take specific actions;
the prior actions of antitrust agencies in rejecting proposed divestiture buyers that do not have both the ability and incentive to compete with the combined entity on day 1 and to take the technologies to the next generation;
that similar complex cross-border deals have taken 18+ months to gain regulatory approval, especially where—as here—approval is required by numerous jurisdictions (here, the United States, the European Union, China, India, Korea, and Taiwan); and
the likelihood that Broadcom’s proposed limitations on how Qualcomm can run its business from signing to close violate antitrust “gun-jumping” rules, which alone could be the subject of a separate investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and others.

With respect to conduct remedies, there are countless examples showing that regulators can and do impose substantial conduct remedies, including those that could amount to an MAE, and that may not be merger-specific. These include:

Interoperability requirements (e.g., the European Commission’s (EC’s) Intel/McAfee and Intel/Altera decisions requiring the companies to take specific steps to ensure that their products interoperated with competitors’ products);
Prohibitions on tying or bundling products (e.g., the EC’s Intel/McAfee and China’s Ministry of Commerce’s Merck/AZ);
Prohibitions on seeking or enforcing injunctive relief on FRAND-assured SEPs (e.g., MOFCOM’s Microsoft-Nokia);
Price caps (e.g., MOFCOM’s Microsoft-Nokia and Merck-AZ imposing royalty caps on IPRs);
Requirements to invest in specific amounts of research and development (e.g., MOFCOM’s Samsung/Seagate, requiring Seagate to invest at least $800 million a year for three years in innovation to ensure that the company would bring more innovative products and solutions to consumers);
Non-merger-specific remedies to address other concerns the agencies may have already or discover during the review process (e.g., distribution-related remedies imposed by MOFCOM in ABI-SABMiller); and
Other non-merger specific remedies to protect domestic champions (e.g., in Google/Motorola, MOFCOM required Google to maintain Android as open and to continue to provide Android to Chinese manufacturers on an expeditious basis).

The real risk posed by these types of remedies generally requires deal protection for shareholders, including a “hell-or-high-water clause” (i.e., do whatever is necessary to get the deal done), or at least defining the MAE provision so as to exclude remedies that may be required by antitrust regulators. Such protections ensure that a buyer cannot walk away from the deal at any point during or after a protracted regulatory review period, particularly given the likely disruption caused to targets (here, Qualcomm) during such a review period.
With respect to divestitures, antitrust agencies will require that any divestiture remedies fully replace the loss of Qualcomm’s competitive pressure in the market, i.e., any remedy must make competition “whole” in the sense that it must put another competitor in a position to compete as effectively against Broadcom as Qualcomm does today (and likely into the future). And, of course, any divestiture transaction would itself have to be reviewed for antitrust and national security issues.
Prior agency precedent makes it clear that agencies require divestiture buyers have the incentive and ability to compete immediately, and continue competing into the future.

Applied Materials/Tokyo Electron (2015) was abandoned after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) rejected the parties’ tool-line (product) divestitures as insufficient to preserve existing competition with respect to “the development of equipment for next-generation semiconductors” on the grounds that proposed buyer was not already focused on the product-line and did not have the same capacity to innovate. The DOJ was also concerned that the transaction would have combined “the two largest competitors with the necessary know-how, resources and ability to develop and supply” the technology products at issue.
As DOJ’s then Chief Economist observed, “[n]aturally, the Antitrust Division would be . . . wary of the ability of any remedy to replicate [the] competitive dynamic” and DOJ ultimately concluded “that replicating the competitive significance of one of the most innovative companies in a sector that is virtually synonymous with innovation would be exceptionally challenging.”[3]
The U.S. antitrust agencies have also rejected proposed divestiture buyers because they could not effectively compete on Day 1. In Sysco Corp./US Foods Inc., the FTC rejected divestiture of facilities and sued to block the transaction; in Staples Inc./Office Depot Inc., the FTC rejected divestiture of significant contracts, and sued to block the transaction; and in Baker Hughes/Haliburton, the DOJ rejected divestiture package because, among other things, the discreet assets were insufficient for remedy.

With respect to likely review timing, recent deals suggest that the regulatory approval process is likely to take 18+ months (see e.g., Qualcomm/NXP—15+ months and counting despite the lack of direct competition between the parties; Penn State Hershey/Pinnacle—abandoned by the parties in 2016 after a 28 month review period; Advocacy Health Care/NorthShore University Health System—abandoned in 2017 after a 30 month review period; Halliburton/Baker Hughes—abandoned in 2016 after a 19 month review period; DuPont/Dow Chemical and Abbott Laboratories/Alere—each taking 20 months to gain necessary approvals. Indeed, the recent proposed merger of the #1 and #3 global suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment was abandoned after an 18-month review period.
In short, there are material regulatory risks associated with any combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm. In the United States, Europe, and China, in particular, this deal raises significant issues that will require a substantial amount of time and effort for global regulatory agencies to resolve. Given the parties’ competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the complexity of complying with a divestiture demand because of the difficulty the parties will have separating these businesses and selling them to an acceptable buyer, and the real risk that agencies (e.g., MOFCOM) may demand significant restrictions on Broadcom’s post-merger licensing and distribution practices, the transaction presents significant antitrust risk.

Google Shopping: beware of ‘self-favouring’ in a world of algorithmic nudging By Nicolo Zingales (Sussex Law School)1
Introduction
On 27 June 2017, the European Commission closed its investigation in the Google Shopping case. It found a breach of article 102 TFEU in relation to Google’s “more favourable positioning and display of its own comparison shopping service compared to competing comparison shopping services” (hereinafter, “the conduct”).2 The Commission’s Decision is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it constitutes the first application of the leveraging theory in an algorithmic context, where as a result of certain algorithmic design choices3 a dominant undertaking systematically directs (“nudges”) consumers towards its own goods or services in a secondary market. Google apparently did not see it coming, as it argued both in the proceedings before the European Commission and in the appeal it lodged against the Decision4> that the Commission used a novel theory of abuse, and therefore in accordance with its previous practice should not have imposed a fine. However, the Commission rejected this argument, noting that it had already used a self-favouring theory to establish abuse in a number of cases.5 It therefore imposed a fine of almost 2.5 billion euros and ordered Google to take a...

Joseph Simons, a retired partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, LLP, is President Donald Trump’s pick to head up the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and would pick up enforcement of antitrust under his charge. Simon was nominated to replace acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen.
According to a report in Bloomberg, in response to questions from the Senate Commerce Committee, Simons said he has “significant concerns” that US antitrust officials have been too lax with merger reviews, which has resulted in higher prices and a reduction of choices for consumers. “Addressing these concerns is critical, as they lie at the heart of the agency’s competition mission,” Simons wrote. “The FTC needs to devote substantial resources to determine whether its merger enforcement has been too lax, and if that’s the case, the agency needs to determine the reason for such failure and to fix it.”
The FTC is also in charge of enforcing consumer protection laws and anti-competitive practices by companies. The other nominees to the five-person panel include Republicans Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson and Democrat Rohit Chopra. Trump has yet to choose a second Democrat or Independent.
Simons went on to say that the FTC needs to lower the failure rate when it comes to merger settlements, which happen when assets are sold to address issues with competition. He pointed to his previous time at the FTC, when he was in charge of the competition bureau during George W. Bush’s presidency. At that time, he claimed, the FTC took more enforcement actions against anti-competitive behavior than in any comparable two-decade prior or after he was in charge.
The last big anti-competitive case was when Microsoft tried to hamper Netscape back in 1988, noted the report.

790,"February 1, 2018",The “Enhanced No Economic Sense Test”:  Experimenting with Predatory Innovation,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
By Thibault Schrepel (University Paris)
The “Enhanced No Economic Sense Test”: Experimenting with Predatory Innovation
This paper originates from a long-standing anachronism of antitrust law in regard to high-tech markets. Conventional wisdom assumes that antitrust law mechanisms are well suited to the study of practices in technology markets and that only adjustments are to be made here and there. This is untrue. Several practices fall outside the scope of antitrust law because the mechanisms for assessing the legality of practices are not adequate. In fact, no one can accurately identify a typical legal approach for non-price strategies. A chaotic jurisprudence emerges from it, which we will show.
This article further aims to contribute to the literature by advancing a new test, the “enhanced no economic sense” (“ENES”) test, to be applied to non-price strategies. We show why applying it with consistency will help to simplify the law while avoiding legal errors – two goals that all of the tests aiming to assess the legality of practices under antitrust law should reach. Some of these tests, which are too permissive, generate many type-II errors but are easily understandable, and thus, increase legal certainty. Others, which are better suited and, in theory, allow avoidance of legal errors, are in fact too complex to be applied by the courts and, above all, to be understood by companies.6 But one must not give up. Antitrust law is not condemned to remain blind to certain technical problems or, on the contrary, to be incomprehensible by the ordinary man. The “ENES” test brings a solution of reason to
this long-standing issue.
Adopting a new test should not be done without first ensuring that it would allow courts and antitrust authorities to take a position in each individual case and that rulings would benefit the consumers. Here again, the “enhanced no economic test sense” meets this double objective. It also helps to understand why several decisions taken in the past are, we will argue, legal errors. The Microsoft case is one of them.
In turn, this paper makes a proposal to rethink of the way most of the new practices implemented in technology markets are actually evaluated. This study is particularly timely because the development of the issues related to these markets and the growing interest shown by competition authorities in this regard calls for an identified position, which will not hinder their extraordinary growth.
This paper proceeds in three parts. The first part presents the enhanced no economic sense test, ranging from the foundations up to the very detail of its implementation. The second part tests its empirical efficiency. In part two, the most important predatory innovation cases, on non-price strategy, are detailed and reassessed through the prism of the enhanced no economic sense test, which helps to establish its effectiveness. The last part expands these empirical findings and presents our conclusions.

791,"November 29, 2017",Bad Science: Abuse And Effects In Online Markets,"
By Alexander M. Waksman[1]
Imagine a scientist who has total conviction that a particular hypothesis is correct.  The scientist’s belief in their hypothesis is so strong that they dispense with the need to test it in experiments or compare it against empirical data.  Even when third parties carry out such tests, the scientist considers it unnecessary to take account of the results.  We would condemn that approach as “bad science”.
Antitrust may not be a science in the strict sense, but the same logic applies.  When a competition authority (or claimant) identifies a theory of harm, that theory ought to be tested against actual market developments to determine whether its predictions are correct.  As Commission guidance states, “economic theory is used to develop a testable hypothesis that is later checked against the data. In that case, the economic analysis makes predictions about reality that can be tested by observations and potentially rejected or verified.”[2]
Thus, a theory of harm is useful as a starting point, but it cannot be the whole story.  In particular, when the challenged conduct has been ongoing for a significant period of time and sufficient data are available, it makes good sense to ask whether the hypothesised anticompetitive outcomes have actually transpired.
The need to “test the hypothesis” is a controversial topic in abuse of dominance cases, where competition authorities, courts, and commentators offer differing formulations of the applicable legal standard.  It has particularly important consequences for firms operating in online markets, which are drawing increased antitrust intervention.

The Legal Standard: “Capability” or “Likelihood” of Restricting Competition

Former Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, observed that “in competition the best should win on the merits, but only on the merits.”[3]  The central challenge in abuse of dominance cases is therefore to distinguish competition on the merits from anticompetitive exclusionary conduct.  This is a difficult distinction to draw, particularly in online markets, where new business models, parameters of competition, and monetisation strategies frequently emerge.
One of the conditions for determining whether conduct is abusive is whether the conduct has the “effect” of excluding rivals.  Otherwise, as Advocate General Wahl observed, there would be a risk that “competition law sanctions form.”[4]  The precise meaning of “anticompetitive effects” has not been interpreted consistently, however.
On one view, conduct needs merely to be “capable” of restricting competition.[5]  Advocates General Wahl and Kokott have interpreted this as denoting conduct that is “likely” to restrict competition – albeit with some disagreement as to the level of “likelihood” that is required.[6]  The Court of Justice has stated that “only dominant undertakings whose conduct is likely to have an anticompetitive effect on the market fall within the scope” of abuse of dominance rules, and that “such an assessment seeks to determine whether the conduct of the dominant undertaking produces an actual or likely exclusionary effect, to the detriment of competition” (emphasis added).[7]
Beyond the distinction between “capability” and “likelihood” (or lack thereof), the Court’s formulation raises a broader question: when must competition authorities take into account “actual” effects and when is it sufficient only to show a “likelihood” or “capability” of restricting competition?
Traditionally, the European Commission and Courts treated “actual” and “likely” effects as alternatives.  In other words, the requirement to show exclusionary effects could be satisfied by demonstrating either that the conduct did in fact exclude competitors (the “actual” effect) or that it was likely to exclude rivals in the circumstances of the case (the “likely” effect).  While recognising that anticompetitive effects could not be merely “hypothetical”, the Court held that there was no need to show that the “likely” impact materialised into “concrete” or “actual” exclusion.[8]
But the distinction between “actual” and “likely” effects is not always clear-cut.  If the alleged “likely” effects do not occur, that casts doubt on whether such effects were ever truly “likely”.  In such circumstances, it is for the party alleging an abuse to explain why the theory of harm is correct, even though its predictions have not been borne out in practice.  And in a series of abuse of dominance cases, the European courts have treated actual effects as having significant probative value.
2. The Relevance of Actual Exclusionary Effects
In Microsoft the Commission determined that a tie between Windows OS and Windows Media Player could not be assumed to foreclose competition without further analysis.  It undertook a detailed assessment of the actual effects of the tie, including a review of its impact on the number of subscribers, users, and usage shares of rival media players over the course of five years.[9]  As the General Court observed, “the Commission examined the actual effects which the bundling had already had on the market.”[10]  The Commission took the same approach in the Microsoft (Tying) case, concerning the tie between Microsoft’s Windows operating system and the Internet Explorer browser.  The commitments decision noted that the Commission “had examined such effects closely,” including through extensive empirical surveys.[11]
The Microsoft cases thereby established a need to look closely at actual market developments in circumstances where the conduct cannot be considered “by nature” abusive.  Summarising the Windows Media Player case, Briss J stated that “the Commission [in Microsoft] had examined the actual effects on the market… For abuse to be established there must be a finding that the practice in question forecloses competition.  The legal principle I take from the authorities is simply that such a finding may be based on inference but the inference must be justified in all the circumstances.  Just because it is normally assumed, it does not follow that it will always be assumed.  The circumstances may be such that such an assumption cannot be made and a close analysis of the actual effects is required.”[12]
Likewise, in Posten Norge the EFTA Court accepted that “in some cases, the persistent lack of actual negative effects on competition may cast doubt on a finding by ESA that a certain conduct is liable to restrict competition.”[13]  On the facts of the case, though, the actual effects left “no doubt” that Posten Norge’s conduct had impeded competition.  Specifically, the Court had “no doubt that the applicant’s conduct made entry for its competitors more difficult”, including because of the existence of actual exclusionary effects: Posten Norge’s competitors “were unsuccessful in securing cooperation with Norway Post’s partners while the exclusivity agreements were in force, but succeeded in achieving such cooperation after the conduct had ended.” [14]
In Post Danmark I the Court again treated actual exclusionary effects as relevant to the analysis, although this time as evidence that the conduct was not abusive.  In reviewing the allegedly unlawful pricing strategy, the Court observed that the complainant had not been excluded or marginalised.  Rather, it had “managed to maintain its distribution network despite losing the volume of mail related to the three customers involved and managed, in 2007, to win back” two of these customers – an outcome that was not redolent of exclusion from the market.[15]
The approach in Microsoft, Posten Norge, and Post Danmark II is consistent with developments in the case law concerning Article 101, where – outside the narrow group of “by object” infringements – an agreement must be shown to have actual effects on the market for the agreements to be considered anticompetitive.[16]  There is no particular reason why the effects analysis should be different with respect to unilateral conduct.
3. Clarifying The Principles: Streetmap v Google 
The relevance of actual effects was addressed in the recent Streetmap v Google case, which concerned a Google Maps thumbnail being placed at the top of the Google search results page.  As an initial matter, Roth J noted that the Commission has – in many cases – examined the “experience over the years since the abuse started”, particularly in cases where the conduct is not one of the “classic forms of abuse”, citing Microsoft.[17]
Roth J went on to state that “in a case such as the present, I would find it difficult in practical terms to reconcile a finding that conduct had no anti-competitive effect at all with a conclusion that it was nonetheless reasonably likely to have such an effect… the appropriate approach, it seems to me, is that it is for Streetmap to establish that the conduct was reasonably likely to harm competition. In determining that question, the court will take into account, as a very relevant consideration, evidence as to what the actual effect of the conduct has been.”[18]
This approach follows an intuitive logic: If the conduct has failed to produce actual exclusionary effects, that casts doubts on whether it was ever likely to do so.  And although Roth J did not explain what he meant by a “case such as the present”, the CAT referred subsequently to the fact that the conduct in Streetmap had been ongoing for eight years and concerned internet searches – an activity that occurs “multiple times each day”.  Thus, “if [the conduct] were to have an anti-competitive or foreclosure effect, it was inconceivable that this would not have become evident.”[19]
Having carried out the assessment, the judgment concluded that introducing the Google Maps thumbnail did not have an appreciable effect in taking away custom from Streetmap.  Roth J stated: “In the light of that, I conclude that it was not reasonably likely to give rise to anti-competitive foreclosure.”[20]  In other words, since the conduct at issue did not have an actual appreciable effect, it could not be described as likely to produce anticompetitive foreclosure.
The Streetmap judgment is important not only as a matter of legal principle, but it could also have an impact on enforcement in other digital markets, which are drawing increased attention from antitrust authorities.  The European Commission has carried out investigations into Google Shopping,[21] the Android operating system,[22] AdSense for Search,[23] and Amazon’s eBooks contracts.[24]  The French and German competition authorities have outlined putative theories of harm relating to the exclusionary use of “big data” by dominant companies – an area which is also being probed in a national sector inquiry in Italy.[25]  And the UK competition authority has confirmed online markets as a “policy priority.”[26]  It is therefore worth considering what the cases mean for the effects analysis in online markets specifically.
4. Three Conditions For Assessing Actual Effects
The foregoing shows that actual effects can be highly relevant – or even dispositive – as to the question of whether exclusion was “likely” or “capable of” occurring.  The relevance of actual effects will vary on a case-by-case basis, though, depending on the following factors that can be discerned from the case law.
Factor 1: Whether the conduct is “by nature” liable to restrict competition.  Conduct that cannot be presumed to have anticompetitive effects, in the circumstances or market context of a given case, needs to be examined closely by reference to its actual effects on competition (per Microsoft and Huawei v Unwired Planet).  Thus, conduct that is “by nature” abusive may be treated as infringing Article 102 TFEU (subject to any objective justification) without recourse to a full analysis of actual effects – albeit the scope of “by nature” abuses is diminished, if not eliminated, following the recent Intel judgment).  By contrast, conduct that is not inherently abusive may require an assessment of actual market developments (depending on Factors 2 and 3, below).
Factor 2: Whether exclusionary effects would have been felt at the time of assessment.  In some cases, proceedings may arise at an early stage, too soon for the alleged anticompetitive effects to have manifested themselves.  Where intervention occurs at a later stage, though, it may be the case that any exclusionary effects would have been felt at the time when the conduct is assessed.  In the latter circumstance, actual market developments should be taken into account as part of the competitive assessment (per Streetmap v Google).
This factor depends on how long the conduct was in place (or how long ago it ceased), and whether there was a significant number of transactions during the period of the alleged abuse (per Socrates v Law Society).  In essence, the question is whether any anticompetitive effects would have occurred by the time of carrying out the antitrust assessment.
In previous cases concerning online markets, the challenged conduct has been in place long enough to cover a large number of interactions with customers or consumers, such that any anticompetitive impact would have been felt.  In Streetmap v Google, the conduct lasted for eight years, during which time users entered a vast number of search queries.  If the conduct was “likely” to affect the position of rivals, that would have been evident at the time when the High Court heard Streetmap’s case.  Likewise, the Microsoft cases concerned conduct that lasted several years.[27]
Even when conduct is in place for a short period of time, though, or has only recently begun, the sheer volume and frequency of user interactions with online services mean that any effects may have already been felt.  Indeed, this is inherent in the way that online service providers carry out research into their own products.  For example, in 2012 Facebook conducted a study to test whether changing users’ news feeds to show more “positive” or “negative” items could affect the emotions expressed in a user’s own posts.  Despite the experiment lasting just one week, researchers were able to benefit from a very large sample size of 689,003 users and could analyse over 3 million posts, resulting in empirical support for the far-reaching claim that “emotions can spread throughout a network.”[28]  This experiment confirms that conduct may trigger a change in observable user behaviour in even a short space of time.
Factor 3: Whether data concerning effects are available.  Although not discussed in the case law expressly, a further factor may be the availability – or ability to collect – data concerning actual effects, without which a review of actual effects would be impossible.  Commission guidance on the submission of economic evidence notes that the limitations of a dataset should be recognised, although deficiencies in the data should not necessarily prevent an economic analysis from carrying weight.[29]
The amount of user interactions with online services will in many cases generate sufficient data for actual effects to be examined.  By way of illustration, Ofcom reported that the average adult Internet user in the UK spends over 20 hours online per week, as of 2015.[30]  By August 2016, the average adult was reported to be spending almost 9 hours each day on media and communications activities – more time than spent sleeping.[31]  In July 2017, consumers in Britain spent on average £1.1 billion online each week – an increase of 15.1% compared with the previous year.[32]  And in the Google Shopping case the Commission reports having analysed 5.2 Terabytes of search results data, equating to 1.7 billion search queries.[33]
5. “Bad Science” In Online Markets
In competition law – as in science – the null hypothesis is true until proven otherwise.[34]  If a theory of harm predicts the exclusion or marginalisation of a dominant company’s rivals, only a “bad scientist” would disregard evidence that these predictions proved incorrect.  In online markets particularly, it is important not to assume that a theory of harm is correct without testing the theory’s predictions against real world events.  That is because conduct that may be liable to exclude rivals in offline markets could have a very different outcome in an online environment.
This was the insight of the Commission decision in Microsoft, where the ability of users to download alternatives to Windows Media Player (the tied product) – sometimes for free – meant that anticompetitive effects could not be presumed, and an assessment of actual effects was needed.  The Commission’s recent decisional practice in merger cases confirms the need to assess the specific features of online markets, rather than extrapolating from the offline environment, given features such as low barriers to entry, multi-homing, and ease of switching between services online.
In Microsoft/Skype, the Commission considered that Microsoft would lack incentives to tie or bundle its products with Skype following the concentration.  In particular, the Commission noted that consumers would not simply use “whatever communications product is provided with Windows” – rather, consumers use multiple communications services across different platforms.   Skype was offered for free, and consumers would likely migrate to other free services if Microsoft tried to impose a charge.  Switching was particularly easy since rival services were provided directly on the Internet, avoiding even the need for user downloads.[35]
Similar insights are set out in the Commission’s decision in Facebook/WhatsApp, which found “no significant costs preventing consumers from switching between different consumer communications apps”.  The services were offered for free, were easily downloadable, take up little memory space and are easy to use, and consumers could switch between them with ease.  Therefore, there were no “significant ‘traditional’ barriers” to entry.[36]
A review of actual effects therefore serves to avoid false positives in antitrust enforcement – the so-called “Type I error”.  In a recent speech concerning antitrust enforcement in the digital sector, FTC Commissioner Ohlhausen commented that “regulators are just people entrusted, temporarily, with the levers of government power. We possess no crystal ball with which we can unerringly see the road ahead, and we can be just as wrong about the way the future will unfold as anyone else. In my time here at the FTC, and throughout my career, I have tried to stress the need for regulators to acknowledge the limits of their actual knowledge before exercising government power.”[37]  This seems particularly true of the fast moving and unpredictable online world.
6. Conclusion
The foregoing analysis should not be taken as meaning that competition authorities (or claimants) are required to show actual exclusionary effects in every case.  As commentators have pointed out, such a position would require authorities to wait for observable anticompetitive effects to arise before intervening, by which point it may be too late to restore effective competition.[38]
Rather, the need to examine actual effects depends on the interplay of the three factors listed above: whether there is a “by nature” abuse; whether actual effects would already have been felt; and whether sufficient data to measure those effects are available.  In digital markets, this will more often than not mean that actual effects are highly relevant – or even dispositive – to the antitrust assessment.  Relying on a hypothesis that conduct is “likely” or capable” of excluding rivals is not enough.

The KFTC’s Extraterritorial Overreach By James F. Rill & John M. Taladay*
Introduction
The Korea Fair Trade Commission’s recent decision against Qualcomm is notable as one of the most significant examples of intentional territorial overreach by an antitrust enforcer in memory.[1]  The KFTC’s remedy ignores principles of jurisdiction and comity by ordering global changes to Qualcomm’s licensing and sales practices, even where those changes affect commerce that has no cognizable effect on the welfare of Korean consumers.  The legitimate enforcement interests of every other global competition and IP agency are virtually ignored; the KFTC defines how commerce for the licensing of Qualcomm’s IP rights and sales of its chipsets will occur around the world.  This outcome is not unintentional; the decision contains an explicit provision to protect the interests of Korean corporations operating abroad.  In short, the KFTC has appointed itself as a global IP police force projecting questionable competition standards well beyond its borders to protect its own domestic Korean producers.  In so doing, the KFTC’s decision undermines the legitimate interests of other jurisdictions that it invades.
KFTC’s Remedy Sweeps Well Beyond Its Legitimate Interests
The KFTC imposes sweeping, worldwide behavioral remedies that restrict or eviscerate Qualcomm’s rights under its non-Korean patents, compel Qualcomm to amend or enter into contracts outside of Korea that it otherw...

Posted by Wall Street Journal
Meet Makan Delrahim, the Antitrust Chief Heading Up AT&T-Time Warner Lawsuit
By Brent Kendall
The Justice Department’s new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, needed just seven weeks to land himself in the middle of the biggest antitrust case in 20 years.
Mr. Delrahim, confirmed by the Senate September 27, made the decision to file the government lawsuit Monday challenging AT&T Inc.’s planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The antitrust division he leads alleged that the vertical combination of AT&T’s video distribution with Time Warner’s popular cable programming would give the merged firm the power to raise prices and hinder competitors and innovation.
AT&T criticized the government’s arguments as unreasonable and inconsistent with past practice, which has focused primarily on horizontal mergers between direct competitors. It called President Donald Trump’s repeated criticisms of Time Warner’s CNN the “elephant in the room” in the Justice Department’s case, raising questions about political influence.
Mr. Trump criticized the deal on the campaign trail last October when it was announced, and criticized it again Tuesday. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he told reporters at the White House.
The Justice Department said the White House had no role in the decision to sue.
The dispute has set the stage for a major court battle in Washington, the highest-profile antitrust case since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in 1998 on allegations of unlawful monopolization. Microsoft Corp. avoided a breakup of its business but agreed to restrictions on its business conduct.
AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said the new lawsuit threw the business world into a state of uncertainty about what types of deals and investment are permissible.

794,"October 9, 2017",Why “fake news” is an antitrust problem,"
By Sean Illing, VOX
Five of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization are tech companies. In the past 10 years, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have all joined Microsoft at the top of the list.
Each of these companies dominates its primary market, and is gradually expanding its reach into secondary markets. Have they become too big? Are they full-fledged monopolies at this point? And if so, should we rein them in?
To get answers to these questions, I reached out to Sally Hubbard, a senior editor of tech antitrust enforcement at the Capitol Forum, a nonpartisan legal investigative company that offers analysis to policymakers and industry stakeholders. I asked her to walk me through the case for using antitrust laws to regulate the major tech companies.
Antitrust laws exist in order prevent monopolization, which occurs when a company so dominates a market that it effectively eliminates the possibility of competition. This is tricky when it comes to a tech company like, say, Google, which has a monopoly in the search market but not in the digital advertising market.
Antitrust enforcement, at least in the past 40 years or so, has focused on protecting consumers from high prices due to a lack of competition. But the problems created by tech monopolies are different: Consumers aren’t paying higher prices to use these platforms, but they are handing over massive amounts of personal data and allowing companies like Facebook and Google to disproportionately influence the news and information Americans consume.
We don’t need to bust up these companies, Hubbard says, but there are very good reasons to use antitrust law to promote more competition in this space. “Fake news,” she told me, “is partly an antitrust problem” because the dominant algorithms of Facebook and Google control the flow of information. If there were more competition, purveyors of fake news would have to figure out how to game more algorithms.
Our full conversation, lightly edited for clarity, appears below.

Are the big tech companies monopolies?
Sean Illing
Can you make the case to me for why big tech companies like Facebook or Amazon or Google should be treated like monopolies?
Sally Hubbard
Monopoly enforcement is often about ensuring fair competition. One of the main arguments is that these platforms have gotten so large that they actually compete with companies that depend on their platforms to exist in the marketplace. This is what I call “platform privilege,” which is really the ability to prioritize their own products over those of competitors.
We’re seeing that in the Google Shopping case that the European Union has brought, where Google allegedly gave priority to its own comparison shopping services on its dominant search engine, so that its own Google Shopping comparison shopping service showed up first and other competitors that had comparison shopping services got put on page four.
Sean Illing
So these companies have gotten so large, so influential, that they’ve distorted competition in the markets they touch?
Sally Hubbard
That’s certainly one argument. I do think a privileged platform is a distortion of competition. You don’t have a level playing field when you’re competing against the company that determines whether you even reach the universe. What we ideally want is a marketplace where these products can come and they can compete on their merits against a huge company like Google, but if Google has the power to squeeze out competitors by placing their results at the bottom of search engines, that’s a problem for innovation, for a robust marketplace that is supposed to thrive on competition.
The promise of the internet was that it was going to be a level playing field where someone could start their business in their garage and there would be opportunities for them to enter the market. If these platforms have the ability to bury a competitor, that promise is dead.

Tech’s New Monopolies
By David McLaughlin
The rise of global technology superstars such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google is creating new challenges for competition watchdogs. In 2017 they joined Microsoft to become the five most-valuable companies in the US, a ranking that included only the software company 10 years ago. They dominate their markets, from e-books and smartphones to search advertising and social-media traffic on mobile devices. New research connects the market power of these high-tech behemoths — part of a broader rise in concentration in many industries — with chronic economic problems, including the decline in workers’ share of national income and slower economic expansions. Their dominance is fueling a global debate over whether it’s time to rein in such winner-take-all companies.

Former Federal Trade Commission chair Edith Ramirez has joined Hogan Lovells as co-head of the firm’s antitrust, competition and economic regulation practice.
Ramirez, who will split her time between Hogan Lovells’ offices in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, will jointly lead the 135-lawyer department alongside London antitrust partner Suyong Kim.
She will also play an active role in the firm’s 80-lawyer strong privacy and cybersecurity practice—a key part of her role at the FTC.
Hogan Lovells CEO Steve Immelt said in a statement that Ramirez will be “a valuable and strategic resource for our clients.”
During Ramirez’s tenure, the FTC filed over 200 consumer protection and competition-related enforcement actions, obtaining more than US$1 billion for consumers.
Ramirez, who has testified before Congress on competition, privacy, and data security issues, said that she was looking forward to returning to private practice. Before joining the FTC in 2010, she worked as a litigation partner in the Los Angeles office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.
It isn’t the first time Hogan Lovells has made a senior hire from the FTC. Former FTC commissioner Julie Brill joined Hogan Lovells in April 2016 as co-director of its privacy and cybersecurity practice, but left the firm this May to head Microsoft’s privacy and regulatory affairs group.

797,"September 4, 2017",EU: Court of Justice to deliver verdict on Intel antitrust fine,"
The EU Court of Justice (ECJ), Europe’s highest court, is expected to deliver verdict on the Intel antitrust fine imposed eight years ago on Wednesday, September 6.
The ruling will greatly impact how US companies reacted to EU legal penalties.
In 2009, Intel was hit with a US$1.26 billion fine for abusing its dominant market position by using various marketing stratagems and has been fighting the case since then.
According to commentators, if the ruling were to go in favour of Intel, then US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google, that had tended to accept EU antitrust penalties, may consider fighting the EU in court as a viable option.
Intel was slapped with the biggest ever antitrust penalty when the EC ruled that Intel blocked rival Advanced Micro Systems (AMD) from the computer chip market, abusing its dominant market position.
After general court judges dismissed Intel’s claim in 2014, the firm turned to the ECJ, its last option to fight against the fine.

District Court Denies Motion to Dismiss FTC Section 5 Complaint Against Qualcomm By Greg Sivinski[1]
Edited by Koren Wong-Ervin

Early this year, the US Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a complaint in the Northern District of California charging Qualcomm with violating Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits “unfair methods of competition.” The FTC’s complaint alleges that Qualcomm used anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly in the supply of baseband processors for use in cell phones and other consumer products. It further contends that Qualcomm has market and monopoly power in the markets for CDMA baseband processors and Premium LTE baseband processors.
FTC’s Allegations Against Qualcomm
The complaint makes three major allegations concerning Qualcomm’s anticompetitive behavior. First, the FTC claims that Qualcomm maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) agree to Qualcomm’s preferred patent license terms. Because of Qualcomm’s alleged dominance in the supply of important baseband processes, and because handset manufacturers cannot risk losing supply, they are not able to negotiate fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) rates for Qualcomm’s standard essential cellular patents (“SEPs”). Second, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm has consistently refused to license its SEPs on FRAND terms ...

799,"August 15, 2017",US: LinkedIn told it can’t stop bots from scraping your personal data,"
LinkedIn has been ordered to unblock a startup’s access to its data, concluding a legal debate that sets a precedent for the future. LinkedIn sent a cease and desist letter when HiQ Labs started scraping its data, the practice of extracting user data from social media accounts or websites like Yelp or Wikipedia for business purposes, as described by the San Francisco Chronicle. A court allowed the activity to continue.
HiQ Labs is a talent management company that’s using LinkedIn’s data to train its artificial intelligence models. The company offers other businesses a way to monitor the LinkedIn activity of their employees. If you make a few tweaks to your profile while thinking about switching jobs, the changes could be reported back to your boss.
“Microsoft is further transforming LinkedIn into a data-driven marketing powerhouse that harvests all its data to drive ad revenues,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.
Microsoft-owned LinkedIn brought a lawsuit against the company, claiming it needed to protect the personal information of its users. It banned HiQ from accessing its data, citing the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Digital Millennium Act as preventing invasive scraping activities. The move was criticised as a step backwards for the open Internet.

803,"August 2, 2017",Recent trends in KFTC enforcement activities regarding IPRs,"

CPI Asia Column edited by Vanessa Yanhua Zhang (Global Economics Group) present:
Recent trends in KFTC enforcement activities regarding IPRs By Kyoung Yeon Kim, Yulchon LLC
Korea’s antitrust authority has, especially in recent years, come to aggressively regulate the use of intellectual property rights (IPRs). One might guess this to be the case merely based on the fact that the Korea Fair Trade Commission (the “KFTC”) has come to be perceived as one of the more aggressive competition authorities in the world, having been very active in enforcing general competition law, overall, throughout approximately the last 40 years.[2]  However, in fact, one can clearly perceive this reality if one examines the KFTC’s history of rulemaking, guidance, and investigative activities and enforcement actions related to IPRs.
I will first outline some of the major milestones in that history. Then, based on my understanding of past regulatory and enforcement activities, I will try to offer a few observations and questions as a practitioner directly and indirectly experienced in competition-law enforcement by the KFTC in relation to IPRs.
Brief Overview of the KFTC’s Past Rulemaking and Enforcement Activities
The Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (the “MRFTA”) has a provision, Article 59, that expressly addresses the application of antitrust law to IPRs. Article 59 currently reads: “This Act shall not apply to any act which is deemed the justifiable exercise of rights ...

805,"July 31, 2017","Jean Tirole “We must protect the worker, not the job”","
One day, Jean Tirole, the French economist, stepped out onto the street and noticed people would stop him at every corner. “Please, we need an Economics book that we can understand!” they implored, as to some kind of Messiah. Tirole had, only recenty, the Nobel Prize in Economics (2014). And so, he decided to write a book meant for the public at large. The result is 577 pages long, and has been a success in France. Its title is “Economics for the Common Good”. It has now been released in Spain, under the Taurus publishing seal. The book was presented at the Rafael del Pino Foundation in Madrid, where the following interview took place. 
And just what Is Economics for the Common Good? “The economy is not a servant to private property and individual interests, nor to those who wish to use the State to impose their own values” Tirole says at the start of his book. “The economy serves the Common Good in order to make a better world.” Full stop. 
Tirole, born in Troyes in 1953, graduated as an engineer from the Paris Polytechnic School and went on to a Doctorate in Mathematics at the University of Paris-Dauphine. His greatest push, however, came when he left for the USA to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating in 1981 with a PhD. in Economic Sciences. The book sketches out, in layman’s terms, part of the work that would earn him the Nobel. Why is the economy so hard to understand? What are the limitations of the market? Why do certain social policies have such terrifying backlashes? What are the challenges presented by new technology? When should the State be reined in?

Q. Did anybody offer you advice for writing to a wider audience?
A  This is the first time I write for a mass audience. I have written for politicians before, or for experts in economics or for businesses. The problem is that we use academic jargon, and the problem was making something that other people could understand, as we tend to take things for granted. 
Q Isn’t that approach part of your idea of the Common Good?
A Yes. It’s important that we expand our knowledge. 
Q In your book, you say that one of the problems with the crisis in 2008 was that economists failed to inform people well.
A. For example, Spain was undergoing a financial bubble, and there were experts around who knew this. The Bank of Spain warned everyone, but they were never able to make the majority of people understand. 
Q You begin the book talking about cognitive bias, that is, the way our economic reasoning is influenced by hidden prejudices. 
A If we don’t understand our cognitive biases it can be hard to comprehend why people do certain things: Why we procrastinate with our chores, anything to do with alcohol consumption, savings… 
Q Was Brexit  a case of cognitive bias?
A No. It was a clear case of Imperfect Information. British people ware made to believe that they could do better with Brexit than without it. They had an incorrect notion of how much they would save if they no longer had to contribute to the EU’s budget. And that protectionism would benefit them. 
Q And that immigrants were taking their jobs…
A Look: Immigrants don’t steal jobs. People don’t understand, because they believe there’s a limited amount of jobs. In the short term it may be true, there may be a limited number of jobs, just as in the short term there is a limited number of books around. But countries with high immigration don’t have a very high unemployment. The US, Scandinavia, Britain and Germany all have lots of immigrants and low rates of unemployment. 
Q Can you solve a riddle for us? How is it that many US workers can believe that Trump will get them their jobs back, when there is very little unemployment in the country?
A Because there is a part of America that has become very rich, with very high income, while the poor have only had a 6% raise in their paychecks over very many years. Globalization has made the USA wealthier in general, but it has been uneven. If someone in the Midwest loses their job they won’t be finding a similar job in a similar environment; they will have to move, and switch jobs. This has caused some discontent. Trump has exploited this anger, by offering the wrong solutions. 
Q In the film ‘Gran Torino’, Clint Eastwood portrays a retired Ford factory worker who feels threatened by immigrants. Is this a good portrait of the USA?
A  True. Every country has its own films dealing with this phenomenon. In France it’s La Loi du Marché (The Law of the Market). It won an award at Cannes. It’s about an unemployed man who finds a job at the supermarket, but the position isn’t a good fit for his abilities, so he fights with his boss. Films like these reflect what people have suffered as the economy evolves. It’s real. I’m a supporter of globalization, because it has been generally good, but we haven’t paid enough attention to the losers of globalization. And now Populists are exploiting it the wrong way. 
Q Plenty of new parties in Spain are exploiting it.
A Spain has been hit hard by the economic crisis. People are right to complain, but they have been bad at choosing the right measures to take. 
Q What do you make of the crisis in Venezuela?
A Venezuela is precisely the wrong way to do things. It should be a very wealthy country, since they have the largest oil reserves in the world, and it’s a relatively small country of 30 million people. 
Q Norway has oil, it’s small and very rich. Venezuela isn’t. Why is that?
A It’s because, if you choose the wrong policies, you can make a country poorer. This has happened with North and South Korea. It happened in East and West Germany. We’re not talking about a 10% difference in income between them, we’re talking about a monstrous difference! In France we have people who think Venezuela should be a role model, and that puzzles me. They don’t know what’s really going on there. They can’t see what’s behind the curtain. 
Q In your book you speak about the impact that technology can have on jobs. If I were a taxi driver, would you recommend I switch to Uber?
A That is all going to become obsolete very quickly due to the rise of self-driving cars. 10 years from now I don’t think there will be Any taxis. If you’re a taxi driver you have two ways to react to Uber. You can either try to compete with Uber and become more efficient – which is what the taxi drivers of Paris are attempting – or you can block the streets and stick to your routine – which is what’s happening in Toulouse. I like Uber’s service, because it is very good. Of course, some things have to be brought to level with Taxis, such as having the same Social Security obligations. But it’s true that the taxi service in France is often very bad, expensive, low quality and some cheaters. 
Q What kind of question should we be asking about this?
A The key question here is how the Digital Economy is going to affect your job and your world. It’s changing everything. Your job as well as mine. That isn’t a new thing, there have always existed fears about the impact of technology on employment. However, the impact was relatively slow-acting before. Now the effects are felt very quickly. 
Q Exponentially?
A Yes. Jobs are changing very quickly. For example, thanks to genetics, blood tests and computers, we will soon have very precise medical diagnoses. What will a Doctor’s job be like in 10 years? Completely different. The job for a professor will be totally different. I may lose my job as a teacher in 5 or 10 years. We have to be prepared, and this is where the good and bad solutions come in. A bad solution is to try and protect jobs. As I say in my book, one should protect workers, not jobs. We have to protect people, because jobs will change in the future. We have to protect workers by giving them social security, of course, as well as entertainment, education… I don’t think we spend enough on education. We need a constant process of training, so people will learn new skills. We have to be learning all the time. 
Q If I were a student, what would you recommend?
A Education is also going to change. We will have to teach people how to learn more, and maybe give them less facts. You can find plenty of facts on Wikipedia. A physician using a certain software can even learn about genetics and perform tests. Knowledge of fact is less important, as it’s accessible to everyone through their computer screen. Thinking is more important. The way we think, the way we adapt our knowledge to new skills, that’s more important. We have to re-train ourselves all the time, and it’s not easy. 
Q So you’re telling us we have to learn how to learn?
A  Even professors will have to adapt to this trend. When I give a lecture I try not to give my students too many facts, since they can find that in books or articles. I try to say to them – “Here’s a situation, what do you think about it? What do you think of this measure?” 
Q Like Socrates. Helping them think. 
A I say to them: “How will you tackle this problem? What comes to mind?” That’s a lot harder than just passing on knowledge. Teaching facts is easy, since you simply have to read your own papers out in class. But believe me: It’s not easy at all to teach someone to think. Professors aren’t prepared for it, but it is very important. 
Q What about the good consequences of technology?
A On a global scale, we will be wealthier, with better sanitation, and we’ll live longer. Thin about search engines, Waze’s GPS, the internet in general. We will have better technology to help us combat ageing and increase the average amount of wealth. However, there will be consequences we have to deal with: One of them is that inequality will increase, both within and between countries. Within them, because there will be a greater demand for skilled people. Between them, because talent can move from one country to another. This is worrisome. If you look at the large new companies –Google, Apple, Microsoft – they are all immensely rich and have rich employees: the average salary at Facebook is two million Dollars a year. And they’re all in the USA. Those who invent things in other countries already speak English and are globalized. The danger lies in all that creativity and innovation being concentrated in only a handful of countries. 
Q Have you been pressured by any parties or interest groups to join them?
A It’s very clear to me that I won’t be getting into all that. During the elections in France I co-signed a letter speaking out against populism (referring to Marine Le Pen). But I want to stay apart from politics, whether on the left or right. [Tirole would not discuss Macron’s reform programme]. I can offer my advice privately, but not lend my support. I say this in the book: I don’t want to be someone who supports something. All I do is talk economics. My role is to explain. This is hard, because when you talk about the economy, if the Left and the Right are in disagreement they take it as your standing in favor of certain politicians. I don’t participate in these acts. I have my own values, like anybody else. I’m an Economist, and I’d like to remain in this position. 
Q Independent.
A Independent. It gives you more power. 
Q I believe I read in your book that the reason why developers bother with Open Source coding is that they are very selfish, and they are actually doing this to gain recognition and perhaps a job. 
A I don’t mean that they are selfish in that sense, but they respond to certain incentives. Most people are truly generous and want to work towards the Common Good. The other incentive is the opportunity to stand out, since these programmers sharing their code are usually quite good, and tend to be picked up by the likes of Google or Microsoft. That’s the kind of altruism I mean. And finally, the image. We all want other people to wee us as kind, generous, intelligent… We all respond to incentives.

806,"July 19, 2017",EU: Google “right-to-be-forgotten” case referred by France to ECJ,"
EU judges will have to decide whether Alphabet’s Google has to remove certain web search results globally to comply with a previous privacy ruling after France’s supreme administrative court referred the issue to the top EU court.
Google has gone head to head with the French data protection authority, CNIL, over the territorial scope of the so-called “right to be forgotten,” which requires the world’s biggest search engine to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results under searches for people’s names.
Having been fined €100,000 (US$115,000) by CNIL in March 2016 for not delisting across national borders, Google appealed to France’s supreme administrative court, which on July 20 passed the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).
The dispute with CNIL arose after the ECJ ruled in 2014 that search engines such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing must comply with the “right to be forgotten”. Though Google did so, it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France, arguing that to do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent on the territorial reach of national laws.
Peter Fleischer, Google’s global privacy counsel, said in a written statement, “We’ve been defending the idea that each country should be able to balance freedom of expression and privacy in the way that it chooses, not in the way that another country chooses.”

Confused EU Regulators Slam Google
Nobody can pinpoint the exact origin of the phrase “Can’t see the forest for the trees,” but that hasn’t stopped countless people all over the internet debating its proper citation, grammar and philosophical interpretation.
Where there appears to be common ground, however, is in what the phrase means: Being so focused on the details of one thing can cause people to lose perspective and miss a much more important and relevant bigger picture — often at their peril.
It’s also a great metaphor for what we just witnessed last week when the European Commission found Google guilty of anti-competitive practices over its Google Shopping product and levied a record $2.7 billion fine on them.
This ruling comes seven years after an investigation was opened into these alleged “anticompetitive practices” (November 2010) and two years after Google was formally charged (April 2015).
The saga is well-documented, so I’ll spare you the lengthy narrative. The Cliff Notes version is that a bunch of tiny websites convinced the Commission that Google’s Shopping product put them at a disadvantage when consumers were searching for products. Google Shopping is the little carousel of product images that consumers see at the top of Google’s search results page and for which marketers pay to be there.
These little guy sites, who pushed the Commission to open an investigation in the years leading up to 2010, had some big help — Microsoft.

Foxconn has lined up several high-profile US technology firms to join its bid for Toshiba’s memory chip unit.
Apple and Dell are among the firms involved in the consortium, said Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou.
Foxconn, the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer, makes the iPhone for Apple.
Mr Gou said Amazon could also come on board, while talks continued with Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
It was not clear how much Foxconn planned to offer for the division, which analysts have valued at about US$18bn.
Earlier this year it was reported that Foxconn could offer as much as US$27bn for the unit. It was not clear why the potential bid was so much higher than its mooted value.
Toshiba is selling some or all of its chip unit to cover huge losses in its nuclear division, Westinghouse Electric, which has filed for bankruptcy.
It was the latest headache for the Japanese conglomerate. In 2015, Toshiba’s chief executive resigned after the firm said it had overstated profits for years. It is also set to post another annual loss.

Whether “Big Data” Could Facilitate Monopoly in the Platform Economy and How We Shall Step In – By Susan Ning, Han Wu & Yangdi Zhao
(King & Wood Mallesons, Beijing)
“Big Data”, one of the hot topics in recent years, has been widely discussed. The impact of “Big Data” on competition interests both practitioners and scholars. The major concern from antitrust perspective is whether “Big Data” could facility monopoly, especially in the platform economy where data could be easily accessed or collected by platforms from multiple sides of the market. The purpose of this article is to review the role of data in different stages of platform development and analyze the possibility of monopoly based on the interplay between data and platforms. We will also discuss when and how authorities should intervene with the anti-competitive behaviors in the platform economy driven by “Big Data” in different scenarios. 

General introduction of recent discussion about whether “Big Data” will facilitate monopoly

In the digital age, the volume and variety of data generated on a daily basis is growing at an unprecedented rate, so is companies’ ability to analyze and exploit it. The innovative application and exploitation of data is of immense value to businesses. This gives rise to concerns that the control of vast amounts of data gives such businesses enormous power.  As observed ...

810,"May 29, 2017",UE: Apple y Nokia hacen las paces,"
Apple y Nokia han llegado a un acuerdo para resolver la disputa legal que pendía sobre las patentes de la compañía finlandesa. Ambas partes anunciaron el acuerdo en una declaración conjunta ayer, cinco meses después de que se habían demandado mutuamente sobre pagos de regalías.
El acuerdo prevé que Apple realice un pago extraordinario, así como futuros honorarios, por el uso de la tecnología de Nokia. Los analistas estimaron que el acuerdo valdría cientos de millones de dólares en ganancias para Nokia.
La compañía sufrió inmensamente a manos del iPhone, y ya no fabrica teléfonos móviles después de vender su negocio móvil a Microsoft en 2013. Mientras que la mayoría de sus ingresos provienen de la infraestructura de telecomunicaciones, está tratando de aumentar los ingresos de las valiosas patentes que aún conserva de sus días como la compañía dominante en la telefonía móvil.
Después que un viejo acuerdo con Apple expiró el año pasado, Nokia presentó una demanda contra la empresa americana por violar 32 patentes utilizadas en el iPhone. Apple presentó una contra-demanda, calificando a Nokia como un “troll de patentes” y diciendo que se había negado a licenciar la tecnología de manera justa.
El martes, las empresas dijeron que habían resuelto todo litigio y llegaron a un nuevo acuerdo. Verá los aparatos de salud de Nokia volver a las tiendas de Apple después de que se retiraron el año pasado, y las dos empresas dijeron que podrían trabajar juntos en iniciativas de atención médica.

811,"May 24, 2017",EU: Apple and Nokia settle their differences,"
Apple and Nokia have reached a deal after a testy legal dispute over the Finnish company’s patents.
The two sides announced the agreement in a joint statement yesterday, five months after they had sued each other over royalty payments.
The deal will see Apple make a sizeable one-off payment, as well as future fees, for the use of Nokia’s technology. Analysts estimated the deal was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Nokia.
The company suffered immensely at the hands of the iPhone, and no longer makes handsets after selling its mobile business to Microsoft in 2013. While most of its revenue comes from telecoms infrastructure, it is seeking to bolster income from the valuable patents it still retains from its days as the world’s dominant mobile phone company.
After a long-running deal with Apple expired last year, Nokia sued it for violating 32 patents used in the iPhone. Apple sued back, calling Nokia a “patent troll” and saying it had refused to license the technology on a fair basis.
On Tuesday, the companies said they had settled all litigation and reached a new agreement. It will see Nokia’s healthcare gadgets return to Apple stores after they were removed last year, and the two companies said they might work together on healthcare initiatives.

Troubling Aspects of the European Commission’s  Standard-Essential Patents Roadmap By Koren W. Wong-Ervin* (Global Antitrust Institute)

In April 2017, the European Commission (EC) issued a consultation on its Communication on Standard Essential Patents for a European Digitalised Economy (the Communication). As the Global Antitrust Institute at Scalia Law School at George Mason University noted in its comment to the EC, there are two main troubling aspects of the Communication:

The Communication appears to view variation in intellectual property rights (IPR) policies among standard-development organizations (SDOs) as a potential problem that may benefit from best practice recommendations.
The Communication refers to the need for “better regulation,” without providing evidence of an identifiable market imperfection, which is a necessary but not sufficient basis for economic regulation.

Embracing the Procompetitive Benefits of Variation Among SDO Policies
SDOs “vary widely in size, formality, organization and scope,” and therefore individual SDOs may need to adopt different approaches to meet the specific needs of their members. Although uniformity of SDO IPR policies may have some benefits, it also has potential costs, including the difficulties of keeping up with fast-moving technology without knowing how well particular best pra...

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Retooling the Patent-Antitrust Intersection: Insights from Behavioral Economics
By Daryl Lim (The John Marshall Law School)
Abstract:     Behavioral economics has been embraced in finance and implemented by the government. In IP law, scholars have argued it can inform non-obviousness analyses, decipher patent damages, and develop a more nuanced narrative for incentivizing innovation. In antitrust law, scholars have argued for a larger role for behavioral economics in antitrust law more generally. Yet to date, there has been no consideration of the role of behavioral economics at the patent-antitrust intersection.
In presenting pioneering work on the issue, this Article explains the role heuristics and biases play at the patent-antitrust intersection, and identifies specific ways that courts can take them into account. If antitrust law based on neoclassical economics were analogized to an app, behavioral economics would be a patch, not an overhaul of the status quo. A court that understands how patentees, licensees, consumers, and enforcers decide can more accurately contextualize and assess competing narratives and articulate more effective remedies. In other words, behavioral economics can help judges better understand how to use the rule of reason to achieve more dynamically efficient outcomes.
Through the lens of patents, Part II traces how the discretion given to courts in applying the rule of reason has empowered them to treat patents first with disdain, and then with veneration under antitrust law. This shift parallels the ascendance of the importance of IP industries to the national economy and the rise of neoclassical economics. It also explains how the quest for dynamic efficiency has resulted in antitrust ennui, before mounting three challenges to the belief that antitrust policy deference toward patent owners promotes innovation. These challenges are that (1) deference underestimates anticompetitive harm and undervalues the value of gains from intervention, (2) courts are inconsistent about their insecurities in regulating innovation through antitrust: they worry about getting it wrong in exclusionary abuses and yet approach vertical restraints and merger analysis with surprising confidence, and (3) patent deference is suspect as a matter of patent policy.
Part III explains how Actavis’s requirement to scrutinize permissible patent conduct through the rule of reason also creates the challenge of developing a coherent and predictable framework of doing so. It argues that Kimble empowers courts to incorporate insights from behavioral economics. In doing so, courts can become more aware of their own cognitive biases and those of the parties appearing before them, giving them a chance to reach more dynamically efficient outcomes.
Part IV addresses the three criticisms against behavioral economics most pertinent to the patent-antitrust intersection: (1) that irrational conduct is irrelevant to antitrust analysis, (2) that behavioral economics fails to provide predictability to antirust analysis, and (3) behavioral economics experiments are anecdotal and fail to provide antitrust with a generalizable organizing principle.
Part IV then identifies four areas where behavioral economics can help courts reach better outcomes: (1) analyzing anticompetitive harm and procompetitive justifications, by contrasting the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s approaches in Microsoft and Rambus, as well as the Supreme Court’s approaches in Actavis and Kimble, (2) empowering judges by enlarging the role of intent, with lessons drawn from cases such as Aspen Skiing, McWane, and Intellectual Ventures, (3) determining market power and lock-ins in aftermarkets, with lessons drawn from Kodak and FRAND (fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory) litigation, and (4) crafting smarter remedies by looking at the EU’s Microsoft decision. The discussion draws on past, recent, and ongoing cases to illustrate each area. Part V identifies areas for future research and concludes.

814,"April 17, 2017",China publica 2da Versión de Lineamientos Anti-Monopolio sobre el Abuso de Derechos de Propiedad Intelectual,"
Por Stephanie Wu
El Artículo 55 de la Ley Anti-Monopolio de la República Popular de China (AML) destaca que la misma no es aplicable al ejercicio de derechos de propiedad intelectual ejercido por empresas que se ajusten a las leyes y reglas administrativas correspondientes. Sin embargo el AML si aplicará a todas las conductas o actividades que eliminen o restrinjan la competencia al abusar de éstos derechos de propiedad intelectual. El Artículo 55 es por tanto la base legal para la intervención del sistema anti-monopolios en temas de abuso de derechos de propiedad intelectual (IPR) en China.
Desde la implementación del AML en 2008, la relación entre la AML y el ejercicio de los IPR ha sido analizada en varias ocasiones por las agencias y tribunales públicos encargados de hacer valer la ley. Por ejemplo, la Comisión Nacional de Desarrollo y Reforma (NDRC) multó a Qualcomm en 2015 por $975 millones de dólares por haber abusado su posición dominante, cobrando precios excesivos al momento de otorgar licencias por patentes esenciales estándar (SEO), así como cargos de empaquetamiento y la imposición de condiciones comerciales poco razonables. Otro ejemplo es el caso de Huawei v. IDC, en el cual la corte de apelaciones, el Alto Tribunal Popular Provincial de Guangdong, sostuvo la sentencia original emitida en 2013 en que IDC fue hallado culpable de abusar su posición de dominio al incrementar los precios, atando sus productos protegidos con SEP a aquellos no protegidos. Finalmente, en 2014 el Ministerio de Comercio (MOFCOM), la autoridad encargada de aprobar fusiones empresariales, aprobó la compra Nokia por Microsoft, bajo la condición de que cada empresa registraría sus SEP bajo términos de uso justos, razonables y no-discriminatorios (FRAND), mientras que Microsoft daría licencias no-exclusivas a ciertas patentes para fabricantes de dispositivos móviles en China.

815,"April 17, 2017",China Publishes the 2nd Version of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines on the Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights,"
By Stephanie Wu 
Abstract
 Article 55 of the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China (“AML”) provides that the AML is not applicable to the exercise of intellectual property rights by undertakings in accordance with laws and administrative regulations on intellectual property rights; however, the AML shall be applicable to conducts of undertakings that eliminate or restrict competition by abusing intellectual property rights. Article 55 AML serves as the legal basis for anti-monopoly law’s intervention in the abuse of intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) in China.
Since the implementation of the AML in 2008, the interplay between the AML and the exercise of IPRs has been scrutinised on several occasions by the AML public enforcement agencies and courts. For instance, the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) in 2015 fined Qualcomm approximately US$ 975 million for having abused its dominant position by charging unfairly high price when licensing wireless standard essential patents (“SEPs”) as well as tying and imposing unreasonable trading conditions without justification. Another example is the private action of Huawei v. IDC in which the appellate court, the Guangdong Provincial High People’s  Court in 2013 upheld the judgment of the court of first instance and found IDC to have abused its dominant position by excessive pricing practice and tying non-SEPs to SEPs. In 2014, the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), the merger...

816,"April 6, 2017",Here we go again. Will the computer industry ever escape its antitrust problems?,"
Posted by The Economist
Here we go again. Will the computer industry ever escape its antitrust problems?
“This antitrust thing will blow over.” Thus Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, a decade ago as regulators launched an action against his company. The chiefs at other big technology firms, even if they were not quite so outspoken, doubtless held similar views when their companies were targeted by trustbusters. It was wishful thinking then, and remains so today, as long-running antitrust actions flare up again and regulators ponder new moves against the industry’s giants.
Perhaps as soon as next week the European Commission will issue its long-awaited decision in the case against Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. It is expected to impose a whopping fine of at least €1 billion ($1.3 billion). In early June Microsoft will defend itself in a hearing in Brussels against accusations that it illegally bundled its web browser with its Windows operating system—the very practice that got the software company into trouble in the late 1990s. IBM, the target of trustbusters since the 1950s, faces a new antitrust complaint. And Google, the industry’s newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny. On April 29th it emerged that America’s Justice Department is examining whether Google’s settlement with authors and publishers over its book-search service violates antitrust laws; and on May 5th the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe to see whether Google’s sharing of two board members with Apple reduces competition between the two firms.
The computer industry makes more antitrust headlines than others, and seems unlikely to shake off these problems, for three reasons. The first is that technology heavyweights are often dominant in their respective markets. Ask any of the bosses of these firms why they are so dominant and they will probably respond that it is a result of billions spent on research and development. But they also operate in markets that allow a winner to take all (or most). Mainframes and operating systems benefit from strong network effects: the more applications run on them, for instance, the more users they attract, which encourages programmers to write more applications for them. With microprocessors, ever-increasing capital requirements mean only the biggest firms can afford to build their own factories. The markets for search and online advertising exhibit similar effects: the bigger a firm’s market share, the greater its ability to attract advertisers, thus bringing in the money to build ever bigger data centres. In each case it is difficult for an upstart to break in.

AOL and Yahoo will merge into something called Oath when Verizon’s purchase of the latter closes, saying goodbye to two of the most familiar brands of the internet era, Business Insider reported Monday.
Verizon, which acquired AOL in 2015, agreed to purchase embattled Yahoo’s core internet business for about $4.8 billion in cash in July — eight years after Yahoo rejected a $45 billion offer from Microsoft. The part of Yahoo that Verizon is not buying, which mainly includes a piece of China’s Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan, will be renamed Altaba.
Verizon executive vice president and president of product innovation and new businesses Marni Walden will oversee Oath.
It’s unclear if the Yahoo name will live on for any part of the internet business that will be run by AOL. However, a big new branding campaign is expected in the coming week, along with more details about the new company.

Will antitrust regulators please stand up — Apple’s free pass
By Nicolas Petit
Last week, Russia’s competition authority said that Apple colluded with resellers to fix the price of its iPhone. This unprecedented decision closes a long period of antitrust leniency towards the giant iPhone maker. And it also puts front and center the question of Apple’s industry dominance. According to every metric, Apple indeed appears to be a textbook monopoly. And yet, many antitrust eyes still seem unable to see it.
Let’s take a closer look, and pierce the veil of antitrust forbearance: year after year, Apple sits atop the rankings as the most successful company of the 21st century. It has been the world’s largest company by market capitalization for some time. It is also the most profitable company in the history of the modern economy. Its flagship product, the iPhone, is the most expensive mass-market smartphone ever sold. On each device, Apple’s earns a 69% gross margin. Last year, industry analysts were taken aback when Apple outsold Samsung.
Granted, high prices and large profits do not a monopolist make. So let us consider other metrics: amongst Tech’s frightful five, Apple is the slacker when it comes to investing in innovation. It spends less than 3.3% of its revenue on research and development. By way of comparison, Google, Microsoft and Facebook devote around 15%. In 2016, Apple did not even feature in the EU ranking of the top 50 highest R&D-intensive companies, trailing behind a host of less glitzy manufacturers of telecoms infrastructure equipment like Nokia and Ericsson and even of mundane suppliers of cars, chemicals, and agricultural products. At such low levels of R&D investment, it is even questionable that Apple can be called a “high tech” company (the minimum to be part of that league is 5–7.5%).
Apple also features as the world champ dividender in financial analysts’ recommendations. Instead of retaining earnings to devote to internal R&D projects as a patient capitalist, Apple returns comparatively more profits to shareholders than any of its peers. It also sits atop a mountain of unproductive capital.

Uber se presentó ante la Corte Suprema de India para responder a alegatos sobre su supuesto abuso de dominio en el mercado de transportes. Uber mantiene que la investigación no puede ordenarse, pues la autoridad carece de evidencia prima facie que apoye la acusación.
La Comisión de Competencia ha acusado a Uber de sacar del mercado a pequeños competidores, como pequeños operadores de taxis, al utilizar precios injustos. La CCI rechazó llamados para iniciar una investigación a fondo debido a la falta de evidencias, pero el Tribunal de Apelaciones de la misma Comisión ha ordenado al Director Genera que se investigue el tema. Uber India Systems, empresa que maneja el servicio de taxi por aplicación de internet, ha interpuesto una queja al respecto ante la Suprema Corte.
“Una investigación como ésta tendrá efectos internacionales, y no puede ser ordenada con ligereza. Tiene enormes ramificaciones para el negocio internacional” argumentó el abogado de Uber, Kapil Sibal. Los materiales entregados por Meru a la Comisión de Competencia y al tribunal de apelaciones tampoco muestra evidencia de una posición dominante para Uber, similar a las que disfrutase en su momento Microsoft o Coal India en sus respectivos sectores, dijo Sibal, citando importantes hitos en el desarrollo de políticas de competencia en el país.

820,"March 2, 2017",India: Uber denies charges of abuse of dominant position,"
On Wednesday Uber told the Supreme Court that a probe into allegations of abuse of its dominant market position cannot be ordered in the absence of a prima facie finding supporting the charge.
Meru accused Uber of driving competitors and small taxi operators out of business by resorting to predatory pricing. The Competition Commission of India rejected Meru’s plea for a probe citing lack of relevant data, but the Competition Appellate Tribunal ordered the antitrust body’s director-general to investigate the matter on Meru’s appeal. Uber India Systems, which offers app-based taxi aggregation service, challenged this in the top court, which last month stayed the probe.
“Such a probe has a wider effect internationally and cannot be ordered lightly. It has huge ramifications in international business,” Uber’s lawyer Kapil Sibal argued on Wednesday. The material produced by Meru to the CCI and the tribunal seeking a probe also doesn’t show any dominant position for Uber-like that enjoyed by Microsoft or Coal India in their businesses, the senior lawyer said.

Abstract:     Utilizing a privateering competitive strategy, firms sponsor the assertion of IP claims by third parties (patent assertion entities and others), with the ultimate objective the raising of rival competitors’ costs. This paper tells the privateering story with respect to both desktop and mobile operating systems competition. It begins with Microsoft’s funding of litigation against Linux – a threat to Microsoft’s desktop operating system monopoly and continues to a analysis of recent competition in the smartphone space. The paper raises potential competitive concerns and related antitrust and IP enforcement issues.

A leading antitrust partner is the latest in a string of key lateral hires made by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan in Europe, while the firm’s 2017 partner promotions are dominated by the United States.
With just one of its new partner promotions in London, and the other 12 falling across the firm’s New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles and San Francisco offices, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan continues to focus on European growth with key lateral hires.
Today the firm announced the addition of competition and regulatory partner Trevor Soameswho was recently at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels.
After beginning his legal career at Linklaters in London, Soames was instrumental in building Norton Rose’s (now Norton Rose Fulbright) antitrust practice in 1990, going on to launch that firm’s Brussel’s antitrust practice in 1993. He later founded and was managing partner of Howrey’s Brussels office where he was instrumental in cementing the firm’s position as one of the top four leading practices in Belgium, poaching six competition lawyers from Clifford Chancein the process, before the firm’s ultimate global demise in 2011.
From Howrey, Soames went on rebuild Shearman’s Brussels antitrust practice, which he left in October this year to provide specialist competition litigation and advocacy services via his own company SoamesAntitrust.
In a statement, Quinn’s Brussels and Hamburg managing partner Nadine Herrmann said that Soames’ addition was a “transformative step” for the Brussels and wider European competition practices.
Speaking to CDR, Soames announced his clear intentions for the Brussels practice: “I’m joining Quinn Emanuel to work with Nadine and the team to build a major, leading antitrust practice in Brussels,” in which his arrival was “just the first step”.
Bringing with him a significant amount of client work, including that of US company Qualcommwhich was levied with charges following an investigation by the European Commission, which suggested the telecommunications hardware supplier may have participated in exclusivity payments and predatory pricing which forced its competitor Icera out of the market; charges which Qualcomm has fought. His other clients have included Samsung Electronics, Microsoft and bank Credit Suisse in its Swiss Franc LIBOR and credit derivatives investigation.
“I have no doubt that on the Quinn Emanuel platform I’m going to build a very substantial Brussels practice which is going to succeed big and will succeed quickly,” he added.

Many of the most prominent executives from Silicon Valley are expected to attend a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump this week that will help steer the complicated relationship between the incoming White House and some of the nation’s most valuable companies.
Expected attendees for the Wednesday summit include Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, and both the CEO and chairman of Google parent Alphabet,Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, people familiar with the plans said. The CEOs of Intel, International Business Machines, Oracle and Cisco Systems also are expected to attend, the people said.
The meeting’s agenda hasn’t been made public. Tech companies are concerned about Trump plans for immigration policy, antitrust enforcement and government demands for user data the companies have.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has emphasized the importance of boosting US jobs, a subject that could put tech firms on the defensive. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are five of the seven most valuable companies in the US, yet they generally employ fewer people than big firms in other industries. The five together employ about 600,000 people, many of whom work abroad. Wal-Mart Stores, meanwhile, employs 1.5 million in the US. The tech industry’s heavy reliance on software limits the need for as many employees as other industries to manufacture, sell and distribute products and services.

He won’t reveal details but says Sterling’s “very happy with the outcome.” However, the lawyer for his wife, Shelly Sterling, calls it a capitulation.
The NBA says it’s pleased that Sterling has dropped the suit. Sterling was banned from the NBA for life in 2014 after it was revealed he’d made racist remarks. His antitrust suit was filed in 2014 after his wife agreed to sell the Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. A judge dismissed the suit in March.

After Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, ripped into Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior in Windows 10, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) opened a case against Microsoft for “abusing dominance.”
Microsoft claimed to have a “long history of cooperation” with Kaspersky and that it is “committed to work in full compliance with Russian law.”
Yet, Russia has already decided to block Microsoft-owned LinkedIn since the law requires Russian citizens’ personal data to be stored on servers within its country. In the past, Microsoft made LinkedIn censorship changes to cater to China, as opposed to being blocked like Google and Facebook. It remains to be seen if Microsoft will localize Russian users’ data as the country’s law demands. The New York Times added that it was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted, “rather than any other major social networking site,” but that is a “sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating” in Russia.
Speaking of growing tensions, Kaspersky has “had enough” and roasted Microsoft toasty last week for anti-competitive bundling in Windows 10, namely the way the bundled Defender is Microsoft’s way of “squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose.”
When upgrading, Windows 10 does have a habit of uninstalling users’ apps and replacing them with Microsoft-flavored versions. Even after selecting “Keep personal files and apps” during the upgrade process, third-party software can get axed and that includes antivirus. Kaspersky wants Microsoft to knock off that behavior and stop “foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks.”

827,"November 14, 2016",UE: Google asegura que Android “No daña la competencia”,"
Google ha rechazado acusaciones por parte de la Unión Europea relativas al mal uso de su poderoso sistema de publicidad en línea. Google rechazó haber utilizado el dominio de mercado de Android para bloquear la entrada de competidores.
La empresa ha sido acusada de utilizar una posición dominante en el mercado de los teléfonos inteligentes en Europa para obligar a los fabricantes de dispositivos a pre-instalar servicios de Google, al mismo tiempo que dejan fuera a otros competidores. La Comisión Europea, en voz de la Comisionada Margrethe Vestager, emitió una serie de objeciones contra Google en abril de éste año.
Google defendió su posición, recalcando la naturaleza de código abierto de su istema operativo. Comparó también a Android con sus rivales de Apple y Microsoft. De acuerdo con datos de google, los dispositivos Apple cuentan con 39 apps instaladas, todas de Apple, mientras que 39 de las 47 aplicaciones pre-instaladas en el teléfono Lumia 550 de Microsoft son también de la propia compañía.
En un artículo publicado el jueves Kent Walker, abogado de Google, expresó que “la respuesta presentada el día de hoy demuestra cómo el ecosistema de Android busca un equilibrio entre los intereses de los usuarios, desarrolladores, fabricantes y operadores de redes. Android no ha dañado la competencia, la ha hecho crecer.”

828,"November 14, 2016",Rusia: LinkedIn podría ser bloqueado por tribunal,"
LinkedIn, la red social para profesionistas que pronto será comprada por Microsoft, será bloqueada dentro de Rusia tras la decisión de un tribunal, el cual determinó que el servicio habría violado las leyes de protección de datos del país – un paso que varias empresas tecnológicas americanas han interpretado como una escalada en la tensión internacional.
El caso recientemente cerrado por el tribunal de la Ciudad de Moscú ocurre durante un periodo de debate en Washington, donde se busca determinar pasos para tomar acciones recíprocas en contra de ataques cibernéticos por parte del gobierno ruso en contra de las oficinas del Comité Nacional Demócrata, así como otros casos de interferencia digital durante las elecciones presidenciales.
El esfuerzo por parte de Rusia por tener mayor control sobre sus usuarios de internet se une a una lista de intentos por parte de gobiernos de todo el mundo para determinar los hábitos de uso de servicios digitales de sus ciudadanos. Desde la restricción impuesta por China sobre grán parte del internet hasta los esfuerzos por parte de la UE para regular el contenido disponible en línea, distintas regiones se encuentran en pugna contra otros gobiernos y empresas para decidir cómo deberá crecer el internet.
Rusia impuso su prohibición tras la aprobación el año pasado de una serie de reglas, requiriendo que todos los datos personales relativos a ciudadanos Rusos deben ser almacenados dentro del país. Los funcionarios han dicho que las reglas buscan proteger la identidad privada de los usuarios de criminales electrónicos o ‘hackers’, aunque los críticos han dicho que ésta ley permite a las autoridades rusas obligar a las empresas – locales o internacionales – a entregar todos estos datos de usuario al gobierno.

829,"November 10, 2016",EU: Google responds: “Android hasn’t hurt competition”,"
Google—as expected—has dismissed the European Commission’s charge that the ad giant abused Android’s dominance to block its competitors in the market.
The company is accused of using Android’s position as the dominant smartphone operating system in Europe to force manufacturers to pre-install Google services while locking out competitors.
Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent a so-called Statement of Objections to Google in April.
On Thursday, the multinational corporation defended its position and spoke of the open source nature of the Android operating system. It also compared a typical Android smartphone to rivals Apple and Microsoft. According to Google, 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple on iPhone 7, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft.
In a blog post on Thursday, Google general counsel Kent Walker said: “The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.”

830,"November 10, 2016",Russia: LinkedIn facing ban in after court ruling,"
LinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country’s data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in the country.
The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government’s hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.
Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald J. Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.
The country’s push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.
From China’s blocking of whole swaths of the internet to Europe’s efforts to regulate what can and cannot be viewed online, different regions and countries are in a battle with companies and other governments to decide how the internet will expand.
Russia imposed its ban — a rare occasion of LinkedIn being blocked in a country — after lawmakers passed new rules last year that required any personal digital data on Russian citizens collected by companies to be stored within the country.
Officials said the rules were aimed at protecting people’s online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies — both local and international — to hand over sensitive information about their users.

831,"November 9, 2016",US: Is President Trump Bad News for Amazon?,"
As Donald Trump began his march to the White House last year, he became embroiled in numerous feuds. One that got a lot of attention starting last year was a spat with fellow billionaire and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over taxes, media coverage in the Bezos-owned Washington Post and antitrust issues.
Following Trump’s victory, Amazon’s stock opened down about 3 percent, not a major drop, and probably a lot less than expected after US markets freaked out as the tide shifted from Hillary Clinton to Trump. But Amazon did see a slightly sharper decline than some of its big tech contemporaries, such as Microsoft, Appleand Google parent Alphabet.
When it became clear that Donald Trump was on the way to becoming the next US president, Dow futures plummeted as the votes rolled in. But US markets recovered this morning, possibly due to Trump’s victory speech, which featured a more conciliatory tone than his divisive and angry rhetoric as a candidate.
To be sure, Amazon’s stock movement could have nothing to do with Trump. Amazon’s stock has shown to be volatile with multiple peaks and valleys through the years. But some outlets speculate that a Trump presidency could be bad news for Amazon and Bezos.
Trump’s first dustup with Bezos came late last year. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. Trump has claimed he used the paper to influence politicians in Washington DC and keep them from taxing Amazon.
Trump has alluded to the possibility that Amazon could face antitrust issues under his presidency.

832,"November 7, 2016","US: Janet Reno, first woman attorney general, dies at 78","
Janet Reno, the first woman US attorney general who served eight tumultuous years with President Bill Clinton, has died aged 78.
Reno’s goddaughter, Gabrielle D’Alemberte, said she succumbed to complications of Parkinson’s disease early on Monday in Miami.
The blunt-spoken lawyer worked as the top US law enforcement official under Clinton from 1993 to 2001, becoming the longest-serving attorney general of the 20th century.
Just weeks into the job, she authorized the deadly 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound at Waco, Texas.
Reno later authorized federal agents to seize six-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez from relatives in Miami in 2000, and headed the Justice Department during the government’s huge antitrust case against Microsoft.
The former Miami prosecutor, picked by Clinton after his first two choices for the job ran into trouble at the confirmation stage, exhibited an independent streak and a brusque manner that often upset the White House.

833,"November 3, 2016","EU: Google formally rejects antitrust charges, says evidence is lacking","
Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines.
The US technology giant’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and US rivals.
The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time.
Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals.
“We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ‘favoring’ – that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said.

835,"September 14, 2016",EU: Facebook probe in gray area between antitrust and privacy,"
A German antitrust probe into Facebook’s user terms falls into a “gray zone between competition and privacy,” the European Union’s competition chief said, describing the social networking site as having “a very dominant position.”
While social networks aren’t a specific worry for EU regulators, they are concerned if they see competition being closed down, Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg TV in an interview Wednesday.
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office is investigatingwhether Facebook abused its power as a social network by forcing customers to agree to unfair terms on how their data is used.
Data and how it may be misused by fast-growing technology giants is a focus for Vestager, who’s probing Google on several fronts and quizzing Facebook on a U-turn over its use of WhatsApp data, two years after the EU cleared the deal. She’ll soon have to examine Microsoft Corp.’s acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn Corp. when they file for EU approval.

836,"September 13, 2016",EU: New rules look to unify digital markets,"
They provide similar services, so now they’ll be held to the same standards. A new draft proposal from the European Union may soon extend security rules that currently apply exclusively to telecom operators like Vodafone, Orange, and Deutsche Telekom to web services like Facebook-owned Whatsapp, Skype, and Apple’s FaceTime.
As first reported by Reuters, the European Commission plans to reveal reforms to its 15-year-old set of telecom regulations this coming week. The new rules will require web companies that also allow users to make calls and send messages to “ensure the security and integrity of their services, including reporting breaches to authorities and having contingency plans and service continuity strategies.”
It’s a victory for telecom companies, which have pointed out for years that so-called “over the top players” like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook do not face the same stringent regulations as more traditional communication firms, despite supplying extremely similar services. These new proposed changes may also help to even the score between European providers and largely US-based internet companies, which has long been a contentious subject within the European Union.
That said, not all web services will be required to uphold the exact same security obligations, as some of these services “do not exercise control over the transmission of their services over telecom networks,” Reuters reports.

837,"September 4, 2016",US/China: Is Dell’s $60bn merger all about challenging Amazon’s dominance of cloud computing?,"
Just three years ago, the future was bleak for Texas technology company Dell Inc. Declining hardware sales and the rise of China’s contract manufacturing hammered the company’s core build-to-order hardware business model. After years of layoffs and restructuring, the company limped away from the stock market with a 2013 leveraged buyout, putting the company back into the hands of its namesake founder Michael Dell.
But if all goes as planned, by Wednesday Dell will start a new chapter for a company he founded more than 30 years ago from a University of Texas dorm room. And following its $60 billion merger with Massachusetts-based EMC Corp., a leader in data storage, slated to be officially sealed next week, Dell Inc. will soon be renamed Dell Technologies.
This deal — the largest-ever technology merger — makes Dell the biggest supplier of the hardware and software used in building cloud-computing networks that centralize storage, applications, databases and other elements delivered to numerous users on demand. The cloud, as it’s known, is the most vital platform on the internet right now. It’s what Netflix and Instagram use to deliver on-demand content, and it’s what corporate titans like General Electric and McDonald’s tap to store and process data globally.
Currently, the industry leader in cloud computing is Amazon Web Services, which offers dozens of cloud-based services to companies and government agencies worldwide, generating $10 billion in sales last year, a 10th of Amazon’s total revenue. Thus, Amazon controls nearly one-third of the global cloud-computing market, dwarfing its closest competitor, Microsoft’s Azure, which has a 10 percent market share. Other players include IBM, Google and Salesforce, but all of their cloud-computing market share combined make up just a little more than half of Amazon’s.
Although it might look like Dell is David going after a Goliath by challenging Amazon, the reality is a bit more complex. By acquiring a leader in data storage and related software, Dell Technologies is priming itself to become a leader in private and hybrid cloud services, said Raj Thangavelsamy, vice president of SSA & Company, an advisory firm specializing in corporate mergers and IT strategies.

“The commission is analysing to what extent so-called over-the-top service providers (OTT) like WhatsApp and Skype are providing services that are equivalent to those provided by traditional telecoms operators,” Wigand said.
“The commission is considering whether the scope of the current EU rules needs to be adapted, to maintain consistently high levels of consumer protection, security of networks and servers, and to ensure that regulation does not distort competition.”

This article will place EU competition law policy in a comparative perspective, drawing comparisons with U.S. federal antitrust law, which differs on a number of key points relating to innovation. As a starting point, both EU and U.S. policy and law both seek to foster innovation. However, they can be argued to do this in slightly different ways.
This article highlights a number of important precedents, such as the Microsoft decision, to show how EU competition policy fosters a competitive marketplace, before applying these points to the ongoing investigation into Google, whose resolution may yet prove to be the most important restatement of EU competition policy towards on digital markets.

Do behavioural insights matter for competition policy? by Emanuele Ciriolo (European Commission, Joint Research Centre)
Intro by Juan Delgado (Competition Policy International)
Behavioural insights make use of behavioural economics and psychology to analyse how humans behave when adopting economic decisions. The use of behavioural insights to improve policy-making is becoming increasing popular all over the world. Pensions, taxes, unemployment, energy efficiency, adult education, charitable giving and, of course, competition policy have benefitted from the application of behavioural insights. Emanuele Ciriolo, from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, explains the role of behavioural insights to improve consumer, regulatory and competition policies.
It is traditionally assumed that a reasonable level of competition is the condition sine qua non for markets to work well, and generate the best allocation of resources. This view explicitly relies on the homo economicus postulate, that is on the idea that consumers are fully informed, utility-maximisers and intertemporally-consistent agents. If so, it is clear that consumers would play a pivotal role in the competitive process, by reacting swiftly to the best available deals, thereby exerting pressure on firms to cut prices and improve on quality. But is that a realistically co...

844,"June 22, 2016",EU: Tech Companies give their opinion on ‘Brexit’ vote,"
Microsoft Corp. was for a decade pursued by European Union antitrust cops, who fined it €2.2 billion. But when customers and employees last month asked executives whether the company wanted the UK to leave the bloc, the firm sent an open letter urging it to stay.
“Historically, the UK being part of the EU has been one of several important criteria that make it one of the most attractive places in Europe,” wrote Microsoft’s U.K. chief, Michel Van der Bel.
Tech firms have clashed with the EU on regulatory issues ranging from privacy to taxes to antitrust law. But ahead of a referendum on the U.K.’s continued membership in the EUon Thursday, several technology executives and lobbyists said that the U.K.’s leaving the bloc could deepen those battles—while creating new obstacles for them to do business in the UK, too.
At issue is a delicate political balance in the EU over tech policy between countries, including the U.K. and Nordic and Baltic countries, that favor lighter regulation and others, led by France and Germany, that argue the rise of big global technology firms necessitates new rules to help level the playing field.
While most big US tech firms have declined to comment on the vote, some executives acknowledge privately that if the U.K. were to remove or lighten some EU restrictions on, for instance, the use of personal data or corporate tax rules, it might help their UK operations.
But they say any change like that would depend on follow-through from U.K. policy makers. Any benefit could also be outweighed by an increase in the regulatory burden in the larger remaining portion of the EU, without what they describe as London’s moderating influence.
Some smaller, European tech companies echoed those concerns.
“In the case of Brexit, I would be worried about the direction of European technology policy,” said Dan Rogers, co-founder of Peakon, a Danish startup that offers employee-analytics platforms to businesses. “Without the UK as a counterbalance, there’s a strong possibility that the EU would enact more detrimental regulations.”

845,"June 16, 2016",The Rise of Big Data and the Loss of Privacy,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Rise of Big Data and the Loss of Privacy
Anca D Chirita (Durham University)
Abstract:      This paper explains why ‘big data’ matters and why privacy is now lost as a social norm. The European Data Protection Supervisor initially suggested a consumer protection approach to data owned by monopolists. It relied on the essential facility doctrine of intervention where a smaller entrant is foreclosed because it cannot access the data owned by the monopolist. Both the report and the doctrine are now of little help to competition authorities. Instead, the paper will evaluate the legal framework to clarify the scope of application of the data protection rules and elucidate whether competition intervention has any merit in its own right. Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the former Directive 95/46/EC will be mentioned before the paper fully engages with the recent developments in the area of data protection. In particular, drawing on the risks associated with data processing in both Directive EU/2016/680 and Regulation EU/2016/679, the paper seeks to determine how price discrimination can actually happen in the form of abuse of personal data. The latter carries an economic significance, as through the misuse of such data, consumers can be left worse off when bargaining or shopping online. Further risks associated with the processing of personal data concern health, which could, in turn, raise life insurance premium rates. In other cases, personal data can reveal a particular economic situation, personal preferences or interests, reliability, or behaviour, which could make price discrimination much easier.
The new regulation mentions the risks associated with online activity and the need to overcome different rules on the protection of personal data, which could distort competition. The major provision is one which explains that the regulation does not apply to a ‘purely personal or household activity’, including social networking and online activity. This is to be interpreted in the sense that data protection and supervision do not have as a purpose safeguarding the online privacy of individuals. This is significant since many influential commentators have long held that competition law should not become a regulatory tool for intervention in the area of personal data protection. Nonetheless, the regulatory approach to data processing aims primarily to protect employees from businesses that process personal data and that could lawfully disclose such data to the competent authorities in the wake of various investigations. However, the present framework can easily be abused or misused. It is broad on potential data subjects, as it includes ‘persons possessing relevant information or contacts’. So anyone’s personal data could be saved for unknown purposes.
The paper moves on to critically review the position of mere silence or inaction in the case of default settings of social networks or web browsers to review the position of informed consent under the new regulation. The paper argues that recent theories of informed consent place particular emphasis upon the degree of sophistication and the length of privacy policies, rather than affirmative box ticking. There are hidden ‘small prints’ or pitfalls, such as ‘improving customer experience’, which make it possible to process personal data without a just cause.
The paper examines Windows 10, Google, Facebook, Linked-In, Instagram, Snapchat, and Whisper’s privacy policies to establish compliance with data protection and reveal which distinctive categories of personal data are being processed. Existing evidence of price discrimination will be used to extract the pitfalls associated with social platforms based on trust and the potential abuse of consumer confidence that such data is safe from being shared with third parties. Although there are warnings regarding the selling of data, the paper will remain focused on the big data owned by the three main companies, namely, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. The selling of personal data could potentially lead competition authorities to uncover the bid-rigging of markets for personal data, which could extend competition intervention to include more ‘secretive’ social media, such as Whisper, Snapchat, or Instagram. Installed software and browsers can also be used as a means to improve users’ experience, but the processing of sensitive and confidential data has little to do with this purpose.
The paper agrees with the merits of the dissenting opinions by the late Commissioner Rosch and Commissioner Jones Harbour, albeit the paper argues that the EU Commission’s intervention is warranted by the enactment of the new rules on data protection, in particular, by what these rules have now left outside their material scope. Relying on Stiglitz’s theory of economic inequality, the paper argues in favour of considering data as the new currency in two-sided markets. While Google’s sale of its users’ privacy to third parties has famously been described as ‘Googlestroika’, namely, a ‘privacy derivative’, this zero-priced product remains problematic through the sharing of personal data with third parties.
In conclusion, the paper adds the abuse of personal data to the non-exhaustive list of abuse of dominance. The latter happens on online platforms, which are outside the scope of data protection laws. Such platforms misuse the trust and confidence of individual users by making them reveal personal data and by encouraging users to voluntarily consent to the transfer of personal data to third parties. Personal preferences or choices are later shared with advertisers and sellers and used to engage in price discrimination. Ultimately, data protection laws are useless in practice, as they solely highlight the need to educate consumers and raise awareness. There is, therefore, one active remedy left: the intervention of competition policy. Indeed, online price discrimination and booking manipulation based on users’ personal data is now a social norm.

Abuse of Dominance: Why Fine? by By David Rosner1 (Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP)
What is the purpose of imposing monetary penalties on companies that engage in abuse of dominance?
To Canadian practitioners, this is an important question.Â  Canadaâ€™s Competition Act was reformed to permit the imposition of administrative monetary penalties against companies that engage in abuse of dominance. However, Canadaâ€™s Competition Bureau has not issued guidelines explaining the circumstances in which administrative monetary penalties will be sought, or how they will be quantified.Â  In addition, there has been little judicial consideration of administrative monetary penalties under the Competition Act.Â  The coherent administration of these monetary penalties in Canada will require an answer to this question.
This paper briefly describes Canadaâ€™s adoption of administrative monetary penalties for abuse of dominance and raises some questions about their purpose in light of the statuteâ€™s words and purpose, as well as the experiences of other jurisdictions that impose monetary penalties for abusive conduct.
Monetary Penalties and Abuse of Dominance in Canada
In 2009, Canadaâ€™s Competition Act was substantially reformed and modernized.Â  Among other things, all forms of abuse of dominance were decriminalized and an administrative monetary penalty was created.
The administrative monetary penalty was intended to operate as a deterrent, not as a sanction or penalty.[2]Â...

Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is appealing the dismissal of his $600 million antitrust lawsuit against the NBA and his wife, Shelly Sterling.
The filing, with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, comes one month after US District Judge Fernando M. Olguin ruled against Sterling.
Olguin said in his decision that he was “skeptical Sterling suffered any injury at all, let alone an antitrust injury” by the sale of the team for $2 billion to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and called other parts of the lawsuit implausible.
Sterling, 81, had claimed in the lawsuit that he could have gotten more than $2 billion for the team but the circumstances of the sale “markedly reduced” the price.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life in 2014 and fined him $2.5 million over recorded racist remarks that he made to a friend.
The dismissed lawsuit also had named Silver, his predecessor as commissioner, David Stern, and two doctors who examined Sterling and determined that he had symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, leading his wife to remove him from a family trust that owned the Clippers at the time.

European Union Competition Law, Intellectual Property Law and Standardization
Damien Geradin (George Mason University School of Law)
Abstract:      This paper provides an overview of the efforts of the European Commission to identify and, when necessary, challenge anticompetitive behaviour with respect to standardization and the licensing of standardized technologies, as well as the case-law of the CJEU on the same subject. The paper starts by discussing the 1992 Communication on Intellectual Property Rights and Standardization, which was the first important contribution of the Commission on the complex interface between standardization, intellectual property and competition law. It then analyses the first major investigations that the Commission made into the licensing conduct of SEP holders, i.e. the proceedings against Rambus and Qualcomm. Next, it discusses the 2010 Commission Guidelines on horizontal cooperation agreements, which contain a chapter dedicated to the application of EU competition rules to standardization agreements. The paper then examines how the Commission has dealt with mergers involving firms holding large SEP portfolios, such as its Google/MMI and Microsoft/Nokia decisions respectively adopted in 2012 and 2013. The paper also analyses the Commission decisions of 2014 against Motorola and Samsung regarding the use of injunctions by SEP holders to enforce their patents against standard implementers. It also analyses the Huawei v. ZTE judgment adopted by the CJEU in 2015, in which the CJEU was asked to determine the circumstances in which SEP holders could seek injunctions against standard implementers without breaching Article 102 TFEU. The paper then discusses several forms of licensing or litigation conduct, which can be problematic under EU competition law, but which have not yet been dealt with by the EU courts or the Commission. Finally, the paper concludes.

The former Iran-Contra prosecutor defended software behemoth Microsoft in its antitrust battle against the US Justice Department. Fourteen years later, he’s involved in another antitrust fight with the federal government. It’s not as widely watched as the Microsoft lawsuit, but it’s a high-stakes case that has rippled across the Chicago-area health care industry.
Webb gave the opening statement Monday on behalf of Evanston-based NorthShore University HealthSystem, which is trying to complete a merger with another large hospital chain, Downers Grove-based Advocate Health Care. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger on grounds that it would reduce competition in the northern suburbs because the two hospital chains are close rivals.
The trial hinges on the definition of the competitive market. Webb argued that the FTC has too narrowly defined the list of potential competitors to the two health systems. The commission’s list includes Swedish Covenant in Chicago, Northwest Community in Arlington Heights, and Vista Medical Center in Waukegan.

The Magic of China IP Misuse Guidelines – By He Jing & Hou Lei (AnJie Law Firm)
The drafting process of various China IP misuse guidelines, circulated by National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), have taken up lots of attention in recent months.  The multiple editions of the drafts, which are all made public to local and global legal community, attracted rounds of discussions and submissions among professional groups and government agencies.  At the same time, the access to the other two draft IP misuse guidelines, being drafted by State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), is restrictive.  Now, it is believed that all the work drafts of the IP Misuse Guidelines have been sent, if not, will soon be sent to the State Council Anti-monopoly Commission for review and consolidation.  We may anticipate something for public comments later this year.
The intensive drafting work has contrasted with somewhat less aggressive antitrust enforcement activities involving IP in China.  People may wonder whether China intends to make some adjustment through such rule-making process, or this is simply silence before next storm.

853,"March 24, 2016",France: Google receives fine over “right to be forgotten”,"
The French data protection authority said it has fined Google $111,720 for not scrubbing web search results widely enough in response to a European privacy ruling.
The only way for Google to uphold the privacy ruling was by delisting results popping up under name searches and linking them instead to outdated information across all its websites, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes (CNIL) said in a statement on Thursday.
The U.S. Internet giant has been at loggerheads with several European Union data protection authorities since the European Court of Justice ruled in May 2014 that people could ask search engines, such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing, to remove inadequate or irrelevant information – dubbed the “right to be forgotten”.
Google complied, but it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France on the grounds that to do otherwise would have a chilling effect on the free flow of information.
“Contrary to Google‘s statements, applying delisting to all of the extensions does not curtail freedom of expression insofar as it does not entail any deletion of content from the Internet,” the CNIL said.
A spokesman for Google, now a unit of holding company Alphabet Inc, said the company had worked hard to implement the “right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe.”
“But as a matter of principle, we disagree with the CNIL’s assertion that it has the authority to control the content that people can access outside France, and we plan to appeal their ruling,” Al Verney, Google‘s spokesman, said.
The company did try to assuage the regulator’s concerns in February by delisting search results across all its websites – including Google.com – when accessed from the country where the request came from.

855,"March 20, 2016",Letter From The Editor,"
This year, as could not be otherwise, our Journal addresses the phenomenon of disruptive innovation and how new technological firms and the sharing economy are challenging authorities around the globe, including competition authorities.
We have witnessed, in particular, the rise –and partial fall- of Uber in different cities in most of the countries with competition laws. Regulators are hesitant whether to allow a service beloved by citizens to operate, or to rigidly enforce all the applicable laws, with the consequent ban of Uber services in many cases. Countries are facing a myriad of alternatives to tackle this problem, from adopting brand new regulations for this type of market, to amending or trying to fit them in the current ones, to simply leaving markets to decide what is best.
In our first symposium, we have contributions from leaders of two of the most prominent competition agencies in Europe. On the one hand, Alex Chisholm and Nelson Jung from CMA discuss how antitrust regulation ought to change and explains why more ex post and less ex ante regulation is required. In their opinion, blanket solutions are not appropriate and they fail to capture the specific circumstances these businesses operate in. Thus, acting prematurely with broad-brush ex ante legislation poses significant risk for business development and innovation. On the other hand, Bruno Lasserre from the French Autorité de la Concurrence, also shares a skeptical view on adopting new regulations. Somet...

Multisided Platforms, Dynamic Competition, and the Assessment of Market Power for Internet-Based Firms
David S. Evans (Global Economics Group)
Abstract:      Market power on each side of a multisided platform, whether in the form of increasing prices or decreasing quality, is constrained by the risk of losing sales on the other sides. That tends to weaken market power on each side and encourages platforms to keep prices lower and quality higher than they would absent these feedback effects. In some cases the nature of the business model, and competition, result in the platform allowing one type of customers to participate in the platform for free or even to subsidize their participation. Non-price methods of attracting customers are especially important in this case, particularly when the business model adopted by the industry makes it difficult for platforms to move from free participation. To provide a reliable assessment of competitive constraints, market power analysis must consider the interdependencies in demand by the participants on the platform as well as have heightened focus on non-price competition when the participation for one group is free. Market shares should be used cautiously in assessing market power for multi-sided platforms, especially when they reflect only one side of the platform, and therefore do not account for the interdependent customer groups, or concern a free platform side where there is no monetary measure of value. Finally, dynamic competition makes the analysis of market power complex because it results in feature competition, and potentially drastic innovation, on one side of a platform that has feedback effects on the other side of the platform. The courts and authorities have recognized these points in Qihoo 360 v. Tencent, Cartes Bancaires v. European Commission, the Facebook/WhatsApp merger, and the Microsoft/Skype merger. These principals should become part of the standard analysis of multi-sided platforms by courts and competition authorities globally. These concerns are illustrated in the context of multi-sided platforms that offer online services where free services and dynamic competition are especially important.

According to Bloomberg Business, the European Union may still be seeking to bring an antitrust complaint against Google regarding its Android operating system. Roughly five years ago, Microsoft and a coalition of other businesses banded together to persuade the European Union to look into possible anticompetitive practices Google may be leveraging with its search engine results.
In particular, the EU is reported to be looking into if Google has leveraged its pre-bundling agreement to deter or stop altogether, mobile manufacturers from building and marketing their apps, stores, and versions of the Android operating system. With apps such as Chrome, Google Search, and the Play Store are front and center on a device, Google’s heavy handed pre-bundling may be robbing independent developers of a legitimate chance to compete.
Similar to Apple’s approach of providing first party solutions front and center on its devices, Google can be seen increasingly encroaching on fair and competitive practices despite being the gateway to a million plus apps, by putting its apps ahead of others.
Bloomberg Business also cites an order issued by Russia’s antitrust authorities last year that had Google renegotiate its ambiguous agreement with mobile device manufacturers. After complaints from Russian search engine provider, Yandex sought to address Google’s default options set to drive traffic to its services over that of local competition.

Korea’s Recent Enforcement Trends of Cartel Law – By Sinsung (Sean) Yun, Kenneth T. Kim

Introduction
Korea’s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (the “MRFTA”) regulates, among others, abuse of market dominance, anticompetitive business combinations of enterprisers, unfair collaborative acts (i.e., cartels), unfair trade practices and resale price maintenance as the main types of violations. Some notable trends in 2015 concerning the Korea Fair Trade Commission (the “KFTC”)’s enforcement of the MRFTA include the following: in regard to abuse of market dominance, the KFTC’s cautious stance since the 2008 Posco decision, which declared stringent requirements for establishing anticompetitiveness, has been maintained, and in regard to business combinations of enterprisers, the KFTC has actively exercised its investigative authority in large-scale global transactions, such as the examination of the merger between Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron which was concluded due to the withdrawal by the filing party and the case of Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s mobile handset division, which was the first business combination case to be concluded based on a consent decree order.

Google’s CEO has been lampooned by Yelp’s public policy chief over a seven-year-old missive penned by Sundar Pichai, in which he told competition officials in Europe that browsers should be “powered by user choice.”
Pichai—who reportedly had his first meeting with Brussels’ competition chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday—was Google’s vice president of product management when he wrote a February 2009 blog post, which criticised Microsoft’s then-dominance in Europe’s browser market.
Yelp’s Luther Lowe couldn’t resist sticking a well-timed boot in this week, however, by posting an altered version of Pichai’s gripes, complete with strikethroughs, to emphasise concerns about Google’s alleged abuse of dominance in European search, where the multinational commands more than 90 percent of the market.
“Seven years ago today [February 24, 2009], Sundar Pichai argued for the European Commission to usher in ‘more competition… greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere’,” wrote Lowe, who posted the mischievous modified missive in Google Docs. “On the eve of Mr Pichai’s meeting with Commissioner Vestager, I draw inspiration from Mr Pichai, and write to echo his important and prescient message.”
The competition wing of the European Commission has been formally probing Google’s search business practices since late 2010. Yelp is among a list of 19 complainants in that case. In April last year, Vestager issued a Statement of Objections against the company, alleging that Google had systematically favoured its own comparison shopping product in its general search results pages, above those of its rivals in that market.

CPI North America Column edited by Koren W. Wong-Ervin (Global Antitrust Institute) presents:
Why Patent Holdout is Not Just a Fancy Name for Plain Old Patent Infringement by By Anne Layne-Farrar1 (Charles River Associates)
Patent holdup – where a standard essential patent (SEP) holder exploits a licensee’s costs to switch away from the related standard as a means of obtaining royalties above the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) level – is a regular feature of the innovation policy debate. Indeed, one of the apparent motivations behind the Federal Trade Commission’s upcoming study of Patent Assertion Entities (the 6(b) study) is concern over “excessive” litigation and patent holdup by non-practicing patent aggregators. Analogous conduct, licensee holdout – where a would-be licensee implements a standard but does not take a license to the SEPs underlying it – has gotten far less attention.
In some circles, patent holdout is dismissed as no more than a fancy name for regular patent infringement. The thinking here is that when an implementer does not take a license to SEPs, it can be sued for patent infringement just as with any other patent. Thus, patent holdout is merely old wine in a new bottle, with no need for any special treatment. In this article, I explain why this view reflects a lack of understanding of important differences between traditional patent litigation and litigation over SEPs under a FRAND obligation.

861,"February 4, 2016",US: Oracle dodges suit over No-Poaching deals,"
Oracle joined Microsoft on Tuesday in successfully dodging an antitrust class action over its agreements not to recruit workers from other tech firms.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh dismissed the suit with prejudice on Tuesday, finding the employees failed to show Oracle entered into any “no-poaching” deals after the four-year statute of limitations clock started ticking in October 2010.
Lead plaintiff Greg Garrison sued Oracle in October 2014, three days before lead plaintiff Deserae Ryan sued Microsoft on similar antitrust claims.
Just as she ruled in the suit against Microsoft this past November, Koh again rejected theories that criminal investigations, lawsuits against co-conspirators, alleged concealment of deals and renewing of agreements froze the limitations period.
“Although plaintiffs allege that Oracle continued to enter into new secret agreements and add companies to the ‘no-hire’ list ‘well into 2012,’ plaintiffs fail to identify a single new agreement after 2009,” Koh wrote in her 51-page ruling.
Koh found a Justice Department probe into Oracle’s anticompetitive deals from 2009 to October 2014 did not freeze the limitations period. The judge pointed to Ninth Circuit precedent that holds the limitations period begins tolling when the government files a complaint, not when it opens an investigation.
The DOJ never filed a complaint against Oracle.
Koh said the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuits against Adobe, Lucasfilm and eBay also failed to stop the clock because none of those complaints mentioned Oracle by name.
Claims that Oracle lied about its commitment to obeying antitrust laws in public Securities and Exchange Commission filings and its employee handbook were also found insufficient to allege fraudulent concealment.

Un senador del partido demócrata ha acusado a las autoridades europeas de levantar casos por competencia para disimular sus propios intereses en el sector de la tecnología. La acusación es el último capítulo en una larga serie de conflictos entre gigantes tecnológicos americanos y gobiernos europeos por temas de privacidad. 
El senador Mark Warner de Virginia entabló una fuerte discusión con la ex-comisionada digital de la UE, Neelie Kroes, con quien compartió el escenario durante el Consumer Electronics Show de Las Vegas. El senador cuestionó los motivos detrás de los planes de la comunidad europea por establecer reglamentos de privacidad unificados a lo largo del continente. 
“Las acciones de la UE podrían constituir una política industrial, en la cual dicen ‘Queremos apoyar a más empresas tecnológicas europeas, simulando temas de competencia’, o alegar motivos de seguridad para decir ‘tenemos que colocar los servidores en lugares específicos para localizar la información.” Dijo el senador. 
Kroes estuvo al frente del caso de la UE en contra de Microsoft, así como varios casos más durante su década como parte de la Comisión Europea. El caso ayudó a sentar precedentes para la investigación actual en contra de Google. Microsoft finalmente fue multado con 1,640 millones de Euros por llevar a cabo prácticas anticompetitivas.

Virginia’s Mark Warner locked horns with former European digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, who appeared alongside him at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The senator questioned the motives behind the EU’s plans for pan-European data privacy rules.
“The actions of the EU may have been industrial policy saying, ‘We want to try and support more European tech in the guise of anti-trust’, or for security concerns, saying, ‘We have to locate servers in certain places in terms of locating information’,” he said.
“That is more about 20th century nationalistic policy than about technology.”

Kroes headed the EU’s high-profile case against Microsoft, among others, during her decade-long tenure at the European commission, a case that set a precedent for the current antitrust investigation against Google. Microsoft was eventually fined a total of €1.64bn for anticompetitive practices.

Protectionist sentiments are becoming more significant in merger control considerations, especially in Europe. Can public interest exemptions or other protectionist considerations bring benefits that would justify potentially harmful side-effects from overriding competition-based analyses? Our first four papers, led by the U.K.’s new CMA, look to answer just that question. And the first paper in our Of Special Interest section also concerns protectionism as David S. Evans explains how the EU’s proposed payments legislation can harm consumers. Finally, Neale Mahoney, André Veiga, & Glen Weyl close with interesting food for thought involving cream-skimming: Can there be too much competition in selection markets?

This issue, compiled with Danny Sokol’s guidance, dives into the very murky waters of patents and acronyms—SEPs, FRANDs, non-SEPs among others. As one of our esteemed authors notes, antitrust lawyers and economists are scrutinizing these with “vigor, fascination, and (sometimes) an admirable level of obsession.”
So do SEPs (and their relatives) warrant special antitrust consideration? How should antitrust laws address concerns inherent in the defensive use of SEPs – especially regarding the tricky issue of injunctive relief? And what about those patents that are still FRAND-encumbered but not SEPs? Or how about patent enforcement that has been outsourced? And are some agencies getting carried away? Finally, how did Miley Cyrus get into the conversation? We look at all those questions.
And does any conclusion stand out? One strong one – if you’re involved in antitrust today, this is a field you really need to understand. And reading these papers will move you a long way down that road.

The DOJ’s case against the AT&T/T-Mobile merger has the potential to be a landmark antitrust case. As such, the case will raise and—potentially—answer key questions about acceptable mergers. Our authors not only present viewpoints on both sides of the case but also ask some of the fascinating, less-analyzed questions the case raises. How will the conduct and results of the case reflect on the DOJ’s reputation? Should congressmen be writing letters to President Obama asking him to intervene? What roles are the lobbyists playing? Is the importance of this case overstated? Will the Court use old—or new—merger analysis methodology? How should the lessons from the Microsoft case be applied? The answers could influence antitrust practice for years to come.

For all but cartel cases, the EC has been increasingly relying on commitment procedures to resolve competition concerns. Yet, despite their popularity, there is often confusion among commitments, settlements, and remedies. And with the recent Microsoft  fine, the question has to be asked: Just how certain can companies be about the finality of these agreements? And what happens when two jurisidictions disagree? Our distinguished panel looks at these and other questions regarding this popular part of the antitrust toolkit.
And in our Of Current Interest Section, we look at two diverse questions – What impact does competition have on trade? And how effective are cartel fines in Russia’s developing antitrust regime.

How best to integrate two different approaches to decision making? Should merger notification still be voluntary? What are the appropriate safeguards to ensure impartial decisions? What does the removal of “dishonesty” from the cartel offense mean?

Recent Developments in EU Anti-Cartel Enforcement
Anti-cartel enforcement has been a major priority for some time for all competition agencies. Beyond intensifying investigative actions and prosecutions, however, the primary thrust of policy and indeed the chief yardstick for evaluation of enforcement is the degree to which ongoing cartel activities in the jurisdiction are severely deterred. Fines or other sanctions through which this deterrence may be expected to dissuade cartel conduct thus assume a central role in any policy considerations.

To some legal and economic commentators, the articulation of an all embracing rule that defines exclusionary conduct has become the Holy Grail of antitrust law, or at least of Section 2. Thoughtful articles have advocated myriad competing tests, but no test has emerged as a consensus choice. Moreover, equally thoughtful commentators have suggested that different species of conduct should not all be governed by the same test for distinguishing the exclusionary from the benign. Given this background, the position that the Department of Justice (â€œDOJâ€) would take on this issue was eagerly awaitedâ€”especially because many of the strongest advocates of the competing tests participated in the hearings that culminated in the DOJ’s recent report.

More than 25 years ago, Christopher Norall and I wrote an article challenging the Commission’s approach to the application of Articles 81(1) and (3) EC, calling for the priests of competition law in Brussels to trust the laity more, to share enforcement duties with others, and to be less formalistic in interpreting the rules. It was one of a string of articles which suggested that the Commission could not maintain its monopoly over the grant of exemptions. Its theory that the prohibition of Article 81(1) EC caught everything which might have a remotely discernible effect on competition was understandable for the early days of an untested institution, dubious about the scope of its competence and the reception its theories would receive from courts and businesses. The theory needed to adapt to the realities of an enlarged Europe. After years of hesitation, the Commission wisely chose to share enforcement with national courts and national competition authorities. This was a massive change in course, widely and justly commended.

Richard Schmalensee, who taught Tirole when he getting his Ph.D. at MIT, provides an overview of the importance of Rochet and Tirole’s work on multi-sided platforms to industrial organization generally and antitrust specifically. Between these bookends we present a diverse selection of articles on the law and economics of multi-sided platforms by key contributors in the area. Our next section benefits from the fact that 2014 was a watershed year for court decisions on multi-sided platforms.

The payment card industry has faced intense antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, partly in response to the merchants’ recurrent complaints about high transaction fees.

Software platforms could, however, employ governance systems to foreclose competition.

Although it was not my task to adjudicate the dispute, an evaluation of the reasonableness of the eventual settlement from an economic perspective inevitably entails a comparison between what the plaintiffs received in the proposed settlement and the expected returns to the plaintiffs

A Symposium on Tying



Dennis Carlton, Michael Waldman, Dec 20, 2012
Brantley Versus NBC Universal: Where’s the Beef?
As with other important cases involving firms such as Kodak and Microsoft, the recent Brantley case raises interesting questions concerning appropriate antitrust policy in situations where firms practice a form of tying. Dennis W. Carlton (University of Chicago) & Michael Waldman (Cornell University)
Peter Carstensen, Dec 20, 2012
Tying Still a Competitive Evil
The central observation is that tying does, in fact, distort the market process and affects adversely both buyers and competitors, actual and potential, of the firm employing the tying device. Peter C. Carstensen (University of Wisconsin)
Daniel Crane, Dec 20, 2012
Tying and Consumer Harm
The Brantley court was correct in holding that some theory of anticompetitive effect from the tying arrangement that is to say, some theory of how the tying arrangement reduced the market’s competitive- ness should be required in every tying case. Daniel Crane (University of Michigan)

Bundling and Tying: Should Regulators Use the Per Se Approach or the Rule-of-Reason Approach? Lessons from the Economics Literature
The question of when a tying case should be ruled under the per se approach or under the rule-of-reason approach is valid and has policy implications. This article is written to shed light into what could be the appropriate answer by presenting several lessons that we can learn from economics literature.

Antitrust and Nonexcluding Ties
Notwithstanding hundreds of court decisions and scholarly articles, tying arrangements remain enigmatic. Conclusions that go to either extreme, per se legality or per se illegality, invariably make simplifying assumptions that frequently do not obtain. Herbert Hovenkamp (University of Iowa)

Strong Spine, Weak Underbelly: The CFI Microsoft Decision
The CFI’s decision in Microsoft came as something of a surprise. In the run-up to its issuance, commentators had been predicting some sort of “split-the-difference” approach, seeing the Court as most likely upholding the Commission’s decision on Microsoft’s refusal to supply interoperability information to Sun but reversing its decision on Microsoft’s refusal to dis-integrate Windows and the Windows Media Player. I thought the opposite.

European Antitrust: Is Big Bad Again?
Every MBA program in every country teaches students to compete using the “four P’s” of marketing: price, product, place, and promotion.

Competition Policy in Europe: Harming Incentives to Innovate
The European Court of First Instance, through its decision in Microsoft v. Commission, dealt a one-two punch to incentives to innovate. First, by penalizing Microsoft for bundling its Media Player with Windows, the court will make companies reluctant to add innovative features to their products. Second, by sanctioning Microsoft for not disclosing fundamental innovations to its server software to its rivals, the court will make companies think twice before investing in costly research and development (R&D).

The Thirteenth Chime of the Clock
Few judgments of the European Court of First Instance (CFI) have attracted as much attention or controversy as the decision in Microsoft Corporation v. European Commission. One aspect of the case dealt with Microsoft´s practice of bundling its own Windows Media Player application with its ubiquitous Windows operating system. The Court upheld a Commission decision that found Microsoft liable under Article 82 and, as a remedy, required Microsoft to produce and market an unbundled version of its operating system called Windows N. But Windows N has failed to sell in the marketplace, and the market position of competing media players has nonetheless grown.

In the tying part of the Microsoft case, as in the interoperability part of the case, the CFI upheld the Commission´s Decision. But it did so on grounds that were confused and inconsistent. For all of the central elements of the case, the CFI appears to have been unable or unwilling to set out a clear statement of principle and apply it properly to the facts.

This paper discusses complementarities and tensions between competition policies and consumer protection policies. The paper argues that markets will often supply adequate customer protection without the need for extra public intervention.

Consumer Protection and Behavioral Economics: To BE or Not to BE?
The foundation of consumer protection policy is respect for consumer choice. Modern consumer protection recognizes the need to preserve information markets and to carefully structure interventions to ensure compatibility with how consumers actually process information.

Regulation of Information and Advertising
Deception is the manipulation of information to gain some advantage. This paper considers commercial deception through advertising. The paper first discusses the economics of information. The literature has derived four major policy conclusions. First, truthful information regarding price should not be restricted by regulatory authorities. Second, deception is most likely and most harmful for credence goods, and regulation is most useful (if it is useful at all) for these goods. Third, truthful information should never be restricted. Fourth, regulation of advertising is best done by authorities that specialize in advertising, rather than by agencies with another mission. A fifth, more tentative, conclusion is that regulation should limit itself to statements that are actually false, and ignore those that are misleading or deceptive.

Unfair Commercial Practices and Misleading and Comparative Advertising: An Analysis of the Harmonization of EU Legislation in View of the Italian Implementation of the Rules
Most antitrust experts tend to consider consumer protection the son of a lesser God in comparison to antitrust rules. Indeed, customer protection is the very essence of competition policy. A market that functions without distortions will benefit consumers capability to choose a larger variety of products at a cheaper price.

Introduction to Chapters VII and IX of Augustin Cournot, Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth
In November 2007, the European Commission accepted a set of guidelines concerning its review of non-horizontal mergers. The section on conglomerate mergers contains a discussion of the possibility that merging firms will bundle their products together. It reads, in part: “When producers of complementary goods are pricing independently, they will not take into account the positive effect of a drop in the price of their product on the sales of the other product. Depending on the market conditions, a merged firm may internalise this effect and may have a certain incentive to lower margins if this leads to higher overall profits (this incentive is often referred to as the Cournot effect).”

Welfare Standards for Antitrust Enforcement
Russ Pittman, Nov 05, 2007
Consumer Surplus as the Appropriate Standard for Antitrust Enforcement
In this paper, I argue that such transfers are likely overall to be quite regressive, and thus that a consumer surplus standard rather than a total welfare standard may be appropriate for antitrust. Two common arguments against this standard that most mergers are in markets for intermediate goods, and that a consumer welfare standard implies a tolerance for monopsony are examined and found wanting. I argue in addition that, even if a total welfare standard is used, both the finance literature on merger outcomes and the structure of the U.S. enforcement agencies suggest that the use of a consumer surplus standard by the agencies is more likely to achieve that goal.

However, it is, in a sense, too easy to label economic activity as two-sided. Without clear limits, most activities appear to be of a twosided nature. Therefore, I begin by examining whether telecoms meet the conditions of two-sidedness as defined by Tirole and Rochet in their 2007 paper.

881,"December 17, 2015",EU: Google ramps up lobbying as antitrust charges proceed,"
Google is ramping up its lobbying in Brussels as a European Union antitrust investigation advances, The Guardian reports today.
The company’s spending on European lobbying has increased from just €600,000 in 2011 to nearly €4 million ($4.3 million) last year. That’s more than Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter and Uber combined, but less than the search giant’s arch-rival, Microsoft.
The lengthy report also details how Google has arranged 29 meetings with EU officials, more than any other private company. Google cofounder and CEO Larry Page met the then European Commission chief in California in spring 2014, bringing up the antitrust case even though EU officials warned him not to.
In April, Google was formally charged with taking advantage of its dominant position in the EU market by favoring its own shopping search services. The company could be fined more than €6 billion ($6.48 billion) if the accusations are found to have merit. Google has called the charges “wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics.”
In some European countries, Google controls 90 percent of the search market. That’s a significantly higher share than the US market, where Google is also dominant, with roughly two-thirds of the market.
In late 2014, several members of European Parliament received letters from US members of Congress expressing “concern” that the MEPs were considering a resolution that would, among other things, suggest breaking up the search company. That resolution passed in November 2014.
Google declined to comment for the Guardian story about its lobbying. “European politicians have many questions for Google and about the Internet,” the company said in an e-mailed statement to Ars. “We’re working hard to answer those questions, helping policymakers understand our business and the opportunity for European businesses to grow online.”

Abstract: What is the role of competition policy in the digital economy? The question is not new, and many have commented on this topic already at the end of the 1990s, particularly in the context of the United States Department of Justice’s proceedings against Microsoft. In recent years, however, the debate has been fuelled by the ever-growing digitalisation of our lives, as well as by the considerable public attention received by the European Commission’s competition case on Google’s activities related to general internet search.
Some believe that competition authorities should refrain from intervening in fast-moving, technology driven industries, as the cost of intervention in those industries would generally outweigh possible benefits. Almost on the opposite front, others have argued that a muscular intervention from competition authorities is needed, but that this is not sufficient to constrain the market power of large companies operating in the digital space. Some of those observers argue that a new regulatory framework would be required to address problems such as access to “essential” digital platforms by third parties, which are not within the scope of existing non-competition laws (e.g. on privacy and copyright) and are also not allegedly tackled by competition law enforcers effectively. A third group argues that competition policy is the right tool to address issues related to market power in digital markets, and conversely that ex-ante regulation would not be desirable insofar as it would likely result in undue constraints on innovation. However, according to these observers, the current European Union competition law legal framework may have to be reassessed and potentially improved to meet the challenges posed by digital markets.
In this article, after having defined the main features of digital markets, I will discuss in turn the above arguments and criticisms. I will conclude that (i) competition law enforcers’ intervention in digital markets is appropriate and desirable, when the circumstances of a case justify it; (ii) competition law cannot deal with all perceived issues in a given market. However, it is the right tool to remedy distortions to competition caused by market power. Conversely, the introduction of pervasive ex-ante regulation in digital markets to ensure access to “essential platforms” does not appear to be warranted; and (iii) in general, the current legal framework appears to be suitable and sufficiently flexible to allow the Commission to intervene and remedy competitive distortions in digital markets. Whilst some of the proposals to further enhance the effectiveness of the enforcement system may have some merit in principle, more in-depth research would be required before any legislative reform.

La Unión Europea se encuentra preparando argumentos para la presentación de una queja formal en contra de Qualcomm Inc. Se sospecha que la multinacional habría puesto en marcha tácticas de depredación de precios, dañando fuertemente a sus rivales más pequeños.
La autoridad reguladora se encuentra en los últimos preparativos para emitir una ‘declaratoria de objeción’, basada en una denuncia presentada por la empresa Nvidia Corp. Dicha queja solicitaba a la UE tomar acciones contra modelos de precios de depredación en el mercado de los ‘chips’ utilizados en teléfonos celulares. Qualcomm ha diseñado la mayor parte de los chips que permiten el funcionamiento de los teléfonos inteligentes del mundo mediante el otorgamiento de licencias para el uso de su tecnología.
Qualcomm se une a una creciente lista de empresas norteamericanas que deberán enfrentar cargos en la Unión Europea. Entre ellas se encuentran gigantes como Google, Microsoft Corp. e Intel Corp. La declaratoria de objeción puede llevar al cobro de multas de hasta el 10% de los ingresos globales de la empresa a menos que esta última acceda a modificar su comportamiento.
Las autoridades europeas también anunciaron que lanzarán una segunda investigación sobre la empresa, ésta para verificar si Qualcomm ha otorgado rebajas, reembolsos o realizado pagos u otros incentivos financieros para clientes frecuentes de sus componentes. Una tercera acusación, la cual alegaba que la empresa cobraba cantidades excesivas en torno a sus patentes, fue desechada en 2009.

884,"December 2, 2015",EU: Qualcomm to face antitrust complaint on predatory pricing,"
The European Union is preparing an antitrust complaint against Qualcomm Inc. over suspected predatory pricing tactics that could hobble smaller rivals, according to three people familiar with the probe.
Regulators are in the final stages of preparing a so-called statement of objections, based on a complaint by a unit of Nvidia Corp., that asked the EU to act against predatory pricing for mobile-phone chips, the people said. Qualcomm designs chipsets that power most of the world’s smartphones, licensing its technology across the industry.
Qualcomm would add to a growing list of U.S. technology companies to face EU antitrust action, following probes into Google, Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. A statement of objections may lead to fines, capped at 10 percent of yearly global revenue, which can be avoided if a company agrees to make changes to business behavior.
Regulators are less advanced with another probe into whether the company grants payments, rebates or other financial incentives to customers in returning for buying Qualcomm chipsets. Another case that focused on complaints that the company was charging excessive royalties on patents was dropped in 2009.

Promoting Competition in Digital Markets; A Case Against the Google Case, and the Futile Search of ‘Neutrality’ in On-Line Searches Fernando Diez (Centro Universitario Villanueva)
Abstract: The technological foundations and businesses models upon which digital companies currently function, the so-called ‘platforms’, are characterized by the sort of features that attract antitrust scrutiny. They are usually conformed as multi-sided markets; they pervasively exhibit network effects; the nature and scope of entry barriers is uncertain; dominance in each market is duly granted to the successful company; foreclosure of small firms is always wandering around. Thus, it’s no surprise that digital markets champions such as Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple have received close attention from the regulators in both sides of the Atlantic. Accordingly, antitrust enforcement efforts both in Europe and the United States have recently increased in number of actions taken and the amount of fines imposed in high-tech industries. Recent decisions in this field have rekindled in-depth and largely unresolved debates concerning the appropriate role of antitrust enforcement in such markets.
Nevertheless, the Statement of Objections sent recently by the European Commission to Google, for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the internet-search market goes a step further, jeopardizing the very goals and objectives competition policy is supposed to pursue. Against this background and in light of other recent high-profile cases (Intel, Tomra, Post Danmark, and the everlasting Microsoft) this paper seeks to set an adequate legal and economic framework for the prohibition of monopolization under article 102 of the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). This sort of high tech markets are usually characterised for a heavy reliance in ICT (information and communication technologies), the importance of product design and the development of platforms. In addition, on the basis of ‘winner-takes-it-all’ paradigm, the platform on which they operate may be considered as an ‘essential facility’. As a result, any discrimination or denial of access may be considered abusive.
However, the legal treatment to be applied to ‘refusals to supply’ remains as one of the most contentious issues in contemporary EU competition law. It was at the heart of Microsoft’s misbehaviour in 2004 — and all the subsequent fines that followed — and, ten years later, if Google’s conduct regarding discrimination of competing firms in favour of its own services may walk the very same path. The four topics addressed in this paper concern three long-lasting controversies and one recent matter: i) under what circumstances a dominant firm is entitled to respond — albeit, aggressively — to its competitor’s challenges; ii) the precise scope — if there’s any — of the ‘objective justification’ defence; iii) if that sort of conduct is prohibited only when leads to anticompetitive foreclosure, without restrictive effects, is there room for a ‘by object’ interdiction of abuse of a dominant position?; iv) finally, in the specific digital industry, and given the still uncertain economics of multi-sided market and the evolving nature of prevalent businesses models, is really a ‘monopoly’ as bad and harmful as with the bricks-and-mortar or oil-well-and-pipeline predecessors? The ultimate question is, does current antitrust enforcement in these specific markets achieve its goal of fostering competition or rather the undesired effect of chilling innovation?

886,"November 8, 2015",Antitrust Balancing,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
Antitrust Balancing Herbert J. Hovenkamp (University of Iowa)
Abstract: Antitrust litigation often confronts situations where effects point in both directions. Judges sometimes describe the process of evaluating these factors as “balancing.” In its e-Books decision the Second Circuit believed that the need to balance is what justifies application of the rule of reason. In Microsoft the D.C. Circuit stated that “courts routinely apply a …balancing approach” under which “the plaintiff must demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm… outweighs the procompetitive benefit.” But then it decided the case without balancing anything.
The term “balancing” is a very poor label for what courts actually do in these cases. Balancing requires that two offsetting effects can each be measured against each other by some common cardinal unit, such as dollars or tons or centimeters. The factors that courts consider under the rule of reason rarely lend themselves to such measurement. Instead, balancing approaches are usually “binary” rather than cardinal. They are more like off and on switches that go in one direction or the other.
The Ninth Circuit’s decision in O’Bannon v. NCAA understood these limitations and performed balancing the way it should be done. In defending its compensation rules the court observed both the NCAA’s and the courts’ longstanding recognition of amateurism in collegiate athletics as requiring uncompensated play. The district court’s creation of a trust fund for deferred compensation was simply price regulation by another name.
One place where a more cardinal form of balancing can work is merger analysis, particularly under the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines. The government’s prima facie challenge to a merger is based on a prediction of increased prices. If the test is met then the burden shifts to the defendant to show merger specific efficiencies of sufficient magnitude to reduce the predicted price to no higher than premerger levels.
Stating consumer price increases as the principal concern creates a unit of measure that makes balancing at least conceptually possible. Second, the consumer price test articulated in the Guidelines is easier to administer than a general welfare test. In order to estimate general welfare effects one must be able to quantify consumer harm, which includes not only higher prices but also deadweight loss. This requires information about the shape of the demand curve. In addition, offsetting efficiencies must always be assessed and netted out. This requires a court to look not only at per unit cost savings, but also at the output over which those costs will be spread.
Whether the Merger Guidelines more cardinal approach to balancing can be migrated to general antitrust litigation under the rule of reason depends on the challenged practice. Joint ventures with efficiency potential but threatening higher prices from collusion are a likely candidate. Practices that threaten exclusion will be more difficult to evaluate. Practices whose consequences show up in the longer run will be particularly difficult, as well as practices for which the defense has little to do with measurable prices.

887,"October 29, 2015",Antitrust in Zero-Price Markets: Applications,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
Antitrust in Zero-Price Markets: Applications John M. Newman (University of Memphis)
Abstract: “Free” products have exploded in popularity along with widespread Internet adoption — but many of them are not truly free. Customers often transfer something of value, typically their attention or personal information, in order to access zero-price products. This dynamic brings zero-price markets within the scope of antitrust law. Unfortunately, despite the critical role that such products now play in modern economies, the antitrust enterprise has failed to adequately account for the unique attributes of zero-price markets. Particularly in view of the rising tide of antitrust investigations and litigation targeting high-profile suppliers of zero-price products, this failure is indefensible.
This Article identifies and addresses several foundational aspects of antitrust law that are challenged by zero prices. First, as to consumer standing, it establishes that attention and information qualify as “property” under the Clayton Act. Second, it proposes altering the traditional tests for market definition and market power by, among other things, implementing a “SSNIC” variant of the hypothetical-monopolist test. It also suggests that analysts should incorporate into such inquiries behavioral-economics research demonstrating the “zero-price effect.” Third, this Article demonstrates the unviability of the “free goods defense.” Fourth, it proposes damages-valuation methods that do not depend on unreliable stated preferences. Finally, it surveys and critiques the existing antitrust case law involving conduct in zero-price markets by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others.

Unable to revive Yahoo’s revenue growth on her own, CEO Marissa Mayer is hoping for a little help from her old friends at Google.
Mayer, a top Google executive until defecting to Yahoo in 2012, announced the two companies had reached a three-year deal to work together in Internet search and advertising.
Yahoo Inc. tried to team up with Google Inc. in search during 2008 as part of its defense against a takeover attempt by Microsoft Corp. The Google alliance unraveled after the U.S. Justice Department threatened to block the partnership on the grounds that it would thwart competition.
After being rebuffed, Yahoo wound up negotiating a deal to rely on technology from Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Yahoo will still use Bing, but will also mix in results from Google.
“We see a unique moment and opportunity for Yahoo as we move into 2016 to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better results,” Mayer said during a review of the third-quarter results. She promised to elaborate on her plan by the time Yahoo releases its fourth-quarter results in 2016.

Recent Developments in Korean Competition Law Enforcement – Youngjin Jung & Gina JeeHyun Choi1 (Kim & Chang, Seoul)
Introduction
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”) has gained attention as one of the most active competition authorities in the world. It has enjoyed a reputation of closely following global enforcement trends of more developed competition authorities, such as the relevant authorities of the United States and European Union. Yet despite these developments, there remain many challenges for the KFTC.2 There is also ongoing dialogue regarding the KFTC’s deviation from the core mission of competition agencies by placing emphasis on issues that are unrelated to promoting competition. Such activities are, in part, due to the  KFTC’s a broader mandate under the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (“FTL”, the primary competition law in Korea) than that of other competition regimes. For instance, the FTL includes a Chapter aimed to address issues associated with economic concentrations in the Korean economy that have plagued Korea for many years. Moreover, because the KFTC is positioned as more than an enforcement agency, the focus of the KFTC enforcement has been viewed as not necessarily consistent with the putative mandate of other competition agencies.
In this paper, the authors do not touch upon these broader issues under the Korean co...

Public Enforcement of Antitrust Law in China: Perspective of Procedural Fairness – Jet Deng & Ken Dai (Dacheng Law Offices)
Abstract
Some high-profile antitrust investigations such as the one against Qualcomm by the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), initiated in November 2013 and concluded in February 2015, with a sanction order almost reshaping the global wireless patent landscape, has drawn the worldwide attention to the public enforcement of antitrust law in China. Entering into the 7th year of the Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”) in force, the enforcement by China’s antitrust authorities has moved up a gear. NDRC and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) have both lunched substantial enforcement actions in respect of monopoly agreements and abuse of dominance. Looking at several significant antitrust investigations and reviews, questioning and criticism on the Chinese antitrust public enforcement procedures are put forward, because it seems to the public, especially to people outside China, those China’s powerful state central bodies have a fearsome reputation. It is argued that some important documents like sanction orders are not publicly issued in complete, which results in suspicion of international community on the lack of transparency in the process of Chinese public...

Antitrust Enforcement with Respect to Intellectual Property in China – Fay Zhou, Xi Liao & Christoph Barth (LinkLaters LLP)
Enforcement activity at the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property (“IP”) rights is one of the hot topics these days and heavily debated among practitioners and industry participants in the US and EU. It is widely recognised that antitrust and IP law share the common purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing consumer welfare and are thus complementary instruments. Antitrust law seeks to promote consumer welfare by prohibiting certain actions that may harm competition with respect to either existing or new ways of serving consumers. IP law grants technology owners a monopoly to reward them for the development of the respective technology and incentivise further innovation. In the absence of IP law, rapid imitation would chill innovation, ultimately to the detriment of consumers. It is thus recognised that antitrust enforcement in this area should be limited and primarily focus on transactions capable of lessening competition among rival technologies, while other enforcement action may interfere with the principal goals of IP rights. Attempts to restrain licensing fees in the short term can thus undermine incentives to invest and thereby slow down innovation and economic growth.

The Antitrust Analysis of Rules and Standards for Software Platforms and Its Implications for China – David S. Evans (Global Economics Group) & Vanessa Yanhua Zhang (Global Economics Group)1
Introduction
Many people use software platforms and the applications that run on them during much of the day for work and leisure. They run our mobile phones, computers, and videogame consoles and are behind our social networks. New ones are behind innovations in payments, transportation, health and fitness, connected homes, and connected shopping, all of which are transforming how we live.
Software platforms create value by providing an environment in which many different types of economic agents can benefit.2 These economic agents typically include end users, application developers, and hardware makers. They may also include advertisers, content providers, and other economic agents depending on the platform and the business model it has adopted.
There are positive externalities between these different groups.More demand from any group of economic agents usually increases the value of the platform to the other groups of economic agents. As with other multi-sided platforms there are positive indirect network effects: more applications leads to more end users, which leads to more interest from application developers and hardware makers, and so forth.
Software platforms also have c...

By: Geoffrey A. Manne & Joshua D. Wright
The antitrust landscape has changed dramatically in the last decade. Within the last two years alone, the United States Department of Justice has held hearings on the appropriate scope of Section 2, issued a comprehensive Report, and then repudiated it; and the European Commission has risen as an aggressive leader in single firm conduct enforcement by bringing abuse of dominance actions and assessing heavy fines against firms including Qualcomm, Intel, and Microsoft.
In the United States, two of the most significant characteristics of the “new” antitrust approach have been a more intense focus on innovative companies in high-tech industries and a weakening of longstanding concerns that erroneous antitrust interventions will hinder economic growth. But this focus is dangerous, and these concerns should not be dismissed so lightly. In this article the authors offer a comprehensive cautionary tale in the context of a detailed factual, legal and economic analysis of the next Microsoft: the theoretical, but perhaps imminent, enforcement action against Google.

899,"April 20, 2015",US/EU: American travel companies take aim at Google,"
American TripAdvisor a leading Internet travel sites has emerged as a key player in the antitrust complaint the European Commission brought against the online search titan Google Inc.
Last week, European regulators accused Google of abusing its dominant market share in Internet search by displaying results from its Google Shopping retail site ahead of similar results from competing online retailers.
The commission began its investigation in 2010, spurred by claims by several small European companies that Google was competing unfairly. But several big American companies joined the fray, including Microsoft Corp., the product review site Yelp.com, and TripAdvisor, which filed a complaint in 2012.
While the commission’s complaint deals only with Google’s shopping service, TripAdvisor and another major travel site, Expedia, say that Google uses the same tactics to promote its online travel service, Google Flights. The European regulators noted they are continuing to investigate Google’s other business practices.
“Google engages in preferencing and manipulates search results so that consumers see content that benefits Google, not the best content for consumers,” Chief executive Kaufer said in a statement Monday. “This practice harms consumers and competition, and must be ended.”
In a posting on its corporate blog, Google senior vice president Amit Singhal denied any wrongdoing. Singhal noted that while TripAdvisor said it has been harmed by Google’s tactics, it also “claims to be the Web’s largest travel brand and has nearly doubled its revenues in the last four years.”

A few weeks ago the European Commission stated they may be looking to re-investigate Google over antitrust violations, but the original case started long before now. According to the Wall Street Journal it all appears to start with a British couple from Berkshire, England who started their price comparison shopping website in 2005 called ‘Foundem.’
For Shivaun and Adam Raff, (Foundem’s creators) it’s been an uphill battle with keeping Foundem inside of Google’s search rankings, although Foundem has been little more than a “zombie site” for years, says Ms. Raff. According to the duo, Google had penalties set in place which seemed to affect their website and resulted in Foundem being excluded from search results.
Foundem may have initially started the series of complaints against the search company, but they’re a fairly small entity compared to the other corporations and companies that followed with their own complaints, such as Trip Advisor, Expedia, and even Microsoft.

The class action lawsuit, filed by two smartphone customers in May 2014, was dismissed on Feb. 20 by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California.
The lawsuit argued that Google requires Android handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd favour Google’s apps such as YouTube and restrict competing apps like Microsoft Corp’s Bing search.

Antitrust Developments in the PRC in 2014 – Michael Han & David Boyle1 (Fangda Partners)
Introduction
In 2014, China’s Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”) entered its seventh year. After a number of years building up the enforcement agencies and gaining experience, the direction of China’s competition regime is becoming clearer. In particular, 2014 saw an increase in the number of high profile antitrust investigations being launched as well as the introduction of a new simplified merger review procedure. While there is still room for improvement in terms of transparency of investigations and due process, more legal rules have been recently published, especially in respect of procedural rules.
This article provides a summary of the key legislative and enforcement developments under the AML over the past 12 months and examines the likely consequences these changes will have for companies doing business in China.
China’s antitrust agencies and their enforcement record in 2014
Before delving deeper into the Chinese antitrust authorities’ activities in 2014, it is useful to provide a brief introduction to the various authorities and their competences. Unlike other jurisdictions, China does not have an independent and unified antitrust enforcement agency. There are three regulatory authorities that enforce the AML at the national level: the National Development and Reform Com...

Antitrust Enforcement: China Ups the Ante – Michael Han and David Boyle (Fangda Partners)1
Introduction
Over the past year China’s antitrust authorities have come to the fore on the global antitrust stage with some notable decisions and investigations in the non-merger antitrust area. Many of these investigations, involving large multinational companies (MNCs), have invoked criticism from some in the international business community with allegations of discrimination against foreign companies. While MNCs at the centre of recent antitrust probes may feel aggrieved, as many companies do when faced with an antitrust investigation, there may be more substance to these investigations than simply discriminating against foreign companies. In this article we will elaborate on this further and provide some possible alternative explanations as to why foreign MNCs have been investigated of late. We will also compare the recent enforcement actions with other enforcement actions taken by the Chinese antitrust authorities against domestic companies – cases which have not grasped international headlines in the same way as investigations against MNCs in China.
While the Chinese authorities have shown that competition law compliance is now a real consideration for global companies doing business in China and have made great strides in terms of improving enforcement, there is still room for i...

Alden Abbott, Mar 16, 2015
The setting of industry standards is widely recognized as a driver of economic growth—standards may reduce production costs; increase innovation, efficiency (through greater product interoperability, for example), and consumer choice; foster public health and safety; and facilitate international trade. In the United States, standards development is sector-based and market-led, with American businesses typically voluntarily collaborating within private standard-setting organizations to develop standards that all firms from their sector (including firms not within the SSO) can employ. Outside the United States, governments more frequently are involved in promoting and providing guidance to particular SSOs.
Many SSOs require their members to offer to license their patents that cover technology necessary to implement a standard—standard-essential patents —on “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory” terms. Standards can also be set in the marketplace, where firms compete to have their own technology accepted by users as a de facto standard (Microsoft’s Windows operating system and the Android mobile operating system currently developed by Google are examples).
Despite its substantial benefits, however, standard setting has long been a concern of antitrust law enforcers, primarily because it brings together competitors that have an inherent incentive to restrict competition among themselves. In recent years, competition law has focused substantial attention on potential competitive abuses stemming from patents held by individual standard-setting participants or their transferees.
This article briefly surveys the current U.S. competition law treatment of patent rights affected by standard setting, which centers on preventing “excessive” returns to individual patent holders, as contrasted to the traditional concern with forestalling collusion among competitors. I conclude that the current approach is welfare-inimical and misplaced. It should be replaced instead with an exclusive focus on potential collusion among patentees, an approach that would better promote consumer welfare and innovation.

Eric Schmidt, head of Google, has had a first meeting with the EU’s new competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager to discuss a long-running probe into the company which could lead to a massive fine, officials have said.
The European Union began investigating Google in 2010 after complaints from rivals such as Microsoft that its search engine, the world’s biggest, unfairly squeezed out competitors.
“I can confirm that Commissioner Vestager met Schmidt and other Google representatives” yesterday, her spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.
“I cannot comment further on the contents of the meeting as they relate to an ongoing competition investigation,” Mr Cardoso told reporters.
Google has offered three packages to resolve the issues that the EU has raised but all were rejected.
Ms Vestager called for a review of the probe and asked for fresh information from all parties when she took office in November.

Intellectual Property Right Holders and Dominance – Susan Ning1, Yang Yang and Sarah Eder
Introduction
More than six years have passed since China’s Anti-monopoly Law (“AML”) came into effect on 1st August 2008. In that time, significant changes have taken place in the legislation and enforcement of the AML, which have achieved both domestic and international recognition. Technology has been drawing particular attention from the Chinese antitrust agencies recently, particularly in relation to abuse of dominance by intellectual property right (“IPR”) holders, the Qualcomm case being the latest example. The analysis of abuse of dominance in the context of IPR requires some special considerations, in particular in relation to the definition of the relevant market and establishing dominance. As one of the first firms, which took part in the drafting of the AML and provided anti-monopoly related services, we are fortunate to have witnessed the trend of expanding technology industries and have gained many valuable observations in our practice.
This article reviews the current practice of the Chinese competition authorities in defining the relevant market and assessing whether an IPR holder is dominant, and makes some suggestions for improvements by refe...

Fay Zhou, John Eichlin, Xi Liao, Feb 12, 2015
Written with co-authors John Eichlin & Xi Liao
Recent years have witnessed intensified enforcement activities by Chinese enforcement authorities targeting a broad range of alleged anticompetitive conduct under the Anti-Monopoly Law. The National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, together with their regional offices, have firmly established their position in the international spotlight with a series of high-profile enforcement actions against domestic and foreign companies. Headline cases in recent years involving multinational companies include fines related to the global auto parts cartel investigation, probes of resale price maintenance by foreign auto manufacturers, and high-profile investigations into Qualcomm and Microsoft reportedly focused on abuse of dominance and patent incensing practices.
With the attention raised by these high-profile investigations, these authorities have drawn international scrutiny for both the substance of the investigations and how they have been conducted. Procedurally, critics have argued that these investigations have lacked transparency and that the targets were not afforded sufficient protections under international norms of procedural fairness. In particular, they have argued that many investigations have been characterized by limited opportunity for companies to prepare potential defenses. Anecdotal accounts have also circulated that parties under investigation have been denied legal representation and subject to intimidation tactics by the authorities seeking confessions or price concessions. While these concerns may be overstated in certain areas and do not necessarily reflect current enforcement practices, they serve as a valuable framework for assessing international perceptions of procedural fairness and transparency in China.
This article provides an overview of some of the areas of investigation procedure in China that have drawn criticism under international procedural fairness and transparency standards, including a meaningful opportunity to prepare a defense, the right to the protections of legal counsel, and transparency in decision-making.
The article also provides insight into the Chinese authorities’ reaction to the international criticism and how they have sought to provide companies with greater comfort on procedural protections. These efforts have included measures to further develop their best practices as well as to clarify existing enforcement practices where there may be a misunderstanding in the international business community.
Finally, the article discusses how certain important procedural protections can be further improved and developed. Overall, the Chinese enforcement authorities should be recognized for their receptiveness to external comments in developing their enforcement practices and for their willingness to promote further improvements to address international concerns about procedural fairness and transparency.

Liu Yang, Feb 12, 2015
The Anti-Monopoly Law, in force since August 1, 2008, is often considered the “economic constitution,” safeguarding fair competition and China’s sound market economy. The AML established an administrative and judicial framework that is conceptually similar to that of other jurisdictions’ competition law systems. Since its entry into force, the AML has been used to prevent undue concentrations of market power, combat cartels and abuse of market dominance, and pursue other goals that enhance the overall competitive environment in China. However, China’s recent antitrust investigations have triggered widespread backlash among western business circles by involving some world-famous multi-national companies, including Microsoft, Qualcomm, BMW, etc. Some have accused China of using the AML as a weapon to target foreign companies, while others have condemned the AML for the lack of clarity in its provisions and transparency and certainty in enforcement.
To better interpret the AML and the trends in its enforcement, MNCs that have business operations in China should acquire better knowledge on China’s unique socialist market economy and take into consideration procedural issues as to antitrust enforcement in China.

Glen Weyl, Alexander White, Jan 30, 2015
Many of the leading controversies in competition policy in the last two decades, especially those surrounding the Microsoft case, reflect the challenges posed by platform industries. Unfortunately, too often economists and policymakers have drawn the wrong lessons when thinking about such industries. Central to our analysis is a more realistic view of the process of consumer coordination. Platforms often use “usage revenue later” strategies to ensure that consumers coordinate on their platform. This greatly mitigates the possibility of inefficient lock-in or excessive dominance by a leading platform, but it makes inefficient fragmentation a greater danger. Thus regulation, rather than competition policy, may be more appropriate in addressing potential market failures arising in platform industries.

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Kala Anandarajah, Tanya Tang, Dec 31, 2014
Competition laws across Asia have gone beyond infancy and nascent stages and have become laws to be reckoned with. The sheer numbers of Asian countries with competition laws, and the seeming diversity as regards enforcement patterns and application of principles, naturally leads one to question whether the implementation of the laws are truly motivated by competitive forces or whether some other hidden agendas drive the same.
China’s recent probes into Microsoft Corp. and foreign car companies such as Audi and Chrysler, for example, have prompted observers to question if China is using its competition laws to support domestic firms at the expense of foreign companies. According to a recent Reuters article, legal experts point out that the Chinese authorities appear to have wielded the law against more foreign multinationals than local companies; firms targeted include Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. and Danone SA which have been slapped with heavy fines, as well as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc., which faces the prospect of a U.S. $1 billion fine.
The same article noted that this had prompted the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to send a private letter to the U.S Secretaries of State and Treasury to highlight concerns that China’s enforcement of the anti-monopoly law was being used to pursue “China’s industrial policy goals” and promote Chinese producer welfare and advance industries policies that nurture domestic enterprises, instead of the internationally accepted norm of using competition law to protect consumer welfare and competition.
Similar concerns have also been raised regarding the Indonesian competition authority, which had in the mid-2000s issued a string of infringement decisions against the likes of Chevron, Carrefour, Mitsubishi, Pfizer, and Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund.
Amidst such concerns, this article looks at the track record of competition authorities in Asia—namely China, India, and the more active jurisdictions within Southeast Asia, some of which had implemented competition law at the behest of international organizations or pursuant to their obligations under free trade agreements with Western nations—to assess whether economic nationalism or protectionism may be at play. Has competition law in Asia been enforced in line with their stated objectives of protecting the competitive process and encouraging market entry and efficiency for the benefit of consumers, or has it been used as a tool to unfairly target foreign companies and protect domestic companies against foreign competition?

The nation’s top patent court issued a landmark decision last Thursday that declares how patent licensing fees should be determined, reports say.
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declared that those fees should be based on the incremental value of each invention and not the value of the standard as a whole. The ruling also limited the ability to argue that patents are misused to gain higher royalties in some cases.
Reports say the decision was the first by any appeals court.
The ruling was made on technology giant Ericsson’s contribution to industry standard for Wi-Fi, which incorporates more than one thousand patents, according to reports. Those standards are set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which is currently debating changes that could possibly contradict this court ruling.

Reports emerged earlier this week that the Commission was looking into yet more allegations of anticompetitive conduct by the world’s largest search engine, this time regarding Google’s practice of having Android devices come pre-loaded with Google products like Google Maps and Chrome.
”This is very similar to what Microsoft Corp was doing a decade ago,” Volozh said. “They were trying to use dominance in operating systems to promote their Internet Explorer browser and were finally band from doing this. The same is now happening with Android – Google dominates in it and runs practices incompatible with fair competition.”
The Commission is looking into a complaint against Google’s tying practices filed by a group representing technology giants including Microsoft and Nokia Oyj. Reports say the Commission is likely to launch a formal investigation of the matter in the near future.

915,"October 29, 2014","Early Signs of Protectionist Merger Control in Korea? Probably No, At Least Not Yet","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Cecil Saehoon Chung, Kyoung Yeon Kim, Kyu Hyun Kim, Oct 29, 2014
In March 2009, China’s MOFCOM blocked Coca-Cola’s proposed $2.4 billion acquisition of a leading Chinese juice producer, China Huiyuan Juice Group, without much explanation, prompting some commentators to cry foul and protectionism and others to lament China’s missed opportunity to lay a foundation for its merger analysis under the newly enacted Anti-Monopoly Law of 2008. In 2010, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto abandoned their production joint venture proposal in the face of antitrust hurdles from various antitrust agencies including the Korea Fair Trade Commission.
Fast-forward to the end of 2013 when the United States and European Union rather unceremoniously cleared Microsoft’s proposed $7 billion-plus acquisition of Nokia’s handset business. Then, in February 2014, Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission came down with a number of conditions for approving the deal. Shortly thereafter, in April 2014, MOFCOM finally approved the transaction with strings attached. In the meantime, in neighboring Korea, faced with the KFTC’s continuing concerns, Microsoft and Nokia reportedly restructured the transaction in late April 2014 to make it a non-reportable transaction in Korea and promptly consummated it. Unfazed, the KFTC continues its merger investigation of the consummated transaction. As of October 2014, the KFTC is still investigating the already consummated Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia, and discussing potential post-consummation commitment remedies.
In the meantime, in June 2014, China’s MOFCOM sank the P3 Alliance proposal among three global shipping companies, Denmark’s Moller-Maersk, France’s CMA CGM, and Swiss’ Mediterranean Shipping Company. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission cleared the deal in March and the EC cleared the proposed transaction on June 3, 2014, just two weeks before MOFCOM announced its decision. The parties to the transaction promptly called off the deal. This was the only the second time that MOFCOM had completely blocked a merger transaction since the adoption of China’s antitrust statute in 2008.
Reading the compilation of global deals gone busted or almost derailed above, one could see why some observers have voiced concern that antitrust merger enforcement in some parts of the world is showing signs of protectionism. Lately, China is often implied (but not necessarily named specifically by speakers) at conferences as the prime culprit in not just merger but other antitrust enforcement areas. Given the continuing investigation of the already consummated Microsoft-Nokia transaction, some commentators are already claiming, hinting, or will likely opine that Korea’s merger enforcement also smells and looks like a protectionist merger review program at times.
However, hard numbers—the KFTC’s merger enforcement statistics—do not necessarily support the assertion, at least not yet. China’s MOFCOM has been reviewing merger transactions since the country’s enactment of its first antitrust statute, the Anti-Monopoly Law, in 2008. Korea has had a merger control provision, Article 7 of the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, ever since the MRFTA was first enacted in 1980 and became effective in 1981. However, only after its July 2003 adoption of the mandatory “foreign merger” notification program for transactions involving a foreign party with the requisite nexus to Korea did the KFTC really begin the modern era of notification-based merger review. Perhaps it is just a matter of time before a fair number of controversial cases may be criticized as protectionist decisions.
More fundamentally, however, it is not clear whether it is a simple matter to call a jurisdiction’s particular decision a “protectionist decision” simply because the decision blocked a foreign company’s acquisition of a domestic company or another foreign company. After all, each jurisdiction’s antitrust agency’s statutory mandate (if not the only mandate, then still the primary mandate) is to protect competition and consumers within its territorial boundaries. It may just be possible, but easy to forget, that consumers in China, Korea, Taiwan, or any other country are actually quite different from consumers in the United States, European Union (for that matter, consumers in each Member State may be quite unique), Latin America, or anywhere else.
And if it so happens that protecting domestic corporate customers of the foreign merging parties serves to protect the consumers in that particular jurisdiction, then it becomes even more difficult to discern whether the merger enforcement agency is being a protectionist agency. Perhaps, a clarification question should follow. If the term “protectionist” encompasses protecting consumers as opposed to simply protecting domestic industries, then perhaps every single merger enforcement agency may be labeled a protectionist agency. Of course, this is not how the term “protectionist” is supposed to be interpreted. Yet, it shows how the term itself is also susceptible to a self-serving “protectionist” interpretation and misuse.
In this paper, we will review the short but already interesting history of Korean merger control. We offer that what the KFTC does (actually what most jurisdictions do) may not really be any more protectionist than others. Indeed, perhaps it is inherent in merger control although not many people talk about it much. In so doing, we hope to offer an alternative way to explain why antitrust enforcement agencies (or some other or larger parts of the national government) review and decide mergers the way they do, sometimes appearing to be (or indeed they really are, at times) protectionist in the true sense of the word.

She noted that France is working with Germany and other jurisdictions to explore how to reign in the power of what the French call “les GAFAs” – the Googles, Apples, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Tuesday that Google could be facing a monumental competition investigation that would probe the company’s actions in more than just the search market.
As reports emerged that the Commission would not yet settle its years-long investigation into Google for alleged anticompetitive conduct in the way it displays rival search results, Almunia spoke Tuesday to announce that a new case could soon open following several complaints that Google is diverting Internet traffic towards its own services.
Almunia said the case could be bigger than the monster investigation against Microsoft, which lasted 10 years and lead to a $2.8 billion fine.
”We have received complaints on the possible diversion of Internet traffic towards Google services which are not search services, so this is a possible third investigation concerning Google,” the competition chief said at a European Parliament hearing.
Almunia declined to elaborate on the issues, but earlier this year he noted that complaints had been filed against Google accusing the company of leveraging its market dominance to promote Google+ and YouTube, which it owns.
The commissioner is set to leave office at the end of next month, so any new probe will be spearheaded by his successor, Margrethe Vestager.

As critics of China’s antitrust regime have begun to warn that foreign investment would likely dwindle in the nation, reports say the numbers are already showing such effects.
According to the Financial Times, foreign investment in China is at its lowest level in four years thanks to price-fixing and other antitrust investigations that critics say unfairly target foreign companies.
Reports added that investment in the nation dropped to $7.2 billion in August, its lowest level since July 2010. The paper calculated the data itself.
Further, the Financial Times found, investment dropped 14 percent from the same month last year.
According to reports, this is also the first time foreign direct investment fell by more than 10 percent for two months in a row since the 2009 global financial crisis.
Lobbyists, consumer advocated and government representatives have heightened their criticism of Chinese competition policy, arguing that recent investigations into companies like Qualcomm, Microsoft, Chrysler and Audi give the impression that China is unfairly targeting foreign companies to promote its own domestic businesses.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
 Does Google Hold a Dominant Market Position? – Addressing the (Minor) Significance of High Online User Shares – Christian Kersting (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf – Faculty of Law) and Sebastian Dworschak (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf – Faculty of Law)
ABSTRACT: In Germany many observers argue that Google is a dominant undertaking under the competition laws and is therefore potentially able to hinder, discriminate or exploit other market participants. This assumption is mainly based on Google’s high share of users in online searches. Closer examination, however, casts doubt on this assumption. It grossly overestimates the significance of Google’s user share and ignores many additional factors that are relevant to the assessment of Google’s market position: as users may use Google’s service free of charge, it is already questionable if there is a market for online searches for competition law purposes. Even presuming the existence of such a free market, regulatory precedent to-date has held that high shares of users in “markets” for free products or services only have little significance in the assessment of an undertaking’s market position. Furthermore, Google’s high user share in general search is only ephemeral and subject to constant change. As users can switch to a wide range of competitors in the market, such as Microsoft Bing, Yahoo! or specialized search engines like Amazon or eBay, with ease, Google is forced to re-invent itself on a daily basis in order to maintain its user share. Taking also into account the absence of direct network effects and the enormous pressure to innovate in this market, the authors finally conclude that Google is not dominant under the competition laws.

Overview of Current Antitrust Enforcement in Korea – Hwang Lee (Korea University School of Law; Deputy Director, ICR Law Center)
Antitrust enforcement in Korea has witnessed many changes in the past year since a new political leadership took place as a result of the December 2012 presidential election. Ever since the 2008 global financial crisis, Korea has experienced economic difficulties similar to most other economies in the world. Korea’s difficulties were considered more troubling because they dramatically exacerbated many of its existing problems. Experts have been concerned with Korea’s loss of potential economic growth momentum in two aspects: limitations of existing growth strategies and economic and social bi-polarization. The new administration has tried to solve these issues by emphasizing the so-called “creative economy” as a key economic policy and by taking measures to protect small and medium sized firms (the “SMEs”). As Korean competition policies were mandated to play a major role for this latter goal, it seems to have dominated Korean competition policy for the last one and a half years.
As widely known, Korean competition policy is composed of two large blocks: on one hand, there are the traditional antitrust policies that pay attention to the creation and maintenance of market power in the context of market competition; and on the other, fair trade p...

923,"September 7, 2014",China: State media dismisses foreign criticism of antitrust bias,"
China’s state run news agency has rejected concerns raised in recent weeks by foreign companies accusing Chinese antitrust officials of unfairly targeting foreign companies to boost domestic businesses.
According to reports, the Xinhua News Agency says that recent competition probes into Microsoft and GlaxoSmithKline have “nothing to do with where they are from.”
The commentary was unsigned, reports say.
”Some people say the Chinese market, once the hottest growth market for Western firms, is getting chillier. It might be so, but only for those law-breaking ones, be they foreign or homegrown,” the article said.
The defense came in response to recent complaints by several US companies and lobbyists that Chinese competition officials are unfairly targeting foreign firms. Claims of bias have lead overseas companies to rethink their strategy in China, and some experts warn that the concern could lead to lessened foreign investment in the country.
In response to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 60 percent of respondents said they felt foreign businesses are now less welcome in China than they were before.

Antitrust Regulation of IPRS – China’s First Proposal – Adrian Emch (Hogan Lovells) & Liyang Hou (KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University)1
Introduction
On June 11, 2014, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) published the Regulation on the Prohibition of Conduct Eliminating or Restricting Competition by Abusing Intellectual Property Rights (Consultation Draft) (draft SAIC IPR Regulation)2 This will be the first regulation dealing with the application of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law3 (AML) to the intellectual property rights (IPRs) domain. The draft SAIC IPR Regulation is expected to be formally adopted later in 2014.
Even though it has yet to be enacted in final form, the draft SAIC IPR Regulation has already received waves of reactions from stakeholders.4 As it is the first time in history that China attempts to regulate IPRs through antitrust enforcement, it is natural to hear comments such as that the draft regulation may be overreaching or that it appears to “discourage innovation.”5 In our view, while the draft SAIC IPR Regulation is about IPRs and hence about innovation, it is itself as cautious as it is conservative. After close to five years of researching, drafting and consultations, the draft regulation reflects a compromise – i.e., mixing both foreign and domestic elements and reconciling various interests.

Following the official completion of the sale of the NBA Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, reports say the saga for Sterling is not yet over.
The NBA has reportedly file a counter-suit against Sterling’s $1 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NBA’s commissioner Adam Silver.
Reports say the counterclaim is seeking damages related to Sterling’s reportedly racist remarks, revealed through secret recordings that initiated the process of banning Sterling from the NBA and selling the Clippers. Those remarks, the NBA said, caused “devastating and incalculable harm” to the association.
The NBA’s countersuit was filed in Los Angeles against Donald Sterling and the Sterling Family Trust on Monday.

According to reports, China News Service said Zhang Xinzhu was dismissed as an antitrust consultant to China’s State Council. While reports did not cite sources of the news, Zhang told reporters he was fired for defending foreign companies.
In an interview, the antitrust advisor also said that antitrust regulation in the country has reached a dead end.
The State Council did not respond to requests for comment.
The reported firing follows emerging trends from China of increasing antitrust scrutiny of overseas companies. Most recently, the nation’s National Development and Reform Commission is in the midst of an in-depth investigation of foreign automakers and car parts manufacturers and chip makers and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce has been in news over its investigation of Microsoft.

As South Korean officials review Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s handset operations, reports say earlier predictions that the rest of the Nokia business will evolve into a patent troll are likely to come true.
According to one unnamed official at Samsung, Nokia has been demanding high patent licensing fees from its rivals; another unnamed source echoed the sentiment, telling reporters that “Nokia has recently been demanding that Samsung and LG Electronics pay a large amount of patent fees.”
The official at Samsung confirmed that the company is now negotiating with Nokia over its “large sum of patent royalties” it demanded of Samsung.
According to reports, experts had predicted that Finland-based Nokia would likely become a patent troll, also known as a Non-Practicing Entity, and gear its business towards making money through the intellectual property rights it owns, especially after it divested its handset operations to Microsoft for $7.2 billion last year.
As part of that takeover, Microsoft reportedly allowed Nokia to retain its patent rights for the next 10 years without actually making any mobile phones.
The majority of Nokia’s smartphone patents, say reports, are standard essential.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission was earlier asked by a smaller electronics firm to investigate the deal based on fears that patent licensing fees would rise following the transaction. Now, say reports, the industry is calling for the KFTC to demand concessions from Nokia is exchange for approving the merger, and that those concessions involve stricter conditions on Nokia’s patent licensing practices. The merger review is ongoing.

930,"July 18, 2014",US/EU: Android class action suit could have huge implications in Europe,"
A class action lawsuit filed in the US that accuses Google of unfairly monopolizing space on Android smartphones could have wide implications in Europe as Google rivals continue to fight the search giant’s dominance.
The lawsuit filed in May says Google unfairly forces smartphone manufacturers to preload Google apps on Android phones. If the lawsuit proceeds, reports say the case could crack open a trove of hidden Google emails and contracts with smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics.
Google motioned to have the case dismissed earlier this month on grounds that even with Google-owned applications preloaded on phones, consumers can still use and download competing applications.
But if the case continues, reports say Google rivals could use revelations from the case to fight Google overseas.
Google continues to face criticism by consumer advocates, rival tech companies and competition regulators in the EU as the European Commission gears up to settle with Google to close a separate case. European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has assured opponents of the settlement that Google will continue to face intense scrutiny and new investigations by EU competition authorities.
While Microsoft is not a plaintiff in the case in the US, it is among several Google competitors that filed complaints with the European Commission last year over similar issues. The Commission is still debating whether to open a formal investigation based on that complaint.

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was banned from the NBA for leaked audio of his alleged racist rants, gave an off-color and bizarre performance in court on Wednesday as he took the witness stand to challenge his wife Shelly Sterling’s authority to sell the team.
The NBA had reportedly reached a deal with Shelly to sell the Clippers after Sterling threatened to sue the NBA for antitrust violations through a forced sale. Shelly reached a deal to sell the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after two doctors found Sterling to be mentally incapable of acting as an administrator of the Sterling Family Trust, which is the current owner of the basketball team.
Sterling made a bizarre outburst on the stand, reports say, vowing to sue the NBA until death.
”Make no mistake today. I will never, ever sell this team, and until I die I will be suing the NBA for this terrible violation under antitrust.”
If the sale is not finalized by September 15, reports say, the NBA could seize the Clippers and put the team up for auction.

932,"July 9, 2014",EU: Yelp joins the anti-Google battle,"
Online review service Yelp has reportedly filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the EU, compounding troubles for the search giant as authorities ready to end a years-long case against the firm.
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has repeatedly expressed that he is looking to settle an antitrust case against Google that has so far lasted for about four years, first beginning when Google rivals complained of its anticompetitive practices when displaying search results. But those rivals continue to fight against a proposed settlement; Microsoft and the European Consumer Organization have already challenged the settlement deal.
Now, reports say, Yelp has joined in that challenge. Those displeased with the settlement offer say that the concessions, which include a paid box spot at the top of Google search results to display rivals’ products, is in a dead spot on the page, and could actually worsen Google’s anticompetitive hold against competitors.
According to an unnamed source, Yelp suggests that instead of Google’s proposal to include a box with rival search results, the company should entirely overhaul its algorithms to not favor Google-owned products when displaying results.
The European Commission’s suggested closure of the case has earned significant backlash, even within the Commission itself, reports say.
Almunia is reported to have made efforts to convince the Commissioners to approve of the settlement, and sent a letter last month arguing that this particular case should be close because Google is sure to face no shortage of additional competition probes in the future.
Almunia is set to exit his post as head of competition policy in the EU later this year.

Let’s Talk About Android – Observations on Competition in the Field of Mobile Operating  – Torsten Koerber (Georg-August-Universität)
ABSTRACT: The paper examines whether the royalty-free distribution of the Android OS and the Google Mobile Applications Suite (GMS) is in line with competition law, in particular with Article 102 TFEU.
The author takes a look at Google’s business model and at the contractual framework of Android mobile OS and GMS licensing. He assesses market definition and competition on the markets for mobile OS and mobile apps.Then he turns to the crucial question of abuse of market power. Frist, he analyses whether royalty-free licensing of open source software can constitute a price-based exclusionary conduct or even predatory pricing in a two- or multisided environment. Then he turns to the question whether licensing all Google apps in a single suite of apps (GMS) constitutes an anti-competitive tying practice or creates pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits.
Throughout the paper the author compares the particularities of competition in the “new” mobile ecosystems to the “old” world of client PC operating systems that formed the background of the Microsoft tying cases.

As Europe launches an investigation into several member states and several major conglomerates about their tax relationship, reports say the probe has widened to include Amazon and its operations in Luxembourg.
Last June, the European Commission launched an investigation into Apple and its relationship with Ireland. The probe is looking at whether tax breaks offered by the nation give companies and unfair advantage or violate state aid rules.
Following that investigation launch, reports emerged that the Commission was also looking into Starbucks’ operations in the Netherlands and Fiat Finance and Trade’s operations in Luxembourg for similar reasons
While reports say the Commission is focused on the companies’ relationships with these nations, and not just the companies themselves, the firms could be burdened with fines or other sanctions should the Commission find that these tax practices distort competition across the EU.
Reports emerged late last week that Luxembourg’s relationship with Microsoft and McDonald’s was also in question.
As the European Commission’s competition arm is set for an overhaul following the departure of EU Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, experts are questioning the future of EU competition enforcement. Almunia is widely seen as having introduced an era of activism within the authority, as the competition watchdog uses its antitrust powers for cases that are not solely competition-related – such a companies’ tax relationships with EU nations.

Donald Sterling is giving the NBA a headache with his decision to revoke his agreement to the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers and pursue a $1 billion antitrust lawsuit against the association just days after he withdrew the suit.
According to reports, while Sterling agreed last week to drop the antitrust lawsuit, filed on the basis that the NBA unfairly forced a sale of the Clippers after leaked audio of Sterling’s allegedly racist rant, he has changed his mind because the NBA failed to un-do its $2.5 million fine and lifetime NBA ban lodged against Sterling in the wake of the leak.
Reports say Sterling agreed to drop the lawsuit, which some antitrust experts have criticized as bizarre, because he understood that the NBA’s sanctions were to be withdrawn.
Sterling’s wife Shelly Sterling reached an agreement to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion in efforts to avoid a forced sale by the NBA. That fact has confounded competition experts, some of whom say Sterling does not have a solid antitrust case against the NBA.
Representatives for the NBA and Shelly Sterling declined to comment on the matter.

CPI Asia Column edited by Vanessa Zhang (Global Economics Group) presents:
Merger Control in China: Understanding MOFCOM’s Unique Approach – Sébastien J. Evrard  & Baohui Zhang* (Jones Day)
Almost 15 years ago, the European Commission decided to block the merger between GE and Honeywell, which had been cleared by the US Department of Justice and a number of other jurisdictions. This decision unleashed a firestorm of criticism.1 Since then, the enforcement of merger control provisions on both sides of the Atlantic has been – by and large – consistent.2
As merger control enforcement in the US and EU was converging, China developed as a third major antitrust jurisdiction.3 The Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”) came into force in 2008 and its enforcement frequently makes the headlines.4 On the merger control side, MOFCOM does not hesitate to take decisions in global transactions that are not consistent with those taken by other antitrust enforcers.5
MOFCOM’s unique approach in some global transaction has not resulted in the same level of criticism as what the European Commission had to endure in the wake of GE/Honeywell. This could be because the additional remedies imposed were not perceived by the parties as onerous enough to complain publicly. This could also be because of the recognition that MOFCOM is a relatively new enforcer and is therefore going through a learning curve.

942,"June 1, 2014",US: Sterling sues the NBA in bizarre twist,"
The disgraced former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA over the basketball association’s decision to force a sale of the team.
Donald Sterling was forced to sell the Clippers and pay a $2.5 million fine after reports emerged of his alleged racist remarks. Sterling soon hired high-profile antitrust lawyer Maxwell Blecher, prompting rumor of an antitrust lawsuit headed the NBA’s way.
Now, reports say, just minutes before the NBA announced it reached a settlement with Sterling’s wife and Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling to sell the team, Sterling announced last Friday he is suing the NBA, its Commissioner Adam Silver, and the Sterling Family Trust, seeking $1 billion in damages.
According to reports, the lawsuit challenges the NBA’s handling of the matter, including its decision to ban Sterling for life from the association. The complaint claims the NBA’s basis for its actions against Sterling – secret recordings of the alleged racist remarks made by the Clippers owner – were a breach of privacy.
But experts are slamming the lawsuit, saying it has no basis in antitrust. The NBA had originally ruled that Sterling must sell the Clippers, but the rights to the team were fully handed over to his wife, who reached an agreement to sell the team; those events mean the NBA did not impose a forced sale on Donald Sterling.
NBA general counsel Rick Buchanan told reporters that Sterling’s lawsuit is “predictable, but entirely baseless.”
The news of the lawsuit came the same day reports emerged that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer reached a deal to acquire the Clippers team for $2 billion, a record in NBA team sales, reports say.
Experts have slammed Sterling’s lawsuit as quite bizarre. One expert, Tulane University sports law program director Gabe Feldman, told reporters he wished he “could find a word to describe how strange it is. We’ve gone from uncharted territory to ludicrous territory at this point.”

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia was on the defense this week following a new wave of criticism over his decision to settle with Google, which ahd been probed for years by the Commission for allegations of abuse of dominance.
According to reports, Almunia said the case will be concluded in the “weeks after the summer break” and that, despite skepticism over the action taken to prevent Google from abusing its market position, “I’m pretty sure of my arguments,” he said.
The investigation was first launched in 2010 over claims Google unfairly prioritized its own services and advertisements in search results. A similar case was also settled in the US without any fines issued upon Google.
Almunia announced a settlement with Google last February and immediately was hit with criticism from top Google rivals like Microsoft. Even other European Commissioners voiced concern that he had announced plans to settle without first consulting with the rest of the regulatory body; the Commissioners also need to agree to settle before the deal becomes official.
Earlier this week, reports from France emerged that said various media companies throughout Europe plan to file a lawsuit against Google because they also found Almunia’s settlement deal to in insufficient at addressing Google’s market power.
The Commission confirmed Thursday that the companies that reportedly threatened a lawsuit, all part of the Open Internet Project, have filed a formal complaint against Google with the Commission.

946,"April 8, 2014","US: Patent battle between iPhone, Motorola Mobility back from the dead","
A feud between Apple and Google over standard mobile phone patent royalties could be back from the dead as Apple has reportedly asked an appeals court to revive the case nearly four years after it began.
Legal representatives for Apple approached the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington on Tuesday to request a new look at the case, which accuses Google of charging unfair royalties for its patent licensing in violation of FRAND agreements.
According to reports, Google-owned Motorola charged 2.25 percent of an iPhone sale price – about $12 – for its technology, while Apple refused to pay any more than $1 per iPhone.
A scheduled trial to determine the royalty fees was tossed after Apple made that refusal.
The two companies have been feuding over patents since October 2010, say reports; additional litigation is currently pending in Miami, and a separate patent case was tossed in Chicago after Circuit Judge Richard Posner rejected Apple’s and Microsoft’s damage claims. The Federal Circuit heard arguments regarding the Chicago case last September.
The breadth of patent litigation between the enemy technology giants earned criticism from Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore. “I don’t understand what any of you are doing,” she reportedly told the companies. “Why are you suing each other in 15 different courts? I don’t think even you can keep track of which patent is in which court.”

947,"March 24, 2014",US: Silicon Valley no-poaching collusion goes deeper than previously thought,"
Reports say anticompetitive agreements made between Silicon Valley rivals including Apple and Google may have been more widespread than previously thought.
More than 60,000 tech workers are suing the companies, as well as Intel, Pixar, Adobe and Induit, over allegations the companies made illegal agreements not to hire each others’ employees. The US Department of Justice investigated similar claims of no-solicitation contracts, eventually settling the matter in 2010.
But with the recently-filed lawsuit, the claims have been revisited.
Some reports have revealed secret internal memos from Google and Apple that demonstrate such hiring agreements may have spanned over several years; the reports claim the documentation shows Apple’s Steve Jobs and Google’s Eric Schmidt formed a non-poaching agreement cartel that involved dozens of other companies, including Dell, Microsoft, Paypal, Comcast and more.
Reports say the memos date back to 2005. One of the documents reportedly shows Schmidt admitting to Google “driving up salaries across the board.”
The trial, given the go-ahead by a judge last January, is scheduled to begin May 27. The plaintiffs accuse the company an “overarching conspiracy” to strike illegal hiring agreements that have been found to be nearly identical to each other; the defendants have previously claimed those contract similarities are merely coincidence.
The revelations follow the unsealing of court filings that show Facebook declined to partake in such anti-poaching agreements, according to reports.
According to court documents, Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg was approached by Google telling her to “lower the rate” Facebook hires Google employees. Facebook declined, however, a move that has now made Facebook a star witness in the case, rather than a defendant.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Essential Facilities Doctrine: The Lost Message of Terminal Railroad –  Stephen M. Maurer (University of California, Berkeley) and Suzanne Scotchmer (University of California – Department of Economics ; School of Law, University of California, Berkeley ; National Bureau of Economic Research)
ABSTRACT: The growing importance of shared networks, shared platforms and shared standards leads to a renewed discussion of the essential facilities doctrine of antitrust. This is an area where European law and American law have diverged. In Trinko (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court came close to abolishing it. At the same time, it was reinvigorated by the European Commission, which asserted it successfully in E.C. v. Microsoft, and then, facing criticism, clarified the doctrine in a Guidance document.
We harmonize the main cases around the doctrine’s original but often forgotten purpose namely, harvesting economic synergies through sharing. We argue that, absent such a doctrine, these synergies could be lost as firms either avoid sharing to avoid antitrust liability, or create sharing arrangements that undermine competition. We show how and why the original purpose of the doctrine has become entangled with other antitrust issues, in particular, leveraging. We systematize the sharing rules that have been imposed or allowed, with an emphasis on how to harvest synergies while mitigating any harm to competition.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia was on the defensive to MEPs this week as he justified his decision to settle with Google after a three-year investigation into the company’s search practices, say reports.
Almunia does not appear to be backing down from the settlement, despite receiving heavy criticism from fellow Commissioners, consumer groups and Google rivals over the deal.
Seven months after Almunia signaled an end to the case, reports say the competition watchdog has sent a note to MEPs that told lawmakers “Google has made far-reaching concessions as to the presentation of rivals on its page.”
Reports also say that the Commission is set to send pre-rejection letters to companies that filed complaints against Google with authorities; 18 companies filed such complaints, including Microsoft.
Google has been under watch by EU regulators and competition watchdogs throughout the globe for the way the company displays rivals’ search results, among other practices, with concern raised over allegations the company is abusing its dominant online search market position. A similar case also lead to a settlement between US authorities and Google; the company is now under scrutiny from the Competition Commission of India and is facing a fine of up to $5 billion as reports note that Google does not have the option to settle under Indian law in this case.

Despite last year’s final report on technology gadget pricing in Australia that called for an investigation into the industry’s state of competition, reports say the planned probe is unlikely to lead to any reforms.
The government confirmed plans to probe tech prices eight months after the parliamentary report was released. The report was part of efforts that questioned multinational technology giants, including Apple and Microsoft, as to why some services and products were more expensive in Australia than in the US.
That report called for competition and copyright reforms aimed at lowering costs for companies importing products from overseas.
Now, while federal officials said they will launch a formal investigation into the matter, some industry experts say consumers should be wary about expecting any price decreases due to the political climate surrounding trade with Australia.

As Comcast remains at the top of the headlines for its recently announced plans of acquiring Time Warner Cable, the nation’s top cable company is facing a new dilemma, this time in the auto industry.
Reports say Comcast is rivaling General Motors to acquire crucial radio waves that could either be used for Web data wi-fi or for communications technology in high-technology cars.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced earlier this month that legislation for “talking” cars will be written before the end of President Obama’s term. That announcement, say reports, sparked a rivalry between the cable and auto industries; General Motors says the spectrum that can be used for life-saving car communications technology should take precedence over expanded wireless and web data services.
But Comcast, along with other technology giants like Google and Microsoft, claim such technology is a long-shot this early, and are now pushing for the Federal Communications Commission to allow the tech firms access to the spectrum.

956,"February 12, 2014",Determining the FRAND Rate: U.S. Perspectives on Huawei v. InterDigital,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Fei Deng, Su Sun, Feb 11, 2014
Standards have become part of our life in this world of rapid technological progress. Antitrust policy makers and practitioners have long realized the important benefits standards bring to social welfare: higher product quality and lower costs for manufacturers that result from the widespread adoption of advanced technologies and the benefits from network externalities and scale economies. However, in recent years, developments in technology licensing involving standard essential patents have drawn many into heated discussions as to whether owners of SEPs who, as members of the relevant standard-setting organization, promised to license their SEPs on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms may have abused the market power they possess simply by virtue of their technologies being included in the standard, and whether the rates they seek are inconsistent with their FRAND obligations.
Antitrust enforcement agencies in the United States and in the European Union have shown great concern over licensing practices of SEP owners with FRAND obligations. A general consensus seems to have emerged that SEP owners should be limited by their FRAND commitments, and that seeking injunctions against willing licensees may be considered an antitrust violation. In several cases, putative licensees have requested that a court determine the FRAND rate and assess whether the SEP owner behaved inconsistently with its FRAND obligations.
As the world economy has become increasingly integrated, and intellectual property rights are more strongly enforced in jurisdictions around the world, global technology licensing has become more common. Inevitably, disputes regarding royalty rates and other terms in patent licensing are rising quickly. Although the United States and the European Union remain the major jurisdictions where licensing disputes are adjudicated, other jurisdictions are emerging as new potential forums for parties to consider strategically. For example, the patent war between Apple and Samsung has reached the courts in South Korea, and the Competition Commission of India is investigating Ericsson for allegedly charging Indian companies high royalty rates that violated the company’s FRAND commitments.
But perhaps the most significant emerging jurisdiction for SEP and FRAND disputes is China. On February 4, 2013, the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court in Guangdong province in China issued a decision that determined a FRAND rate for InterDigital’s SEPs in Huawei v. InterDigital, several months before a U.S. court ruled on FRAND rates for the first time in Microsoft v. Motorola.

957,"February 5, 2014",EU: What the Google settlement means for online searches,"
As news emerged this week that the European Commission has approved of Google’s third round of concessions offered to quell competition concerns, details are being reported about what the end of the three-year probe will mean for online searches in the EU.
Organic search
According to reports, the settlement offered by Google means the company will have to give equal weight to at least three of its rivals when displaying search results on services such as travel and restaurants.
For example, when displaying restaurant reviews from its Zagat rating service, it will also have to promote restaurant reviews from rival review websites.
The agreement was approved by Commission in efforts to level the online search playing firled for rivals like Yelp, Microsoft, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor when consumers search for flights, hotels and other services.
Advertising
Reports also note that Google has made concessions in the agreements it makes with advertisers whose campaigns appear on search result lists.
Rivals had complained to EU regulators that Google makes exclusive agreements with publishers and that it restricts advertisers’’ ability to switch to Google’s rivals.
Reports say Google has removed those restrictions as part of its offer.
Rivals react
Despite European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s assurance that the concessions are a vast improvement upon Google’s last two offers, rivals criticize the settlement and the EU’s acceptance of it as the Commission decided not to market test the concessions or consult with complainants before clearing the deal.
Following Google’s offer, FairSearch Europe, which represents Expedia, Microsoft and other Google rivals, slammed the concessions as “worse than doing nothing.”
”These proposed commitments have not been subjected to any form of consultation, although it was thanks to market testing of industry participants that the Commission had condemned two previous packages of proposed commitments as fatally flawed,” the group said.
FairSearch said it needs to review the offer in full, but its concerned for several aspects of the settlement, including Google’s policy of requiring rivals to bid for having their search results displayed.

958,"February 5, 2014",EU: Commission unveils Google progress,"
Confirming earlier reports, European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia released a statement early Wednesday confirming progress made with Google and the antitrust case regarding how Google displays rival search results.
According to reports, Google’s third round of concessions to settle the matter are considered a vast improvement by the Commission in addressing competition concerns, effectively settling the dispute. Almunia announced Wednesday he would accept the proposals.
In a statement, Almunia said he believes “the new proposal obtained from Google after long and difficult talks can now address the Commission’s concerns.”
With the acceptance of the settlement offer – Google’s third attempt to settle competition concerns – Google will avoid fines that could have reached up to $5 billion.
The offer
The search giant’s offer reportedly includes displaying rivals’ logos and URL links in a prominent display when search results show up. Further, say reports, Internet content providers will be able to choose which Google material to use for its services.
Google is also said to be planning to end restrictions on advertisers’ ability to move campaigns to rival search engines.
Google holds a 75 percent share of the search engine market in Europe, consultancy firm comScore reports.
Rival input
Update: The most recent reports say Almunia has confirmed he will accept Google’s third proposal without third-party input. But the Commission’s decision not to consult rivals who lodged original complaints sparked fury among critics.
A representative for Microsoft-backed lobbyist ICOMP responded to the news by saying accepting the offer without consulting competitors is like “having the wool pulled over [Almunia’s] eyes.”
A second probe
While Google may be able to avoid a fine and end this investigation with the European Commission, the company is facing yet another probe by EU authorities regarding its Android smartphone operating system. The Commission launched an investigation regarding allegations Google anticompetitively diverts smartphone Internet traffic to its search engine.
Microsoft-backed lobbyist group FairSearch is among the complainants.

The powerhouse group of patent-owning tech firms known as the Rockstar Consortium has reportedly resolved at least one of its conflicts with rival companies over patent infringement, say reports.
The Consortium, made up of Apple, Microsoft, Sony, Ericsson and BlackBerry, has reportedly dropped its patent infringement case against China-based telco Huawei, though the mutual decision to dismiss the case did not lead to a public settlement.
The Rockstar Consortium acquired $4.4 billion worth of Nortel technology patents in an auction which it then used to file infringement cases against Huawei and others last October. According to reports, the dispute sprouted when the Nortel patent portfolio was up for grabs in 2011 when the Canadian telco went bankrupt.
Among the competitors for the portfolio was Google, which eventually went on to acquire Motorola Mobility and its patents for $12.5 billion.
Rockstar also sued Google for patent infringement, a case that is still unresolved respite the apparent settlement with Huawei. Reports say the Consortium is suing Google for infringing upon seven patents regarding technology that relates Internet searches to advertisements.
Google has since fild a counterclaim against the group.

Thanks to corporate collusion, the European Union has reportedly earned a record amount of fines issued by regulators in what some reports say is the upside to cartel behavior.
The EU saw a record-setting year in 2013 for antitrust fines amounting to $2.5 billion in fines. In comparison, the US saw $1.02 billion in fines, and Chinese regulators collected $242 million. The figures were curated by law firm Allen & Overy.
Reports say the fines sanctioned y the European Commission get re-circulated into the European Union’s budget; this is good news for authorities who have been forced to scale back financial spending following complaints by the UK, Brussels and other EU members.
The largest fines for the Commission stemmed from its widespread probe into six major financial groups for LIBOR and Euribor benchmark manipulation – a scandal that hit Deutsche Bank, RBS, JP Morgan Chase and others, leading to $2.32 billion in penalties.
Last March, Microsoft was hit with a $731 million fine for breaching an earlier agreement to allow users to choose Internet browsers.
Looking ahead, the global auto parts price-fixing probe, also focused within the US and Asia, will likely yield significant fines for the EU, say reports.

As the two companies engage in legal battles regarding smartphone patent licensing, sources say the companies my look to reach a joint settlement on the feuds as soon as early January.
The two companies initiated a similar process last year, but 17 hours of discussion failed to lead to an agreement.
Now reports say the companies are willing to try again as they look to settle disputes over royalties paid to each other for use of their smartphone patents.

According to reports, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, as well as US and EU authorities, are all working with the firms to work out a potential deal.
Google sues Rockstar group
As Samsung and Apple are rumored to be making peace in the patent wars, Google is reportedly taking a different route.
Reports say Google has filed a lawsuit against patent group Rockstar, which is run by Microsoft, Apple, Blackberry and other smartphone makers, as Google looks to get legal clearance to use seven Rockstar patents.
Google filed the case in California late last month in efforts to have a judge declare non-infringement on the patents, which Rockstar claims are in licensing violation by Google’s smartphone Android operating system.
The Rockstar group, also owned by EMC, Ericsson and Sony, has risen concerns before; the American Antitrust Institute recently sent a letter to the US Department of Justice regarding the group, questioning the validity of such “horizontal collaboration” between the firms.

963,"December 9, 2013",EU: Almunia not satisfied with Samsung patent litigation offer,"
Samsung’s offer to not bring rivals to court over patent infringement over the next five years is an unsatisfactory offer to European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, the regulator said Monday in a speech.
Samsung will likely have to offer more to end the Commission’s probe into the world’s top smartphone manufacturer, and whether the company’s infringed competition rules in taking rivals to court over patent disputes.
In addition to the five-year offer, Samsung proposed to discuss licensing fees with its rivals for one year, and to let a court settle patent disputes should those discussions lead to a disagreement.
Almunia told reporters that rivals’ feedback will be considered, suggesting the response from Samsung competitors has been less than positive, though he did not elaborate.
The investigation into Samsung overlaps as Samsung and rival Apple take each other to court over disputes over their smartphone patents; cases in more than 10 nations around the globe have been filed.
Almunia offered a speech in Paris Monday to discuss the role of patents – and, more broadly, intellectual property – in EU competition policy, announcing that he does not agree with the view that competition regulation and the IP community have “misaligned objectives.”
In mentioning Samsung in his speech, Almunia noted that the company’s offers have been market-tested, but need improvements. The competition chief also touched upon Google’s Motorola buyout and Microsoft’s recently-approved acquisition of Nokia, and how those mergers will impact patent litigation, though said that Nokia’s plans to keep its patent portfolio – seen as a threat that Nokia may charge more to license those patents – fall outside the Commission’s jurisdiction of merger reviews. Still, the regulator warned Nokia not to turn into a patent troll.

HTC’s flagship the HTC One may soon fall as well, though HTC vowed to appeal the ruling.
The case is more good news for Nokia, which recently got clearance to sell its handset business to Microsoft.
Nokia is also challenging HTC’s use of the patent in six other nations, reports say, as global patent wars challenging rivals for the use of standard-essential patents shows no sign of slowing.

Germany’s largest IT firm SAP, however, has rejected such an idea, saying the move would threaten competition and innovation.
”A merger between some European IT companies with the aim of drawing a line between them and the rest of the global market does not make any sense,” SAP co-chief executive Jim Hagemann said Wednesday.
The problem, he said, is that IT is a global industry that cannot be concentrated in one geographical area to combat another.
But some politicians who favor the idea say IT firms including Merkel would allow the EU to be less dependent on US dominating tech groups including Google and Microsoft.

As interaction between the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) and intellectual property right (IPR) becomes center of debates worldwide, China has also geared up in the AML enforcement involving IPR. No matter private litigation or agency investigation, people would like to understand the nuts and bolts of how Chinese authorities take charge of the cases. In this month’s Asia Column, we have an insightful article which sheds some light on this issue. Enjoy reading and have a nice holiday season!
Summary
The recent rulings of the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court and the Guangdong Higher People’s Court in Huawei v. InterDigital addressed several important issues at the crossroads between antitrust law and intellectual property in China in respect of standards essential patents (SEPs).
On the issue of how the holders of standards essential patents can enforce their rights, it appears from this case that the Chinese courts share similar competition concerns with regulators and courts in developed jurisdictions such as the US and EU.
However, a China-specific consideration may impact the courts decisions in relation to SEP cases: the encouragement of indigeno...

967,"December 2, 2013",US: Googleâ€™s patent grab exponentially ballooned in last decade,"
Google has been vocal in recent years regarding the acquisition of patents, a practice the conglomerate deems as one riddled with low-quality tech patents mainly acquired to harm innovation and used as a weapon against tech firms in court.
But according to data compiled by the US Patent & Trademark office, Google is stockpiling patents at an alarming rate – about 10 patents every day, according to the numbers.
That’s compared with 2003, a year in which Google was awarded just four patents in total.
Reports say the company is set to have gained 1,800 patents to its portfolio this year. The move is likely part of a strategic defense for its smartphone operating system Android as it faces legal challenges in court over patent infringement. Both Google and Samsung, for example, were sued last month by a company representing Microsoft and Apple for patent infringement.
But while Google continues to nab up technology patents, the company publically slams patent litigation as a legal technique that ends up inflating prices on tech gadgets for consumers. Top Google layer David Drummond described many smartphone patents as “largely questionable” and “dubious” on the company’s official blog.
The practice of patent trolling has come under fire as of late within the antitrust community as regulators, lawyers and experts debate how to handle such excess litigation in which companies acquire such technology patents for the sole purpose of suing others that use them, as they are often necessary to build a device.

Nov 27, 2013

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) presents:
Selected Issues Raised by Recent Cartel Fines Decisions by Antoine Winckler and François Charles Laprévote*
 
Intro by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International)
This issue of the Europe Column focuses on antitrust fines, the cornerstone of public enforcement under EU competition law. Antoine Winckler and François Charles Laprévote (Cleary Gottlieb) shed light on the evolution of the EU cartel fining system in light of the Commission’s decisional practice and some interesting judgments of the EU Courts. The article comments on the trend to extend parental liabilty for infringments committed by their subsidiaries including full-function joint ventures. This trend may call into question the inclusion of captive sales, in cases of vertically integrated groups, into the calcultion of the basic value of the fine. The interaction between the two practices is not yet settled in the case law. However, a case-by-case analysis based on an “effects-based” approach may all the more be justified in this regard. The article also reflects on the important issue of judicial scrutiny of antitrust fines post-Menarini. Recent case law not only confirms the EU Courts’ full jurisdiction to review such fines (as to questions of both law and facts) but is also critical of the Commission’s unrestricted jurisdiction in setting the actual amount of fines. In view of the latest de...

969,"November 10, 2013",US/EU: Apple scores double win against Google,"
Apple received two favorable court decisions, one in Germany and one at the US International Trade Commission, last Friday in its longstanding battle with rival Google and the use of standard essential patents.
Reports say Apple was granted a stay in Germany that suspends a current lawsuit in which Google is seeking royalty claims against Apple and Microsoft for use of patents Google acquired. Apple requested a stay, now granted by Judge Andreas Voss, pending the outcome of a current probe by the European Commission into the matter.
The Commission is examining Google’s use of SEPs to earn royalties from its rivals; in this particular case, Google is leveraging patents acquired through its buyout of Motorola Mobility against both Apple and Microsoft.
The defendants argue that Google’s demands for its rivals to use such patents do not fall under the fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory rule.
In the same day, Apple heard favorable news by the International Trade Commission, which denied Friday Motorola Mobility’s request to rehear a previous decision in favor of Apple regarding SEPs.
Both Motorola Mobility and Apple had filed counter claims against each other seeking ITC import bans on products that violated each other’s essential patents; both cases were dismissed by Judge Richard Posner in June of last year.
Apple, however, won an appeal last August that reversed the ITC’s decision on two of the three patents regarding Apple’s touchscreen. Google had requested a rehearing of that decision, which was denied.
Further, this week will mark the continuation of ongoing litigation between Apple and rival smartphone maker Samsung over patents; Apple previously won a $1 billion settlement related to SEP infringement, say reports.

970,"November 3, 2013",US: Tech giants go to war over Android patents,"
A group of tech conglomerates self-proclaimed as the “Rockstar Consortium” filed a lawsuit late last week against several rivals, including Google and Samsung, over accusations of patent infringement regarding Android-related patents.
Reports say the lawsuit was filed by the consortium made up of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Sony and others against companies that offer Android products, including HTC, Huawei, LG, Samsung, ZTE, Pantech and Asus.
The defendants are accused of infringing on patents owned by Rockstar, acquired from Nortel in 2011 for $4.5 billion, beating out rival bidder Google. The patents reportedly cover 4G data networking, wireless, Internet and other portfolios for mobile devices.
The patent lawsuit comes about six months after Google submitted comments to the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns the company has for so-called patent trolls, which are companies that acquire patents for the sole purpose of launching lawsuits against companies that infringe on those patents, usually essential to the function of various products.

The Supreme Court of Canada is set to announce rulings of antitrust class actions on Thursday, according to reports.
The Court decided in December 2011 to hear appeals whose decisions will decide whether indirect purchasers have a class action remedy under Canadian law; the BC Court of Appeal ruled in twin cases that class actions were not available to such purchasers, which buy products after the initial purchase from a company involved in anticompetitive conduct.
Reports say the BC Court of Appeal’s ruling was adopted from the US Supreme Court Illinois Brick Co. v Illinois from 1977.

Reports say as European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia hints at a coming resolution to the long-standing Google investigation, which has twice required concessions from Google, the search giant’s rivals are intensifying their criticism of the case.
Competitors that filed the complaint are not only slamming Google’s second try at resolving the matter, but a lawyer for one of the complainants reportedly suggested that Almunia may simply be looking to resolve the case before his term is up.
More than one year of discussions and negotiations have accumulated to Google offering to show more of its rivals’ links in search results. While the exact details of the concessions have not been revealed, and while competitors admit they have not seen the complete offer, reports say complainants like Microsoft and Oracle are condemning the offer as one that is unlikely to resolve all concerns that Google abuses its dominance in the search engine market.
A lawyer for an unspecified complainant equated the settlement offer to “putting lipstick on a pig.”
Further, the lawyer said the situation now suggests Almunia “just wants to get a deal before his term as Commissioner is up next year.”

Almunia spoke before the European Parliament to offer his opinion on Google’s offer, suggesting the concessions could resolve concerns that the search giant is abusing its dominance in how it displays search results.
Google has been probed by the Commission for about three years as rivals accuse the firm of squeezing them out of the market by failing to display rivals’ search results; the companies that stand against Google include Microsoft and price comparison site Foundem.
Almunia declined to outline the exact details of Google’s offer, which was revised following a rejected set of initial concessions, though he said the Commission has reached “a key moment in this case,” describing Google’s offer as having “significant improvements.”

The European Commission launched a daylong oral hearing Monday following its complaint sent to Motorola Mobility, the smartphone unit of Google, over allegations Motorola is abusing its dominance by launching litigation against rivals based on its standard essential patents.
The regulator will now press Motorola on the issue during the oral hearing. A spokesperson for the Commission declined to comment on the matter, however, as hearings are confidential.
The watchdog’s probe launched into Motorola in April of last year surrounds a much broader, controversial topic of excessive litigation stemming from standard essential patents. Experts are now studying how such lawsuits could harm competition.
Motorola launched a case against Apple based on the essential patents in Germany. In response, Apple and Microsoft both lodged complaints against the Google-owned firm.
Last week, Samsung Electronics submitted concessions in hopes of ending a similar case against the smartphone giant within the EU.

Reports say the probe into Samsung is just part of efforts by the Commission to crack down on excessive legislation over intellectual property. In recent months, additional firms including Microsoft and Motorola have been part of these patent wars, suing each other over standard-essential patent usage.

A US appeals court has sided with Microsoft in a two decade-long antitrust lawsuit launched by Novell Inc. over the company’s Windows 95 operating system, signifying a potential end to the feud.
The 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals issued the decision Monday upholding a lower court’s ruling that tossed the claims against Microsoft. Novell accuses Microsoft of making last-minute changes to Windows 95 before its release that forced Novell to postpone the release of its WordPerfect program.
According to the complaint, those last-minute changes cost Novell a major share of the market.
A mistrial had been declared after a two month hearing in 2011 after one juror refused to abandon his support of Microsoft. The 10th Circuit issued a 35-page ruling agreeing siding with US District Court Judge J.

The European Commission’s Joaquin Almunia said Friday at a conference in Italy that two investigations regarding disputes of standard-essential patents are “advanced” and could be concluded soon. The Commission’s decisions on the two cases will define the regulator’s stance on patents moving forward, reports say.
The investigations are looking into whether technology firms Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility are abusing mobile phone patents. Both companies were sent statement of objections.
The cases are part of a major power struggle between the companies, Google and Apple, which have all been trading victories as they sue each other for infringing on the so-called essential patents. Standard-essentials are patents for functions and technology necessary for a device to properly function.
According to Almunia, the Commission is cracking down on the “rules of the game” to stop such back-and-forth lawsuits and prevent companies from anticompetitively suing counterparts for infringements on essential patents.
While reports say a decision on the cases could be reached soon, Almunia assured that a date cannot be predicted at this time.
The Commission opened a probe into Samsung after the company began suing Apple within the EU in 2011 for infringements on 3G patent technology; a similar probe was launched with Motorola, which runs on Google Android software, after Microsoft and Apple issued complaints regarding smartphone patents.

Eyebrows in the antitrust community rose as news emerged that Microsoft is bundling its Windows 8.1 software with online voice communication application Skype appearing automatically at the start screen.
The bundling, announced by the tech company on Thursday, seems similar to some antitrust experts and members of the tech industry to Microsoft’s major antitrust battle with regulators over Microsoft’s practice of making its Internet Explorer web browser the default browser on its operating system.
Microsoft was sued by the US Department of Justice over allegations the company was abusing its monopoly position; the two settled the case in 2001 to avoid a court-ordered breakup of Microsoft.
Now, some say Microsoft is “testing the waters” with the appearance of Skype on its new homepage, though others say features – like a custom set-up process for users and previous bundling – suggest Microsoft is safe from any lawsuit regarding the matter.

Reports say Senator Klobuchar, along with Mike Lee (R-UT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and James Risch (R-ID) have all sent the letter to the ITC alleging the ruling misuses the FRAND patent policy and poses a threat to technological innovation. The letter to the White House claims that such misuse of the policy, which stands for fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, will deter companies from standard-setting, thereby hiking costs. The ITC decided last June that Apple had infringed on Samsung’s patent; the ruling will need to be signed by President Obama before it goes into effect. Several of Apple’s competitors, including Microsoft, have also rallied behind the tech giant against the ITC’s ruling.

The tendency to over-lobby on major cases taken up by the European Commission may actually be backfiring on major corporations like Google and MasterCard, according to a blog post published Wednesday by the Financial Times. The post comes just one day following the European Commission’s swiping payments regulations that restricts credit card giants’ interchange fees, a major blow to MasterCard that spent time and money lobbying the issue. MasterCard’s approached was slammed as a “mad campaign,” one that was “insufferable and counterproductive,” according to European Commissioner Michel Barnier. While the blog considers that MasterCard’s lobbying may have been successful in that the European Commission did not outright ban interchange fees entirely, the author, Alex Barker, suggests that such mega-lobbying may make EU regulators “more irritated than converted.” A similar example occurred with the antitrust case against Google and its methods of displaying search results; the lobbyists on the side of Microsoft rallying against Google, often portrayed as the fighters for consumer rights, appeared to have annoyed EU Commissioner Juaquin Almunia. In a past interview he described the complaints as “noise and fury,” and a fury that “neither Google nor the Commission” partook in. It’s a trend that may warrant lessons learned from future lobbyists, said Barker.

As Apple prepares for some of its products to be banned from being imported into the US beginning next week, the company is seeing support from some of its largest industry peers – as well as some of its largest rivals.
In a ruling by the US International Trade Commission, Apple products including the iPhone 4 and some models of the iPad were found to have infringed on a Samsung patents concerning cell data. The result is a import ban on the products that infringe on the particular patent, though the ruling did not come without controversy.
Reports say in addition to support from the Federal Trade Commission and other antitrust officials, Apple Inc. is reportedly receiving support from some of the largest tech giants in the country including Microsoft, Oracle, AT&T, Verizon and Intel, the latter of which is scheduled to testify on the matter at the Senate hearing.
A trade group representing companies including Microsoft and Oracle told reporters that only unusual circumstances should warrant a product ban on the basis of infringement on essential industry patents. Verizon sent a letter to President Obama last week regarding the situation, asking the White House to overturn the ban, which is set to go into effect August 4. Previous reports in the Wall Street Journal say officials from both the FTC as well as the US Department of Justice have voiced their opposition to the ban.
Antitrust regulators in the US have debated standard essential patents, known as SEPs, frequently as officials gear up their fight against patent trolls, which acquire SEPs with the sole purpose of bringing companies to court that use such patents.

986,"June 17, 2013",Not Enough Girls in the Club: The European Antitrust Approach Towards Multisided Markets,"
Christian Ahlborn, Christoph Barth, Jun 17, 2013
Long before the era of e-commerce, girls would be let into nightclubs for free (or get bonus drinks) while guys would be charged often “excessive” prices to get past the bouncer. Multisided markets involve economic platforms that provide related goods or services to two or more distinct customer groups where the value of the product to one customer group is dependent on the number of users or participants “on the other side.” An obvious contemporary example is smartphone operating systems that connect users of handsets with application providers: the larger the number of handset users, the more attractive is the platform to application providers (and vice versa). For online dating-in some ways the internet equivalent of a traditional nightclub-meanwhile, the match-making platform’s attractiveness to men is, again, dependent on the number of participating women (and vice versa).
The task of platform operators in multisided markets is to overcome co-ordination problems and to bring both (or all) sides “on board.” In setting prices for the various groups, they take into account the relationship among the various groups and the interdependencies of their demands, i.e. they internalize the network externalities between the various groups. Platform operators often achieve this balancing act by charging very different prices to the different groups of customers even where the underlying costs for the various users are the same.
In fact, there are frequent examples where for “one side” the use of the platform is free: Google makes available its search engine for free while charging advertisers (the same is true for Microsoft or Yahoo). Similarly, certain daily or weekly newspapers require their advertisers to pay all costs incurred and stock exchanges charge “liquidity takers” a commission for every share bought or sold, while “liquidity makers” get a significant rebate (or sometimes even paid for providing additional liquidity).
While economists have made significant progress over the last decade in describing and understanding multisided markets, competition authorities have struggled to come to terms with their specific characteristics (such as the interdependencies between markets and the implications for pricing) and in adapting traditional antitrust tools accordingly. In Europe, the competition authorities and courts have developed three distinct approaches to the analysis of multisided markets.

Injunctions And Standard Essential Patents (SEPs): The Problems Of Arguing From The Particular To The General by Robert O’Donoghue* (Brick Court Chambers)
Introduction by Europe Column editor Anna Tzanaki
In the May edition of CPI’s Europe Column, Robert O’Donoghue (Brick Court Chambers) turns his attention to the “patent wars” debate and explains intricate issues pertaining to injunctive relief and standard essential patents (SEPs), which have been at the forefront of the Commission’s antitrust agenda recently. Over the past year, EU regulators have reiterated their view that seeking an injunction against a potential licensee of a SEP may, albeit exceptionally, constitute an abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU. The debate is framed around high profile cases involving some of the modern high tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Google/Motorola. 
 The potential concern with regards to SEPs in nascent, cutting edge markets is the strategic use of patents to inhibit innovation and competition on the merits among market rivals. In this regard, the Commission seems to find that while injunctions to enforce IP rights are legitimate in principle, owners of SEPs agreed on FRAND licensing terms must fulfill certain conditions before resorting to injunctive relief, e.g. that a potential licensee is unwilling to cross-license its own ...

989,"May 14, 2013",A Cost-Cutting Solution to the Discovery Burdens of Antitrust Disputes,"
 J. Hardy Ehlers, James Bo Pearl, May 13, 2013
Litigating an antitrust case has always been a costly endeavor for all parties involved. Just in the last 30 years, sprawling cases such as Microsoft, Intel,and price-fixing cases involving LCDs, vitamins, and memory have chewed up hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and expert costs. There are myriad reasons for the staggering expense: The scope of these cases often comprises all aspects of a defendants’ business, a searching inquiry of the relevant markets at issue, and battles between pricey economists who conduct vast econometric market studies to support their side’s view of the case. And while the unrelenting explosion of electronic data has affected all litigation segments to some extent, it has impacted antitrust litigation in a particularly profound way. Rapidly expanding discovery costs now force settlements in situations where, in the past, defendants might make the pragmatic business decision to litigate when they believed they did nothing wrong.
The costs do not impact only defendants. Plaintiffs’ lawyers who in the past may have worked a case from the ground up may be more hesitant to invest in a multi-year discovery battle. Such attorneys may be more likely to simply trail government investigations in which a plea deal portends a higher likelihood of a success.
As it stands now, the law is not well situated to rein in the mushrooming discovery costs.

While news recently emerged that it will take at least until the summer for the European Commission to decide whether to accept a proposed settlement with Google over the company’s methods for presenting search results, Google’s woes with the Commission extend further than that single case. According to reports, Google’s unit Motorola Mobility Holdings has its own conflict with the watchdog concerning its patent ownerships. Those patents are used for various electronics produced by companies like Apple and Microsoft. The Commission is looking into whether Motorola is abusing its dominance by blocking rivals’ use of those patents, according to three anonymous sources, though the Commission has yet to send a formal complaint against the company. It’s part of a wider crackdown on so-called “patent trolls” and various patent cases that the authority has looked into. Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.4 billion in 2012.

As the European Commission continues its in-depth investigation into allegations that Google abuses its dominance in the way it presents search results, the search giant now faces new allegations from rivals. According to reports, tech giants Microsoft and Nokia have filed a formal complaint with the regulator concerning Google’s mobile operating system Android, arguing the system holds a dominant position in the market and therefore earns most of the revenue from mobile search advertising. Lobbyist FairSearch, which includes 17 search and tech companies, claims Android is a “Trojan horse” that forces users to chooses Google’s apps over others’. The latest complaint will now force Commissioner Juaquin Almunia to decide whether to umbrella the filing in the existing investigation or to start an additional probe into Android and its apps.

992,"April 1, 2013",The European Commission’s Practice Under Article 9 Regulation 1/2003: A Commitment a Day Keeps the Court Away?,"
Paul Lugard, Martin Mollmann, Apr 01, 2013
No less than three recent high profile cases have put the EU antitrust commitment procedure in the spotlights. First, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) recently announced that it had terminated its investigation into Google’s services regarding search engines and web advertising, the EU Commission’s parallel attempts to reach an agreement with Google on similar commitments have been ongoing for about a year and are expected not to be finalized before Autumn 2013. Second, on March 6, 2013 the Commission imposed a EUR 561 million (U.S.$794 million) fine on Microsoft for having breached its 2009 “choice screen” commitment intended to offer consumers a choice of web browsers. Finally, on March 13, 2013, the Commission published in the Official Journal the text of the December 2012 commitment decision regarding the e-Books investigation involving Apple and four publishers. These three matters underscore the importance of the EU commitment procedure, and the controversies surrounding the use of this EU-style consent decree procedure.
As with all good things in life, the commitments procedure should be used with moderation to avoid indigestion. Although the commitment procedure was only introduced in 2004 in EU antitrust proceedings as a means to rapidly resolve cases, it has over the past years become a cornerstone of the Commission’s antitrust policy. Such success was not foreseen. In fact, when the Article 9 of Regulation 1/2003 was introduced, a prominent former EU Commission official expected the commitment procedure to remain an exceptional, alternative enforcement instrument in the Commission’s toolbox.
While the Commission already had the means to informally settle antitrust investigations prior to the adoption of Regulation 1/2003, Article 9 provided it with a clearer legislative framework and, importantly, clarified the rights of third parties.
It is sometimes argued that the commitment procedure of Article 9 has been inspired by a long standing U.S. procedure which allows the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FTC to settle investigations by “consent decrees” (DOJ) or “consent orders” (FTC). These instruments are used in the vast majority of proceedings and allow the agencies to close a case on the basis of agreed concessions. One important difference with the EU system is, however, that DOJ decrees are reviewed by courts to determine whether the decree is in the public interest. Also, contrary to the EU system, U.S. negotiated settlements may include fines imposed on companies.
The frequent use of the EU commitment procedure supports the idea that the EU and the U.S. systems are converging. The frequency of negotiated outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic leads to similar questions, in particular with respect to the desired level of legal certainty and guidance, as well as the role and interests of third parties.
An antitrust enforcement system based solely on infringement procedures without any room for negotiated outcomes would undoubtedly be inefficient and inappropriate. But the question is whether the extensive use by the Commission of this new enforcement tool and the (partly self-inflicted) marginalization of the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in this area have not overshadowed the need to establish a balance between enforcement efficiencies on the one hand, and imperatives of legal certainty, due process, and non-discrimination on the other.

993,"March 28, 2013",The Increasing (Ab)use of Commitments in European Antitrust Law: Stockholm Syndrome,"
Stefano Grassani, Mar 28, 2013
If an “EU antitrust hot topic of the month” award were to be attributed for March 2013, the prize would certainly go to the issue of commitments pursuant to article 9 of Regulation 1/2003, which made the front page of most antitrust newswires and blogs thanks to two notable cases.
On the one hand, on March 6, 2013, the Commission adopted a decision imposing a fine of U.S.$794 million on Microsoft for failure to comply with undertakings offered, in 2009 to the European Commission, in exchange for the closing of the abuse-of-dominance investigation related to the alleged tying of Internet Explorer and the Windows operating system. On the other hand, on March 13, 2013, the Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union the text of its December 2012 decision where it had accepted commitments from Apple and four publishers in connection with a supposed concerted practice as to retail prices of e-Books.
Ten years after the enactment of Regulation 1/2003, these decisions give us the occasion for a few reflections on the subject of the institutional and philosophical implications that stem from the insertion in the EU framework of commitments as means to preempt further public enforcement action on the merits.

994,"March 28, 2013","You Made a Pledge, Then Keep Your Promise: Article 9 Commitments Decisions in European Antitrust Law","
Paul McGeown, Juliette Orologas, Mar 28, 2013
Until the European Commission slapped a U.S. $730 million fine on Microsoft at the beginning of March 2013 for failing to comply with the “choice screen” commitment that it had made in 2009 to close the Internet Explorer case, part-time antitrust watchers could have been forgiven for believing that a European Article 9 decision was akin to a settlement. The result was, after all, a textbook “win-win.” The Commission could close its file without needlessly expending scarce resources on the prosecution of an investigation; it could assert that it had corrected the perceived-though not proven-anticompetitive effects of certain behavior quickly through a tailored remedy; and it could repeat its claim to being a consumer-champion, all without undue fear of its decision being overruled in the courts. Back at corporate headquarters, meanwhile, the boards of the companies concerned could announce that they had spared the business a costly, drawn-out procedure-the outcome of which was unpredictable-and avoided a formal ruling that the company had infringed the competition rules; they could also be confident that for all practical purposes they had side-stepped costly follow-on damages actions before national courts.
But, as the Microsoft case reminds us, it never was thus.
People talk colloquially about European competition law “settlements,” but often confuse “remedies” imposed by the Commission, “commitments” offered by the parties, and “settlements” where a member of cartel admits liability in return for a reduced fine. Indeed it is reported that in December 2012 even Commissioner Almunia misused the “s” word, when speaking about the “constructive discussions” that DG COMP was having with Penguin Books about “a possible settlement” of the e-Books case. That is not what an Article 9 decision is. It is a commitments decision, a promise by a corporation to do or not to do something. And its failure to keep its promise is actionable. So why on balance do so many corporations sign up to them?

995,"March 26, 2013",Global Antitrust: Does It Have Limits?,"
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Tad Lipsky (Latham) asks Global Antitrust: Does It Have Limits?
ABSTRACT: Before 1985 there was only one mandatory suspensive premerger notification scheme of general applicability in the world—Hart-Scott-Rodino review in the United States ; now there are scores.
Similarly, antitrust challenges to monopolization were almost exclusively American until at least the early 1970s (about the time the European Commission first squared off against IBM Corp.), but“abuse of dominance” claims are now increasingly common not only in Europe but also in Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and elsewhere, and they are a realistic threat to companies operating in almost any economically significant jurisdiction. Finally, aggressive prosecution of price fixing and analogous covert cartel behavior—long a hallmark of U.S. antitrust enforcement—now appears in waves of coordinated “dawn raids” upon suspected wrongdoers in Brazil, Canada, the European Union and its Member States, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and a steadily increasing number of other jurisdictions in addition to the United States. This spectacular global expansion of antitrust enforcement has never received much commentary outside the confines of the antitrust community—the antitrust bar, enforcement agency officials, the economists who assist in advocacy on behalf of parties engaged in antitrust disputes, as well as academics interested in antitrust issues and policies. Major antitrust matters do attain some higher visibility in the financial press and, more rarely, even in the mass media. Examples include EU and U.S. investigations of Google, the EU’s initial objections to the acquisition of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing (later resolved), and the clear conflict between the U.S. and EU over General Electric’s proposed acquisition of Honeywell International (which the parties ultimately abandoned). The main U.S. case against Microsoft was followed closely in the popular media, although years of drama ended with only a mild behavioral consent decree. A recent EU investigation of alleged abuse of dominance by Russian energy utility Gazprom led to front-page global coverage of powerful figures on both sides of the underlying dispute (over natural-gas prices)—Russian President Putin and EU Vice President and Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
On the whole, however, antitrust’s transition from an American sport to a global one has occurred well beneath the threshold of public attention and without media-worthy controversy.

The ICOMP coalition has announced it has submitted a new dossier to the Commission on January 20th. ICOMP includes Microsoft Corp, one of Google’s main rivals. The dossier is said to contain accusations that Google obtained its dominant position in the market through “unfair agreements” with companies in the Internet and advertising industries. In a statement, ICOMP calls those agreements “an illegal network of exclusive relationships.”

Patent lawyers are suggesting that despite the Federal Trade Commission’s recent decision to end its investigation into Google without legal action, lawsuits from Microsoft and Apple are not likely to go away. The FTC agreed to end its probe into Google after the search giant offered voluntary concessions concerning various complaints that Google unfairly restricted access to its patents that are widely used in various mobile devices by various companies. But according to experts, despite Google’s agreements to offer its rivals access to those patents, those “fair and reasonable” terms are not likely to settle disputes between the tech giants.

1001,"January 7, 2013",A few reflections on the FTC’s decision on Google,"
David Evans, Jan 08, 2013
 
The FTC’s 5-0 decision to drop its investigation into Google’s search-related practices is breathtaking. A number of companies had charged that Google was engaging in unfair competition by cooking its search results. Yet the Commission staff concluded that there was no significant evidence to support allegations that the “company biased its search to hurt competition” or that consumers, rather than competitors, were harmed. Three Democratic and two Republican FTC Commissioners, none of whom have been particularly bashful about pursuing companies they believe have violated the antitrust laws, supported that conclusion. For those who know the FTC Commissioners and staff, it is a bit hard to give credence to the hysterical complaints by some of Google’s antagonists that the FTC fumbled the investigation.
There’s not much more to say at least on the search case in the US for now. We’ll have to wait to see what the EU concludes. So I’d like to reflect at bit on some of the broader questions this decision raises.
Should antitrust give the information-technology sector a rest?

Nowadays, it is undisputed that innovation is a key driver of consumer welfare. As a result, unwarranted restraints on desirable innovative activity as a consequence of enforcement errors that incorrectly condemn pro-competitive or competitively neutral conduct (Type 1 errors), are potentially most damaging. Obviously, by the same token, private restraints-whether through mergers, cartels, or unilateral conduct-which hamper innovation may bring about significant negative effects.
Against this background, one would expect that, over time, the application of EU competition law under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, as well as the European Commission’s (“Commission”) enforcement practice under the EU Merger Control Regulation (“EUMR”), would have given rise to a refined analytical framework as to how to adequately integrate dynamic efficiencies (as well as restraints on innovation) into the overall analysis of business transactions.
However, it is striking that, despite the general recognition that innovation is an important source of welfare gains, the precise significance of innovation in EU competition law has remained, at best, opaque.

Regardless of whether the outcome in these matters is correct, it has sometimes been argued that the Commission has paid little-perhaps too little-attention to the nature and significance of the specific type of innovation that is of importance in the market. This argument is particularly made in relation to the European Microsoft case. In general, in Commission decisions under Article 102 TFEU one searches in vain for an analysis of the innovation potential of the various players on the market, let alone an attempt to weigh the innovation benefits that those parties bring to consumers against those of the dominant company.

A firm that practices tying in the United States can be committing a per se violation of the an- titrust law, and it can be also considered a per se violation of the Article 102 of the EC Treaty. However, there is evidence for the use of the rule-of-reason approach in some courts’ decisions in tying cases, such as United States vs. Microsoft in 2001 and the case against Microsoft in the EC in 2004. Therefore, the question of when a tying case should be ruled under the per se approach or under the rule-of-reason approach is valid and has policy implications. This article is written to shed light into what could be the appropriate answer by presenting several lessons that we can learn from the economics literature.

1007,"December 20, 2012",Brantley Versus NBC Universal: Where’s the Beef?,"
Dennis Carlton, Michael Waldman, Dec 20, 2012
As with other important cases involving firms such as Kodak and Microsoft, the recent Brantley case raises interesting questions concerning appropriate antitrust policy in situations where firms practice a form of tying. Such cases are particularly difficult from an antitrust perspective because tying is pervasive in the economy and in many cases-actually probably most-the tying behavior has an efficiency justification. Even in cases where the justification may not be efficiency, as might occur in some instances where tying enables price discrimination, the practice may have nothing to do with harming competition. So the difficult issue faced by the courts in analyzing tying under the antitrust laws is to prohibit tying which harms competition and welfare without prohibiting tying that has an efficiency justification and thus improves welfare or where tying has a justification that is unrelated to harming competition.
In this short paper we discuss the specific issues raised by the Brantley case. We begin by describing the case in more detail and then discuss the relevant economic theories that have been developed to understand the type of tying behavior practiced in the case. We then discuss appropriate antitrust policy and end with a concluding discussion.

If the case were to end without any repercussions for Google, analysts say it would be a disappointing result for major competitors like Microsoft who claim Google abuses its dominance.

Allen Grunes, Dec 12, 2012
Pop quiz: What do antitrust cases involving the leading PC operating system, a national association’s rules about real estate listings, and a joint venture between a cable company and a movie studio have in common?
Hint: Not the statute involved. One was Sherman, one was Sherman and one was Clayton.
Answer: They were all about competition to be the “next big thing.”
Quite a lot has been written on the importance of innovation to the U.S. economy, and how, if at all, antitrust enforcement can promote or protect innovation. The aim of this short article is slightly different. Enforcement actions are where the rubber meets the road, so in some sense they tell us more than speeches and policy documents.
In this article I look at how the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) approached innovation in the National Association of Realtors and Comcast/NBC Universal cases. While it is difficult to draw conclusions from only a couple of data points, I outline the ways in which DOJ seems to have developed an internally consistent approach toward exclusionary conduct in the digital world. I do not see the same kind of consistency over at the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Google is the great unknown as I write this. But based on the FTC’s decision to close its investigation of the Universal/EMI merger, I am not overly optimistic about the prospects of a Google case. One conclusion that may be drawn is that DOJ benefitted institutionally from fully litigating the Microsoft case, while the FTC has paid a price for not fully testing an innovation theory in court. As it stands now, there seems to be something of a “digital divide” between the DOJ and FTC.

1010,"December 13, 2012",The Ebb and Flow of Joint State and Federal Antitrust Enforcement: Is Everyone Playing Nice?,"
Kevin O’Connor, Dec 12, 2012
For over two decades, the relationship between the state and federal antitrust enforcement authorities has varied from productive cooperative efforts to, at times, outright hostility. By most accounts, however, the relationship in the past few years has been quite productive both with respect to merger reviews and non-merger conduct investigations and lawsuits.
However, there are important nuances to the state-federal relationship that bear emphasis. First, over the past twenty-five years, the state enforcers and the federal agencies have created a system of joint merger review that can be quite efficient and likely to lead the multiple enforcers to a common end point if handled competently by the parties to the transaction. That said, there are often difficult issues that need to be carefully addressed at the beginning and at the end of merger reviews. For example, merging parties enjoy comprehensive confidentiality protection with the federal agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino regime. But parties often struggle with how to create or at least simulate this confidentiality regime with state enforcers in the face of expansive state public records laws and the absence, at least in many cases, of explicit airtight confidentiality protections in state law. Similarly, although the system has evolved to provide for fairly streamlined review of transactions, at the end of the review it is important to understand that individual states may and often do demand relief or conditions not demanded by the federal agency or other state involved.
Second, the procedural template governing joint state-federal merger reviews does not provide a controlling template for non-merger conduct cases but, it is fair to say, it provides at least a persuasive model. Both federal agencies have worked closely on several large conduct matters with groups of states. But just as in the case of joint merger reviews, confidentiality issues and differing settlement postures (e.g., most famously, the Microsoft case) can complicate resolution of these matters. Moreover, the availability of more expansive remedies to state enforcers (e.g., indirect purchaser damages) makes the joint litigation environment far more complicated than the merger review arena.

1011,"December 12, 2012","U.S.: FTC to announce patent case settlement with Google this week, say sources","
Three sources have said in reports that Google Inc. is nearing a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that the search giant violated law by blocking access to patents the company owns for smartphone technology. While the sources said the terms of the settlement are not final, they did say that the FTC may announce the deal this week reached with Google that would limit its ability to block the use of standard essential patent designs from other companies whose products rely on those patents. The agreement would not bar Google from seeking those injunctions altogether, however. The case’s biggest effects would reach Microsoft Corp and Allple Inc after Google tried to block imports of the rivals’ products.

Kathleen Foote, Nov 14, 2012
Antitrust enforcers in the offices of state attorneys general frequently find ourselves between a rock and a hard place when it comes to public perceptions of our work. State antitrust enforcement tends to be subject to criticism as misguided-or worse-whenever it diverges publicly from enforcement by the federal agencies. Yet when it doesn’t diverge it is often labeled “redundant” in the pejorative sense of that term. The reality is a good bit different from the perception in either case.
Much of the perception is a legacy of the historic 2001 split between the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”) and state government prosecutors over appropriate remedies in the Microsoft case, which arose after an exemplary partnership throughout the liability phase of the case. The rupture led to two contemporaneous and highly visible tracks through the same courtroom in early 2002: a Tunney Act review of whether the DOJ settlement (joined by nine states) was in the public interest, and a six-week merits trial in which nine other states sought to prove that far stiffer remedies should be required. Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s ultimate rulings rejected most of the state-requested remedies but added some terms to the DOJ settlement, thus largely conforming the state and federal results. The subsequent years of joint enforcement of the affirmative mandates of the Microsoft decree under active court supervision marked a return to smooth sailing between the state and federal agencies and close cooperation in executing their shared enforcement responsibilities.
The wave of criticism following the initial split, however, by then had taken on a life of its own. It was promptly formalized in the initial agenda of the Antitrust Modernization Commission, which reviewed and debated at length the history of dual state-federal enforcement and considered, but ultimately rejected, various proposals for partial preemption of state authority. Its conclusion, reached in 2007, was that no changes to the institutional structure were warranted. The AMC did note, as others have, that further efforts by state and federal enforcers to harmonize their work would be salutary.
While Microsoft is an undeniable and extreme exception to their usual consistency, it is not the only time that state and federal agencies have differed in recent years. Typically, the differences can be viewed as healthy ones that foster the overall goal of preserving competition, and rarely manifest themselves as public disagreements over major policy issues. No generalizations are possible, however, without distinguishing between merger reviews and non-merger situations.

1013,"November 8, 2012",What Does The Chicago School Teach About Internet Search and the Antitrust,"
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Robert H. Bork & J. Gregory Sidak (Criterion Economics) have a new paper on What Does The Chicago School Teach About Internet Search and the Antitrust
ABSTRACT: Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began investigating Google’s search practices in 2010. Google’s critics have consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized search results in general search pages and limiting access to search inputs, including “scale,” Google content, and the Android platform. Those claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate competitors’ efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality, or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teaches—and the Supreme Court has long affirmed—that antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Google’s practices as anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended to protect.

In response to the FTC’s recent investigation into whether Google has been improperly using Motorola’s patents against its competitors, Google is reportedly considering a settlement with the FTC, though it is unclear exactly what that settlement may be. According to two sources obtained by the Wall Street Journal, the Commission is investigating claims that Google has violated antitrust law by refusing to grant essential patent licenses to competitors such as Apple and Microsoft after the company acquired Motorola last May. Google has been under investigation by the FTC for over a year but it is only recently that the concerns focused on Google’s alleged misuse of Motorola patents.

1016,"October 18, 2012","Antitrust for High-Tech and Low: Regulation, Innovation, and Risk","
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Ron Cass, Center for the Rule of Law, Cass & Associates, PC, Boston University School of Law explores Antitrust for High-Tech and Low: Regulation, Innovation, and Risk.
ABSTRACT: Severe limitations on antitrust enforcement officials’ knowledge and the potential impact of ill-advised investigations and prosecutions on markets suggest that officials should exercise extraordinary caution in enforcement of restraints on single-firm conduct. Although it is common to depict antitrust enforcement as protecting market competition while other forms of regulation are seen as intrusions (justifiable or not) into market operation, antitrust enforcement has characteristics and risks similar to other forms of regulation. Indeed, government antitrust enforcement can be especially problematic, as it requires discretionary selection among an extraordinary range of possible targets, imposes significant burdens on companies that are under investigation or subject to suit, invites efforts by individual firms to motivate officials to deploy resources against rivals, and can seriously disrupt competition among firms. Antitrust authorities need to exercise special care in making enforcement decisions respecting conduct of individual dominant firms in high-technology industries, where antitrust enforcers’ abilities to understand and predict industry evolution are most limited and where enforcement actions are most likely to rest on debatable predicates about the effects of specific conduct.
Critically, market boundaries that so often are taken for granted as setting the proper framework for evaluating effects of a leading firm’s conduct frequently fail to capture the most important sources of competition for the firm, which in many industries (including many high-technology industries with strong network effects) are dynamic and involve potential replacement of the technology that is associated with the government’s market definition. This has led to ill-advised enforcement initiatives which have dramatically burdened the target companies (even at the formal investigation stage) and has prejudiced market development without compensating benefits to consumers. Further, while network effects can establish or sustain dominance within a narrowly defined market, network effects also can have just the opposite effect: they can be the reason that a firm’s dominance comes to an end, as the success of a dominant firm is a spur to investment in competing technologies, including technologies that can replace the currently successful product or service.
At a time when companies publicly identified as potential antitrust enforcement targets include a very large number of leading high-technology firms (among them, Facebook, Apple, Google, IBM, AT&T, Microsoft, and Intel), it is important to look critically at prior enforcement efforts predicated on similar theories. This article examines government enforcement decisions respecting four prior targets and draws lessons for enforcement going forward

1017,"October 10, 2012",U.S.: FTC scrutinizes Googleâ€™s smartphone patents,"
Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating Google’s conduct in its Internet search and search advertising businesses. According to the New York Times, this focus now revolves around smartphone patents, especially technology patents, and the conduct of Google’s Motorola Mobility subsidiary. Google currently owns patents covering communications and data-handling technologies that are crucial for the basic operation of smartphones and tablets. However, it has gained an unfair advantage when it agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion and picked up 17,000 patents, including large important ones relating to wireless devices. In June, the FTC sought information from Google and smartphone rivals including Apple and Microsoft, through questioning representatives of the companies. The F.T.C. investigation shows that it is keeping an eye on the patent buildup up by Google and other high-tech companies.

According to the New York Times, Apple’s use of Apple Maps, a decision substituting its own mapping software for rival Google’s in the iPhone 5 and the new iOS 6 operating system, appears to be a textbook case of what’s known as a tying arrangement, sometimes referred to as “bundling.” In bundling, the purchase of one good or service (the iPhone) is conditioned on the purchase or use of a second (Apple maps). Such arrangements extend the control of a dominant producer, thus violating antitrust laws. The best example of which is Microsoft’s attempt to bundle its Internet Explorer browser on Windows software, to the disadvantage of Netscape.

The Supreme Court of Canada is determining the fate and scope of antitrust class actions in Canada. The Court has scheduled a hearing on Oct. 17 for two decisions pending in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, namely Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, and Sun-Rype Products Ltd. v. Archer Daniels Midland Company. At the same time, the Court will hear the appeal from the Quebec Court of Appeal’s decision in the Options Consommateurs v. Infineon Technologies case.
The core issue before the high court is known as the “DRAM” cases on whether indirect purchasers, those who bought a product after the initial purchase from those involved in anti-competitive conduct, have a class action remedy under the Competition Act. The Act allows a private “right of action” to any person who has suffered a loss as a result of criminal misconduct under the legislation.

1021,"October 1, 2012","Competition, Standards, and Patents","
Per Hellstrom, Thomas Kramler, Oct 01, 2012
The interface of competition, standards, and patents has received increased attention over the past few years, in particular in the information, communication, and technologies sector. With regard to the mobile devices sector, some even refer to an on-going “patent war” in reference to the extensive global patent litigation between technology and software companies such as Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, and others.
Antitrust authorities have recently signaled increased vigilance about the strategic use of patents. When clearing the Google/Motorola merger in February 2012, Vice-President Almunia stated, “the Commission will continue to keep a close eye on the behaviour of all market players in the sector, particularly the increasingly strategic use of patents.”
In January 2012 the European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation against Samsung Electronics to assess whether it may have abusively used certain of its essential patent rights to distort competition in the field of mobile devices in Europe. In April 2012, the Commission opened two further formal proceedings against Motorola Mobility to assess whether Motorola may have abusively used certain of its standard essential patents related to mobile, wireless, and video compression standards to distort competition.These proceedings are on-going.
The purpose of this paper is to briefly outline some of the issues raised by the use of standards and patents from an EU competition law perspective, and discuss what lessons market participants and regulators might draw from ongoing disputes.

1022,"October 1, 2012",Fines for Abuse of Dominance in “High Tech” Markets,"
Benoit Durand, Andreas Reindl, Oct 01, 2012
Blockbuster fines have become a trademark of European Commission abuse of dominance cases. Intel’s EUR 1 billion fine is currently under appeal, and just a few months ago the General Court largely upheld the EUR 800 million fine imposed on Microsoft for its failure to comply with the licensing remedy in the initial Commission decision, which “supplemented” the EUR 450 million fine imposed in 2004.
The practice of wielding the big stick in Article 102 cases involving high-tech firms has had an impact on the narrative about European competition law. Take the numerous reports in the trade press about the Commission’s ongoing Google investigation; they have little to report on substance, but almost invariably emphasize that the tough antitrust enforcers in Brussels could impose a EUR 4 billion fine if they found Google guilty of a violation. That is not small change, even for the Googles of the world. For a firm with a little less cash at hand than Google, the threat of being subject to an investigation by a competition authority with little understanding of high-tech markets and equally little hesitation to consider novel and perhaps experimental conduct to be a “very serious” infringement on par with price-fixing, and thereby impose enormous fines, might be enough reason to change its business conduct when an unhappy rival makes noises about filing a complaint.
This is a worrisome development. The current fining practices in single-firm conduct cases rest on shaky grounds and are potentially harmful. We begin with a brief discussion of core economic concepts that should inform the imposition of corporate fines, in particular in single-firm conduct cases. We then use the Commission’s Intel and Microsoft decisions to illustrate the risks associated with the current ill-designed fining practice, in particular in cases involving high-tech sectors: (i) enforcers may find it impossible to determine whether conduct was, in fact, inefficient and harmful; (ii) the risk of deterring beneficial conduct is particularly high; and (iii) market participants will typically find it impossible to understand what type of future conduct a fine is supposed to deter, given the rapidly changing market conditions and unclear substantive analytical standards. We conclude by identifying conditions that must be met if a competition authority considers imposing sanctions in single-firm conduct cases. We are not arguing here that corporate fines should never be imposed in cases involving high-tech industries, but we doubt that blockbuster fines are a suitable enforcement tool in most single-firm conduct cases.

1023,"September 23, 2012",E.U./U.S.: Europe hints at impatience in settling Google case,"
According to the European Union’s top antitrust regulator, Joaquín Almunia, there are limits to how much longer his office would try to negotiate a settlement with Google over whether its Internet search engine favored the company’s own Web offerings to the detriment of competitors. Without a settlement structure, Google would leave itself open to being fined as much as 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue – which reached nearly $38 billion USD last year – and conform to any E.U. law it was found to violate before being allowed to appeal to the General Court of the European Union. Instead of proceeding with formal charges, Mr. Almunia offered Google a chance to reach an amicable solution. It was the most significant sign yet that E.U. regulators were seeking to avoid a battle that would drag out for a decade or more, as happened in previous cases involving two U.S. technology giants, Microsoft and Intel.

1024,"September 23, 2012",Consumer Choice as the Best Way to Describe the Goals of Competition Law,"
Robert H. Lande, (University of Baltimore – School of Law) describes Consumer Choice as the Best Way to Describe the Goals of Competition Law.
ABSTRACT: This article is both a short introduction to the Consumer Choice explanation for Competition Law or Antitrust Law, and also a short advocacy piece suggesting that Consumer Choice is the best way to articulate the goals of European Competition Law and United States Antitrust Law.
This article briefly: 1. defines the consumer choice approach to antitrust or competition law and shows how it differs from other approaches; 2. shows that the antitrust statutes and theories of violation embody a concern for optimal levels of consumer choice; 3. shows that the United States antitrust case law embodies a concern for optimal levels of consumer choice; 4. presents evidence of the new paradigm: United States v. Microsoft; 5. argues that non-price competition should become a higher priority for he enforcers; 6. Discusses Consumer Choice and the media.
The article shows that the choice framework has many advantages. It takes full account of all the things that are actually important to consumers – price, of course, but also variety, innovation, quality, and other forms of non-price competition. It is also far more transparent, which is an important administrative virtue even where, as in the great majority of cases, it will reach the same result. And in some important real-world situations it will lead to better substantive outcomes. There are a number of variety-valuing industries and circumstances that can be assessed correctly only by including an effective analysis of nonprice factors. We identify these in the article.

Hon Hai provides electronic manufacturing services to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
The Commission determined that Hon Hai and Sharp’s activities will have only minimal overlap after the acquisition. Since SDP will be supplying LCD panels to other companies beyond Sharp after the deal, Hon Hai’s competitors will have increased access to the panels. The Commission also noted that Hon Hai’s customers direct the company to purchase LCD panels, and they will remain free to request competing LCD panels.

Texas sued Google, Inc. on June 12 for withholding a “large volume” of documents the state requested as part of an ongoing antitrust investigation. In response to two Civil Investigative Demands, Google supplied “several hundred thousand” documents, but classified several thousand as “privileged” and did not send them. Google also requested that the Attorney General send back or destroy some select records that it had re-classified as “privileged.”
The state considered those documents not only highly probative with respect to the investigation, but also saw nothing in the documents that would justify Google in withholding them. In this new complaint, the state requested the court determine whether the documents Google withheld are protected by attorney-client privilege and order Google to produce any unprotected documents.

Korea’s Fair Trade Commission has raided Google’s Korea offices this week, making it the fourth investigation of the search company since September 2011. The raid concerns two issues. The first is the complaint lodged by NHN and Daum Communications, which alleges that Google Korea has entered into agreements with smartphone manufacturers to exclude apps provided by competing Korean search engines. The second issue is whether Google Korea has been obstructing the FTC’s on-site investigations with acts such as concealing documents.

1038,"May 2, 2012",Technology Licensing: Evolving Antitrust Standards in the Smartphone and Other Sectors?,"
Paul Lugard, Apr 30, 2012
Antitrust review of business transactions involving intellectual property has never been entirely undisputed. On the one hand, there is a general belief that antitrust intervention in R&D-, intellectual property-, and innovation-intense industries should be centered on the preservation of innovation incentives. On the other hand, day-to-day practice demonstrates that even in sectors where the intellectual property landscape is relatively easily accessible, but where innovation is nonetheless important, the proper application of antitrust law is highly fact-specific and complex.
For instance, intuition tells us that grant-back clauses in technology licensing agreements may decrease licensees’ incentives to innovate unless they are properly compensated for their innovative efforts. But it also obvious that appropriate compensation schemes for future innovations may be impossible to set up, and that some licensors may not be willing to license their technology, without grant-back clauses, as a result of which the positive welfare effects associated with technology licensing may not materialize to start with. How does one distinguish the good and the bad cases?
And, to add a particularly topical example, how should one ensure that-given evidence of the ability and incentive to foreclose rivals-the acquisition of a portfolio of hundreds of Standard Essential Patents (“SEPs”) relevant to wireless devices by Apple, Microsoft, or Google will not result in post-merger exclusionary conduct as a result of those companies repudiating prior fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) commitments, or a failure to adhere to those commitments in a meaningful manner as the prior owners would have done?
Faced with fast-moving, innovative industries, antitrust enforcement agencies are up against difficult tasks. Indeed, they need to have a well-informed opinion on the nature and drivers of innovation and the durability of market power, as well as the potential of the industry at hand to correct itself, especially in light of dominance. In these settings, over-enforcement resulting in the loss of valuable dynamic efficiencies is often a real risk, while devising and implementing adequate remedies is difficult and takes time. This certainly applies to the one sector that takes a prominent place in this issue of the CPI Antitrust Chronicle, the sector of mobile devices.
This issue comes at a critical time. Only a few weeks ago, on February 13, 2012, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued its closing statement following its investigations into three cases: Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a manufacturer of smartphones and computer tables and the holder of a portfolio of approximately 17,000 issued patents and 6,800 applications; the acquisition by Rockstar Bidco (a partnership including, among others, Apple, Microsoft, and Research in Motion (“RIM”)) of approximately 6,000 Nortel patents; and the acquisition by Apple of a portfolio of Novell patents. Each of these three acquisitions involved a large number of SEPs relevant to wireless devices, many of which the pre-existing owners had committed to license through their participation in Standard Setting Organizations (“SSOs”) on FRAND terms.

1045,"November 18, 2011",Competition Law and the Regulation of Technology Markets,"
Just in the time for the holidays, we thought our readers might be interested in this book review:
Competition Law and the Regulation of Technology Markets, Kevin Coates, 448 pages, April 2011, 978-0-19-957521-3, Hardback
Review written by Timothy R.W. Cowen, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP
It is clear that this book is both up to date and has been deeply thought through. This is without doubt the work of someone who has spent many years dealing with cases and the issues that they raise at the cutting edge of the law and policy in the sector. It is welcome as a work of rare insight and expertise.  It is also a clear book addressing a number of complex subjects in the one place. The title poses the conundrum: ‘Competition law and the Regulation of Technology Markets’.  This is a conundrum because it could be argued that the book is concerned with technology law. Whether there is such a things as technology law or law that applies to technology markets is a question posed at the outset and one to which this review will return to below.
It starts by outlining the areas of law that are the most relevant for the technology sector and takes a ‘joining-the-dots’ perspective: cutting across economic policy and the theory that underlies competition law, competition law and its application to the technology cases, both in the US and the EU, and cutting across intellectual property rights and in particular the interface between intellectual property and competition law. This provides a strategic or ‘horizontal’ perspective starting with the law as it applies to the sector and illustrating the law with relevant cases. It then deals with a set of ‘vertical’ industry specific issues that arise and which are specific to the technology sector such as in the areas of standards, and interoperability and later on dealing with issues such as price squeeze and net neutrality. In the part of the book looking at access and interoperability it provides a useful outline of the controversies that have taken place in what has often been a heated debate behind the scenes.  Issues are addressed with interesting illustrations from US and EU cases, as is product design. Again, this is an industry specific area often overlooked by competition lawyers, data protection or  technology lawyers, but an area where the law is increasingly likely to focus in the future. Compliance by design may well be an area for future development  given the difficulty of tracking monitoring and enforcing the law in technology markets.
One wonderful aspect of this work is that it is so up to date. The most recent cases are referred to and placed in the context of current investigations. In particular the US and EU investigations of Microsoft, Intel and most recently of Google, are addressed in detail.
Antitrust investigations into the technology sector are some of the most high profile investigations of all, and provoke widespread argument and controversy.  Businesses seek to claim that the sector is so dynamic that it should be left alone and so competitive that the market resolve any issue. While it is recognized that it is a real challenge for the competition authorities to take on the task of ‘Trying to shoe a galloping horse’, it is a task that they have been given and one that has to be discharged. How and why they have done so in recent years is thoroughly explained in a coherent and thoughtful way.
As indicated at the outset of this review, one issue for every lawyer approaching this area, (and which is pointed out in the introduction) is whether there is any such thing as technology law; Judge Easterbrook’s famous comment that there is no law of  the internet, or for that matter any such thing as the law of ‘technology markets’, but only law that applies to technology markets  is a profound observation. As discussed throughout the book there is no more a law of the internet than there is a ‘law of the horse’. This book deals with the law as it applies to the technology markets, then looks at the issues raise, from, if you like, the perspective of the horse. Looking at the law from the point of view of the horse is very helpful in understanding the issues and vital for any business seeking to understand the law that applies to them and then to comply with the law. This is a current issue for businesses that have not sufficiently designed their businesses or taken the law into account,  and one that overly tidy minded lawyers ignore at their peril. Lawyers in particular are susceptible to the delusion that narrow definitions provide comforting specializations and that that is enough. In technology markets in particular, being an expert in one aspect of the law is insufficient to help businesses or competition authorities or the courts to resolve the issues that they have to deal with.  There are many areas that need to be mastered before an intelligent outcome can be either presented, proposed or decided.
Of course, it is also recognized that the law that applies to horses is one that requires those involved, be they the horse and the lawyer, to understand both the law and the horse.   This book is admirable in seeking to tackle so much , and is extraordinary in doing it so well and so succinctly.

The epic cases between the government and “Ma Bell” in the 1980s and Microsoft in the 1990s not only moved antitrust policy onto the front pages but also stretched the limits of antitrust analysis. Both cases left their mark on antitrust law, if not on the commercial life of the nation. Might the DOJ’s challenge to the AT&T/T-Mobile merger be a similarly significant antitrust case?

1048,"May 17, 2011",Jeffrey Rohlfs’ 1974 Model of Facebook: An Introduction and Reprint,"
Richard Schmalensee, May 17, 2011

Jeffrey Rohlfs’ pioneering 1974 study of demand in the presence of network externalities, which make each actor’s demand for some good or service depend in part on whether others purchase it, laid the foundation for a huge academic literature that has had a major impact on antitrust policy. The government’s case in U.S. v. Microsoft, for instance, relied heavily on network externality arguments.
In most of the post-Rohlfs network-effects literature, buyers are modeled as making long-term product or technology choices because those choices either involve the purchase of significant durable goods or create switching costs. Examples include the choices between VHS and Betamax VCRs, or between Apple and Wintel computers, or the choice to purchase an early fax machine.
In contrast, Rohlfs presents a model that seems better suited to analysis of new Internet-based businesses that rely on network effects, like Facebook and YouTube. These businesses provide services rather than durable goods, and their customers are not required to make long-term commitments. Switching costs are at most moderate, and customers can often participate in multiple competing networks at the same time. (In the terminology of the recent, related literature on two-sided markets, they can “multi-home.”2) Thus I think the Rohlfs paper deserves to be read carefully on its own, apart from the literature it helped to launch.

1049,"January 28, 2011","Google, IBM, SAP, and The Others: Is the European Commission Targeting Technology Firms?","
Lorenzo Coppi, Jan 27, 2011

The European Commission has recently opened an antitrust investigation in connection to Google’s commercial practices. This is just the last of a number of recent investigations in the high-tech sector, which have involved Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Rambus, Apple, and SAP.
After reviewing the scope of the European Commission’s investigation of Google (on the basis of the available public information), this article focuses on the question of whether there are characteristics of the high tech sector which make it particularly prone to monopolization or anticompetitive foreclosure, and which justify the European Commission’s apparent focus on the sector.
First the article discusses the reasons militating in favor of close scrutiny of the technology sector, namely the tendency of high tech markets to be significantly concentrated, and the fact that high tech products tend to have significant complementarity and interoperability relationships which make exclusion of competitors a tangible possibility.
Then the article reviews the argument against close scrutiny of the technology sector, namely the fact that it is characterized by dynamic, fast-changing, platform competition, and that the legitimate by-product of innovative behavior is a transitory monopoly, the curbing of which may chill innovation incentives.
The article concludes that, on balance, high tech markets are a reasonable target for antitrust scrutiny because they have a propensity to “tip to monopoly;” exclusion of competitors is fairly easy and often profitable; the effects of market power on incentives to innovate are uncertain; and the sector is very important to the economy.  Obviously this does not mean that all the cases the European Commission is investigating have merit-only time will tell if that is the case.

1050,"January 27, 2011","Keywords: Google, European Commission. Anyone Feeling Lucky?","
Lia Vitzilaiou, Jan 27, 2011

On November 30, 2010, the European Commission issued a press release which many were worried about, others looking forward to, but almost everyone anticipated: Google is under formal antitrust investigation with regard to an alleged abuse of dominance in the online search market.
The Commission will investigate three main issues. The first is whether Google has manipulated its unpaid or “algorithmic” search results by giving preferential placement to its own results while lowering the ranking of those offered by competitors, i.e. vertical search engines. The second issue is whether Google has imposed exclusivity contracts on its advertising partners, preventing them from placing ads on competitive websites. Finally, the Commission will look into whether Google has restricted the portability of online advertising campaign data to competing online advertising platforms.
This development was expected by most, not only because Google has recently been the center of attention for many national competition authorities (the latest being the Italian antitrust investigation in the Google News Service which ended by compromise) but also because the Commission seems to have lately targeted powerful technology companies. Since 2004, when Microsoft was fined EUR 497 million for abuse of dominance, to 2008 when a further EUR 899 million penalty was imposed for failure to comply with the 2004 ruling, up to 2009 when Intel was fined a historic EUR 1.1 billion, also for abuse of dominance, the Commission has shown a strong interest in the high-tech industry, apparently feeling confident it has the sophistication to tackle the complex issues arising in such innovative markets.
This Commission investigation targets the core of the Google business, i.e. its search engine, and naturally has attracted a lot of controversy. For example, there is speculation that this is an attack partly assisted by Microsoft, which recently merged its search business with Yahoo’s in order to challenge Google’s market lead.This assertion is based on the fact that Microsoft owns one of the plaintiffs (Ciao!) as well as a price comparison service in Germany, and it sponsors a trade grouping called ICOM, a member of which is another plaintiff called Fodem, a British price comparison service.If this is the case, then there might be more competition in the search engine market than initially appears.
Also controversially, Benjamin Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, recently published the results of a study conducted of Google’s search engine, which allegedly show that there exists what he calls a “hard coded bias” that overrides the normal algorithmic results in order to put a Google answer first. In another study, he suggests that this “distortion” is identified with almost all leading search engines, including Yahoo!, but supposedly Google promotes its own services significantly more than others.
Google can be expected to bring forth evidence to contest such arguments. As we are not yet in a position to reach solid conclusions on such complex technical issues to answer the core question of whether Google tampers with its search results or not, it is safer to look at the available facts and pose some other questions also relevant to the competition analysis.
The first question is whether Google has a motive to tamper with its search results, in view of the two-sided platform market it operates. The second question is whether it is Google or the Commission who should “be feeling lucky” in the present dispute. And finally, if the “holy grail” of a neutral search engine is behind the Commission investigation, is this a realistic pursuit?

1051,"August 19, 2010",Should Antitrust Bite the Dust?,"
Since August can be a bit somnolent, I thought I’d liven things up a bit by reprinting two letters to the editor that appeared in The Wall Street Journal in reaction to the blog we reprinted in our August Blog ‘o Blogs. In that article, Tim Muris offers offer five principles to guide competition policy toward successful  innovators, see here for a link to that article. 
The first letter came from David Heiner, Chief Competition Counsel for Microsoft, who somewhat understandably applauded Mr. Muris:
“Regarding Timothy J. Muris’s “Antitrust in a High-Tech World” (op-ed,  Aug. 11): Mr. Muris offers five principles to guide competition policy  toward successful innovators. Every one of them is sound. Every one of  them should be followed by competition law regulators world-wide. None  of them, however, justifies exempting IBM or other successful innovators  from scrutiny. In an increasingly connected and digitized world,  interoperability among competing products is more important than ever  and a likely subject of antitrust review.
Companies that are  dominant may have to license some of their intellectual property (for a  royalty) in order to enable interoperability that fosters competition  and benefits consumers. That, of course, is one of the lessons of the  Microsoft case, on both sides of the Atlantic.”
Nothing terribly exciting there, but I found the following reaction by Edwin Rockefeller, former chairman of the American Bar Association’s section of antitrust to be curious and curiouser — and maybe just a bit over the top:
Time for Antitrust to Bite the Dust
It is discouraging to read that a counselor to Microsoft Corp., the  foremost victim of antitrust in our time, has joined the chorus of  antitrust professionals who are singing that antitrust is, or can be,  “sound” (“The  High-Tech World Still Needs Antitrust,” Letters, Aug. 16).
Antitrust  is unsound as economics. It is based on a definition of competition  that is neither possible nor desirable—undifferentiated products in  price equilibrium. It is unsound as law because it provides no coherent  set of ascertainable rules to guide conduct. It is unsound as a matter  of fact, because it is based on a belief in the false legend of Standard  Oil.
Antitrust is a religion carried on by a cult of  professionals. It gives government officials the power to interfere  whimsically with freedom of contract, frequently on behalf of losers. It  is a needless drag on the economy and of little demonstrable public  benefit.

1052,"July 27, 2010",Sponsored Search Auctions: Simple Economics and Implications for Antitrust Policy,"
Renato Gomes, Jul 27, 2010

The most valuable asset of many two-sided platforms is their user base. In a celebrated example, Internet search engines (such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing) derive most of their revenue from selling the eyeballs of millions of searchers to advertisers. For each query entered by searchers, search engines return a list of sponsored links displayed to the right of the algorithmic (also called organic) search results. The knowledge of what searchers are looking for enables search engines to create very precise matches between searchers and advertisers.
The ability to target consumers has great value to advertisers. The average price of a click on a sponsored link from Google in 2006 was $2.00 and, for certain keywords, a click may cost more than $100. On aggregate, keyword advertising has impressive figures: in 2007, the U.S. search traffic totaled more than eighty billion queries, of which 40 percent have commercial potential. The total revenue generated by keyword advertising alone amounted to more than 20 billion dollars in 2007.
Recently, the three major search engines announced plans to collaborate in search technology and advertising. In June 2008, Google and Yahoo! issued a proposal according to which Google would deliver ads next to Yahoo’s search results. In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal to share search technology and to join forces in search-generated advertising. The Department of Justice raised concerns about the anticompetitive effects of such partnerships, which were ultimately aborted. Still, the prospect of future mergers brings many new questions to the antitrust debate in online advertising. Would a merger between the leading search engines be beneficial to searchers or advertisers? How would market conditions affect the pricing and the selection of sponsored search ads?
Search engines have traditionally employed auctions to sell sponsored links to advertisers. The use of auctions in two-sided markets is a novel phenomenon, and its antitrust implications have no parallel in one-sided settings. In this short note, I review the simple economics of sponsored search auctions, and describe its main insights for antitrust policy. Surprisingly, concentrated markets can be welfare-improving when search engines are not able to subsidize (or charge) searchers for their clicking behavior.

I’m going to introduce you to the business ecosystem that has emerged in the last 15 years since the commercial internet began.  It is keeping competition authorities and communication regulators very busy.
Just last week the French Authority found that Google was dominant in search advertising and imposed interim measures.
Regulators will be getting busier because new firms are raising lots of complicated issues involving antitrust, consumer protection, and regulation: not only for themselves, but also for the traditional firms that these new ones are challenging, and for the industries that these new firms are disrupting.
Most of the firms that we’re going to talk about today are media firms that provide content to attract viewers and that sell access to these viewers to advertisers.  And we also will be talking about the communication firms that provide the internet connections that make all this possible.
But you’ll see that these categories-the 20th century labels of media and communications-don’t really do justice to the new forms of businesses that are emerging and that have become the subject of considerable controversy.
Let me introduce the ecosystem by describing three of the most significant firms today, and dazzling you with some numbers that tell us a lot about this new world.
400 million
That’s the number of active users of Facebook around the world.
On any given day, half of them log on.
500 billion
That’s the number of minutes they spend on Facebook over the course of a month.
The number of Facebook users more than doubled last year. It continues to grow like a mushroom around the world: about 5 percent a month.
So what is Facebook?
I’m going to revert to the language of the 20th century.
Facebook is a media company, plain and simple.                
It makes money by getting people to view pages just like a newspaper does. And then it sells advertisers the ability to presents ads to those people.
It is also a communications company. Just as plain and simple.
The average user on Facebook has 130 friends.  People use Facebook to interact with their friends.  Those who use social media a lot probably don’t use the phone so much anymore.  Why call a friend to chat about the great time you had last night when you can post a message and picture for all your friends?
Facebook is just one of the giant companies that have emerged in the last few year-and that provide media and communications services, in one fashion or another.
Most people, by the way, describe Facebook as a social networking company.  And that it is. It exploits our connections and the connections to our connections and so on.
Facebook is more than 7 times larger, based on unique visitors, than the next largest social networking company, which is MySpace. 
88 billion
That’s the number of Google searches each month as of the end of 2009.
Google makes most of its money from selling advertising: $23.6 billion worth in 2009.  When you search for something, Google often shows little text ads on top and to the right of the results.
In twentieth-century speak Google is sort of like the yellow pages.  But so much more because, as it says, its mission is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It has been working on digitizing all of the books in the world.  And then of course there are the roving vans that videotape the world-and perhaps more.
Google has more than an 80 percent share of searches and of advertising for searches in most countries outside of Asia.    
Almost half of online advertising spending in the United States goes to Google.  And more of advertising spending in the United States is going online.
Here’s a much smaller number for you.
34 million
That’s how many Apple iPhones that have been sold to date: a trivial fraction of the 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions around the world.
But Apple accounts for 40 percent of operating systems running on smart mobile phones.  Smart phones are basically little computers with browsers that are connected to the internet over a wireless connection. With one of them a person can get everything on the internet.
You might ask why I’m even mentioning Apple. It isn’t really a digital media company or a communications company. But it touches every company that is.  The iPhone provides a platform for digital media companies to reach viewers. Apple is also helping them sell advertising. 
Apple has made the mobile phone operators less relevant and less powerful.  It used to be that people chose a mobile operator and then selected one of the many phones they offered. Increasingly, people decide whether they want an iPhone or an Android and then choose the mobile operator that has the device they want.         
These companies wouldn’t be able to do anything without the internet.  That’s provided by a whole host of communications companies that generally operate in specific geographies.  In the United Kingdom, people get connected through telephone and cable companies such as British Telecom or through wireless providers such as Vodafone.  These firms are subject to traditional public utility regulation in most jurisdictions.
Each of the companies I’ve mentioned supports vast numbers of complementary businesses.
Facebook, Apple, and Google operate software platforms.  They encourage entrepreneurs to develop businesses that are based on applications that run on their platforms.  That was a secret to Microsoft’s success with Windows.  These new firms have ratcheted that business model up a level.
550,000+
That’s the number of active applications that are available for Facebook.  Many of them are trivial. But others like Farmville attract millions of users and make massive amounts of money mainly by selling virtual goods. Yes, you can actually make a small fortune selling a bunch of pixels that look like an artichoke to make-believe farmers.
150,000
That’s the number of applications for the iPhone. Many of these are also silly little things. There’s even an app for atheists. But others are the basis for standalone companies.  In the United States, late last year, the company Square introduced a way for small merchants to accept credit cards by attaching a small plastic device to iPhones that works with an application that installed on the phone. It is intended to be the basis for a significant payment system.
These numbers are growing quickly. In fact Apple, Facebook, and Google are propelling themselves forward through network effects. More users encourage more developers to write more applications.  More applications encourage more people to become users which encourage more applications.
We have gotten used to talking about the online world versus the physical world.  In developed economies, that will soon become like talking about places with electricity and places without electricity.  Many devices are getting connected to the internet and are relying on software in the cloud for services.  When you walk into a bricks and mortar store in the future you will be swiping your card through a device that is connected to the internet with software that resides in the cloud.
That the online world is sucking up the physical world is a very important development for media companies.  That brings me to the wars for the three screens.
There are about a billion desktop computers.  That has been where most internet content has been consumed and where most internet-based communication has taken place in most countries outside of Japan. Lots of battles for the desktop were fought over the last twenty years. We can declare some victors for the time being. Google trounced everyone else in search in the last decade. Microsoft became the standard operating system in the 1980s.
There are more than 4 billion mobile phone subscribers around the world. Many don’t have computers. Over time they will convert to smart phones. That’s where they will consume media and communicate.
Naturally there’s a fierce battle going on here.  Apple is in the lead. But Google developed the Android operating system and has gotten phone manufacturers to introduce phones for it. Already there are more than 50,000 applications for Android and Android phones outsold iPhones in the first quarter of this year. In Western Europe, Google’s Android has a 73 percent share of the operating systems running on smart mobile phones.
There are also more than 4 billion television viewers around the world.  Television accounts for about 35 percent of global advertising revenues.  A lot of effort has gone into bringing information technology to the living room. Billions were squandered in the last decade on services that people didn’t really want.
Google has just announced that it is introducing Google TV later this year. If you want to get a glimmer of the future, watch the two-minute video for Google TV on YouTube. The search giant has partnered with Sony and others to develop television sets to incorporate the same Android operating system that it has used so successfully for mobile phones.
If you look at the digital media and communications around the world today, Apple, Facebook and Google are the most significant firms: the ones who should keep each other, internet rivals, and traditional firms awake at night.
But this changes all very quickly. If I had given this talk four years I suspect I would have said that the Great War was going to be between Google and Microsoft.  Apple hadn’t launched the iPhone and the Facebook had only 18 million users. Ten years ago, when a district court found that Microsoft was a monopoly and ordered its breakup, it was hard to imagine a world that wasn’t controlled, like a puppet master, by this then young company.
Last week Microsoft pulled its new smart phone, designed for the young and hip, from the market because hardly anyone wanted to buy it.  Microsoft was leapfrogged first by Apple and just recently by Google in mobile phones. And it is nowhere after several failed attempts in television. As the New York Times reported on Monday, many young developers aren’t interested in writing for Microsoft platforms.
Today, Apple, Facebook, and Google look secure.  You could even say they are protected by an application barrier to entry. But if one thing has been demonstrated in the first fifteen years of the internet it is that nothing stays the same for long.  Who would have predicted the rise of Twitter a couple of years ago?  There were more than 75 million users the beginning of this year for this new form of digital media. And who would have forecast that MySpace, which used to own social networking, would now be a distant number two.
But these dynamics don’t mean that competition authorities should be any less vigilant here than in any other important sector of the economy.  At no time in history have we seen the emergence of firms that have become so significant on a global basis so quickly.
As these new giants strut around the world they throw off controversies for regulators like beads of sweat.
And they raise interesting issues. 
In many countries traditional communications and media firms are subject to regulation.  Does the emergence of these new media and communications firms mean that we should extend regulation to them; that we should abandon regulation of traditional firms; or something in between?
We have a lot of experience doing market definition.  But many of these new firms operate in multi-sided markets, which makes deciding on boundaries rather hard. Also, the extent to which the products of these new firms substitute for the products of traditional firms is changing very quickly.  Can standard methods cope under these circumstances and if not what should we do?
There are new issues, too, like privacy and the role of data.  Each day these and other companies take lots of data from us and use it to make lots of money for themselves. Should antitrust regulators consider changes in privacy as possible consumer harm, in evaluating mergers for example?
These are just some of the topics we’ll be touching on today and I suspect for many years to come.

John Vickers, Jun 30, 2009
One of the most controversial questions in current competition policy is when, if ever, should competition law require a firm with market power to share its property, notably intellectual property, with its rivals? And if supply is required, on what terms? These questions are discussed with reference to recent law cases including the EC Microsoft judgment of 2007 and the US linkLine case of 2009. The analysis focuses on whether competition law and regulation are complements or substitutes, and on incentives for investment and (sequential) innovation.

R. Hewitt Pate, Apr 24, 2008
Few judgments of the European Court of First Instance (CFI) have attracted as much attention or controversy as the decision in Microsoft Corporation v. European Commission. One aspect of the case dealt with Microsoft´s practice of bundling its own Windows Media Player application with its ubiquitous Windows operating system. The Court upheld a Commission decision that found Microsoft liable under Article 82 and, as a remedy, required Microsoft to produce and market an unbundled version of its operating system called Windows N. But Windows N has failed to sell in the marketplace, and the market position of competing media players has nonetheless grown. The ineffective remedy calls into question the liability analysis that came before it. This article examines possible alternative remedies for technological tying and concludes that no satisfactory remedy was open to the Commission or the Court. A more realistic liability analysis would have been appropriate, and the doctrine of objective justification could have provided a better analytical vehicle for resolving the case. By recognizing that, in the context of the software industry, technological bundling is the paradigm of progress, the Commission and the CFI might have avoided an ineffective and potentially dangerous foray into regulation of software design.

David Evans, Apr 24, 2008
A colloquy of articles on the European Court of First Instance (CFI) judgment in Microsoft Corporation v. European Commission (EC Microsoft) begins the Spring 2008 issue of Competition Policy International. The CFI´s September 2007 judgment capped an almost decade-long tussle between two powerful entities and is a significant statement by this influential court on the state of Article 82 EC jurisprudence. The first three papers in this series focus on the refusal-to-supply side of the case. We begin with John Vickers who compares aspects of the Microsoft matter to the Commission´s investigation and ultimate undertaking with IBM in the early 1980s. Eleanor Fox comments on Vickers article and is followed by Daniel Beard. Articles by Hew Pate and Kelyn Bacon address the tying abuse side of the case. Maurits Dolmans, who played a significant role for RealNetworks and other interveners that sided with the Commission, will publish a comment on Pate´s article in a forthcoming release of Global Competition Policy, our online magazine.
A symposium on consumer protection and antitrust follows the colloquy on the EC Microsoft case. The field of competition law and economics has shown increased interest in consumer protection partly as a result of recent work by economists on behavioral economics. This relatively new discipline studies how people actually make decisions and examines the implications, rather than, as is customary in economics, examining the ...

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Damien Gerard, Apr 23, 2008
The publication of the Discussion Paper in December 2005 sparked tremendous interest in the EC antitrust community and, indeed, much beyond. The Commission received no less than 107 contributions from all over the world in the framework of the public consultation and one cannot begin to estimate the number of seminars, colloquia, or symposia devoted to the enforcement of Article 82 EC in the months preceding and following the publication of the Discussion Paper. However, since the public hearing on June 14, 2006, silence has prevailed on the side of the Commission. Officially, it is “currently reflecting carefully on the comments received from the public and on the issues at stake, to determine the best way to move forward with the review.” That careful reflection has been ongoing for almost two years and no announcement has been made as to the outcome of the review process. Is the Commission likely to issue some sort of “Article 82 enforcement guidelines” any time soon? The fact is that, in spite of the silence of the Commission, a lot has happened on the Article 82 front since June 2006. In particular, the EC Courts have released five important judgments (Wanadoo, British Airways, Grane Punkt, Microsoft, and Deutsche Telekom) since then, dealing with most of the issues addressed in the Discussion Paper (and more). In all of these cases, the EC Courts hav...

Youngjin Jung, Sang-Seung Yi, Nov 05, 2007
For a relatively young agency with only a quarter-century history, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) has achieved some remarkable success in cartel enforcement and competition advocacy. However, its track record in enforcing merger control leaves much to be desired and its recent ambitious foray into regulating unilateral conduct by global firms such as Microsoft has received a mixed review. In order to achieve its aspiration to be recognized as a global force in antitrust for which it has already made significant progress the KFTC should take measures to encourage private suits, strengthen its economic analysis unit, fundamentally overhaul chaebol (large Korean conglomerates) regulation, establish a Chinese wall between its investigative and adjudicative offices and personnel, and reinforce its efforts to guarantee proper procedural rights to defendants. In taking these steps, the KFTC can grow from its current new kid on the block status to a leader in global antitrust.

Daniel Spulber, Sep 18, 2007
The European Court of First Instance, through its decision in Microsoft v. Commission, dealt a one-two punch to incentives to innovate. First, by penalizing Microsoft for bundling its Media Player with Windows, the court will make companies reluctant to add innovative features to their products. Second, by sanctioning Microsoft for not disclosing fundamental innovations to its server software to its rivals, the court will make companies think twice before investing in costly research and development (R&D). The deterrence of innovation does not stop there. The Court’s decision also deters innovation by competitors of leading firms. Why invest in costly R&D, when you can get it for free from the leading company in your industry? Simply send the leading company a request for the use of any and all of its innovations, and threaten to complain to the antitrust authorities if there is not full compliance. Since a leading company’s failure to supply the innovation is ruled to be an “abuse,” companies with smaller market shares will know where to obtain free innovations.

This piece was originally published on the author’s Management R&D blog, and is reprinted here with the permission of the author. The original post, and comments thereto, may be found here.
Every MBA program in every country teaches students to compete using the “four P’s” of marketing: price, product, place, and promotion. So when Microsoft began distributing its media player with its operating system, it would seem that it was competing by taking advantage of its low cost distribution channel (“place”) and by improving functionality (“product.”) Not so fast. Today, the Court of First Instance ratified the European Commission’s case against Microsoft, accusing it of “abusing its dominant position” by bundling its media player with Windows, and by refusing to supply “inter-operability information” to competitors. The Court seemed to be saying that because Microsoft was taking advantage of its advantages, it violated the antitrust laws. Disappointingly, the Court failed to articulate a principle that would tell firms when they are competing on the merits and when they are going to violate the increasingly murky European antitrust rules about dominant firm behavior. And, in an unfortunate choice of words that invites criticism from those who remember the bad old days of antitrust, the Court seemed to admit t...

1063,"April 19, 2007",Holding Innovation to an Antitrust Standard,"
Richard Gilbert, Apr 19, 2007
Several antitrust cases have involved allegations of anticompetitive innovation or product design and some plaintiffs and antitrust scholars have argued that investment in research and development that excludes competition can have predatory effects similar to predatory pricing. This article analyzes several tests for predatory innovation, including the rule of reason based on total and consumer welfare and profit sacrifice tests. All of these tests are likely to produce false positives that chill incentives for beneficial investments in research and development. Most courts that have considered allegations of anticompetitive innovation, including the appellate court in U.S. v. Microsoft, have concluded that innovation is not anticompetitive if it has plausible efficiencies. This is close to a test of whether innovation is a sham. While a sham test may fail to identify innovations that harm competition, that risk is acceptable given the high cost of penalizing beneficial innovation.

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Frank Fisher, Apr 05, 2007
The question of how to design remedies in Section 2 cases is not an easy one. Unlike prospective mergers, which can be blocked, or price-fixing and other collusion cases, where actions can be enjoined, single-firm monopoly cases even when won on liability can founder on remedy design. Structural relief can be seen as too drastic, and injunctive relief can simply turn into an effort to prohibit actions already in the past and already obsolete or can require continued (and perhaps continual) judicial supervision.
Too often in the past, the antitrust authorities have failed adequately to consider the problem of remedies, and I am glad to see this set of hearings taking place.
In these remarks, I first discuss the desirable objectives that a Section 2 remedy (or, perhaps, any antitrust remedy) should have, and then go on to a discussion of the Microsoft case.
1. Principles and Objectives Please note that the following objectives are not necessarily listed in order of importance. Further, be aware that, even if an objective is obtainable considered alone, it may conflict with other objectives.
A. Restore competition. A primary objective should surely be the undoing of the anticompetitive effects of the violation. If possible, a remedy should restore the market or markets to the state in which they would have been had the violation not taken place. Of course, this may not be possible. Indee...

Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, John Ratliff, Apr 01, 2005
Commissioner Mario Monti’s impact on Article 82 of the EC Treaty during his period as EC Competition Commissioner has not been as revolutionary as his impact on other areas of EC competition law. Nonetheless, the European Commission has done serious work on Article 82 cases, notably taking several important decisions: Microsoft in the area of refusal to supply and tying and Michelin II on rebates. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the Court of First Instance (CFI) have also made important contributions to the law on Article 82 with their judgments in IMS Health and in appeals from these rebates cases.

But it has been hard to find robust methods for identifying anticompetitive ties. In most countries the law has taken a less forgiving approach to tying than the economics literature. To paraphrase U.S. Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter: there’s nothing redeeming about tying. Such skepticism led U.S. courts for many years to make tying by firms with market power a per se violation. This doctrine has been relaxed slightly over time, but tying is still treated much more harshly than other unilateral practices. There is an ongoing debate in the competition policy community on whether tying with market power should remain essentially per se illegal, be made lawful as the Chicago School urged, or be subject to some sort of rule of reason analysis.
The lead article by Jean Tirole and thoughtful comments by Dennis Carlton and Michael Waldman and by Barry Nalebuff offer recommendations for going forward from four economists who have made seminal contributions to the scholarly literature on tying and its effects. This issue...
