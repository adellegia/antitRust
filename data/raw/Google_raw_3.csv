This week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposed that Congress make revisions to federal internet regulations that would require platforms to have systems in place for identifying and removing unlawful content.
The proposal, which Zuckerberg presented during his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, March 25, would raise the bar for social media companies that are currently granted immunity from liability for the content that appears on their platforms. That immunity, granted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, has come under fire in recent years from Republicans and Democrats.
While meant to ensure that companies are taking action against unlawful content, the changes could theoretically shore up Facebook’s power, as well as that of other internet giants like Google, by requiring smaller social media companies and startups to develop robust content moderation systems that can be costly.
“Instead of being granted immunity, platforms should be required to demonstrate that they have systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it,” Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, according to written testimony released on the House Committee website Wednesday.
Under Section 230, Facebook, Google, and other internet giants bear no legal liability for content that appears on their platforms. Zuckerberg’s proposal would keep those protections in place, but would make platforms liable for having systems to protect against unlawful content.
“Platforms should not be held liable if a particular piece of content evades its detection — that would be impractical for platforms with billions of posts per day — but they should be required to have adequate systems in place to address unlawful content,” he said, according to the written testimony.

Democratic Representative David Cicilline, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, is preparing to come out with 10 or more pieces of legislation targeting Big Tech companies, Reuters reported.
The subcommittee, under Cicilline’s leadership, released a 449-page report in October last year, which detailed abuses of market power by Apple, Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, and Facebook.
The strategy to produce a series of smaller bills is aimed at lowering opposition from tech companies and their lobbyists towards a single piece of legislation, Reuters’ source said.
Cicilline is also working on a separate bill targeting a key law called Section 230, which offers protection to tech platforms from liability over content users post, the source said.
His 230 legislation is likely to go after platforms such as Facebook and the way they amplify user content.

US President Joe Biden intends to nominate Lina Khan, a former counsel to the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, to be a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the White House announced on Monday, March 22.
Lina Khan is an associate professor of law at Columbia Law School, where she teaches and writes about antitrust law, infrastructure industries law, and the antimonopoly tradition. Her antitrust scholarship has received several awards and has been published by the Yale Law Journal, Harvard Law Review, Columbia Law Review, and University of Chicago Law Review. 
Khan previously served as counsel to the US House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, where she helped lead the Subcommittee’s investigation into digital markets. Khan was also a legal advisor in the office of Commissioner Rohit Chopra at the Federal Trade Commission and legal director at the Open Markets Institute. She is a graduate of Williams College and Yale Law School.
Khan’s nomination follows the appointment of Tim Wu, a Columbia Law professor, to work on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Wu coined the term “net neutrality” and has been a prominent voice on the subject of antitrust regulation against Big Tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
Biden’s choice of Khan to serve at the FTC comes as regulators, lawmakers, and the courts are facing immense pressure to take on Big Tech. The House Judiciary kicked off the second leg of its antitrust investigation last month and it’s poised to introduce competition legislation to rein in tech this spring.

Britain’s competition regulator is set to begin an antitrust investigation into Facebook in the next few months, after similar actions into Google and Apple early this year, the Financial Times reported on Friday, March 19.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would look into the way Facebook allegedly uses customer data against rivals in social media and online advertising, people close to the matter told FT.
The investigation is also likely to examine Facebook’s status as a so-called gatekeeper for its ability to collect data from users to boost its advantage over rivals.
A person close to the CMA said the probe would draw on the regulator’s report on digital advertising, which highlighted the “strong incumbency advantage” Facebook benefited from in areas such as online ads and social media.
The timing of the official announcement of the probe and the exact concerns could still shift, these people warned. But legal experts said Facebook had so far escaped the intense scrutiny its rivals were facing in the UK, so there would be a strong appetite among regulators to pursue a case.

In 2021, EU antitrust horizons will be wide and enthralling: EU competition law and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this matter have seen many interesting developments in the course of the last years, and there are many exciting developments yet to come. This paper singles out particularly relevant and trendsetting evolutions in three fields that will occupy the Court of Justice and the General Court in 2021 and beyond: private enforcement of EU competition law; the per-object/per-effect-distinction as regards infringements of Article 101 TFEU; and new challenges brought about by the development of new digital markets and distribution channels and the digitalization of commercial practices.

The EU Court of Justice (“ECJ”), in particular, will soon again be called upon to decide on fundamental issues, be it, for instance, the inspection powers of the European Commission and the corresponding rights of the parties to judicial review2 or the application of the ne bis in idem principle in the field of competition law,3 to name just two outstanding topics currently pending before the ECJ.

6,"March 19, 2021",Economic Evidence and Modern Antitrust,"
The question of the continued relevance, persuasiveness, and sufficiency of economic evidence in assessments of antitrust matters in the digital age has become of increasing interest to commentators, academics, and regulatory and legislative bodies. A closely related question is the contention by some commentators that the courts’ narrow focus on the consumer welfare standard is ill-suited for dealing with the complexities of today’s world. In our view, the consumer welfare standard remains the gold standard for the analysis of antitrust concerns in the digital age. Beyond using consumer welfare as a metric for evaluating potential anticompetitive impact, the use of rigorous, fact-based economic analysis, matched to today’s market complexities, is more important than ever in helping develop a better understanding of the evolving digital world. A better understanding, in turn, will be crucial in helping the appropriate authorities legislate and regulate in ways that ensure strong competition without jeopardizing the benefits that result from the digital revolution.

7,"March 19, 2021",In Comity We Trust: Utilizing International Comity to Strengthen International Cooperation and Enforcement Convergence in Multijurisdictional Matters,"
Competition authorities across the world have taken increasingly divergent enforcement approaches, including in respect of the conduct of companies involved in the high technology and digital markets. New regulatory developments may further accentuate such divergence, increasing the risk of inefficient and conflicting regulatory efforts. With these trends, there is a greater need for competition authorities to advance international cooperation efforts and convergence on enforcement, particularly when enforcers with sufficient parallels in competition laws and enforcement principles are involved. This article proposes that the application of international comity principles would helpfully promote international cooperation and convergence on multijurisdictional enforcement, creating a “win-win” for competition authorities and the respondent businesses subject to competition scrutiny in the form of consistency, predictability and efficiency. In advancing this thesis, this article proposes five considerations where international comity can helpfully promote international cooperation and enforcement convergence in multijurisdictional matters.

8,"March 19, 2021",Do Algorithms Communicate With Each Other and What Does This Mean for the Application of Competition/Antitrust Law?,"
One of the issues for discussion among scholars of competition law in the digital space is collusion, and the ineffectiveness of competition law to deal with collusion that is driven by algorithms and not humans. This ineffectiveness is based on several assumptions, with the main being that humans, and not algorithms, have the ability to communicate. In this article, I put forward some arguments to challenge this view. I outline how algorithms “communicate,” if they communicate, and discuss if such communication can be perceived as communication for the purposes of competition law. Collusion cannot happen without communication and, therefore, communication is the first essential step for anti-competitive collusion to exist. The manner in which we perceive algorithms and their interactions thus determines whether specific legal requirements of anti-competitive collusion can be applied to algorithmic collusion or not.

In recent years we have seen a rich discussion, legislative proposals and even application of competition law2 with regards to large digital platforms.3 It is reasonable to assume that this is just the beginning of addressing the existing and potential anticompetitive issues in the digital space.

9,"March 19, 2021",The Antitrust Attack on Big Tech,"
The four major internet platforms – Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook – have in recent months been subjected to increasing attacks on antitrust grounds. These attacks have been generated by various entities in the federal legislature and by the threat of individual lawsuits, some by one of the platforms against another. The subject of these attacks is the sheer size of the platforms themselves, though it is also alleged that various of the platforms engage in unfair practices that benefit their own products over those of competitors. This essay argues that these antitrust attacks ignore the character of the platforms as network industries. Network industries are different from well-known monopolies because consumers benefit, rather than are harmed, as the network expands. As a consequence, none of the attacks can demonstrate harm to consumers, the overriding standard of interpretation of the antitrust laws.

There is a current effort in the U.S. and abroad to employ the antitrust laws to attack Big Tech firms. “Big Tech” refers to the current four major internet platforms — Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. These firms are variously accused of being monopolies and that on that ground should be broken up; of being monopolies illegally acquired by the acquisition of smaller competitors with the demand of divestiture of the previously acquired entities; or of engaging in practices, in particular the preference of their own or relat...

Targeted at Big Tech, Section 19a of the Competition Act, Germany’s new antitrust tool for dealing with large digital platforms, rebalances power in favor of the German competition authority. Under the new tool, the authority may declare that a firm is of “paramount significance for competition across markets” and prohibit it from certain specified practices presumed to be unlawful. The addressed firms carry the burden of proving the practice’s countervailing procompetitive or efficiency-enhancing effects. Decisions by the German competition authority under Section 19a can only be challenged at the German Federal Court of Justice as the first and only avenue of appeal. We identify the advances and shortcomings of this new tool, as well as the opportunities and risks, when it comes to employing it in the field.

So welcome to the third installment of our series on antitrust and platforms in the digital economy. This one is called Analyzing the Antitrust Remedies in Digital Markets. And today’s discussion is especially interesting because we are going to dive into what the potential remedies are for perceived antitrust issues surrounding digital platforms and all their different shapes and sizes.
So, while the previous panels discussed how governments overseas are dealing with antitrust issues in digital markets versus how the US authorities are dealing with them, and then also how the U.S administration is looking at enforcement and reform in this area.

News Corp has struck a three-year deal to provide news to Facebook in Australia, ending a battle between two billionaire-owned empires being watched worldwide as a possible template for regulating Big Tech, reported The Financial Times.
The Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher announced on Monday, March 15, the agreement would allow it to “provide access to trusted news and information to millions of Facebook users” in the country through the social media network’s dedicated news tab. Financial details were not disclosed.
The deal includes content from The Australian newspaper, the Sydney-based Daily Telegraph, and the Melbourne-based Herald Sun as well as regional publications, News Corp said in a statement. The pay television channel Sky News Australia has reached a parallel deal, it added. 
The agreements come after Australia last month passed a controversial law designed to force major technology platforms such as Facebook and Google to pay publishers for news content.
Online platforms have grabbed the vast majority of digital advertising, sapping traditional publishers of resources to cover local and regional news. Lawmakers in the US, UK, and Canada have suggested taking similar steps to shift commercial power towards struggling news outlets.

Dear Readers,
The Asia Pacific region – broadly defined – is key to the global economy. Global supply chains depend critically on the economic functioning of this part of the world. In its broad definition, “Asia-Pacific” includes South, East, and Southeast Asia, as well as Oceania. An understanding of this region is essential to any global understanding of antitrust.
The articles in this Chronicle include contributions from the entire Pacific rim. The topics covered range from the regulation of digital advertising in Japan, to the development of the mobile app ecosystem in India, to the controversy concerning online news in Australia.
The topics explored in these pieces reflect the state of the art in antitrust thinking, while also referring back to general themes that have long informed such thinking worldwide.
As such, they run the gamut of the issues specifically affecting the Asia Pacific region, but also are of great relevance to readers worldwide.

15,"March 12, 2021",Regulating Digital Ads: Is a Global Approach the Way Forward for Japan and Other Advanced Economies?,"
This article addresses the problem of the regulation of digital advertising in Japan from a comparative and global perspective. There are a number of possible concerns about digital advertising, ranging from the lack of transparency of transactions and “unfair” conduct to conflicts of interest and self-preferencing by certain operators, from the way personal data are gathered and used to excessive concentration and market power in the supply chain. Several reports have been produced, including in the United Kingdom, in Australia, in Japan, and in a number of EU Member States. The European Commission’s proposals for a Digital Markets Act and for a Digital Services Act, if adopted, would introduce regulation that would also apply to online advertising. This paper examines the potential concerns that have been identified, focusing on the Interim Report by the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition of the Japanese Cabinet Office of Japan and comparing it to regulatory initiatives in the European Union and the United Kingdom. It concludes that an international approach should be adopted, with the right mix of Government intervention, under the aegis of institutions such as UNCTAD, UNCITRAL or the OECD, and Government-backed industry self-regulation. This is the only way to avoid regulatory unilateralism, which would fragment markets, hinder trade and ultimately harm business and consumers world-wide, depriving them of the benefits that the digital economy has already b...

Across the globe, regulators continue to question the extent of current competition laws and policies following the rise of digital platforms, big data, fintechs, and e-commerce which has led to different jurisdictions adopting different approaches. This paper provides a glimpse on online platforms’ role in digital transformation and highlights common competition issues observed. Findings show that competition is not hindered by digital platforms but rather enhanced. It is also found that digital platforms can also play a crucial role as the world begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, the paper emphasizes the need for regulatory harmonization to avoid fragmentation and better clarity on the problems that regulations aim to tackle. These components in tandem can help create a global policy mindset and bring competition laws in line with current developments.

17,"March 12, 2021",The Digital Coase Theorem and the News,"
The rise of news aggregator apps has spurred legislative initiative across the globe due to the lawmakers’ ability to represent the interest of local trade associations – namely, traditional news publishers. To a perceived problem, the traditional approach has consistently been to identify the negative externalities created by news aggregator apps at the expense of traditional news publishers. The traditional approach nevertheless lies upon numerous pitfalls and a partial analysis of the situation, hence favoring inefficient outcomes. This Article offers an alternative approach. This approach spawns from the tradition first incepted by Nobel Prize Laureate Ronald Coase. Applying the Coase Theorem to the digital journalism problem identified, this Article proposes a “Digital Coase Theorem” where an efficient outcome is reached and where innovation is optimally incentivized.

By Dr. Geeta Gouri1
 
The fundamental question for any competition authority in its assessment of a market is: “What to regulate”? To address this question, the law identifies possible abuses in which an enterprise or firm could potentially engage. Any follow-up action is then defined by how and when to regulate. The economics of defining and measuring the market power of dominant enterprises are well-honed and tested in mature competition regimes such as the U.S. and Europe. Competition agencies in new market regimes lean heavily on the structure of these laws and the decisions of these two jurisdictions. In India, the bias tends to be more European. Case references and arguments used by lawyers before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) typically refer to decisions of the EU Commission with occasional reference to the U.S. FTC/DOJ.

20,"March 10, 2021",Bi-Partisan Lawmakers Plan Antitrust Bills To Protect News Media,"


A bipartisan group of US lawmakers led by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representative David Cicilline will introduce legislation on Wednesday aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook, reported Reuters.
The bill comes not long after Facebook had a pitched battle with Australia over how much publishers should make from their social media pages. During the fight, Facebook blacked out Australian news pages and only restored them once the government granted concessions. It also promised a $1 billion investment in the news industry.
Senator John Kennedy and Representative Ken Buck, both Republicans, said they will also sponsor the bills. Klobucar and Cicilline are both Democrats.
The measure would allow print, broadcast or digital news organizations to work together to win better deals from Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google during a four-year period, when they would not be subject to antitrust laws. The bill would require the negotiations to aid news publishers generally rather than a small number.
Klobuchar said she was optimistic about the possibility of the measure’s becoming law because of the growing concern of lawmakers from both parties about monopolies. “Tech has no mercy,” she said, saying the bills would allow negotiations on “everything from advertising revenue to access to information on subscribers.”
She noted that most people now get their news online through Facebook and Google.
Social media companies use news to attract users and have been accused by news publishers of not sharing enough advertising revenue with them. The legislation could boost revenues.
The news industry is undeniably struggling, with employment at U.S. newspapers down by half since 2008 amid tumbling advertising revenue and changing media habits, according to data from Pew Research.
“This bill will give hardworking local reporters and publishers the helping hand they need right now, so they can continue to do their important work,” Cicilline said in a statement.
Smaller publishers using Google’s ad sales technology have for years complained about their bigger competitors getting more favorable revenue-sharing deals from the search giant.
The House of Representatives Judiciary antitrust panel, which Cicilline chairs, will hold a hearing on the matter on Friday.

Thom Tillis, and supported by several outside groups. 
“For too long, our two-headed antitrust enforcement system has suffered from bureaucratic in-fighting, delays, redundancies, and inconsistency. Competition is too important to tolerate these problems any longer, especially when they allow sophisticated players to game the system to their own advantage and avoid accountability for engaging in anticompetitive behavior,” Sen. Lee said. 
“It’s time to right the ship by consolidating and strengthening our antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. The Department is more politically accountable, and its structure is better suited to the decisive enforcement we need to better protect American consumers.”
“I’m a strong proponent of antitrust enforcement, especially in the case of intellectual property protections,” said Sen. Tillis. “Antitrust has a valuable role to play in ensuring that Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter can’t simply use their market power to steal creators’ content. But our current antitrust enforcement system—split between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission—simply isn’t working anymore. It hasn’t been for years. For too long, unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats at the FTC have pursued overly partisan enforcement actions which are entirely disconnected from economic reality. It’s past time that antitrust enforcement be handled solely by a politically accountable entity. I am proud to work with my colleagues on this long-overdue bill to ensure proper enforcement of antitrust laws through an improved, more streamlined process.”

Vanita Gupta, President Joe Biden’s nominee for the Justice Department’s No. 3 post, said on Tuesday that she doubts that big tech companies would be excited about her being confirmed and promised to pursue vigorous enforcement of antitrust law, reported Reuters. 
The US Senate Judiciary Committee conducted a confirmation hearing for the Democratic president’s nominations of Gupta as associate attorney general and Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general, the department’s No. 2 job.
Gupta said she plans to bring the full force of US antitrust laws to bear to protect competition.
Among other responsibilities if confirmed by the Senate, Gupta would oversee the department’s Antitrust Division. The department sued Alphabet’s Google last year for allegedly breaking antitrust law and has other investigations of big tech companies underway. Biden has not yet made his nomination to head the Antitrust Division.
Gupta was asked during the hearing about her relations with the big tech firms such as Amazon, Apple and Facebook, which are accused of abusing their powerful platforms.
“I will just say based on my prior engagements with tech companies, I would highly doubt that they would be excited necessarily about my confirmation,” Gupta told the senators.
“My role as a civil rights lawyer has been to push the tech companies very hard on any number of issues,” Gupta added. “If I am confirmed as associate attorney general, I will bring the full force of our country’s antitrust laws to bear to protect competition which is so core to our economy and to protecting consumers.”

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the first episode of our series Antitrust in a Digital World: Does It Work?. Read below to see the discussion about What Is Next for the Digital Markets Act?.

Morgane TAYLOR:
Good afternoon everyone, or good morning, wherever you’re placed in the world. I’m Morgane Taylor, from The App Association, in case you just joined us. I would like to welcome you to this first session of antitrust in the digital world series, organized jointly by The App Association and Competition Policy International. We have distinguished panelists with us today. And for this session we’ll focus mainly on developments happening in the European Union. With the European Commission, which released a Digital Market Act in December 2020, to regulate online platforms.
And the proposal ends up bringing more fairness and contest-ability in digital markets, and creates new obligations for online platform acting as gatekeepers. So this text will radically change the way digital platforms are allowed to operate in the EU, and will have far reaching consequences on those that do business with them, such as tech SMEs or smaller app developers. And whilst this proposal has many unanswered questions as regards to its implications for the future of European digital economy.
And to talk about this today, I have with me Dirk Auer, Senior Fellow in law and economics at International Center for Law and Economics, and Adjunct Professor...

24,"March 8, 2021",Can We Teach Antitrust to an Algorithm?,"

By Giovanna Massarotto* & Ashwin Ittoo**
 
The answer is “Yes.” Prof. Ashwin Ittoo and I have built a machine learning (“ML”) algorithm — an AI application — to assist antitrust agencies in enforcing antitrust (“AML”).1
 
1. Why an ML algorithm?
ML is the main AI application2 and it is commonly referred as weak AI, because the algorithm is not intelligent by itself but rather learns from a large amount of data — big data. Thanks to an increasingly high-speed internet connectivity and devices, such as smartphones, we are always online and data has become today’s most valuable resource.3  Today, most companies are jumping into the data industry to exploit data in the field of AI and create new applications. Data and AI techniques can be used to create a variety of different AI applications in any sectors, including Siri speech recognition or AI techniques to suggest movies that we might like on Netflix. There are a number of AI techniques, which are mainly distinguished into two macro categories: supervised (“SL”) and unsupervised learning (“UL”). The main difference is that a supervised algorithm is fed by a large amount of data and learns a specific task you ask for. In other words, you provide data classified into variables and you ask the algorithm to identify the value related to a specific variable. In unsupervised learning such as clustering, which we adopted in our ML, you do not ask the algorithm to find something in particular (namely learn a specific task) but allow the algorithm to learn completely on its own. Unlike SL, in UL the algorithm looks for identifying rules or associations from data—there is no prior training or exploration phases.4
 
2. AML
In the development of our AML we started analyzing data from my book “Antitrust Settlements — How a Simple Agreement Can Drive the Economy” which analyzed a large amount of antitrust cases in the two main antitrust jurisdictions — the U.S. and EU. But we soon realized that there were too many differences in these two jurisdictions and our algorithm was unable to identify any useful patterns from recent cases. Thus, we selected the U.S. jurisdiction by focusing on the FTC’s enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act. The DOJ and the FTC have different powers and tasks, although some might overlap.5 We did not include mergers, but rather focused on Section 5 of the FTC Act cases, which are settled through consent decrees over 90 percent of the time.6 We selected about seventy cases of these Section 5 proceedings settled by means of consent decrees and classified them into variables, such as industry, types of conduct, and remedies. Initially there were thirteen variables, including the industry; three different types of investigated conduct, and four remedies, distinguishing between structural and behavioral remedies.
Having collected and classified our data in a dataset we applied different AI techniques. We used UL methods as we thought it would be more interesting to see what the algorithm would learn on its own rather than asking the algorithm to perform a specific task (find a specific variable). More specifically, we used clustering methods to attempt to automatically identify similar cases in our dataset. We investigated three different clustering algorithms, namely K-Means, Bisecting K-Means and K-Modes, to determine which one was most suitable for our task. In addition, we also determined which features (characteristics/variables) of the cases were the most pertinent. To this aim, we relied on two SL methods, viz. Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. The results (in terms of feature importance) of these two methods corroborated each other.
Overall, we were interested in understanding whether a similar algorithm could be built to suggest possible anticompetitive practices to the FTC, as well as what remedies to enforce.
   
3. AML Results
Having adopted different ML techniques, the best performing algorithm detected four clusters. We tested these four clusters and their variables to identify those that were more informative. In particular, some insightful results have been revealed from cluster 4, which mainly clustered price-fixing cases in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry by suggesting “limitation in the exchange of information” and “compliance obligations” as remedies. Cluster 3 seems to suggest that, in cases where the FTC investigated merely one anticompetitive practice or two, the agency imposes no remedies or a selection of remedies, including “compliance obligation,” “the implementation of a compliance program,” or “limitation in the exchange of information.” Cluster 2 concerns cases where the FTC investigated more than two anticompetitive practices by adopting “compliance obligations” as remedy by default. The second remedy suggested in this cluster is “limitation in the exchange of information,” which makes antitrust sense, as seventy percent of cases detected in this cluster are concerned with “conspiracy” conduct. Finally, cluster 1 is interesting as it clustered cases from the healthcare industry with those from the computer industry by detecting similar conduct.
We also tested and analyzed the variables from both an antitrust and technical perspective. From a technical point of view, the different techniques revealed four different types of conduct and one remedy as the most informative variables. In short, the distinction between structural and behavioral remedies, the year, the name of cases, and other remedies that we used as variables to classify antitrust cases were excluded. From an antitrust perspective the exclusion of these variables make sense. Section 5 of the FTC Act has not changed over time, antitrust conducts are prosecuted in all industries in the same way, although in some industries some anticompetitive practices are, as we have seen, more common. The distinction between structural and behavioral remedies looks meaningless, as we identified the type of conduct in more detail (e.g. price fixing, exchange of information, and refusal to deal).
 
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that teaching antitrust to an algorithm is actually feasible, as both the clusters and variables that our ML detected seem to make antitrust sense. We admit that AI cannot replace the FTC. However, AI methods can be useful in making antitrust enforcement actions faster and more efficient. Moreover, we noted that these tools can make antitrust enforcement more predictable for companies. Thus, this would help market players to better understand what can and cannot be considered anticompetitive, in addition to suggesting procompetitive remedies to adopt if a specific anticompetitive practice is detected.
In summary, we do not actually think that AI techniques can replace antitrust enforcers. But we do believe that antitrust enforcers can exploit AI methods to make their work more efficient in today’s fast-moving technological markets.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) plotted out a multi-pronged approach to taking on the power of dominant tech firms like Facebook and Google in a speech for a Verge Live event Monday, March 1. In her remarks, Klobuchar called for the passage of legislation addressing issues from competition to data privacy and content moderation.
“We need to be asking more from Big Tech companies, not less,” Klobuchar said in her speech. “We have seen that how they operate has real life effects on the safety and civil rights for all of us as well as on our democracy. Holding them accountable for problems that can lead to real-world harm is critical to our success.”
Klobuchar leads the Senate’s top antitrust subcommittee, positioning the Minnesota Democrat as one of the most important legislators in the debate over tech reform. Last month, she introduced a sweeping bill to revamp US antitrust enforcement. Klobuchar’s Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act would provide law enforcement with more resources to take competition cases to court.

26,"February 26, 2021",Waiting for Change—Antitrust in Distribution in Early 2021,"
By: Steven J. Cernak (The Antitrust Attorney)
Recently, I was researching antitrust developments in 2020 to update my Antitrust in Distribution and Franchising book.  While there were several developments last year, what struck me was the large number of potentially drastic changes to antitrust distribution law that started to play out in 2020 but are continuing into 2021.  Whether you think of them as shoes to drop or dogs yet to bark, these three potential changes are the key ones to watch in 2021.
Legislative Changes to the Antitrust Laws?
In the Fall of 2020, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee issued its Majority Report on its lengthy Investigation into Digital Markets. While the bulk of the Report focused on a few big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, the Report also recommended that Congress override several “classic antitrust cases” that allegedly misinterpreted antitrust law applicable to all companies.  Because we have covered several of those recommendations in detail already (see below), I will just focus on potential applications to distribution here…

27,"February 26, 2021",New Enforcement Tool Against Abusive Market Conduct,"
By: Lars Mesenbrink and Julius Schradin (Antitrust Watch)
In a nutshell:
What’s new?Introduction of the Concept of Intermediation Power: A dominant position can as of now also result from intermediation services of a company that is active in multisided markets.The German competition authority now has a new tool for intervention aiming at some types of large platforms’ conduct and other companies for which the authority established a so-called “paramount cross-market significance for competition”.Action items for our clientsFollow the Federal Cartel Office’s approach with the new tool closely – we will keep you posted.
In detail:
The 10th amendment carries the name “Act amending the Act against Restraints of Competition for a focused, proactive and digital Competition Law 4.0 and other provisions (ARC Digitization Act)” and, as the name suggests, comprises the legislature’s intent to adapt German competition regulation to the new competitive environment in digital markets, in particular with respect to the controversial behavior of “gatekeeper” companies with superior market power like Google and Amazon. Hence, a core element of the amendment is the modernization of regulations on the control of abusive practices, in particular, the introduction of a new section 19a ARC (Act against Restraints of Competition) on abusive conduct of companies with a paramount cross-market significance for competition.
For the first time, section 19a ARC enables the Federal Cartel Office to intervene at an early stage in the event of threats to competition from certain large companies by determining that a company, which is active to a considerable extent in multisided markets, is of paramount importance for competition across markets, i.e., companies whose strategic position and resources make them particularly important for competition across markets. Under specific circumstances, the Federal Cartel Office can preventively prohibit such companies from certain practices, including:
1. Prohibition of “self-preferencing”, i.e., prohibition of giving preferential treatment to the company’s own offerings over those of competitors, in particular in terms of presentation and pre-installing exclusively the company’s own offerings on devices (a situation prominently discussed in the “Google-Shopping” case of the EU Commission)…

28,"February 25, 2021",Congress Warns Big Tech: “Change Is Coming. Laws Are Coming”,"


The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held the first in a planned series of hearings to “consider legislative proposals to address the rise and abuse of market power online and to modernize the antitrust laws,” reported Bloomberg.
“This problem is a cancer that is metastasizing across our economy and our country,” Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), chairman of the subcommittee, said in an opening statement. “Mark my words: Change is coming. Laws are coming.”
Ranking member Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado) said bipartisan regulation is possible for funding for antitrust regulators, as well as reforming the burden of proof in merger cases.
The hearing follows the findings of the panel’s 16-month investigation of tech companies released last year. The report determined that Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple have all abused their gatekeeper power over the digital economy.
The committee’s report recommended a series of far-reaching antitrust reforms, including a measure that would prohibit a dominant tech platform from operating in competition with the firms dependent on it — much the way banking laws once barred large lenders from acquiring insurers, real estate firms, and other non-banking companies. The committee also recommended restrictions on acquisitions by dominant firms.
Hal Singer, an antitrust economist, told lawmakers there is an “urgent need” to reform competition laws. “Recent developments imply that certain platforms have accumulated so much economic and political power that they may not be governable, which militates in favor of cutting them down in size,” he said.
Democrats are looking to capitalize on control of Congress to pass antitrust reform in response to evidence that industries across the US economy have grown more concentrated, with many markets suffering from signs of declining competition. Competition policy is increasingly seen as a mechanism to combat economic woes such as income inequality and stagnant wages.
In the Senate, Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced legislation earlier this month that would clamp down on mergers by making it easier for antitrust enforcers to stop deals.
Antitrust reform has Republican support. Representative Ken Buck, the ranking member of the antitrust panel, said tech companies “are able to act with complete impunity because of their status as monopolies.”

29,"February 24, 2021",DOJ Looks Into Complaints Regarding The “Sign In With Apple” Button,"


Apple has been facing several accusations of anti-competitive practices in multiple countries as investigations into the company’s dominant position go on. Now the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into the fact that Apple forces developers to adopt the “Sign in with Apple” button if the app has other third-party login methods.
As reported by The Information, investigators want to know if the “Sign in with Apple” button makes it harder for users to migrate to another platform, such as Android or Windows. While some members of Congress praise Apple for its privacy efforts, others believe that the company has been abusing its control over the software on its devices to harm its competitors.
Sources for the report said that some developers began filing complaints about the sign-in button with US investigators last summer. “Sign in with Apple” was introduced in 2019 as an easy and secure way to create an account on apps and websites using just an Apple ID.
However, while using “Sign in with Apple” in iOS and Mac apps is somewhat optional for developers, Apple forces them to use its own solution if the app already offers login through Facebook, Google, or other services. Two developers told the DOJ that they removed all sign-in buttons from their apps only because they didn’t want to adopt Apple’s button.

30,"February 23, 2021",Facebook Reaches Deal With Australia To Restore News Sharing,"


Facebook will restore news pages in Australia after the government agreed to change a proposed law forcing tech companies to pay publishers for news content.
“Facebook has refriended Australia,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.
The proposal would force Google and Facebook to pay Australian news publishers for stories. It would allow media companies to bargain, either individually or collectively, with the companies over payment. If no agreement could be reached, payment terms would be set by a third-party arbitrator in a government-run process.
The government’s latest tweaks to the measure give the platforms more time to negotiate with publishers and clarify that they can potentially avoid forced arbitration if they reach deals.
Both platforms objected to the proposed media code, particularly its forced arbitration provision. But last week, Google dropped its objections and struck deals with the nation’s biggest publishers. Facebook, in contrast, protested and yanked news content from its site in Australia last Thursday, February 18, sparking outrage from critics around the world.
After a weekend of what Frydenberg described as “intensive negotiations,” Facebook backed down.
“We are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them,” said William Easton, Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, in a statement. The platform contends that publishers benefit more than it does from having news on Facebook.

31,"February 23, 2021",Tim Wu May Soon Join White House National Economic Council: Report,"


The Columbia University professor and antitrust crusader who coined the term “net neutrality,” Tim Wu, is likely to join the White House National Economic Council, according to Politico.
Tim Wu is the author of “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,” and a hero to progressives who want President Biden to take a more aggressive approach to Big Tech.
Wu previously served on the NEC at the end of the Obama administration, and has been discussed as a potential Biden pick to fill one of two vacancies on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and perhaps also be elevated to FTC chair.
“Tim Wu, a major advocate for the antitrust suits filed by the FTC and state attorneys general against Facebook, is one of the founders of the New Brandeis school of thought, named for former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Neo-Brandeisians believe the antitrust laws should focus not simply on consumers but on challenging corporate power itself to prevent any company from exerting too much economic or political control — making the tech giants, particularly Amazon, Google and Facebook, among their biggest targets. They also view antitrust as just one of several ways the government can fight monopoly power.
“As a veteran of the FTC, the New York attorney general’s office and the Obama White House, Wu was seen as a top pick for chair of the FTC, where he could help put some of that new antitrust manifesto into action. Installing him at the White House could breathe new life into the proposal to create a new Office of Competition Policy. The office, championed by Wu and prominent Obama-era antitrust vets, would be in charge of promoting competition across the federal government, urging federal agencies to institute new rules, or repeal old ones, and coordinate between agencies to help markets function better” commented Politico’s Leah Nylen.

32,"February 23, 2021",Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?,"
The dramatic growth of music streaming over recent years is potentially very positive. Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry. This paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. It argues that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.

By Daniel Antal, Amelia Fletcher & Peter L. Ormosi1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Over recent years, music streaming has grown very quickly, with streaming revenues growing at around 50 percent per year globally. According to IFPI figures, in 2014, streaming accounted for just 14 percent global recorded music revenues. By 2019 this figure had increased to 56 percent, and the figure for 2020 ­is likely to be higher still.2 Some streaming revenues derive from advertising, but the vast majority for most platforms is derived from subscriptions. The revenue growth from streaming has helped to revitalize a flagging music industry, with global recorded music revenues now increasing again, after hitting a low point in 2014.
So far, so positive. But it means that streaming is now a critical part of the recorded music industry. A chunk of its growth has come at the cost of revenue streams from other forms of legal digital distribution and physical distribution. Over the medium term, it is also likely to threaten the viability of many commercial radio stations and music television, as the latter lose listeners to streaming services. All of this means that streaming has already become the most important route to market for recorded music, and this position is likely to strengthen over the near future.
It is therefore both timely and important to reflect on the extent to which streaming services provide a level playing field for those involved in producing recorded music: labels, publishers, composers, performers, producers. This is also topical since streaming has received substantial criticism, with many artists considering that they have been treated unfairly by streaming, despite the overall boost it has given to industry revenues.
Fair treatment is important not only for artists but also, over the longer term, for consumers. As we discuss later, if competition is distorted, this risks inhibiting innovation, variety and the prospects of upcoming and more niche artists. This in turn risks harming the long-term success of the music industry. A thriving independent sector has long been an important breeding ground for musical innovation, whilst niche areas of music ­– including music which reflects local culture and experience – can be exceptionally important culturally.
In this paper, we focus on one particular aspect of streaming platforms: whether they provide for a level playing field in terms of competition between (types of) recordings. We also briefly summarize some of the wider competition concerns raised in relation to streaming.
 
II. INTRODUCTION TO THE VALUE CHAIN: HOW STREAMING REVENUES ARE SPLIT
Streaming platforms obtain streaming rights for recorded music (i.e. the “fixation” of the recorded performance) from record labels (and sometimes individual artists). They obtain streaming rights for the associated music works from publishers or collective management societies. The three major record labels (Universal, Sony BMG, and Warner) account for around 67.5 percent of the overall global recorded music market, and each has historically had strong negotiating power with the streaming platforms, since their catalogue is vital for any credible streaming platform. The influence of the major labels and the deals they receive may also be enhanced by their small shareholdings (direct and indirect) in the streaming platforms. For example, Universal holds a 3.5 percent stake, and Sony Music a 2.9 percent stake, in Spotify,3 while Deezer is part-owned by Access Industries which in turn owns Warner Music Group.
The contracts that are signed between the platforms and the major labels are confidential and complex, depending on factors such as geography and whether streams were advertising-funded or subscription-funded. But effectively the platforms pay the labels royalties that are calculated ­on a pro rata basis, as a proportion of the revenues associated with the streams of their content. Independent labels and artists make up the remainder of the industry, and their royalty payments are also calculated on a pro rata basis. An organization called Merlin negotiates on behalf of a number of the larger independent labels, which account for around 12 percent of digital streams. The remainder of the industry has less negotiating power, and terms are effectively set by the platform.
The streaming platforms are also required to obtain licenses for mechanical rights and public performance rights in relation to the musical compositions. These fees ­– which go to publishers and songwriters ­– are often negotiated collectively through rights organizations, and typically also take a percentage form. The total payment for these rights is substantially lower than (around a quarter of) the payment made to labels.
 
III. WIDER COMPETITION CONCERNS
There is not an obvious lack of competition between platforms for consumers, at least currently. The largest platform is Spotify, with 320 million monthly active users, 144 million subscribers across 92 different geographic markets, and annual gross revenues of €7.6 bn (as at September 30, 2020), but it faces stiff competition. Apple Music is the next largest with around 70 million subscribers, while Amazon, YouTube (Alphabet), Deezer, Pandora (in the U.S.), and Tencent (in China) also provide successful streaming services. In addition, while YouTube offers an audio streaming service, its more popular video streaming service is also an effective competitor for listeners, with IFPI estimating that it accounted for more than 45 percent of all audio listening hours in 2017.4
However, the presence of vigorous competition between streaming platforms does not mean that there are no competition concerns.
A first competition issue highlighted by many parties, including Spotify and Deezer, relates to the commission fee charged by Alphabet and Apple for subscriptions that are made through Android or iOS devices, and the restrictions that are imposed (by Apple) to inhibit or prevent services from circumventing these fees. This arguably creates a competitive disadvantage for independent third-party services like Spotify and Deezer, relative to the vertically integrated services of these major tech firms. In the EU, the European Commission’s proposals for a Digital Market Act appear likely to address this issue, via the proposed obligation at Article 5(c).5
A second concern that has been highlighted is that the video streaming activity of YouTube effectively competes with specialist music streaming services, but (and in contrast to YouTube’s own music streaming service), it does not obtain proper licenses for the recorded music it streams, nor does it pay fees analogous to those paid by other streaming services. Instead it offers content publishers a share of the advertising revenues that it earns from their content. It is not straightforward to compare the resulting payments made by YouTube’s video streaming service on a per stream basis, but they appear to be substantially lower than are paid by the specialist audio streaming platforms (including YouTube’s own). As such, YouTube video arguably competes unfairly against specialist audio-streaming services, as well as against radio stations and television, and also treats creators unfairly.
Concerns have been raised about the transparency and lack of auditability of revenues and payments from YouTube’s video streaming service. These YouTube-specific concerns are analogous to similar concerns raised about Google’s conduct more widely, as discussed in the CMA’s market study into Digital Advertising.6 In the EU, the situation looks set to be improved by Articles 5(g) and 6(1)(g) of the European Commission’s proposed Digital Markets Act.
A third area of concern, expressed by many artists, is whether the total payments made by the platforms to third parties are fair. Comparisons between streaming and prior sources of income are far from straightforward, given the diverse sources of income ­– physical product, digital sales, radio plays ­– that streaming is replacing. However, streaming does appear to pay out less than many of these. For example, assume an average streaming payout of around 0.004 Euros.7 By contrast, a single sale of a digital track via Bandcamp could easily generate a payment of 0.8 Euros. That individual purchaser would therefore need to stream the track an unlikely 200 times for it to generate the same royalties.8
On the other hand, while the precise payments made under its third-party licensing agreements is confidential, Spotify’s overall cost of sales is around 75 percent of its revenues, and it claims that the vast majority of this relates to such payments. Although transparency is limited, and payments differ across countries and types of streams, it appears that the other popular streaming platforms (apart from YouTube video) pay slightly more than Spotify on a per stream basis. While there is clearly potential for the revenue share offered to third party suppliers of content to be higher, it not necessarily low enough to be viewed as abusive under competition law.
Of course, another route to offering higher royalties to artists would be for the streaming platforms to increase gross revenues, either by charging more for the service, or by attracting more subscribers to the paid-for service.
It is true that streaming revenues are still increasing, and platforms have strong incentives to increase subscriber numbers. However, average revenue per user has been falling steadily since 2013, for Spotify at least,9 reflecting that these increasing revenues can be largely attributed to adding new subscribers at lower subscription rates.10 Part of this is due to the growth of streaming in new territories where subscription prices are set lower. For example, Spotify Premium costs around a tenth as much in India as in Denmark. While these low prices partly reflect market conditions, they also feed into low royalty payments from these territories, which will be especially detrimental to artists who are especially popular in those territories.
We note that the percentage nature of royalty payments in fact incentivizes lower pricing than would a more conventional set-up with fixed unit costs, since royalty costs automatically fall as prices fall. By contrast with the audio streaming services, Netflix – which has a more standard cost structure ­­– has been increasing its average revenue per user over time. For music streaming platforms, the total content consumed per user has also been increasing, meaning that the average revenue per stream has fallen substantially over time.
It should also be noted that ­– for any particular recording – the share of the revenues which gets passed back to individual performers, producers and composers depends on the deals they have signed with their labels and publishers, as well as any charges levied at the distribution level for distributing the recorded music to the streaming platforms. To some extent, therefore, complaints about the streaming royalties received by artists and composers are targeted as much at their labels and publishers and the collective management organizations as at the streaming platforms themselves.
A final area of concern, linked to the YouTube-related concern discussed above, is that streaming platforms are able to compete unfairly against traditional audio or television broadcasters, and increasingly expand directly into these activities. First, if these platforms can acquire music content at an unfairly low per minute rate relative to radio or television broadcasters, then this gives them an undue competitive advantage against broadcasters that offer higher royalties to creators.
Second, a royalty system which is based on revenue-sharing could have the effect of subsidizing expansion by the streaming platforms into these alternative markets. After all, the more audio content that a platform provides to any given listener in these other formats, the lower the proportion of total streams which recorded music accounts for, and thus the lower the payment that would be made to recorded music (subject to any minimum payment guarantees). This would hold true even if the absolute number of recorded music streams remained unchanged. Any such reduction in payment for recorded music would in turn act a subsidy to such expansion and also put these platforms at a competitive advantage, relative other potential operators of such content which do not have the benefit of the same subsidy.
As well as potentially comprising unfair competition, any substitution by streaming for more traditional media also has the potential to circumvent existing domestic media regulation in several territories. Such regulation is typically designed to guarantee a certain visibility for national, regional, or upcoming artists. The replacement of regulated broadcasting streams with unregulated digital (media) streams can reduce the royalty income of these protected groups.
 
IV. COMPETITION ON STREAMING PLATFORMS
While we agree that these various concerns discussed above merit attention, and welcome the European Commission’s relevant proposals in this area, they are not the focus of this article. Instead, we examine the conduct of the streaming platforms themselves, and how this supports – or distorts – fair competition between different types of recorded music and their creators.
We note that the issue of ensuring a level playing field in music creation has a long history. As long ago as the 1950s, “payola” ­(effectively, paying for airplay) was ruled illegal in the U.S. In 1959 Berry Gordy was getting so much airplay for his Motown artists that he even created a second label, Tamla, to dilute this success and thus allay rumors that he was using payola to achieve it.
The line between marketing and payola can be somewhat blurry. We note the concerns expressed that Spotify’s new “Discovery Mode,” which is currently an experimental feature, is a form of payola.11 However, the issue we primarily discuss below is a broader one. We examine whether there is a risk to competition in recorded music creation arising from the combination of:

the pro rata royalty allocation method adopted by the streaming platforms and
the role played by playlists in driving streams (with particular reference to Spotify) and the way in which these playlists are created.

 A. The Pro Rata Revenue Allocation Method
While a pro rata royalty allocation method might appear fair in principle, in practice it can skew revenues and distort competitive incentives.
Consider the following simple example. Imagine one premium subscriber who likes to play mainstream music in the background all day, while they do other things, and a second premium subscriber who only listens to a streaming service for a couple of hours each evening, when they can really focus on the more niche music that they love. Suppose both subscribers pay 14 euros per month, of which 10 euros is distributed as royalties. The first subscriber might account for around 9,000 streams per month, while the latter accounts for only 1,000.
Even though the first subscriber only loves mainstream music and the second only loves niche music, the pro rata revenue allocation system will allocate 9/10 of the total revenue (i.e. 18 euros) to providers of mainstream music, and only 1/10 to the providers of niche music. In other words, 80 percent of the royalty payments generated by the second subscriber’s subscription fee go to providers of music that they would never choose to listen to.
Of course, a “per stream” unit royalty payment would solve this issue directly, and is often advocated. However, there is an alternative approach to revenue allocation that also overcomes this issue. Under a “user-centric payment system” (or “UCPS”), the royalties generated by an individual user’s subscription are simply split between what they choose to listen to. In the above example, all royalties generated by the second subscriber would go to the providers of the particular music that they listen to. This would in turn help to protect the creation, over the long term, of exactly that sort of music which the second subscriber is interested in, and would help to preserve competition, variety and innovation in the creation of new music.
Of course, there will in practice be many different types of subscribers to platforms, and some of the heaviest users may well have the most catholic tastes. However, the empirical analysis carried out to date confirms that a move to UCPS would benefit local/national tastes and domestic artists, and more niche tastes, over the more international and mainstream stars.12 Thus a move to UCPS would be expected to help support a greater diversity of local/national music scenes, to the benefit of their economies and culture; and a greater breadth of types of music, which should enhance the long-term innovation and sustainability of the recorded music industry. Deezer, which is itself endeavoring to move to a UCPS allocation system, but apparently facing resistance from the major labels, has calculated that the system would also be better for upcoming artists.13 This should again help to engender new and more innovative music creation.
Another substantial benefit of UCPS is that it would eliminate the current cheating of the system through the “farming” of streams. Currently, individual accounts can be used to play particular labels’ music non-stop, thus increasing their total share of revenues. Although the streaming services have systems in place to try and police such activity, it is inherently difficult, and can lead to “takedown” actions which some consider disproportionate.14 UCPS would solve this in one stroke, since the more streams racked up by one account, the ever tinier would be the royalty payments made per stream.
 B. The Role of Playlists
Music listening on streaming platforms can happen in three ways: listening to single tracks, listening to albums, and listening to playlists. There is typically also an “autoplay” function, whereby the service streams tracks by default if a listener has not made an active choice. These work similarly to playlists and can reflect either what the listener was listening to previously and/or their prior usage.
Playlists can be invaluable in introducing listeners to new music. However, as has been demonstrated by Aguiar & Waldfogel (2018), they are also an extremely important source of streams on these platforms.15 For example, they found that being added to Spotify’s “Today’s Top Hits,” a list with 18.5 million followers during the sample period, increased streams by almost 20 million. As such, fair access by recordings to playlists is important for ensuring fair competition.
Since playlists require less user intervention then listening to single tracks or albums, it is also likely that heavier platform users, who tend to have music playing in the background while they do other things, are particularly likely to use playlists. As such, the impact of playlists on royalty payments is likely to be accentuated under a pro rata royalty allocation system relative to UCPS.
There are three main types of playlists: user-created playlists; proprietary playlists created by the platform itself, which may be editorial or “algotorial” (algorithmically generated editorial); and third-party playlists. It is the latter two types that raise potential competition concerns, in particular in relation to the ability of new or niche recorded music to gain access to playlists and thereby attract streams.
Listener numbers for playlists are highly skewed. The tables presented below are based on preliminary analysis of UK Spotify data collected by Mariuzzo & Ormosi (2020).16 The sample for the data analysis is 24,000 songs from recent recordings by UK artists signed to both major and independent labels. These 24,000 songs have appeared on around 1.7 million distinct playlists at various points in time, although most of these playlists have very few (or zero) followers.
The most popular playlist is Today’s Top Hits with over 27 million followers, followed by Global Top 50 (16 million followers), and RapCaviar (14 million followers). Table 1 shows how skewed playlist listenership is thereafter. The 100th most popular playlist in our sample (when ranked in descending order of the number of followers) has around 2 million followers. The number of followers per playlist then drops off sharply, with the 1,000th playlist attracting around 260k followers, the 10,000th playlist having only around 11k followers, and the 100,000th having just 55.
Table 1 – Skewness of sample of Spotify playlist followers

1,000th playlist


259,862




10,000th playlist


10,949




100,000th playlist


55




Similar concentration numbers are reported by Aguiar & Waldfogel (2018). This is important because it means that access to the most popular playlists (and especially the top 100 playlists) can be especially valuable for driving total streams.
The most popular playlists tend to be at least notionally editorial (edited by a curator), although curators tend to pre-select on the basis of algorithms. Editorial playlists can be created by the platform itself or by third party editors. Purely algotorial playlists (derived through an algorithm without human discretion) are created by the platform itself. Both types of playlist play important roles. While editorial playlists tend to be the most followed, algotorial playlists are also important. Even if the listener numbers are lower, there are so many of them that they can have a significant impact. Spotify alone has around 4 billion playlists.17
 C. Proprietary Playlists
As is shown in Table 2 below, the vast majority of successful playlists on Spotify are proprietary. It curates almost all of the top 100 playlists and 90 percent of the top 1,000 playlists. This is not unusual, and indeed it may even more true on the other streaming platforms. The problem with proprietary playlists of either type is that it is unclear what are the criteria for inclusion, and whether all producers and publishers have equal access to inclusion, or fulfilment of the criteria.
Spotify states that, for its own editorial playlists, songs can in principle be pitched by labels or artists, that followers and listening history do not play a role in their playlisting decisions, and that Spotify does not allow payment for playlist placement. In practice, however, playlists can be hard to access. While this is understandable, given that around 40 thousand songs are uploaded on Spotify each day,18 it nevertheless creates a significant risk of unfair competition, given the importance of playlist access for driving both revenues and future success.
Algotorial playlists, which are created by the streaming platform’s own proprietary algorithms, are designed to predict user preferences and select content tailored to users’ individual data, based on advanced data analytics. They can take various forms, including providing for a high degree of personalization. We understand that they draw on three primary types of data as “signals”: the metadata of the music itself (its musicological or engineering properties), user data about how users have been interacting with the music or the artist (liking, disliking, skipping, playing) and natural language text data provided by the artist (or their representatives) or drawn from the internet.
The algorithms are confidential, and so it is hard to assess what biases they may introduce. However, even though playlists can play a valuable role in introducing followers to music they might not otherwise have heard, and even though the platforms have a competitive incentive to offer appealing playlists as part of their commercial proposition, these algorithms could nevertheless easily be biased. For example, any algorithms which are based on past global performance could result in “success breeding success” and are likely to favor more mainstream, established and international recordings. If music is initially misallocated to the wrong playlists, and receives negative feedback (such as in the form of listener skipping), then the algorithms may make it hard for it re-establish itself with the right audience. Music that doesn’t fit easily within an established genre, or which is not in the English language, is also likely to be competitively disadvantaged.
In general, the largest distributors, owned by the major labels, may be more effective in gaining access to the platform’s proprietary playlists. Spotify’s incentives to playlist songs from the major labels may also be influenced by their contracts with those labels. While these are confidential, Spotify states that they include minimum payment guarantees, which require it to make payments even if that label’s recordings do not hit a specified level of streams.19 Putting more of that label’s music onto playlists would clearly reduce the risk of triggering such payments.
Recently, as mentioned above, Spotify has gone one step further towards commercializing access to playlists. In November 2020, it announced a new “Discovery Mode” feature, whereby it would be allowing artists and record labels to flag tracks that are a particular priority for them, in return for receiving a lower royalty rate on these tracks. These tracks will then be given a degree of priority when algorithms are creating playlists and “autoplay” tracks.20
There are obvious analogies here to other platforms, such as hotel online booking sites, which also allow business users to pay to gain preferential rankings. Concerns have been raised that such conduct effectively exploits the trust that consumers have in “natural” rankings, and the fact that they assume them to be user-orientated, rather than advertising-funded. This has led to calls for sponsored content to be clearly distinguishable from organic content.21 In the specific case of hotel online booking, the UK CMA has required sites to set out clearly how such commercial factors underpin their rankings.22 At the very least, it would seem reasonable to require this of streaming services too, and it is arguably required in the EU under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005.
 D. Third-party Playlists
While third-party playlist curation could be potentially a competitive market, we note that the most successful third-party playlist operators would appear to be the major labels themselves. Filtr (Sony BMG), Digster (Warner), and Topsify (Universal) primarily play their label’s proprietary content. Aguiar and Waldfogel (2018) find that Filtr, Digster, and Topsify, respectively have 3.1, 2.7, and 0.9 percent of the top 1000 playlists’ cumulative followers. Table 2, based on the Mariuzzo & Ormosi (2020) data, shows similar prevalence. The first column in Table 2 shows that cumulative “follows” are heavily concentrated in the top playlists.23

 E. Implications for Playlist Access
The overall effect of the above factors is that major label recorded music has a greater share of the most popular playlists, which really drive streams, than they do in the less popular playlists. This is shown clearly in Table 3 for the Mariuzzo & Ormosi (2020) data. While this data sample does not provide a full description of the UK recorded music market, we note that total share of independent labels in the total UK recorded music market is around 30 percent . As such, a share of less than 25 percent of a playlist, for the top 10,000 playlists analyzed here (which account for over 90 percent of cumulative “follows”)­ would appear consistent with differential playlist access.
Table 3 – Share of major label recordings on sample of Spotify playlists

81.0




Top 1,000 playlists


77.2

64.6




This preliminary analysis suggests that independent label artists are getting far less than their fair share of access to the most popular playlists. While the vast majority of these are curated by Spotify, the shares of the major labels’ own proprietary playlists may exacerbate the situation. This lack of access is likely to have a direct impact on revenues for independent labels and their artists today, and also an indirect impact on the sustainability of this important segment of the market in the future.
Given the importance of playlists for driving streams, any potential informational advantage to how they are created can provide a huge advantage for suppliers of recorded music. Providing greater transparency as to how each streaming platforms’ proprietary playlists are created would therefore seem to be vital for ensuring fair on-platform competition. In this context, we note that Spotify has an unusually open API, which provides artists with more detail on how their music is being represented than do its competitors. However, greater transparency and auditability would be valuable from all streaming services.
Finally, we note that only the streaming platforms themselves are currently able to offer algotorial playlists, as only they have access to the relevant data about every listeners’ streaming choices that is required to train the algorithms. But this situation is not inherent. With greater access to such data, for example through explicit data access requirements or through data portability provisions, there may be more potential for the development of an effective competitive market for third party playlists, even including enhanced algorithmic and personalized playlists. This should be given serious consideration, especially in the context of the wider policy debate on smart data access and portability.
 
V. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
We have argued that fair competition in music creation risks being compromised by the combination of several factors: the nature of the royalty arrangements with the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, access to critical data, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. These distortions tend to favor more mainstream, established and international music, in particular that which appears on major labels, and to disadvantage the more niche, the more independent, the more locally-focused.
This would be an important issue even in normal times, but at a time of a world-wide pandemic, which has effectively shut down many revenue streams for artists, and left streaming as their almost exclusive source of revenue, its significance is even more pronounced. Moreover, it has long-lasting potential consequences. Although currently consumers have low price access to an unprecedented selection of music, they will be harmed over the longer term if the current arrangements harm competition, variety, innovation and cultural diversity in music creation.
In terms of possible solutions to the concerns identified above, we recommend that urgent consideration should be given to moving from the pro rata payment system to a user-centric remuneration. We note that Deezer is already pushing for this change. We also believe that further analysis would be valuable into the role of, and access to, the main editorial playlists, as well as the algorithms underpinning the algotorial playlists, in order to ensure they do not create an unbalanced playing field. There should be greater transparency and auditability around how these playlists are created. Enhanced data access would also be valuable in facilitating the development of a competitive and innovative market for third-party playlist creation.
We would encourage greater transparency of contracts, once they are agreed, to help ensure fair treatment; or alternatively that competition authorities should allow industry-wide negotiation by labels, as is already carried out for performance and mechanical royalties on the composition side of the split. We note that some of the majors have residual equity stakes in Spotify. Requiring divestment of such stakes could also be helpful in ensuring that Spotify has the right incentives to ensure a level playing field.
Finally, while our focus here has been on competition considerations, we note that this is only one policy area relevant to streaming platforms. Copyright law and broader media regulation may also merit rethinking in the streaming era.

In the waning days of the Trump administration, the DOJ moved to terminate a 70-year-old consent decree that required Decca Records — once one of the country’s most important labels — to license its master recordings to third parties under certain circumstances. Compulsory licensing and forced sharing may seem like a vestige of a bygone era in antitrust, but those remedies may soon see a resurgence. In the age of “Big Tech,” commentators, politicians, and enforcers have alleged that controlling access to electronic data may give rise to monopoly power — and some have suggested that forcing tech giants to share their data may be necessary to break down that alleged power. In the coming months, we will see whether the Biden administration intends to take a page from the mid-century playbook that led to the Decca consent decree.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over 70 years ago, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice filed sued against Decca Records, a leading American record company. The lawsuit alleged that Decca and its British counterpart conspired with EMI, another major competitor, to carve up the world map into exclusive territories and to fix resale prices for records sold to American consumers, all in violation of the Sherman Act. After four years of litigation, but before the parties reached trial, the record companies settled with the Antitrust Division. They agreed to a consent decree that imposed a numb...

34,"February 23, 2021",Competition Law in the Digitized Music Industry: The Winners Take It All — But Should They?,"
The last two decades have seen the music industry crash and emerge from the ashes, more digitized but also more consolidated. New players, in particular music streaming services, have joined, but they complement rather than challenge traditional players such as record labels. Moreover, they are equally concentrated. Artists may therefore be confronted with counterparties with significant buyer power, which can be abused. In this article, we describe the evolving dynamics in the music industry and how competition law (in particular through merger control and abuse of dominance investigations) has dealt with them. We also examine how existing power structures may be technologically disrupted, rebalanced through collective bargaining (insofar as allowed under competition law), or streamlined through collective management. Finally, we look beyond competition, to check whether other regulatory tools offer a (more) effective answer. We find that, while a number of private and public interventions show significant promise, meaningful change will require rethinking the initiatives on both fronts.

This paper discusses the evolution of the music industry in the digital era, the emergence of interactive streaming, and the strategy behind the Spotify music service which now controls the largest share of the market for the distribution of musical recordings. With the emergence of digital technologies, new download and streaming channels have displaced the traditional record store and reduced the importance of radio promotion. Independent artists and labels are now more able to promote new acts, reach new fans, and learn about listener tastes. Nonetheless, the evolving market process will now determine whether or not content markets continue to loosen, or whether bottlenecks reemerge that allow major labels to maintain more control over market shares.

36,"February 22, 2021",Microsoft Enters Australia-Style News Payments With The EU,"


Microsoft is teaming up with European publishers to push for a system to make big tech platforms pay for news, raising the stakes in the brewing battle led by Australia to get Google and Facebook to pay for journalism, reported The Financial Times.
The Seattle tech giant and four big European Union news industry groups unveiled their plan Monday, February 22, to work together on a solution to “mandate payments” for use of news content from online “gatekeepers with dominant market power.”
The company stated that it will “take inspiration” from proposed legislation in Australia to force tech platforms to share revenue with news companies and which includes an arbitration system to resolve disputes over a fair price for news.
Christian Van Thillo, a Belgian media executive who is chair of the European Publishers Council, welcomed “Microsoft’s recognition” of the value “our content brings to the core business of search engines and social networks.” 
“It is crucial that our regulators recognise this key point, and don’t get misled into thinking that side deals on the basis of a standalone product are the same thing,” he said, adding, “All publishers should get an agreement — no one should be left out.”

The UK’s antitrust tribunal ruled on Monday, February 22, that Epic Games, the creator of popular game Fortnite, will not be allowed to pursue its case against Apple in the United Kingdom over its App Store payment system and control over app downloads, reported Reuters. 
The two companies have been at loggerheads since August, when the game maker tried to avoid Apple’s 30% fee on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system, which led to Apple’s subsequent ban of Fortnite from its store.
The UK tribunal said Epic’s suit against Alphabet Inc’s Google could move forward, but deemed that the United States would be a better forum for its case against Apple.
“Epic will reconsider pursuing its case against Apple in the UK after the resolution of the U.S. case,” the video game company said in a statement in response to the tribunal’s ruling.
In October, a federal judge in California ruled in an injunction request that Apple could bar the Fortnite game from its App Store but must not harm Epic’s developer tools business, which includes the “Unreal Engine” software used by hundreds of other video games.

38,"February 22, 2021",Analyzing Nascent Competitor Acquisitions Rationally,"

By John M. Taladay & Jeffrey S. Oliver1
 
Many recent articles have posited that dominant companies are squelching competition by buying up nascent companies before they can become effective rivals. Dubbed “killer acquisitions” by some, or “stealth acquisitions” by others, the argument is that these acquisitions are anticompetitive and must be stopped, and that new means are justified in doing so.2 This article proposes that competition is better served by first determining whether the facts of the acquisitions themselves raise a threat to competition, using well-understood tools that effectively identify competitive harms. There is no need for frenzied reactionism where rational evaluation can provide informed answers to the key question of whether an acquisition of a nascent competitor is likely to harm competition.
Articles addressing this topic typically approach the question from a macro perspective, charging that the entrenchment of the dominant company is bolstered in general by a strategy to gobble-up would-be rivals before they can gain strength. Sometimes this phenomenon is examined in hindsight, identifying a specific prior acquisition. If the acquired entity is successful on the acquirer’s platform, the assertion is that the nascent company was acquired to prevent its independent success, which is assumed irrespective of the platform’s subsequent investments and synergies. If the acquired entity was unsuccessful on the acquirer’s platform, then it is argued that the platform killed-off the alternative to maintain its own market position. This article does not tackle those issues specifically, but it does address an essential informative foundational point that those articles do not.  Specifically, that analysis of merger effects is fact-specific and there are established methodologies that allow one to evaluate the potential competitive effects of the acquisition of a nascent competitor rationally, dispassionately, and free from the political, doctrinal, and other influences that often infect the dialogue on this topic. This article seeks to strip this analysis down to practical considerations and identify some of the relevant tools for this analysis.
Because predictive tools exist, enforcement should not be based on speculation as to the possible success of a nascent company. Indeed, it would be a great irony — in an exercise that relies on predictive tools — for agencies to approve mergers in cases where the acquisition of an established and reasonably significant competitor is involved but to reject mergers where a nascent company of unknown competitive significance is in play. Agencies should not take an approach of “the less we know, the more certain we can be that a problem will exist.” That said, it also would be improper for agencies to ignore the competitive potential of an upstart company, particularly in technology markets that involve the prospect of Schumpeterian change and network externalities. Clearly, a balance must be sought.
Decades of merger analysis have provided numerous tools that can help competition authorities evaluate both the short- and long-term potential of a nascent competitor relative to its larger acquirer. These tools include means of conducting factual, legal and economic analysis that can inform the counterfactual — looking to both the acquired and acquiring companies — in a way that will improve merger review outcomes involving nascent companies, whether that review is carried out ex post or ex ante. Our list of methods is almost certainly non-exhaustive and omits additional tools that agencies can identify through their own experience.3
 
I. Introduction
The hypothesized scenario is often this: an innovative upstart is acquired by a large technology platform company to prevent the upstart from growing into a significant independent competitor that could drive innovation, impose competitive constraints, or perhaps even unseat the incumbent. But because the nascent company lacks sufficient revenues (or turnover) or market share, competition agencies have no chance to stop the anticompetitive merger and are unable to unwind it once consummated. On the other hand, there is nothing hypothetical about the challenges in determining whether the nascent competitor would ever have matured into a significant competitor independently or in the hands of another, or whether it would have fallen into the vast scrapheap of unsuccessful, defunct start-up ventures. Hindsight can successfully identify the more (and less) successful acquired technologies that have flourished in the hands of a large platform company, but it cannot tell what might have been in the absence of the acquisition.
Various solutions to this challenge have been suggested, including shifting the burden of proof to the acquiring party to demonstrate a lack of anticompetitive effects. This is the equivalent of declaring every acquisition by a company of a certain size or category to be presumptively unlawful irrespective of actual competitive effects unless it can be proven otherwise.4 This approach would adopt a principle that, because the ultimate long-term impact of acquisitions of nascent competitors is inherently unpredictable, the ends of preventing any “killer acquisition” is justified by the means of dispensing with competitive analysis. But such an approach presumes, without any empirical foundation, that nearly all acquisitions of nascent companies harm competition. It would unnecessarily chill such acquisitions altogether and, thereby, deter the very start-up activity that leads to important innovation and economic growth. Moreover, it would not be consistent with the economic underpinnings of competition law, particularly when sound competition analysis can be brought to bear on the evaluation of such mergers.
Recall that before the introduction of merger control standards centered around “substantial lessening of competition,” some jurisdictions analyzed acquisitions utilizing rules relating to anticompetitive agreements or abuse of dominance. With a view to the inherent difficulties regarding ex post remedies for completed transactions, ex ante merger control was introduced, subject to certain filing thresholds, to anticipate potentially problematic transactions in a given market before structural changes had set in.5 These thresholds can be adjusted, and have been adjusted (typically upwards), to account for transactions that create a potential for material competitive harm.6
Ex ante merger review is an inherently predictive exercise. But a long history of evaluating mergers has provided many predictive tools. For example, the 2010 U.S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines begin by stating that merger policy in the U.S. is focused on enforcement “with respect to mergers and acquisitions involving actual or potential competitors.”7 Thus, the Guidelines incorporate predictive tools that have been refined over several decades and are designed to capture potential competition at all stages.
Clayton Act Section 7, EC Article 102 and the laws of other regimes require probabilistic analysis based on factual and economic analysis.8 In recent years, court decisions in both the U.S. and EU have required agencies to focus on econometric and documentary evidence to support this predictive exercise. Absent such analysis, agency decisions to challenge or block a transaction are likely to be unsuccessful or overturned, with the potential to create bad legal precedent. Thus, speculation need not guide this exercise and likely would not be accepted by reviewing courts if it did.
Identified below are some of the economic and factual tools that have been utilized and can be useful in evaluating mergers involving smaller or nascent competitors.
 
II. General Factors for Evaluation of Nascent Competitor Transactions
A. Horizontal, Adjacent or Vertical?
As with any merger, the observable competitive relationship between the parties should be a starting point for evaluating the potential for competitive concern. Thus, the initial consideration should be to evaluate whether the nascent competitor currently sits in a horizontal, vertical or adjacent relationship to the acquirer.
Horizontal Relationships:
Horizontal relationships have proven over decades to present the greatest concern. There is no reason to believe the same rule shouldn’t apply to nascent competitor acquisitions. If a horizontal relationship exists, it is proper to next ask whether the nascent competitor is a mere copycat of the acquirer or whether it represents a significant step forward in innovation. Either scenario may present a problem, although there is growing evidence that preserving transformative innovation is more important than addressing allocative efficiencies.9 But evaluating the current competitive interaction as it reads on the near and longer term is the appropriate starting point. For example, is the nascent competitor a “maverick” or just another potential player? Is the company truly a “nascent” horizontal competitor or is the competition still just “potential?”
Adjacent Relationships: If the nascent competitor is not a direct competitor but is in an adjacent market, the threat of harm may not be as immediate as with a horizontal competitor. Entry often occurs from adjacent markets, so an adjacent competitor could eventually become a threat to the large tech acquirer. But where a company is nascent in an adjacent market — i.e. is not even a substantial competitor in that adjacent market — the likelihood that they will become a competitive threat in the acquirer’s market becomes more remote.
Vertical: As with all vertical mergers, the key question will often be whether the acquisition will foreclose rivals. The foreclosed competitors may be actual or potential rivals, including other upstarts. Thus, the greatest threat might exist where the merger forecloses competition from one or more nascent competitors. Whether dominance is reinforced through foreclosure is not always directly observable. But this sometimes can be discerned by looking to the development efforts of the merging companies.10
Vertical deals normally should not be presumed to be anticompetitive where a nascent competitor is involved.11 If, for instance, a vertical acquisition by a company of a well-established, mature competitor would not create a problem, then an acquisition of a nascent competitor — which may or may not ever make it to maturity — should not be viewed as anticompetitive, and certainly should not be presumed as such.
B. Stage of Product Development
The stage of product development at the time of acquisition, considering both the incumbent and nascent competitor, often can materially inform the potential for anticompetitive effects. This is principally a factual analysis but can often be well informed by review of product roadmaps and strategic planning reviews. There are several elements to be considered.



State of Commercialization



An important factor is the stage of commercialization of the underlying product or service offering. Combinations or acquisitions of fledgling rivals that are already in full commercialization can create issues, even when the market is relatively young and underdeveloped, if the acquisition combines two uniquely-positioned competitors. At the same time, combinations of nascent products that are further from commercialization may not create issues. These scenarios often arise in connection with pharmaceutical mergers, where a more transparent product pipeline allows for further analysis. There, a probabilistic analysis can sometimes be undertaken in light of the phase in which the drugs are participating and the likelihood that either or both products will emerge successfully from clinical trials.
In July 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) challenged the merger of the two largest daily fantasy sports sites, DraftKings and FanDuel, alleging that the combined firm would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. At the time of the proposed merger, the market was still evolving as many U.S. states had not authorized such “quasi-gambling” activity and neither company had turned a profit. The FTC challenged the deal alleging that the merger would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act by creating a single provider with by far the largest share of the market for paid daily fantasy sports contests in the United States. Here, using traditional and well-established tools, the FTC concluded that the parties were far enough along in their respective developments to be counted as viable competitors in a new market. According to the FTC’s complaint, DraftKings and FanDuel were each other’s most significant competitor and battled head-to-head to offer the best prices and product quality, including the largest prize pools and greatest variety of contests.12 Shortly thereafter, the parties abandoned the transaction and remain independent companies today.13
Earlier, in 2001, the FTC reviewed the merger of Genzyme and Novazyme, two competitors with the leading R&D efforts to develop a treatment for a rare but devastating disease. Despite the nascent stage of R&D in the market, the FTC used well-developed analytical tools to test whether the merger was likely to harm future development of the products.  It realized that the combination of the two R&D initiatives could have either harmful or synergistic effects. In his statement, then-Chairman Tim Muris stated, “[t]he Commission’s investigation properly focused on how the transaction would affect the pace and scope of research into pharmaceutical products for a life-threatening medical condition affecting infants and young children for which no treatment presently exists. The facts of this matter do not support a finding of any possible anticompetitive harm. Moreover, on balance, rather than put patients at risk through diminished competition, the merger more likely created benefits that will save patients’ lives.”14 He further stated, “There is no evidence that the merger reduced R&D spending on either the Genzyme or the Novazyme program or slowed progress along either of the R&D paths. Although there have been schedule changes since the merger, there is no evidence that they resulted from anything other than the difficulties that attend challenging research efforts.”15 The Genzyme/Novazyme example also reflects the importance of evaluating the potential for merger-specific synergies including in cases of nascent competitors. A nascent competitor, even one with a narrow portfolio and limited independent prospects, may fill an important gap for a larger competitor, unlocking new product offerings that may benefit a far larger population of consumers when placed on a broad platform.



Regulatory Hurdles



Where significant regulatory hurdles must still be crossed, the acquisition of a nascent competitor may be less likely to cause competitive harm. Merger review is a probabilistic exercise; the probability of a company obtaining necessary regulatory approvals therefore must be baked-in to the evaluation of the potential for competitive harm. This is relevant, especially, in mergers in regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals, telecoms and energy, among other sectors.



State of Market Development and Dynamism of Market



While some tech markets are more mature, other markets are themselves “nascent.” For example, while cellular technology is well established, competition surrounding 5G product development and the use of cellular technology to implement the Internet of Things (IoT) is still very much evolving. Therefore, it is relevant to ask how “new” is the market and how fast is it evolving and changing.
Digital markets sometimes evolve very quickly because of fast innovation or innovation “cycles.” This innovation may either be (1) sustaining, i.e. taking place within the value network of the established firms; or (2) disruptive, i.e. taking place outside the value network of established firms.16
Just a decade or so ago, the landscape of arguably “dominant” companies in the tech sector would have looked quite different than today. Those markets were fairly new then and the leaders of that era obviously were overtaken by today’s leaders, with some markets having now become more established. But it is clear that the leaders of the prior decade — i.e. Nokia, Blackberry, AOL, Yahoo, MySpace, etc. — did not keep pace with development and innovation and were outstripped. In quickly evolving markets, competitors must evolve to remain relevant and even large players may need to acquire technology to remain competitive.17 Where the state of market evolution has slowed, then the innovation may be more sustaining than disruptive. A fulsome analysis of the state of the market evolution is therefore an important precursor to evaluating potential competitive harm.
Further, heterogeneity of user preferences will lessen the likelihood of entrenchment. For instance, successive generations often find their own preferences for social media. Facebook’s users reportedly are aging, with far more downloads in recent times going to Snapchat and TikTok, particularly among younger users.18 The existence of dynamics such as these make future predictions of foreclosure particularly challenging. Where user preferences are neither diverse nor shifting over time, enforcers should consider whether other “lock-in” factors or network externalities may contribute to entrenchment. They also should consider whether ongoing customer loyalty may be due to innovation or quality exhibited by the leading firm(s). All of this fits into an established approach to analyzing the likelihood of successful entry.
Recent enforcement actions by the U.S. FTC have employed tools to evaluate nascent competitor acquisitions and to protect consumers from anticompetitive transactions. In 2018, the FTC challenged the proposed merger between CDK and Auto/Mate. In that case, a large, established firm with a substantial share of the automotive “dealer management systems” software market was buying a relatively small upstart that had enjoyed some recent success and appeared poised to challenge the market leader more aggressively. While there was some current competition between the firms, the greatest concern identified was the likely future competition that would be lost, should Auto/Mate be absorbed by CDK.19 The parties ultimately abandoned the transaction.20
In December 2019, the FTC successfully challenged the proposed merger between Illumina and PacBio, where it alleged that Illumina, with 90% share of the market, attempted to “extinguish [PacBio] as a competitive threat” upon discovering that PacBio was on the verge of offering better, more cost-effective DNA sequencing products.21 And in February 2020, the FTC challenged the proposed merger between Harry’s and Schick in the market for “wet shave razors.” There, Harry’s — a disruptive newcomer — changed the market from a “comfortable duopoly to a competitive battleground.”22 Again, the parties ultimately abandoned the transaction.23 These enforcement actions demonstrate that the agencies can and will use the tools available under current antitrust laws to preserve competition between rivals, including nascent competitors.
 
III. Looking at the Nascent Company Factors and Assessing the Counterfactual
Nascent competitors are not all created equally and, therefore, do not all stand the same chance of posing a threat to large incumbents. There are numerous factual clues to the potential impact of a nascent company, even at relatively early stages of development. These factors should be evaluated in considering the potential for competitive foreclosure in cases involving nascent competitors.
A. Independent Business Plan
It is relevant to ask whether the nascent competitor requires an existing platform to succeed or whether it is likely to succeed on its own. Just like intellectual property (IP) exploitation, tech development is sometimes exploited by the inventor, but at other times is best exploited by others. Incubators are filled with examples of tech developments that were never intended to be exploited by the inventor, but instead were targeted from the start to become a complement to a large tech platform. At times, without the complementarities offered by the large tech platform, there is little or no utility to the technological development.
Where a nascent competitor’s business plans do not indicate the need for complementary resources from a larger platform, it should be studied to identify the relevant significant hurdles that must be crossed for the upstart to evolve into an independent player (or platform), and the probability of succeeding at each turn. A realistic assessment should be employed, recognizing that the start-up and its investors are likely to have perhaps the most optimistic view of the company’s success (as no start-up company launches on the premise that it will fail).
Obviously, the further down the path to success, the greater likelihood that the nascent company will have competitive significance in the market, and that the merger will have anticompetitive effects. The converse is also true, with some companies affirmatively planning on being acquired. Indeed, some tech inventions are not only intended to be sold to a platform, but could not succeed otherwise.
Agencies should also consider the degree to which the nascent competitor’s product must scale in order to compete. Some tech developments, particularly in the electronics and semiconductor space, are tied to the ability to mass produce the goods. For example, new tech that goes into handsets, computers or televisions may require hundreds of millions of units of production. While ODMs are sometimes available, certain technology may involve significant manufacturing know-how, in which case a nascent competitor may lack the kind of production expertise that may be required and which resides only in the hands of a larger, more established entity. So even if the underlying technology design itself is flawless and directly competitive with established market players, there may be uncertainty as to whether the nascent competitor can scale up production and compete effectively.
B. Unique Technology/Protected IP
It may also be useful to examine whether the nascent competitor will be able effectively to access the market in light of IP hurdles. If a nascent technology is truly unique this will not be an issue. But if it builds on prior discoveries and IP within the industry segment, as is often the case, the nascent competitor may face significant IP hurdles or allegations of patent infringement in the hands of large players. If the nascent competitor does not have a “defensive” IP portfolio, it may have no protection in the event of a challenge and therefore no ability to negotiate a cross-license to necessary foundational technology.
Patent thickets exist in many technology markets. While standards and FRAND commitments enable entry in some settings, many patent thickets involve non-standard essential patents that are capable of excluding infringing players. Therefore, in some markets, the likelihood of ultimate success of a nascent technology may be much higher in the hands of an existing player with a stronger portfolio of IP. Thus, the competitive significance of a nascent competitor may be reduced if there is a patent thicket through which it must navigate.
C. Alternative Pathways
Agencies should consider whether, if the proposed merger is struck down, there are alternative paths to success. In some cases, this may require an evaluation of whether there are (or were) alternative purchasers for the nascent company who could effectively exploit the company’s invention. The counterfactual should not automatically be assumed to be an independent path to success. The realistic set of business alternatives — not just in the absence of the merger, but in the context of the deal being rejected — must be evaluated.
The nascent company’s financing horizon also should be considered. For example, does the nascent company have the funding to continue, and for how long? Has it already received Series A and B funding? If the merger does not go through, will it have funding to sustain its development and reach a positive cash flow position? Agencies should remember that some tech start-ups may be highly valued — and therefore readily funded by venture capitalists — precisely because they are attractive targets of larger platform companies. Notably, small start-ups may not be able to monetize their inventions without a strong partner who can provide the necessary scale and/or complementary functionalities. Other start-ups, in contrast, may have aspirations or plans for an independent path to achieving economies of scale and the financing to get there. These hurdles that the nascent company would have to surmount to attain its plans, absent the merger, should receive full consideration.24
If the acquisition of a nascent company is shot down, the prospects for the nascent competitor from that point forward may be very different than its prospects pre-merger, which enters into the counterfactual.  Also, it should be recalled that the value of some technology is very time-sensitive (e.g. technology relating to a specific release of 5G standards). If a proposed merger fails, the nascent company may miss an important technology cycle necessary for the success of its invention and may even threaten its viability.25
 
IV. Looking at the Potential Buyer Factors
Evaluating the status of the buyer in the relevant market(s) is also necessary. For example, is the buyer already entrenched as dominant or simply one of several competitors in the market? Has the buyer made serial acquisitions in the same market? Has there been robust entry in the buyer’s market indicating ease of entry? Has the buyer engaged in independent innovation pre- or post-acquisition?
A. Acquirer’s Product Development
One failing of many of the “killer acquisition” articles is that they generally assume that an acquisition by an allegedly dominant platform is harmful to competition irrespective of the possibility that the acquisition is made in order to better compete (including) with another platform. In other words, it assumes perfect acquisition alignment in that each large platform acquires only the nascent firms that threaten them in their own market(s), ignoring the incentives of other platforms to make the same acquisition in order to grow into the competitive space of rivals. In effect, they assume that the platforms can perfectly predict the nascent competitors that will rise to success (as clearly not all nascent companies are acquired by the large platforms), and perfect market allocation among large platforms. In this respect, an enforcer should consider whether the nascent company is innovating in the market in which the platform/buyer currently has a strong or dominant position, or whether the buyer is extending into a market in which it may challenge another platform rival. For this reason, the notion of dispensing with market definition principles undermines the innovation goals of antitrust.26
Alternatively, the acquisition could relate to a future generation of product for which the buyer’s position is not established or secure. As an example, consider a company that is already strong in 4G products or services, but does not yet have a complete 5G strategy, making an acquisition of a nascent 5G IoT technology. The buyer, although strong or even “dominant” in 4G, may be one of several companies vying to be significant in 5G but currently lacking the IP or technology to compete. Does it serve competitive objectives to exclude the dominant/incumbent 4G player from competing aggressively to succeed in 5G?
That scenario may be much different than an acquisition by the same buyer of a nascent company involving a product for a “mature” 4G network. Thus, the mere nascent state of the seller itself does not tell the entire competitive story. In the first case above, the buyer may be seeking to establish its competitive position in the evolving market, even though it is dominant in the mature 4G market. In the latter case, it may be seeking to foreclose competition in the market it dominates. Recall that some large, even dominant, tech companies are not successful in developing products for the next generation (see Nokia, Blackberry, supra). Thus, while their current competitive significance may be high, their future significance may be in doubt. Large competitors in the present should not be precluded from seeking alternatives to their own internal development for the next generation of products or services, so long as an acquisition does not slow innovation or lead to market foreclosure.
If a buyer is developing a product similar to the nascent competitor’s product, then the stage of development and testing of the buyer’s product will be extremely important. The further along in the developmental pipeline both products are, the more reason for concern, and the opposite is equally true. This is well demonstrated in pharmaceuticals but also may be applicable in the tech sector where products that are not yet successfully engineered or coded and have not yet succeeded in beta testing are likely to be of less certainty, and therefore of less competitive significance, than products closer to commercialization.
B. Plan for Acquired Technology
Another important consideration is what the buyer will do with the acquired technology. Internal documents may be informative about the buyer’s plans for its own technology absent the acquisition. Evaluation of the justifications for the acquisition may also be telling as to the potential effects.
Deals in which the tech that is acquired and abandoned are inherently more suspect. They certainly will have fewer synergies than deals in which the technology is used to complement the buyer’s current technology or become part of the future technology and are more likely to allow for an immediate reduction in competition. Such transactions may not always be anticompetitive, such as when customers are transitioned to a more efficient, more advanced, or less costly network without sacrificing important features of the old network. But they should be viewed with greater concern.
Similarly, if the principal motivation for the deal is for the large purchaser to prevent the technology from falling into the hands of a rival who could successfully exploit it and undermine the current large or dominant player, then the transaction should be scrutinized. At the same time, if the acquisition will lead to efficiencies for the large buyer or an expansion of output in the market more generally, it should not be condemned, absent market foreclosure, merely because greater synergies could have been obtained if acquired by another buyer.
  
V. Conclusion
Rational evaluation of acquisitions of nascent competitors is well within reach. This exercise should be conducted in the presence of sound economic and factual information using predictive measures that have proven useful over many years of merger review. These tools can be applied as agencies employ their well-tested analytical frameworks and guidelines to the acquisition of nascent companies. Applying generalized concerns about dominance to specific acquisitions does not allow for a disciplined evaluation of potential merger-related effects.

3 These merger assessment tools are not meant to be employed as a means of policing concerns about the dominance of the acquiring firm that may exist independent of a specific transaction. Such concerns lie at the heart of some commentators’ views on “killer acquisitions.” In our view, to the extent that abuses of dominant market power exist, those concerns should be addressed under separate statutory authority granted to agencies to address dominance or monopolization. Seeking to curb the pro-competitive conduct of dominant firms does not protect competition or enhance consumer welfare.

10 In February 2013, the FTC challenged the merger between Nielsen and Arbitron. At the time of the merger, Nielsen and Arbitron did not compete directly but operated in complementary areas of media measurement, principally television and radio audience measurement. The FTC identified a relevant product market — a nationally syndicated cross-platform audience measurement service — that was still in development and was not yet commercially available. However, Nielsen and Arbitron (in partnership with another company) each had been working to develop the product. The complaint alleged that Nielsen and Arbitron were the best positioned to develop the relevant product, that other companies lacked the same capabilities, and that the combination would both eliminate future competition in the relevant market and increase the likelihood of Nielsen’s exercise of unilateral market power. The companies entered a consent agreement in which they agreed to divest assets to put another competitor in Arbitron’s position with ongoing obligations by Nielsen to support the divestiture’s effectiveness.

24 More generally, agencies should consider further study of the changed investment incentives that would accompany restrictions on acquisitions of nascent companies — a more hostile climate relating to such acquisitions could create disincentives for VCs to finance start-up activity.
25 This is a particularly important consideration when assessing “pre-emptive” measures, such as the proposal to reverse the burden of proof in acquisitions undertaken by certain specific platform companies. The incentives to invest in innovation, and the fate of existing nascent competitors in tech industries, could become instantly uncertain. The authors are not aware of any empirical research on this topic and implementing these measures without significant study seems risky.

39,"February 22, 2021",AG Nominee Garland Says He Will “Vigorously” Enforce Antitrust Law,"


President Joe Biden’s nominee for attorney general will face a host of pressing issues if confirmed to the job, but Judge Merrick Garland’s views on the topic of antitrust could end up being the most important for investors to understand, reported Reuters.
During confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday morning, February 22, Garland said he “absolutely” commits to “vigorously” enforcing antitrust law in an exchange with Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has championed the issue of increasing funding for and broadening the Justice Department’s powers to enforce economic competition.
If confirmed, Garland will inherit a lawsuit filed in October by the Justice Department against Alphabet’s  Google for what it alleges is anticompetitive behavior in the market for general search services.
Garland said that antitrust law was “my first love in law school,” and noted that he worked on antitrust law in private legal practice. “I take it very seriously and have throughout my entire career,” he said. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to antitrust law as the charter of American economic liberty, and I deeply believe that.”
There is bipartisan support in Congress for beefing up the federal government’s authority and resources to promote competition, particularly in Big Tech. At the same time that the Justice Department is suing Google, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a number of state attorneys general have also brought antitrust cases against Facebook,  for alleged anticompetitive behavior.
Sen. Klobuchar and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, have proposed legislation that would greatly increase funding for the Department of Justice and the FTC.
Klobuchar has separately introduced legislation that would require the Justice Department and the FTC to block mergers that would create “monopsony” power, when a firm becomes an overly dominant employer or purchaser of goods and services in a particular market. Monopsonies are the inverse of monopolies, which are firms that are overly dominant sellers of goods and services.

40,"February 22, 2021",UK Regulator Warns Big Tech Of Future Antitrust Probes,"


The UK competition watchdog has told Big Tech companies it is planning a series of antitrust investigations into their practices over the next year, signalling a tougher approach to reining in the sector in the wake of Brexit.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said the watchdog plans to mount a number of probes into internet giants including Google and Amazon in the coming months. 
The moves come as the watchdog looks to assert its newfound independence after Britain left the EU’s regulatory orbit in January. 
The CMA is due to be granted additional powers to police Big Tech later this year with the creation of a new sector-specific unit. “Until we have these new legal powers, if we want to achieve impact for consumers in the UK, we need to use our current [tools],” Coscelli said. “There are quite a few cases against the digital platforms in Brussels today and a number of these cases include the UK market.”

41,"February 21, 2021",How Texas And The Rest Of The US Regulate Electricity,"
By Theodore J. Kury (Director of Energy Studies, University of Florida)
Americans often take electricity for granted—until the lights go out. The recent cold wave and storm in Texas have placed considerable focus on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, the nonprofit corporation that manages the flow of electricity to more than 26 million Texans. Together, ERCOT and similar organizations manage about 60% of the US power supply.
From my research on the structure of the US electricity industry, I know that rules set by entities like ERCOT have major effects on Americans’ energy choices. The current power crunch in Texas and other affected states highlights the delicate balancing act that’s involved in providing safe, reliable electricity service at fair, reasonable rates. It also shows how arcane features of energy markets can have big effects at critical moments.

Bipartisan members of Congress plan to introduce a bill in coming weeks to make it easier for smaller news organizations to negotiate with Big Tech platforms, said Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel.
The US bill would be introduced at a time when Australia is in a pitched battle with Facebook, reported Reuters. The social media giant blocked news feeds and other pages – including those of charities, and health and emergency services – as part of a dispute over a proposed law that would require it and Google to pay news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or agree on a price through arbitration.
Buck, who was named the ranking member this month, told Reuters on Thursday the panel would bring out a series of antitrust bills and the first one in the coming weeks would allow smaller news organizations to negotiate collectively with Facebook and Alphabet’s Google.
Social media companies use news to attract customers and have been accused by news publishers of not sharing enough advertising revenue with them. The legislation could boost sales in the struggling news business.
While Facebook has fought publishers, Google has struck deals with them in France, Australia and other countries.

43,"February 18, 2021",House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Announces Hearings To Curb Platform Dominance,"


The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law announced it will hold a series of hearings starting next week, to consider legislative proposals to address the rise and abuse of market power online and to modernize the antitrust laws. 
The first hearing, entitled, “Reviving Competition, Part 1: Proposals to Address Gatekeeper Power and Lower Barriers to Entry Online,” will take place on February 25th at 10:00 a.m. E.T.
The hearings will launch the Committee’s competition agenda in the 117th Congress following its 16-month, bipartisan investigation into the state of competition online, which examined (1) competition problems in digital markets; (2) whether dominant firms had engaged in anticompetitive conduct online; and (3) the adequacy of current laws and enforcement levels to address these issues. 
As part of this top-to-bottom review, the Subcommittee received 1.3 million internal documents and communications from dominant online platforms; submissions from 38 antitrust experts; interviewed more than 240 market participants, former employees of the investigated platforms, and other individuals; and held seven hearings, including one with the Chief Executive Officers of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. 
The investigation culminated in a comprehensive report entitled Investigation of Competition in the Digital Marketplace: Majority Staff Report and Recommendations, which totaled more than 450-pages and included a number of recommendations. The Report is available here.
“For too long, the dominance of a handful of gatekeepers online has wreaked havoc on competition, suppressed innovation, and weakened entrepreneurship,” said Subcommittee on Antitrust Chairman David N. Cicilline. “During our investigation into the rise and abuse of monopoly power online, we uncovered significant evidence of anticompetitive conduct and harmful business practices by Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple that enabled these companies to entrench their monopoly power, abuse competitors, and harm consumers. After publishing a comprehensive report documenting this conduct, I pledged to undertake a series of legislative reforms to restore competition online and to strengthen the antitrust laws. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to do just that.”

Utah Sen. Mike Lee made an announcement this week that he’s ready to lead the charge against US Big Tech companies and what he sees as a widespread effort among those interests to suppress conservative voices.
“We have much to address,” Lee said in a release. “The actions of Big Tech continue to divide the nation, undermine fundamental liberties and distort the market. 
“The Silicon Valley fairy tale of innovation and technological progress sold to Americans has turned into a corporatist nightmare of censorship and hypocrisy.”
Lee noted his long-running concerns as a member of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee and offered praise to subcommittee chairwoman and former Democratic presidential candidate from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar for her stated willingness to work across the aisle. Lee also promised to work toward curbing the behaviors of those tech company operators who he said “are no longer content simply to profit off of us — they want also to control what information we are allowed to access.”
“As the leading Republican on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee for the last decade, I have repeatedly warned of the dangers posed by Big Tech,” Lee said. “But despite those warnings, our antitrust enforcers were asleep at the wheel while Silicon Valley transformed from a center of innovation into a center of acquisition.

45,"February 18, 2021",Japan Should Update e-Commerce Laws: Lawmaker,"


Japanese policymakers must keep open the option of toughening regulations on technology giants if an e-commerce law introduced this month does not work as expected, said a lawmaker overseeing the ruling party’s deliberations on competition policy, reported Reuters.
On February 1, Japan joined a global trend towards increased scrutiny of possible antitrust activity by big tech names with legislation requiring disclosure of information such as terms of contracts with business partners, how search rankings operate and reasons for suspending or refusing vendors.
The law, which offers leeway in how much information companies must submit, comes as authorities in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere confront the clout of global e-commerce and social media firms, concerned of their significant market dominance.
“If this joint regulatory approach isn’t sufficient, we have to make rules going a step further,” Tatsuya Ito, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Ito, who oversees competition policy in the LDP’s powerful policy research council, described the law as “light-touch”, saying policymakers must assess how it is working before taking any further steps or expanding its scope.
Japan’s e-commerce market was worth 19 trillion yen (US$180 billion) in 2019. Its app store market reached US$20.2 billion in 2020, showed data from App Annie.
Amazon and Rakuten were the largest e-commerce operators in 2018, while the app store market was split between Apple and Alphabet’s Google, showed a 2019 report from the Japan Fair Trade Commission.
Under the new law, operators of shopping sites and app stores with annual Japan revenue of at least 300 billion yen and 200 billion yen, respectively, must submit annual reports to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

46,"February 18, 2021",Facebook Blocks Australian Access To News On Its Platform,"


Facebook announced Thursday, February 18, it has blocked Australians from viewing and sharing news on the platform because of proposed laws in the country to make digital giants pay for journalism. Australian publishers can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences, the US-based company said in a statement.
Australian users cannot share Australian or international news. International users outside Australia also cannot share Australian news.
“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” Facebook regional managing director William Easton said.
“It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” Easton added.
The announcement came a day after Treasurer Josh Frydenberg described as “very promising” negotiations between Facebook and Google with Australian media companies. Frydenberg said after weekend talks with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google, he was convinced that the platforms “do want to enter into these commercial arrangements. Frydenberg said he had had a “a constructive discussion” with Zuckerberg after Facebook blocked Australian news.
“He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward,” Frydenberg tweeted.

47,"February 16, 2021",Sen. Lee Sets Senate Republican Antitrust Agenda,"


Upon being assigned the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee issued the following statement Tuesday, February 16, on antitrust matters in the 117th Congress:
“Antitrust law and policy continues to grab headlines and attract attention in Congress, and there appears to be a broad consensus that the status quo isn’t working. With the Senate split 50-50, any effort to reform or update our antitrust laws will need to be a bipartisan effort with buy-in from both sides. I look forward to playing a leading role in that process, including by reintroducing the One Agency Act with new provisions to address the inequities of FCC merger review. I appreciate Sen. Klobuchar’s opening contribution to this bipartisan discussion, and am excited to work through the details with her and others to reach a consensus approach to improving antitrust enforcement for the 21st century.
“We have much to address. The actions of Big Tech continue to divide the nation, undermine fundamental liberties, and distort the market. The Silicon Valley fairytale of innovation and technological progress sold to Americans has turned into a corporatist nightmare of censorship and hypocrisy.
“For over two centuries, conservatives have echoed the voices of America’s founding fathers, warning of the danger of concentrated political power. The greatest threat to liberty has always been state coercion.
“This remains true, but increasingly that threat is rivaled by another: the soft totalitarianism of a corporate shadow state. It is not the government’s monopoly on force that today’s left uses to punish wrong think, but the economic monopolies of multinational corporations. While the means are different, the effect may in some cases be the same.
“We now see forming before our very eyes a world in which the massive tech companies that facilitate so much of our daily lives are no longer content simply to profit off of us; they want also to control what information we are allowed to access.
“As the leading Republican on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee for the last decade, I have repeatedly warned of the dangers posed by Big Tech. But despite those warnings, our antitrust enforcers were asleep at the wheel while Silicon Valley transformed from a center of innovation into a center of acquisition. Instead of competing to be the next Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon, today’s tech startups are pushed by their private-equity backers to sell out to Google, Apple, Facebook, or Amazon.
“Innovation is supposed to benefit consumers by challenging the market incumbents, not strengthening their monopoly power. But this works only when there is adequate antitrust enforcement, rather than laissez-faire deference to the sort of speculative efficiencies Judge Bork warned against in The Antitrust Paradox. Everyone knows that illicitly obtained monopolies lead to higher prices and lower quality for consumers. Now we are seeing that, unchecked, they can also threaten our most basic liberties.
“At the same time, some of my colleagues across the aisle would seize this moment to radically alter our antitrust enforcement regime in a manner that would undermine both the economy and Congress’s legislative prerogative.
“The consumer welfare standard—which ensures that the primary beneficiaries of the antitrust laws are the people, rather than big business—is essential to maintaining free markets. It is also essential to preventing unelected judges from advancing their private political preferences by applying the antitrust laws to non-economic harms. Put another way, it prevents judges from usurping Congress’s legislative role.
“The consumer welfare standard also conforms antitrust law to basic doctrines of fairness and equality under the law. Rather than simply declaring that ‘big is bad’, antitrust law—properly applied—looks to conduct and its effect on consumers in the same way that other laws judge a person’s conduct and not their status. Straying from these guiding principles would cripple our economy at a time when millions are already struggling, and it would undermine one of the foundational principles of our republic.
“For those reasons, any legislative attempt to replace or undermine the consumer welfare standard is a non-starter. It’s also unnecessary. Our current laws are more than up to the task of policing the anticompetitive conduct that has left so many markets bereft of competition. Make no mistake: the consumer welfare standard is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for any business if properly enforced. Our time and resources will be much better spent ensuring that we are adequately enforcing existing laws, rather than pursuing drastic changes with unintended consequences that could wreak havoc on the economy.

US President Joe Biden’s administration is considering a new approach as it struggles with a messy vaccine rollout, setting aside his harsh criticisms of the tech industry and taking Silicon Valley up on its latest offers to help fight the pandemic, reported Politico.
Amazon is pitching its expertise in IT and operations to help in vaccine distribution. Airbnb is suggesting it can help create “vaccine depots” using its vast network of real estate across the country. And Google is looking to give free ad space to public health authorities.
Companies like Amazon are well placed to get the vaccine into exactly the right trusted churches, clinics, and corner pharmacies, said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

EU privacy watchdog EDPS on Wednesday, February 10, backed the bloc’s push to curb the power of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook via new tough rules and suggested more safeguards to boost users’ privacy rights, reported Reuters.
Unveiled by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton in December last year, the two sets of rules are known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).
DMA takes aim at online gatekeepers which will be subject to a list of dos such as sharing some data with rivals and regulators and don’ts among them not favoring their own services on their platforms.
The DSA requires large online platforms and other internet players to do more to tackle illegal content, be more transparent about political advertising on their platforms. DMA fines can be as much as 10% of global turnover and 6% for DSA breaches.
“The EDPS welcomes the (DMA) proposal, as it seeks to promote fair and open markets and the fair processing of personal data,” the EU watchdog, which ensures that EU institutions comply with the bloc’s privacy rules, said in an opinion.
EDPS stated that gatekeepers should provide an easy and accessible way for users to consent or decline the use of their personal data by the companies for their other services, and that there should be tests to ensure personal data is effectively anonymous.

51,"February 11, 2021",Apple Privacy Chief Says New Bill Could “Destroy iPhone As You Know It”,"


A bill has been introduced in the North Dakota State Senate that could ban app storefronts (via The Verge). That would mean that Apple would have to remove the App Store from the iPhone, the iPad, the Apple Watch, and the iPod Touch. The bill, number 2333, seeks to remove those app stores like Apple’s App Store that demand developers use only their in-app payment platform. 
State Sen. Kyle Davison (Republican – Fargo) introduced the bill Tuesday, February 9, before a Senate committee. During a press conference, Sen. Davison said, “The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies.”  Davison believes that the 30% cut of in-app revenue garnered by Apple and Google ends up “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.”
Apple already testified against the bill on Tuesday in a hearing with North Dakota’s Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, told the committee that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” The law would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into the iPhone by design. Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.”
The bill requires that any “digital application distribution platform” taking in more than US$10 million a year in revenue will need to adhere to certain restrictions. For example, if the bill becomes state law, in North Dakota Apple would have to allow users to sideload apps from a third-party app store, something that the tech giant currently does not allow.

A new bill introduced in the North Dakota Senate might have far-reaching consequences for app store operators. The bill, Senate Bill 2333, seeks to ban stores like Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store from mandating developers only use those app stores and their respective in-app payment systems. It also bans retaliation against developers in the event they choose an alternative distribution channel or payment system. 
“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies,” said Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo), who introduced the bill before a Senate committee on Tuesday, told reporters in a press conference yesterday, as reported by The Bismarck Tribune. Davison said the 30 percent fee imposed on app developers who sell software through Apple and Google’s marketplaces has the effect of “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.”
Proponents of the bill said it addresses concerns of a monopoly by Apple and Google.
“They control so much about what consumers can get, what businesses can do, and it really puts these businesses in a tough position,” said Onsharp President and CEO Joe Sandin, of Fargo. His business develops apps.
DAWA Solutions Group President Jeff Zarling, of Williston, said the app stores have gone beyond distribution in having “injected themselves into every aspect of the revenue-generating model of every business that runs on their app store, in any transaction, anywhere down the line.”

EU lawmakers overseeing new digital regulation in Europe want to force Big Tech companies to pay for news, echoing a similar move in Australia and strengthening the hand of publishers against Google and Facebook, reported The Financial Times.
The initiative from members of the European parliament would be a serious blow to Google, which has threatened to leave Australia in protest at a planned new law that would compel it to pay for news.
Facebook has also warned it will stop users in Australia from sharing news if the legislation is passed in its current form.
European parliament members working on two landmark draft European digital regulations, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), told the Financial Times the laws could be amended as they pass through theEU parliament to include aspects of the Australian reforms.
These include the option of binding arbitration for licensing agreements and requiring tech companies to inform publishers about changes to how they rank news stories on their sites.
“We will never accept this situation when somebody is using content . . . and authors are not remunerated at all” said Andrus Ansip, MEP and former commissioner.
Alex Saliba, a Maltese MEP who led the parliament’s first report on the DSA, said the Australian approach to Google and Facebook had managed to address “the acute bargaining power imbalances” with publishers.
“With their dominant market position in search, social media and advertising, large digital platforms create power imbalances and benefit significantly from news content,” he said. “I think it is only fair that they pay back a fair amount.”

54,"February 8, 2021",The Necessary Revival of Sherman Act Section 2,"
The application of the antitrust laws to single-firm behavior is challenging. On the one hand, neither courts nor government enforcers are well equipped, or even inclined, to micro-manage a single firm’s choice of suppliers, customers, distribution strategies, or product bundling, even if that firm is a monopolist or otherwise dominant. On the other hand, firms with substantial market power can inflict serious economic harm. For many years, the difficulty of controlling exclusionary practices led to the de-emphasis of Sherman Act Section 2 cases. But in recent years, as the harms from single-firm exclusionary behavior have become more apparent, in the big tech world and beyond, there has been a resurgence of interest in Section 2. This essay argues that the antitrust laws are indeed capable of effectively addressing practices that sustain market dominance, and it encourages renewed attention to, and use of, Section 2.

Section 2 of the Sherman Act has been a problem child for a long time. Judge Learned Hand put his finger on its difficulties 75 years ago, when he wrote in his famous Alcoa opinion that “[t]he successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.”2 Yet only a few pages earlier, in the same opinion, Hand had also written that “[t]hroughout the history of these statutes it has been constantly assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and in spite ...

Intense regulatory scrutiny on the digital economy and “Big Tech” companies has led to a raft of expert reports and regulatory proposals across the world relating to the digital economy. Regulators have increasingly focused on identifying digital businesses who play a “gatekeeper” role as the basis of regulatory intervention. However, the exact delineations of how such a “gatekeeper” designation should be determined remain amorphous. There are complex questions where further debate and consideration should continue, in particular: how should a “gatekeeper” designation be formulated, and is a “blacklist” or principles-based approach to restricted conduct more suitable in the dynamic digital economy? Beyond the form such regulation takes, what types of “gatekeeper” conduct should be regulated and how will this impact longer-term competition and innovation incentives?

56,"February 8, 2021",On the Competitive Effects of Single-Homing: The Case of Hybrid Marketplaces,"
By revisiting the “competitive bottleneck” hypothesis in the context of multi-sided platform competition, this paper shows that the existence of single-homing consumers needs not to raise anti-competitive concerns regarding the behaviour of the online platform running the marketplace, as the nature of the induced competitive effects will critically depend on the specificities of the platforms’ business model. This then suggests that the only sensible way of assessing the likely competitive effects of single-homing in the context of platform competition is a case-by-case approach that captures the heterogeneity of adopted business models as well as the complex competitive dynamics involved. In particular, several reasons justify why hybrid platform marketplaces (i.e. marketplaces run by vertically integrated platforms which operate also as resellers) would not be able to extract high fees from third-party sellers and from consumers even if a significant proportion of the latter decided to patronize a single gatekeeper platform.

 INTRODUCTION

The growing digitalization of the economy has led to the emergence of new business models, based on multi-sided platforms, which have inspired a relatively recent, but rapidly expanding, strand of the economics literature on the economics of two-sided markets.2
This literature has given rise to many important challenges as far as competition policy enforcement is conce...

57,"February 8, 2021",Gatekeepers’ Tollbooths for Market Access: How to Safeguard Unbiased Intermediation,"
Gatekeepers may seek to maximize revenues by replacing any unbiased, purely relevance-based intermediation of business users with a biased, payment-based intermediation. To this end, search engines, app stores or online marketplaces may exploit an entrenched intermediation power by making the outcome of their matching increasingly dependent on the amount of money that a business user is paying the platform for the intermediation, rather than on objective criteria to determine the relevance of offerings. Using the example of the systematic replacement of “organic” search results with paid results in Google Search, the article outlines under which circumstances a shift to a biased intermediation constitutes a market failure. The article concludes that an excessive substitution of unbiased intermediation by a gatekeeper may amount to an unjustified private “toll” to access markets that reduces competition and innovation. The article then outlines how regulation can ensure a sufficient level of purely relevance-based intermediation of gatekeepers.

Recently, the term “gatekeeper” has featured prominently in policy discussions concerning whether “big tech” needs to be regulated and whether antitrust laws need to be reformed to better protect consumers from their market power. Consequently, this Article asks: what exactly is an online gatekeeper? Within that discussion, it also asks whether the term is useful within antitrust. Next, it discusses some general guidelines that should be considered when determining whether an online service qualifies as a gatekeeper. Finally, it discusses potential concerns with gatekeepers that go beyond the standard litany of antitrust theories of harm — namely, information asymmetries and representations made to users and businesses.

In the 1990s, the typical path to the Internet was a subscription to America Online (“AOL”) using a dial up modem on a Microsoft Windows computer. AOL was, at the time, the dominant online presence and offered what was commonly referred to as a “walled garden” — providing email (who can forget the notification “You Got Mail”), messaging, and website access for an hourly and, later, monthly fee.2 A walled garden is an online ecosystem where the provider exerts considerable control over the content including restricting access to non-approved content.3 The emergence of broadband internet access (such as, DSL and cable modems) and standalone web browsers, such as Netscape, began to change that ...

The allegedly entrenched positions of certain dominant companies in the digital economy and the alleged inability of antitrust enforcement to prevent potential anticompetitive conduct by these firms have led several European jurisdictions to consider an overhaul of their competition policy approach. A common theme is giving competition authorities or newly created digital agencies the power to regulate firms with gatekeeper status. This article discusses the criteria that have been proposed in the EU, UK, and Germany for identifying the firms, or gatekeepers, that are to be subject to such regulation. It also highlights advantages and disadvantages of different approaches as well as challenges for practitioners in their implementation, and discusses some potentially far-reaching consequences due to inconsistencies in the proposed criteria across jurisdictions.

60,"February 8, 2021",Proposed Solutions for Big Tech in the United States: Out of Step or Déjà Vu?,"
The U.S. House Report on digital markets suggests adopting important changes to U.S. antitrust law. If implemented, the proposed changes (particularly those related to unilateral practices) would bring U.S. antitrust law closer to EU competition law, by lowering the burden of proof and expanding existing prohibitions. Yet, the experience from the EU suggests that the proposed reforms are unlikely to provide an adequate solution for the problems identified with digital markets. In December 2020, the European Commission presented a proposed text for the Digital Markets Act, a regulation that seek to ensure “contestable and fair” digital markets. The regulation stems from the explicit recognition that even a broader competition law regime, such as the one available in the EU, cannot address the problems with big tech. One could thus question whether expanding U.S. antitrust law is likely to provide an adequate relief in dealing with the problems described in the House Report.

61,"February 8, 2021",Regulating Digital Gatekeepers: Lessons from the Banking Industry,"
Gatekeepers are not exclusive to digital markets. Gatekeepers exist in many other industries such as banking, telecoms and energy. The new element introduced by digital gatekeepers is their scale and scope: There are digital gatekeepers that have a global scope, have millions of users and are present in several industries. The potential anticompetitive conducts of those digital gatekeepers might have a large impact over consumers. Banks have traditionally been the main gatekeepers and facilitators of the overall financial industry. The banking industry provides an illustration of an industry where regulation has been imposed to reduce the market power of gatekeepers. The analysis of such regulations shows that regulatory remedies necessarily have to be tailored to the relevant competition problems, to the characteristics of the industry and of the business models of the market participants. A too general regulation runs the risk of not being operational and creating uncertainties amongst market players.

Digital gatekeepers can be defined as entities that “have a high degree of control and influence over the relationship between buyers and sellers, or over access by advertisers to potential buyers” which gives these entities “three distinct forms of power: the ability to control access and charge high fees; the ability to manipulate rankings or prominence; and the ability to control reputations.”2 Gatekeepers are not exclu...

62,"February 7, 2021",Microsoft CEO Says Big Tech Antitrust Issues Can Be Solved With Laws,"


Microsoft President Brad Smith said that though Microsoft isn’t a target for these new big tech antitrust cases, there are key lessons governments should take from its 2001 case, reported CNET.
“Twenty years ago, almost solely the vehicle that governments used was an investigation and a lawsuit. It was a case against individual companies,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said Tuesday, February 2, during an editorial roundtable with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. This time around, Smith said, governments appear to realize that legislation can help solve larger concerns about competition. “I think regulators have broadly concluded that cases are both too narrow and too slow.”
The European Union has introduced ideas like the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to spell out how much companies with large user bases can promote their own products to users ahead of those from a competitor, and the Digital Services Act, which would put pressure on companies to do a better job moderating their platforms. Tech companies could face fines of up to 10% of their global revenue — easily reaching into the billions of dollars — for breaking these rules if they’re implemented.
The EU isn’t the only government targeting tech. Microsoft’s comments come at a time when governments around the world are expressing concerns about increasing signs of bad behavior among tech companies. Amazon, Apple and Google have been accused of kneecapping competitors by pushing their own products to the top of search results, deservedly or not. 
To Nadella, this is part of a larger problem with the tech world, where companies worry about growing first before they worry about unintended consequences that come with that type of scale. For example, he said, companies need to consider how their growth can impact people’s trust. And whether the company’s being fair as it grows.
“The business model and the technology need to account for the unintended consequence, with the unit of scale being one,” he said to CNET.
For many tech watchers, that’s a bit rich coming from the CEO of Microsoft, a company whose software reached a worldwide scale so quickly and forcefully that it eventually led to the antitrust ruling in 2001.

The likes of Facebook and Twitter were right to block former US President Donald Trump from their global platforms following the Capitol Hill riots, Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s digital regulator, told POLITICO.
The Danish politician added that the European Commission’s new online content proposal, known as the Digital Services Act, would have intervened before these private companies blocked the former president from posting online. Her words run counter to those of leading politicians, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, who have criticized that decision. 
“I can’t say I would have done it differently if I was in their shoes,” Vestager told the Digital Bridge, POLITICO‘s transatlantic tech newsletter, when asked if she agreed with Facebook, Google, and Twitter banning Trump from using their platforms.
“But with the Digital Services Act, the point is that it shouldn’t have gotten that far. There would have been interaction with the user along the way,” she added. “We want to increase transparency on how these decisions are made. If platforms want to ban you, they have to notify you and explain what that is.”
In December, Brussels outlined its new content-moderation proposals, including potentially hefty fines if social media companies did not stop online hate speech and illegal products from circulating widely on their digital networks. 
Separate plans — in a bill called the Digital Markets Act — also outlined a fundamental revamp of the bloc’s antitrust rules, potentially giving regulators the power to step into markets before a specific company can become too dominant.

Andy Jassy will succeed Jeff Bezos as Amazon’s CEO. Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter of 2021. The CEO succession comes at a time of enormous financial and technical strength for Amazon but big antitrust challenges, reported CNBC.
“Andy’s got a promotion and his job now includes testifying to Congress, so good luck with that,” former Amazon VP Tim Bray told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” in an interview Wednesday, February 3. Bray later added, “Andy’s a smart guy. He’s a good leader. I suspect he’ll do well. But let’s not claim it’s going to be an easy job.”
Amazon is a likely next target for regulators, state attorneys general, and lawmakers who are increasing their antitrust scrutiny on Big Tech companies. Facebook and Google were sued in the US last year for alleged antitrust violations. But Amazon could be up next this year as investigations throughout the US and EU continue. And it won’t be Bezos taking the heat in the lawsuits and congressional hearings any more.

Lawmakers are already on alert. Shortly after Amazon announced Jassy would be the new CEO, Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado), a member of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, tweeted that he’d like to question Jassy. This is the same House subcommittee that put out that epic report last year laying out alleged antitrust violations from Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.

Panel Summary
This Panel brought together speakers from diverse backgrounds, jurisdictions and professions leading to a rich cross disciplinary discussion and was moderated by Professor David Evans (Global Economics Group / Jevons Institute). He set the stage for the discussion by noting that there is robust innovation by local and Chinese players in the APAC region and encouraged the Panel to address the issues arising from the digital economy, and to assess how different jurisdictions are attempting to address similar problems, and if there are opportunities for the jurisdictions to learn from each other.
Some relevant policy recommendations emerged from this panel. Illustratively, Geeta Gouri (formerly, CCI) emphasized the need for understanding and respecting the market logic and being wary of the per se approach in dominance cases, Yong Lim (Seoul National University AI Policy Initiative) brought to the forefront the need for careful institutional design and the need for reliance of economic evidence. He also spoke about the need to build skill and expertise in crafting proper remedies in competition matters. Similarly, the need for using consumer welfare standard as the guiding principle for regulating digital platforms and a word of caution against over regulation, as well as regulatory fragmentation, also emerged.

The Competition Commission of India has dismissed a case which alleged that Google’s integration of its videoconferencing service Meet with the Gmail App amounted to anti-competitive behavior.
The case was filed by Baglekar Akash Kumar, a student at Hyderabad’s Osmania University, against Google and Google India alleging contravention of the Competition Act. Kumar claimed that Google was dominant in the “internet-related services and products” and the Gmail app was dominant in the “email and direct messaging market.” The company’s integration of Meet with Gmail amounted to abuse of dominant position in one relevant market to enter another, which amounts to a violation under Section 4(2)(e) of the Competition Act, Kumar claimed.
However, the Commission ruled that users can choose between either of the apps with all functions, without having to use the other. Further, although the Google Meet tab has been integrated with the Gmail app, users are not coerced to use Meet exclusively, and are free to use any other video conferencing app.

Rod Sims was perhaps one of the only people in Australia who didn’t flinch last month when Google threatened to pull its Google Search from the country. As Australia’s top antitrust watchdog, Sims and the agency he leads, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has been behind a law that will force it to pay news publishers for featuring articles on its site.
Google, which is valued above $1 trillion, almost as much as the entire GDP of Australia, and holds a 94% share of the online search market there, has waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to prevent the law from going ahead. Facebook, too, had also vowed to withdraw its news service from Australia if the law is passed. 
Even the United States, which is leading its own multi-agency antitrust campaign against Big Tech companies, has sided with Google and Facebook, attacking the Australian proposed law as “fundamentally imbalanced” and suggesting it could violate the U.S.-Australia free trade agreement. Instead, the U.S. government suggested Australia scrap the law in favor of a voluntary requirement.

70,"February 2, 2021",Reshaping the Contours of Combination Threshold through the 2020 Draft Competition Amendment Bill – Meeting the Need with Digital Merger Control in India?,"
By Dhanendra Kumar & Anish Gupta1
 
I. Background
The Competition Act, 2002 replaced the toothless Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (“MRTP”) in 2002, as it was considered insufficient to deter anti-competitive conduct. However, considering the changing dynamics of competition law and creating a robust competition regime for changing market trends, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) felt the need to further analyze the Act in light of the current situation. It therefore constituted the Competition Law Review Committee (“CLRC”) to study and research present market trends, and existing government policies and regulatory mechanisms to check if such policies and regulations are in line with market practices.
 
II. The Proposed Amendments – Merger Control
The Draft Competition Amendment bill, 2020 prepared by the CLRC, put forward certain recommendations for amendments2 such as statutory recognition for so-called “green channel” approval, expanding the definitions of  “control” and “group,” a speedier process for reviewing and assessing combinations, changes in standstill obligations, statutory recognition of inquiry processes, and the central government’s power to set new thresholds for merger control. This article, however, broadly discusses the proposed amendment to the combination threshold regime and its impact on digital mergers in areas such as e-commerce, fin-tech, start-ups, etc. It further makes recommendations both on a national and global level to increase coordination and cooperation in regulating digital mergers that may be harmful to competition.
Section 5 of the Competition Act, 20023 deals with “combinations” and lays down specific thresholds based on the monetary assets and turnover of the enterprise. The proposed amendment however introduces an “empowering” provision that would permit the central government in conjunction with the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) to set out other criteria to determine whether a given transaction is to be viewed as a “combination,” in addition to the asset-size and turnover criteria.
 
III. Need for an Overhaul in Merger Control
Section 6 of the Draft Amendment Bill4 empowers the central government in consultation with CCI to identify any other ground to classify a transaction as a combination. This is a laudable steps by the committee, as it will increase the jurisdiction of the CCI by bringing more transactions under its purview in a more standardized and progressive form.  The objective behind the alteration was to bring transactions in the digital market into both administrative and judicial scrutiny, as previously they were often non- notifiable to the CCI due to their asset-light nature, despite having the potential to produce competitive harm.
The proposed modification expands the provision to include agreements entered in the digital market as it would include “control over data” or “specialized assets” under the list of conditions used in determining dominance. The shifting of the thresholds from asset-size turnover to deal-size would result in increased compliance costs for businesses. Such a shift in threshold is favourable to nascent enterprises or start-ups as it opens the door for their growth and expansion, whereas previously they may have been likely to be acquired by dominant players in the market to eliminate any threat they may pose.
 
IV. Exemption of Certain Combinations – Doing More Harm Than Good
In 2016, the exempted certain combinations from the need for approval if the “target firm’s” assets were below INR 350 crore and their turnover was below INR 1000 crore.5 This arguably posed more threat to competition than justified by the “ease of doing business” in technology-driven markets.6 The exemption from notifying such “nascent acquisitions” risks so “killer acquisitions” that would eliminate growth by new entrants that would have the potential to disrupt dominant players through its pool of fresh talents, innovative ideas and government subsidies. The proposed amendment is welcome, as it would make antitrust regulators more vigilant towards enterprises or firms who believe in practicing “one-player market rule.” Hence, the new deal-size (transactional value), threshold for merger control will impact heavily on e-commerce and tech giants as any acquisitions by them would have to be notified to the CCI, to determine whether there would be an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (“AAEC”) in the market.
 
V. A Global Reset on Digital Mergers: Need for a Global Expert Review Committee?
There is also a need for the regulation of global M&A regulations especially, amongst the e-commerce and tech giants. Lately, the CEOs of the big tech giants (Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple) testified before the U.S. Congress.7 The primary aim of the investigation was to check for unfair data practices and surveillance of other companies which big tech fears as a potential threat, and their abusive strategies to protect its power by “buying, copying, or by cutting off” potential competition.8
However, the only defence for adopting such strategies were “providing better and convenient services to their customers.” The antitrust agencies noted that such defences cannot be provided at the cost of the economy and consumer welfare.
The UK government’s Furman review focused on “Unlocking Digital Competition”9 and critically analysed the problem of growing competition concerns (the tipping point) in the digital space globally, and suggested recommendations to grapple with the persistent dominance of big tech companies. The report also highlighted how the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) was responsible for not identifying and overlooking the long-term impacts of anti-competitive mergers in the digital space such as the Facebook/Instagram acquisition or the Facebook/WhatsApp acquisition.10 On October 23, 2019, Facebook, before Congress, confessed that it feared the competitive threats of Instagram and Whatsapp.11 Google/DoubleClick12 was another master acquisition in the advertising technology business. Paypal/iZettle13 was also a high profile UK CMA phase 2 case where Paypal acquired iZettle for $ 2.2 billion when it was initially valued at $ 1.1 billion.
Over the last 10 years, these big tech firms have already made an unnerving 400 plus acquisitions globally and few have been blocked or subject to conditions for approval in the UK or elsewhere.14 These acquisitions have done no justice to the e-commerce sector. The recent probe of Amazon’s acquisition of a 16 percent stake in the food delivery company Deliveroo caused serious concern in the incipient ultra-fast grocery delivery market.15 Walmart’s strategy of acquiring Jet.com, a smart and fast-growing online retailer, for $3 billion in 201616 then further acquiring Art.com, an online specialty retailer of wall art and other home-decor products in 201817 highlights the need for valuation analysis in merger control.
The major reason for acquisitions of such nascent/targeted companies in the digital market is because of their “small size and low turnover.” Such targeted  companies raises no issue as selling their companies to the potential acquirer would  help them in generating funds for the formation of their own venture capital market. However, the ultimate harm in this process is always faced by the consumers as there remains no countervailing buying power due to limited competition existing in the market. The initial absence of any firm provision both in India and globally to deter, the growth of such anti-competitive conduct by the dominant tech and e-commerce entities have paved an impetus for them to walk on the roads of profiteering.
Therefore, the need for a thorough analysis by economic and market experts becomes necessary to identify the relevant counterfactuals in big mergers. However, there is also a requirement to enact broader policy reforms that might find more pro-active methods and a more targeted approach in dealing and assessing the intent of the acquiring firm.
 
VI. Conclusion
The loss of potential competition by acquiring a small or nascent firm is no more a novel theory of harm but in the buy versus build era, competition watchdogs should concern themselves with the contemporary and dynamic marketing strategies practiced by dominant players. The rapid increase of nascent acquisitions not only involved in the killing of a product or innovation but also are seriously to the detriment of consumer choice.
The CLRC recommendation concerning to the “shift to valuation analysis threshold” in merger control is undoubtedly a much-needed shot in the arm for dominant players in the digital space, but it however failed to make suggestions similar to those in the Furman review, such as assessing a merger using an “expected harm test” i.e. shifting the approach to merger control from a “balance of probabilities” to a “balance of harm.” Ex post review would also help competition agencies to trace or check the extent to which the success of the target’s product depended on the acquisition. The CLRC in its draft competition amended bill should also have come up with a recommendation concerning “retrospective evaluation” of selected cases, that escaped the scrutiny of regulators in India (such as Facebook/Whatsapp or Facebook/Instagram), as such mergers were not notified in India.
Closer co-operation and co-ordination among other national antitrust agencies is essential, as it would monitor potential anti-competitive conduct arising from new technologies in cross-border digital mergers. Apart from the new shift in merger thresholds, further economic policy tools and frameworks are required to better understand and assess online markets, and a strategic and periodic market study approach should be pursued at both national and international level to address the challenges of the digital economy.

Panel Summary
Korea, with its three decades of competition experience and vibrant and robust technology industry, is ahead of many of its western counterparts in digital regulation. The Panel discussed certain important issues in respect of app markets in particular and mobile ecosystem in general, use of ‘Abuse of superior bargaining position’ provisions (“ASBP”) and certain key concerns regarding different approaches to policy making viz. focus on consumers versus focus on businesses, closed system versus open system, stringent regulation versus collaborative regulation.
The Panel was moderated by Hwang Lee (Korea University School of Law) who noted the widespread use of ABSP in the Korean context and its increasing international appeal. Korea has been a frequent user ASBP as highlighted by Yong Lim (Seoul National University AI Policy Initiative), who went onto discuss the features, merits and demerits of the use of ASBP. Hwang Lee underscored the need to balance data protection concerns with innovation in the mobile ecosystem and acknowledged...

Panel Summary
The Panel discussed few themes relevant to the Indian mobile phone ecosystem, such as the need to understand the business model of the digital players and the unique features of the Indian mobile ecosystem, need to give primacy to consumer welfare while addressing competition concerns, and having a nuanced approach with respect to assessment of consumer harm. The Panel also cast a spotlight on the issue of Indian competition agency following the footsteps of its western counterparts and the merits / demerits of such approach.
The Panel was moderated by Aditya Bhattacharjea (Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi) who noted that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has taken a rational and not a ‘per se’ approach in interpreting the abuse of dominance provisions. He also raised the concern that if one accepts the proposition that digital eco...

73,"January 31, 2021",EU May Delay Big Tech Hearing,"


Legislators in the European Union have informed Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon that they are open to delaying a potential hearing beyond February 1, its initially scheduled date, Reuters reported.
The European Parliament had invited the leaders of the firms to a hearing in Europe to aid them in forming an opinion on stringent new regulations that the European Commission had put forward. Parliament’s economic affairs committee provided the invitations.
That committee is “willing to consider rescheduling and looking into alternative dates later than the originally planned date of Feb. 1,” per a letter viewed by the news outlet. Legislators are willing to hold the hearing in March of February, Reuters reported.
Antitrust watchdogs in the bloc want the tech companies to stop business practices designed to maintain their leading positions and dominate smaller competitors. They also want the companies to take further actions to remove harmful and illicit content on their systems, with large financial penalties for those who fail to do so.
In December, the European Commission revealed comprehensive possible new rules for digital services that would cover social media, online marketplaces and other platforms, providing first drafts of the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA).
“The two proposals serve one purpose: to make sure that we, as users, have access to a wide choice of safe products and services online. And that businesses operating in Europe can freely and fairly compete online just as they do offline,” Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said in a release at the time.

74,"January 29, 2021",Digital Ecosystems – a New Economic Paradigm?,"
By: Harry Hong (OECD On The Level)
What are digital ecosystems and what are their characteristics? 
The most successful digital companies in recent years have increasingly been building their business model around large ecosystems of complementary products and services centred around their core service. These digital ecosystems offer access to their consumers to a line of products and services with a technological linkage increasing the complementarity between them. For example, Google, in addition to its search engine, has a strong position in browsers, operating systems and video streaming. Also, Facebook, from its origins as a social network, has expanded into messaging, devices, gaming and retail.
There are several key characteristics of the digital economy that facilitate and encourage the development of digital ecosystems. As Marc Bourreau suggests, among others, large economies of scope and scale across markets, and network effects play important roles on the supply side, while consumption synergies due to technological linkages are crucial on the demand side. The complementarity of services on offer may be seen as advantageous by some customers, who then become locked in to that particular ecosystem. Also, by collecting, analysing and aggregating large amounts of data, digital ecosystems can generate significant benefits and a comparative advantage against competing firms that cannot access the data. Moreover, the value created from data and the information it incorporates is reinforced through the data feedback-loop, which is enabled through machine learning and AI technologies…

75,"January 29, 2021",Be Careful What You Wish For: Why Discretion To Fine-Tune Digital Markets May Not Be In The Interest Of Authorities (Or The Public Interest At Large),"
By: Pablo Ibañez Colomo (Le Concurrentialiste)
Emerging regimes for the regulation of digital markets share a common philosophy. They are grounded on the belief that, if authorities enjoyed more discretion and, in the same vein, if the constraints to which they are subject were reduced, they would be in a position to intervene fast, and adopt the sort of far-reaching remedies which, the argument goes, digital markets demand. In this sense, the new instruments represent, first and foremost, a departure from the limits of competition law systems. Establishing the anticompetitive object or effect of a practice and ensuring that the theories underpinning intervention reflect mainstream views are seen, from this perspective, as a burden that may dangerously delay much-needed action.
There are reasons to question whether this philosophy will deliver on its promises. Granting discretion to an authority to fine-tune digital markets whenever it deems it necessary does not address the fundamental challenges raised by the measures proposed. The phenomenal difficulty that comes with the latter does not relate to the lack of discretion, but to the very nature of the intervention expected from authorities. Redesigning products (as in Google Shopping), altering business models (as in Android) and re-allocating rents across the supply chain (is a 30% commission too much or just about appropriate?) are complex tasks, prone to errors, which are not made any easier by doing away with the need to show the anticompetitive object and/or effect of a practice (or the need to weigh such effects against any pro-competitive gains). The lengthy aftermath of the Google saga, and the aura of limbo and uncertainty that surrounds the remedies implemented in those cases, provides eloquent evidence in this sense.
This piece, however, makes a different point. It is submitted that granting discretion to an authority to fine-tune digital markets does not necessarily do it any favours. On the contrary. Depending on the design of the regime, discretion may in fact weaken it vis-à-vis stakeholders. One of the most precious powers of an administrative authority (and all of us, really) is the ability to say no. The ability, in other words, to see off pressure from firms and governments and take a decisive stand on a particular issue (or not take a stand at all). Paradoxically, the problem with discretion is that it empowers the authority to reach virtually any decision it desires from a policy-making standpoint. Once this impression is created, it may be difficult for an authority to justify why it favours certain outcomes and why it does not opt for the maximalist (or minimalist) positions allowed under the regime…

Who should pay for the news? The question is at the centre of an increasingly fraught battle between the world’s large technology companies and traditional news publishers, which are demanding compensation for the use of their content. 
Since the internet took off, platforms such as Google and Facebook have become dominant forces in the media landscape as more and more people have turned to them for news. A recent survey found that about half of adult Americans rely on social media “often” or “sometimes” for news. Big Tech’s increasing power has seen platforms rake in the lion’s share of local and classified advertising, helping to undermine the business models of traditional publishers. Newspapers and magazines hosted half of all advertising spending worldwide in 2000. Inside two decades their share of that roughly $530bn market has fallen to less than 10 per cent.

77,"January 27, 2021",Ex Ante Regulation of Digital Platforms?: Cautionary Tales From Telecommunications,"
Whether there should be increased antitrust enforcement, and/or ex ante regulation of heretofore lightly-regulated major high-tech companies has attached considerable academic, policy, and popular attention, both in the United States and internationally. Proposals for more vigorous intervention — by new ex ante regulation and/or stronger ex post antitrust enforcement — resemble measures implemented to accommodate the transition of the U.S. telecommunications from predominantly a regulated landline monopoly providing traditional voice telephone services to one in which such services are also offered as wireless and internet-based offerings. The regulatory and legal battles that accompanied this major technological shift provide important lessons on the efficacy of applying similar mechanisms to promote competition among major high-tech firms and their existing and emerging rivals. Telecommunications experience has shown that in determining whether market power is sufficient to warrant ex ante regulation and developing measures to facilitate efficient competition, major regulatory measures are revisited, sometimes several times, in response to changing market, technological, and even political conditions. Rapidly-changing market conditions and technology can make the factual basis and theories justifying ex ante regulation obsolete before the necessary actions to update the regulatory regime and/or defer to antitrust to deal with competition problems can be implemented.

78,"January 27, 2021",Three Things You Might Not Have Known About The Sprint/T-Mobile Merger Litigation,"
The merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is now complete. After receiving clearance from the DOJ and the FCC, the last significant hurdle it had to clear was the court challenge by a group of states. It was a rare event in which states found themselves pitted against both the merging parties and the federal agencies that had cleared the merger with remedies. A number of issues related to the merger have already been dissected in the public discussion. In this paper, we highlight three significant issues that haven’t received as much attention. These include, the court’s exclusion of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNOs”) as participants in the relevant market, T-Mobile’s estimation of standalone marginal costs and merger efficiencies, and the somewhat odd remedy that required dismantling of a fully operating network and building of a brand new network to replace that dismantled network.

By Nitin Dua & Keith Waehrer1
 
INTRODUCTION
The recently closed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint went through a long legal process in front of antitrust enforcers across the United States. At one point, the merger was simultaneously being investigated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), Department of Justice (“DOJ”), California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”), and numerous state Attorneys General (“AGs”), including AGs of New York, California, and Texas. Even though the FCC and the DOJ approved the merger, a group of 13 stat...

79,"January 27, 2021","Mr. Watson, Come Here. I Want To See You: A Message From the Communications Industries on How To Promote Competition in the Online Platform Space","
The “legacy” communications industries — plain old telephone service, fixed and mobile broadband access, cable and satellite video distribution — afford two useful teachings for a way forward in the Google search engine antitrust case, including a way past the conundrums presented by the complaint filed against Google by the Department of Justice. First, be careful not to throw out the baby of the competition you want with the bathwater of the exclusivity arrangements you do not like. Second, to promote competition, nurture a competitor: find a white knight or two that are not burdened with market power baggage of their own, and give them the resources to compete.

I. INTRODUCTION
The communications industries range from plain old telephone service, through broadband access, whether fixed or mobile, to cable and satellite video distribution. These industries are not exactly passé compared to the online platforms such as the search engine “market” that Google has so admirably revolutionized and may (or may not) dominate today. After all, Google search queries need a pipe to travel from us, the hopeful searchers toiling on our computers, tablets or smartphones, to Google servers. Even more important, the pipe is necessary for the return trip back to us, bringing a cornucopia of audio and video that condenses real and imaginary worlds on one small screen in ways that would have been incredible to time traveler...

80,"January 27, 2021",Rebooting Antitrust and Regulation for Digital Communications,"
This paper analyzes the development of a “tight oligopoly on steroids” in the communications sector. It uses Business Data Service as an example because it represents a new choke point in the sector. The other services in the “tight oligopoly” include wireline and wireless, cable and set top boxes, and broadband. Using antitrust concepts in the Merger Guidelines the paper argues that high levels of concentration are reinforced by geographic separations, technological specialization, and product segmentation to magnify market power. The paper also uses Alfred Kahn’s discussion of the justification for regulation to explain the long and successful dual jurisdiction (antitrust and regulation) used to control the pervasive market power in the sector. The paper concludes by showing how the concepts and recommendations can be applied to the digital platforms (search and social media), in which an even worse “tight oligopoly on steroids” exists.

By Sandra Marco Colino (The Chinese University of Hong Kong)
Is the tide changing for big tech companies? Legal challenges against them appear to be mounting across the world. In October 2020, a subcommittee of the US House of Representatives published a report on competition in digital markets, highlighting some of the worrying practices of GAFA (Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple) and proposing ways to rein in their market power. It was soon followed by a historic lawsuit against Facebook, filed by the Federal Trade Commission. On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Commission unveiled the Digital Services Act package, proposing new rules to ‘create a safer and more open digital space’. The initiative encompasses rules for the digital market, and aims to impose special obligations on large platforms acting as ‘gatekeepers’. The Commission further issued statement of objections against Amazon, suspected of using independent sellers’ non-public data for its own benefit. China is also tightening the grip on its own big tech ecosystem, with regulatory proposals to control market power, an investigation into Alibaba’s monopolistic practices, and fines on Alibaba and others for failing to report their mergers. This article discusses these recent developments, and assesses the road ahead for tech giants.

Many Democrats, as well as some Republicans, want to take on Big Tech with laws and regulations to address issues like market power, data privacy, and disinformation and hate speech, reported The New York Times. Those ambitions have only grown since the events at Capitol Hill, with more members of Congress pointing to the power of the tech companies as the root cause of many problems.
Facebook and Google are fighting federal and state regulators in court over allegations of anticompetitive conduct. Regulators continue to investigate Amazon and Apple over antitrust violations. President Biden and his nominees for attorney general and commerce secretary have also promised to hold tech companies to account for the speech they host and to strengthen policing of competition violations.
We have a major monopoly and competition problem,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “People have just finally had it.”
“I don’t think people were feeling very trusting when you have angry mobs of people fed by the internet going to invade buildings or when you have foreign entities trying to invade our elections,” she added.
Ms. Klobuchar has made her critiques of the industry, and existing antitrust law, well known. Last year, during her failed run for president, she promised to get tough on the biggest tech companies. She is expected to release a book this spring that presents a case against corporate concentration — from the industrial-age trusts to Silicon Valley.

84,"January 20, 2021",The Easterbrook Theorem: An Application to Digital Markets,"


By Joshua D. Wright & Murat C. Mungan (George Mason University)
The rise of large firms in the digital economy, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, has rekindled the debate about monopolization law. There are proposals to make finding liability easier against alleged digital monopolists by relaxing substantive standards; to flip burdens of proof; and to overturn broad swaths of existing Supreme Court precedent, and even to condemn a law review article. Frank Easterbrook’s seminal 1984 article, The Limits of Antitrust, theorizes that Type I error costs are greater than Type II error costs in the antitrust context, a proposition that has been woven deeply into antitrust law by the Supreme Court. We consider the implications of this assumption on the standard of proof. We find that, taking variants of the Easterbrook assumption as given, the optimal standard of proof is stronger than the preponderance of the evidence standard. Our conclusion is robust to how one specifies the preponderance of the evidence standard and stands in stark contrast to contemporary proposals to reduce or eliminate the burden of proof facing antitrust plaintiffs in digital markets.

85,"January 20, 2021",The ACCC’s Continued Digital Inquiry: Online Private Messaging and App Stores,"
By Felicity McMahon & William Georgiou (Allens)1
 
I. Introduction
Concern from consumers, businesses, governments and antitrust regulators about the growing power of digital platforms, their increasing ubiquity in all facets of public and private life, and their impact on competition and data privacy continues to grow globally.
The circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for businesses to operate digitally and serve their customers through digital means.2 As businesses “pivoted” to operating and serving customers in a digital way, the importance of the architecture of our digital economy became acutely apparent. A future in which all businesses are “digital” necessitates reflecting on how digital platforms shape our markets and society, and what regulatory and policy responses might be required to deal with the challenges created by the increasing role that digital platforms play in our supply chains, as well as our daily lives, both business and personal.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) continues its examination of developments in digital platforms issues through its ongoing Digital Platforms Services Inquiry 2020-2025 (DPSI).3 The DPSI follows the ACCC’s original Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (DPI Final Report), released in July 2019.4
The Australian Government’s direction to conduct the DPSI provides the ACCC with an extensive remit to examine, among other things, the impact on competition and consumers of internet search engine services, social media services, online private messaging services, digital content aggregation platform services, media referral services, and electronic marketplace services.5
This article summarizes the key findings and implications of the ACCC’s first DPSI interim report covering “online private messaging services” (Messaging Report).6 It also considers the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its next DPSI interim report covering app stores (App Store Report),7 relevant international antitrust cases and the public submissions received in response to the App Store Report’s issues paper.
  
II. The DPSI Messaging Report (October 23, 2020)8
The focus of the ACCC’s Messaging Report was on competition and consumer (including privacy) issues associated with online private messaging services. The Messaging Report also updated the findings reached by the ACCC in its original DPI Final Report in relation to social media and search services.
The impetus for the ACCC’s focus on messaging services in this report no doubt relates to the COVID-19-related uptake of these services, with the ACCC remarking upon releasing its Messaging Report that it “shows how the use of online private messaging services has grown significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as workplaces and schools moved to remote access and people sought alternatives to face-to-face communication.”9
The ACCC’s findings included:

Online private messaging services: Facebook (through its Messenger and WhatsApp services) and Apple (through its iMessage and FaceTime services) are among the largest suppliers of standalone online messaging services in Australia. The ACCC found that Facebook’s large user base gives Facebook a significant competitive advantage and a degree of freedom from competitive restraint when compared with Apple and smaller suppliers of standalone messaging services.
Key data and privacy concerns: The ACCC reported that data collection, use, and disclosure practices by messaging services raised concerns. The ACCC recognized that broad disclosures about these practices (e.g. via privacy policies or T&Cs) were unclear and did not provide sufficient information to enable consumers to understand what data was collected about them and how data would be used/sold to third parties (and who these third parties were).10 While the ACCC is not Australia’s privacy regulator, it is taking enforcement action for data and privacy-related issues through Australia’s consumer protection laws in circumstances where it considers there have been misleading data collection and use disclosures made to consumers.11 The ACCC has also shown a willingness to address data and privacy-related issues in its assessment of competition matters, most recently in its ongoing assessment of Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit.12
Market power in advertising, search, and social media services: The ACCC considered that an increasing number of consumers were choosing search platforms on the basis of privacy protections (e.g. DuckDuckGo). However, despite some shifts in consumer behavior and some instances of new entry and expansion, consumers continue to spend a large proportion of their time on Google and Facebook services. Google is by far the largest search services provider with over 95 percent of supply of search services in Australia, and Facebook/Instagram are the most used social media platforms. The ACCC observed that Google’s and Facebook’s dominance also translates to an increasing share of online advertising expenditure, and it explicitly noted that Google and Facebook both continue to have substantial market power in search (Google), social media (Facebook) and online advertising services (both Google and Facebook).13
Potential consumer harms across these services: The ACCC considered that increased tracking and profiling of consumers by platforms and third parties (including data from private messaging services, mobile apps, websites, video games, etc.) has a range of potential and actual harms. These harms ranged from decreased consumer welfare and privacy to increased discrimination and exclusion.

The ACCC considered that consumers’ online activity is extensively tracked by Google and Facebook. This includes tracking via Google and Facebook software development kits installed in third party apps, and consumer data collection via voice assistants and other new technologies (e.g. Google Assistant). This data is often sensitive and includes, for example, location information, audio recordings, and personal health data. The ACCC outlined concerns that consumers have a limited understanding of the consents they give to allow their data to be used and aggregated and their online activity to be tracked. As discussed above, similar competition concerns regarding the aggregation and potential use of data (in this case, health data) have arisen in the ACCC’s ongoing review of Google’s potential acquisition of Fitbit.

Potential small business harms across these services: Small businesses are increasingly reliant on the advertising services provided by platforms like Facebook and Google. The impact of sponsored posts and advertising searches impacts the ability of businesses to organically reach customers. Small businesses that rely on digital platforms to reach customers often have to accept disadvantageous default terms, including broad discretions to suspend/terminate accounts or to remove content, and terms that seek to limit a small business’ ability to dispute these issues.

The report characterized both Google and Facebook as having a substantial degree of market power in relevant advertising markets, acting as “gatekeepers” controlling access to digital advertising services which small businesses require.14 In relation to alleged concentrations of market power such as this, the ACCC has raised concerns with the ability for it to intervene in markets using Australia’s competition laws. For example, ACCC Chair Rod Sims recently recognized “you cannot rely on competition laws alone to stop or deal with all the adverse consequences from a growth in market power.”15 In order to fill this perceived gap, the ACCC continues to advocate for changes to Australia’s consumer protection laws. This includes reforms to Australia’s unfair contract terms regime to make such terms illegal and give courts powers to impose penalties for their use,16 and for the addition of a broad ‘unfair trading practices’ prohibition (e.g. on business models that are arguably oppressive or exploitative).17

Emerging trends including platforms expanding their ecosystems: The ACCC noted that large platforms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon continue to expand their ecosystems by acquiring businesses and developing new products and services. While this is obviously not inherently illegal and can (in certain cases) result in efficiencies, innovation, and increased competition, the ACCC recognized that “[w]here a platform occupies a strong gateway position and acquires a business in a related market, the platform may have the ability and incentive to harm downstream rivals through high fees or restricted access.”18 Like the UK Competition and Markets Authority,19 the ACCC expressed concerns that expansion into adjacent markets by these platforms entrenches their incumbency and provides them with further opportunities to gather consumers’ data.

The Messaging Report’s findings also generally reiterated the consumer protection and privacy law recommendations that the ACCC previously made in its DPI Final Report.
  
III. The forthcoming DPSI App Store Report (due March 31, 2021)20
A. The Issues Paper
To inform the ACCC’s App Store Report, the ACCC released an Issues Paper seeking feedback from interested stakeholders to understand the extent of any competition and consumer issues with respect to app store markets (Issues Paper).
The ACCC’s focus for this report is on “mobile apps” and their related app stores (i.e. not app stores generally, such as on gaming consoles or personal computers). The ACCC defined ‘mobile apps’ as software applications that are downloaded onto, and run on, a mobile operating system such as on a smartphone, tablet, smartwatch or smart car.21
At the outset, the ACCC recognized that the two major app stores were the Apple App Store (for Apple mobile devices running Apple’s “iOS” operating system) and the Google Play Store (for mobile devices running Google’s “Android” operating system).
The ACCC stated that “[w]hile there are various app stores or marketplaces, app sales are dominated by the Apple App Store, for iOS, and the Google Play Store, for Android devices.”22 It referred to estimates that in 2019, consumers spent around $54 billion USD on the Apple App Store and around $29 billion USD on the Google Play Store.23 The ACCC also noted that 99 percent of smartphones globally use either the Apple iOS or Google Android operating systems.24
Some of the key issues the ACCC sought to understand in its Issues Paper included:25
how Apple’s and Google’s various roles as the key suppliers of app stores (but also simultaneously as app developers, operators, and licensors of their mobile operating systems and device manufacturers) affects the ability of third-party app developers to compete, including the impact of app store fee structures on rivals’ costs;
terms, conditions, and fees (including “in-app purchases” (IAP)) imposed on businesses to place apps on app stores. In particular, app developers offering “digital goods and services” are required to use Apple’s or Google’s proprietary IAP systems. These developers are also charged a 30 percent commission by Apple/Google for each transaction through the IAP system;
how app stores determine whether an app is allowed on their app store, and the effect of this on app providers, developers, and consumers; and
how the app search, display and ranking system works on an app store and whether being “featured” on an app store is important to an app’s success.
The ACCC’s Issues Paper also sought to understand substitutability and potential market definitions with regard to app stores. For example, question three asked about the extent to which app developers could bypass the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to distribute apps; question five asked about the extent to which app developers list apps on different marketplaces; and question eight asked about the extent to which web-versions of mobile apps are substitutes for their mobile version counterparts.
Consistent with the Messaging Report and DPI Final Report, the ACCC also highlighted in the Issues Paper that it sought views on the collection and use of consumer data by app store providers (e.g. Google and Apple) and app developers, as well as whether consumers are provided with adequate disclosures about these practices and can control the data that is collected about them.
B. The International Context
The key issues canvassed in the ACCC’s Issues Paper closely follow those aired in a variety of private litigation cases, regulatory investigations and inquiries.
For example, Epic Games is litigating against Apple and Google in the U.S. after its video game app, Fortnite, was removed from both the App Store by Apple and Play Store by Google. This was, alleges Epic Games, in response to Epic Games allowing Fortnite users the option to use Epic Games’ own IAP system on Apple and Android devices.26 There are also a number of class actions on foot against both Apple and Google regarding the IAP and 30 percent commission requirements.27 Epic Games recently instituted proceedings against Apple in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging that Apple misused its market power by restricting developers from creating rival app stores on iOS and by requiring that developers use Apple’s own proprietary IAP system.28
The European Commission is also investigating complaints against Apple from a number of complainants, including Spotify, an e-book distributor, and an audiobook distributor. These complaints allege that the 30 percent commission distorts competition.29
The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) published a report into mobile app stores, outlining developer concerns that a 30 percent IAP commission is excessive, particularly when fees of 2-3 percent can be found in alternative financial services.30 The U.S. House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust also examined these issues, among a variety of others, in its investigation into competition in digital markets (the House released its report on October 7, 2020).31
C. The Submissions in Response
The ACCC received a number of submissions in response to the Issues Paper. The table below briefly summarizes key points from some of these submissions:32



Apple submission
Apple considered it brought innovation and competition to apps through the App Store. Apple outlined that its focus is on device sales such that it has an incentive to promote a rich app ecosystem. Apple’s submission generally referred to privacy and data security as central to its various practices, including its app store review process, and restrictions which do not allow rival iOS app stores to compete with the App Store.Apple defined an app store market broadly, arguing that all app stores compete with Apple’s App Store, including app stores managed by Android device manufacturers (called “OEMs”) (e.g. Google, Samsung, Oppo, Huawei, etc.), those on desktop computers, notebooks, televisions, cars, game consoles, etc. Apple also argued its App Store competes with web-apps and websites.
Apple argued that its proprietary IAP system was necessary because it provided a safe purchasing mechanism for consumers and enabled Apple to record sales and collect commissions from developers to fund Apple’s investment in, and maintenance of, the App Store (including developing technology that developers take advantage of, such as development tools). Apple also argued its 30 percent commission, collected through the use of its IAP system, was consistent with industry standards. Apple also noted that developers whose business model depended entirely on advertising and those who sold physical goods and services paid no commission.


Google submission
Similarly to Apple, Google argued that it delivered innovation and competition with the creation of Android and the Play Store.Google noted that Android was an open platform which allowed OEMs and others to create their own app stores which compete with the Play Store.
Google did not appear to consider the relevant market to be as broad as Apple did. Instead, Google suggested the Play Store competed with other mobile app stores, including other Android app stores, Apple’s App Store, and websites and web-apps.
Google justified its 30 percent fee for IAP transactions on the basis that it enabled Google to maintain its investments in the Play Store and the Android ecosystem more broadly. It argued that Google’s IAP system was a safe and secure payment system.


App developer submissions
Submissions included those from Microsoft, dating app provider Match Group, property advertising services provider REA Group and various television and radio broadcasting app developers (and their developer associations).Developers expressed concern with mandatory requirements by Apple and Google to use their respective IAP systems. They considered that the 30 percent commission raises developers’ costs, with REA Group noting it was a significant disincentive to improving its paid app services.
Submissions noted that there was confusion as to when an app would be required to use Apple’s or Google’s IAP systems, arguing there is no clear distinction between apps that provide “digital goods and services” (which must use a proprietary IAP according to Apple and Google) and those offering “physical goods and services” (which do not use a proprietary IAP). Developers disputed the justifications put forward by Apple and Google in this regard.
Submissions also indicated that there were no technical reasons for mandating the use of these proprietary IAP systems for certain transactions over others. Submissions referred to Apple’s decision to allow Amazon to use its own IAP system to deliver digital content as an example of an inconsistency which undermines arguments in favor of such mandatory requirements.
Submissions noted that the app review process for the approval of apps or new content (in updated apps) was opaque and led to inefficiencies and uncertainties for developers. It was suggested that the requirement to use an IAP system and pay a 30 percent commission favored a data-monetization business. Concerns were also raised with the transparency of the app search, display and ranking processes, the app review process and the collection of transaction data by IAP systems that can be used by Apple/Google later to target that particular app segment.


Association submissions
Submissions included those from the Australian Investment Council (AIC), Australian Business Software Industry Association and the Developers Alliance.The Developers Alliance, whose membership includes Google and Facebook, argued that app ecosystems currently work well but a market-driven code of conduct, with dispute resolution and transparency enhancing mechanisms, could be an option to address concerns relating to the lack of transparency in the market (e.g. regarding app rankings or the strategic targeting of app segments by app store operators).
Other associations, such as the AIC, argued that the mandatory IAP and 30 percent commission requirements raise barriers to entry and impact developers’ ability to generate returns and reinvest in their businesses. The lack of transparency with respect to the app review process and the ability for app store operators to self-preference, including in their display rankings, was a feature of these submissions.



It remains to be seen what the ACCC’s response will be to the views canvassed in response to its Issues Paper and concerns raised by the numerous app store-related disputes and inquiries. When the ACCC produces a report following an inquiry, it will usually result in a range of legal recommendations and reforms, as well as some enforcement action (as resulted from the Digital Platforms Inquiry33). The ACCC made a range of recommendations in the DPI Final Report which, among other things, led the Australian Government to request the ACCC develop a mandatory bargaining code for negotiations between Australian news media content producers and Facebook and Google. Legislation for this media bargaining code of conduct has recently been introduced to the Australian Parliament.34
The ACCC could also use the concerns expressed by developers to bolster its advocacy efforts in favor of the introduction of a general “unfair practices” prohibition.35

EU’s Vestager has warned that Big Tech companies will face a flurry of countries passing laws to curb their power if they do not support the EU’s approach to regulation, reported The Financial Times.
Ms Vestager, who is both the EU’s competition chief and its head of digital policy, said it was in the interests of the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon to work with Brussels if they want to avoid “a completely fragmented European legal system.”
The EU has recently put forward proposals for new legislation that will span the bloc — the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act — designed to create a fairer playing field and make online platforms more responsible for the content posted on them.
But EU officials are also concerned that some member States are taking unilateral action because of political pressure to rein in the tech giants. “We are worried that countries are rushing to legislation and will seek to delay the negotiations so they can establish the rules of the game ahead of the commission,” said one person involved in the process.

87,"January 19, 2021",GDPR On The Rise As EU Officials Crack Down,"


Fines levied under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) jumped almost 40% in the past 12 months as EU regulators stepped up enforcement efforts, Financial Times reported on Tuesday, January 19.
Since starting in 2018, GDPR regulators imposed €272 million (US$330.3 million) in fines, with €159 million (US$193.1 million) in penalties levied just in the past dozen months, DLA Piper research showed, per FT. More than 50% of those penalties were levied by Italy and Germany.
“Regulators have been testing the limits of their powers this year, issuing fines for a wide variety of infringements of Europe’s tough data protection laws,” Ewa Kurowska-Tober, global co-chair of DLA Piper’s Data Protection & Security Group, told FT.
The biggest fine so far — €50 million (US$60.7 million) — was levied against Google in 2019 by CNIL, the French data protection authority. The watchdog stated that the search giant wasn’t transparent about how it collects data and doesn’t have a legal reason for personalizing advertisements.
“It is positive to see that the number and size of the fines imposed under the GDPR continue to grow,” Estelle Massé, senior policy analyst at Access Now, told FT.
“Moving forward, DPAs should not only look at fines but also use all other punitive sanctions available under the GDPR, such as the possibility to suspend data transfers or to request data acquired unlawfully to be deleted,” she said.
Industry verticals retail, hospitality, telecom, and oil have been hit with the most GDPR penalties. Germany and the Netherlands reported the most data breaches, with 121,165 notifications, up almost 20% compared to the same period in 2019.
“[Regulators] certainly haven’t had things all their own way, with some notable successful appeals and large reductions in proposed fines,” Kurowska-Tober told FT.
Ross McKean, chair of DLA Piper’s UK Data Protection & Security Group, told FT that due to the pandemic, regulators have lowered fines if a company was experiencing financial hardship.
A GDPR report issued in June by the European Commission indicated that although GDPR is considered a success, there is still more work to be done, especially concerning small and mid-sized businesses. The report also showed that there is still a degree of fragmentation since member countries have different implementation and enforcement rules.

88,"January 18, 2021",Antitrust Remedies for Big Tech,"


By Herbert Hovenkamp, The Regulatory Review
The U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and several states attorneys general have brought major antitrust cases against Facebook and Google. The complaints allege several anticompetitive agreements, and a judicial finding of liability against the tech companies is a realistic possibility.
Yet too often the government has proven antitrust violations against large firms only to have the case fall apart at the remedy stage. The antitrust laws themselves are not very helpful: They empower the government to “prevent and restrain” antitrust violations but say nothing about how to do that.
We cannot identify proper antitrust remedies without some clarity about antitrust policy’s goals. The antitrust laws speak in unmistakably economic terms about “monopoly,” “restraint of trade,” and “competition.” The laws cannot be interpreted as limitations on political power, large size, or some common law or criminal offense, such as theft, invasion of privacy, or fraud, unless those bad acts serve to injure competition. Other statutes exist for pursuing those harms, and they are important components of legal policy.
If we wanted antitrust laws to police these practices, however, antitrust laws would have to be amended. But antitrust should not be some general fix for issues that the U.S. Congress has not seen fit to address more directly.
Under antitrust’s consumer welfare principle, the goal of antitrust law is competitive markets, which produce the highest output of goods and services consistent with sustainable competition. High economic output delivers low prices to consumers. It will also protect labor and other suppliers, who almost always benefit when markets produce more goods and services.
More competitive markets, however, does not necessarily mean the absence of large firms. This is particularly true if economies of scale make production by large firms cheaper, or if network effects make a firm more valuable as the number of users increases. The goal of an antitrust remedy should be driven by this same rule—to make markets more competitive. Courts have the power to break firms into little pieces or even to dissolve them. The hard part is for courts to fix the problem in a way that is consistent with maximum competitive output.

90,"January 18, 2021","The Pandemic, Edtech, and the Tricky Subject of Service Providers and Processors","
The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Protection Act seem like ideal legislation to address privacy concerns that have arisen as a result of the increased use of education technology during the global coronavirus pandemic. Those laws’ application to edtech, however, requires untangling. This paper examines how both laws’ geographic reach, substantive scope, and treatment of principals and agents in the data lifecycle apply to edtech vendors. Because the two laws have similar approaches that differ in critical respects, edtech vendors must be cognizant of how the laws address their status as contractors with non-profit or public schools and when they are processing data on behalf of their school partners – and when they are processing it for their own purposes.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the use of technology in education has seen a rapid transformation. Schools implemented remote learning in response to the pandemic and, instead of learning in classrooms, children began learning online, a trend that has extended well into the new school year. With the movement of children’s learning and data online, privacy concerns began to multiply. Advocates called attention to data use and security vulnerabilities in education technology (“edtech”) platforms. That concern was shared by the California Attorney General’s Office, which was responsible for the ne...

Two former Obama administration officials have emerged as front-runners for the top antitrust job at the US Department of Justice under the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, reported Reuters.
One of the picks is Renata Hesse, who has had several stints at the Justice Department since 2002 and most recently served as the Acting Assistant Attorney General from mid-2016 to January 2017. She also has held private sector roles and advised on matters involving companies such as Amazon and Alphabet’s Google.
More notably, Hesse advised Amazon on its more than US$13 billion acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, according to her bio on the website of New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, where she is currently a partner.
The other front-runner is Juan Arteaga, who has also worked for the Justice Department under President Barack Obama between 2013 to 2017 and served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Enforcement, according to the sources, who did not wish to be named.
Arteaga also has held private sector roles and advised companies such as JP Morgan Chase & Co and AT&T.

92,"January 17, 2021",Platform Mergers and Antitrust,"


By Geoffrey Parker (Dartmouth College), Georgios Petropoulos (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) & Marshall W. Van Alstyne (Boston University)
Platform ecosystems rely on economies of scale, data-driven economies of scope, high quality algorithmic systems, and strong network effects that typically promote winner-take-most markets. Some platform firms have grown rapidly and their merger and acquisition strategies have been very important factors in their growth. Big platforms’ market dominance has generated competition concerns that are difficult to assess with current merger policy tools. In this paper, we examine the acquisition strategies of the five major US firms—Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft—since their inception. We discuss the main merger and acquisition theories of harm that can restrict market competition and reduce consumer welfare. To address competition concerns of acquisitions in big platform ecosystems we develop a four step proposal that incorporates (1) a new ex-ante regulatory framework, (2) an update of the conditions under which the notification of mergers should be compulsory and the burden of proof should be reversed, (3) differential regulatory priorities in investigating horizontal versus vertical M&A, and (4) an update of competition enforcement tools to increase visibility into market data and trends.

Makan Delrahim, the chief of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, is departing on January 19, the day before Joe Biden’s inauguration.
Delrahim submitted his resignation to Donald Trump on Wednesday, January 13, in a letter in which he outlined the accomplishments of the Division during his tenure. He cited an effort to review the Division’s 1,200 consent decrees, which led to the termination of 850 of them, including the Paramount consent decrees. He also cited the launch of a major antitrust lawsuit against Google and an investigation of major tech platforms. 
“During my tenure as Assistant Attorney General, the Division successfully enforced the competition laws and implemented transformative policy and organizational initiatives that will bear fruit for both American consumers and entrepreneurs for years to come,” Delrahim wrote in the letter.
During his tenure, Delrahim also launched a review of the consent decrees that govern music licensing, and held a public workshop on the issue.
Before he was confirmed as chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim was in the White House counsel’s office, working on the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Before joining the administration, he was in private practice in Los Angeles at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.
Biden, who has nominated Merrick Garland as the next US Attorney General, has yet to announce a nominee to lead the Antitrust Division.

The Department of Justice’s Makan Delrahim said Wednesday, January 13, that the Biden administration will continue the federal government’s antitrust investigations into US tech companies once it comes to power in January.
The Trump administration’s outgoing competition chief, told Bloomberg he expects that a group of staff attorneys in President-elect Joe Biden’s Justice Department will be in charge of carrying on the inquiries into companies such as Google.
Delrahim, who will finish his job on January 19, said scrutinizing tech companies by enforcers is crucial for protecting competition in digital markets.
“In markets where you have network effects which lead to a winner-take-all, you want to ensure there is continued competition, continued innovation,” he said. The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and Congress “are right on the money in taking a close look.”

Competition regulator Rod Sims has foreshadowed possible further legal cases against tech groups as a result of inquiries into mobile phone app stores and how ads are sold online, reported The Guardian.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which Sims chairs, has been investigating so-called “ad tech,” where search engine Google is a major player, and the stores both Google and competitor Apple use to sell mobile phone apps, as part of its broader agenda to examine the power of tech companies.
Sims handed a report detailing the findings of his inquiry into ad tech to the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on December 31, and the government is expected to release it before the end of the month.
Sims was asked about the potential consequences of the two inquiries during an interview broadcast online by Reuters on Tuesday, January 12.
“There may be some competition law cases or consumer law cases that may follow our work,” he said.
“But essentially I think the real value add will be just painting a picture of how these things work and what likely harms are.”

Australia’s competition regulator has warned that planned laws to make the country the first in the world to force Google and Facebook to pay for news content were likely just the start of more regulation for digital platforms, reported Reuters.
The Australian government announced legislation last month after an investigation it said showed the tech giants held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy.
Under the code, Google and Facebook will be subject to mandatory price arbitration if a commercial agreement on payment for Australian media cannot be reached.
“This bargaining code is a journey, if we see market power elsewhere, we can add them to the code,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said in an interview for Reuters Next.
Digital platforms face fines of up to A$10 million ($7.7 million) if they do not comply with the decision.

The American Economic Liberties Project, an influential Washington-based anti-monopoly group, issued a report with guidance for antitrust enforcers in the next administration. The group is led by Sarah Miller, who is working with President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team and has been instrumental in making antitrust enforcement against Big Tech a mainstream issue.
The report’s recommendations offer a glimpse into the thinking that could influence future policymaking under the Biden administration.
The group urged that the US Justice Department make clear it will continue antitrust action against Google by expanding the scope of litigation beyond search to maps, travel and its app store.
The Justice Department sued Google on Oct. 20, accusing the $1 trillion company of dominating search and advertising. In December, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Facebook saying the company used a “buy or bury” strategy to hurt rivals.
The report calls on the Biden administration to appoint aggressive Justice Department and FTC antitrust enforcers and urges Biden’s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, to “publicly commit to seeking a Google breakup.”

Dear Readers,
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee’s Report on Digital Markets represents a landmark in the latest round of efforts to subject the “big tech” companies to antitrust scrutiny.
The Report, clocking in at over 400 pages, and published after a thorough set of hearings, sets out detailed concerns primarily with respect to the conduct of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, all of whom are alleged to operate dominant “platform” businesses. Significantly, the report was also issued in the context of various investigations by Federal, state, and international agencies into these companies’ conduct. Its political salience can therefore scarcely be underestimated.
On a technical level, the stated aim of the Report is to examine whether such dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct, and whether existing antitrust laws are adequate to address any such issues. The pieces in this Chronicle set out to evaluate the Report in light of these stated aims, and to assess its likely outcomes. As these pieces make clear, the jury is still out on the Report’s content and its likely implementation.
What appears clear, however, as the timely articles in this Chronicle illustrate, is that there are winds of change in the air. Regardless of how the conclusions in the Report are implemented, the climate has become frostier for the large platform operators, and there will inevitably be practical changes in how such companies adapt their conduct to the...

99,"January 12, 2021","Antitrust 2020 and the House Monopoly Report: How Do You Fix This Hot, Colossal Mess, and Who’s Going to Do It?","
The House Judiciary Committee’s report on big-tech monopoly is in a lot of ways very welcome, and it accomplishes important work. It was a large feat of fact-finding and conceptual foundation-work, and it evidently helped launch or support the pending federal monopolization suits against Google and Facebook. But it also invites the same discouraged fatigue that are the daily bread of anyone who cares about American antitrust. It’s still hard to imagine meaningful correction to the law’s catastrophic misdirection, in a divided America governed by broken institutions.

The House Democrats’ big-tech monopoly report2 was several things. Measured by length and detail, the Report was above all a fact-finding exercise. Its vast majority — upwards of four hundred pages and more than 2,400 footnotes — consists of very long, meticulous analyses of the conduct of four particular firms. It reads more or less like a complaint in litigation, and indeed, the pending government lawsuits against Google3 and Facebook4 both track it closely. In some respects, the fact-finding work is loose and lacks rigor, for what that may be worth. For my money that includes its routine, unelaborated conclusions that particular firms have market power in particular areas, and its essentially undefended claim that “Amazon has adopted a predatory-pricing strategy across multiple business lines at various stages in the company’s history.”5 But put that aside, beca...

100,"January 12, 2021",The Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets: Looking in the Wrong Forest?,"
The majority staff of the House Judiciary Committee recently released its Report and Recommendations (“MSRR”) following an investigation of competition in digital markets.  It claims that the leading digital technology firms (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook) have acquired and maintained monopoly power by exclusionary conduct, and blames this on alleged narrow vision and weak enforcement efforts of the U.S. antitrust agencies and courts.  The MSRR proposes a near-total revision of U.S. antitrust, restoring the enforcement approaches of fifty years ago when per se rules and structural presumptions were predominant.  Considering that the U.S. is the unquestioned leader in digital technology, and that the EU has far fewer leading digital technology firms but does have antitrust rules very much like those proposed by the MSRR, it seems that both the MSRR’s view of the evidence and the logic of its proposals are questionable.

By Abbott Lipsky, Jr.1
  
U.S. antitrust law has gone through a long evolutionary process of refinement in light of changing business practices and improving understandings of how the economy functions and how it responds to the law-enforcement systems applied to competitive conduct. The Sherman Act contains two very brief and general prohibitions – on “restraint of trade” and “monopolization” – which require interpretation by courts faced with particular forms of business conduct challenged in specific cases...

A lively debate about the effectiveness of current antitrust laws and enforcement capabilities has erupted in the U.S., focused in particular on the competitiveness of what has been labelled “digital markets.” This article focuses on two of the most recent contributions to that debate, the fruits of hearings held by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, which propose potentially significant reforms.  The two reports join an ongoing and global discussion of the institutional and doctrinal adequacy of competition law to adapt to new technology-driven business models and the information economy.  This article summarizes the legislative recommendations of the two reports, evaluates areas of agreement and disagreement among the two reports, considers public reaction to the recommendations, and evaluates the likelihood of the legislative proposals becoming law.

102,"January 12, 2021",Understanding the House Judiciary Committee Majority Staff Antitrust Report,"
The U.S. antitrust system is undergoing a profound reassessment.  Many events and commentaries have inspired this upheaval.  Among the most important is an inquiry conducted over the past two years by the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. The Report nominally addresses “competition in digital markets,” but its policy agenda is much broader. The Majority Staff proposes to fundamentally redesign basic elements of the entire U.S. antitrust system, not only concepts involving big tech. The Majority Staff urges Congress to repudiate, in whole or in part, fifteen court decisions. The broader implications of these proposals have received little attention. In this essay, we pose questions about the Report’s larger implications in three areas: (1) the restatement of antitrust system objectives; (2) doctrinal changes involving antitrust procedure; (3) doctrinal changes involving antitrust law’s substantive commands. Overall, we worry that the Report, in its abbreviated discussion of doctrinal reforms, has not come to grips with the administrability implications of overriding certain precedents and replacing them with new decision-making principles.

103,"January 12, 2021",Competition — And Competition Policy — In Digital Markets: The House Report,"
The House Antitrust Subcommittee Report makes clear the weakness not just of competition in the tech sector, but also of competition policy toward the tech sector.  We argue that this is the result of the failure to employ one important tool of antitrust, namely, structural separation.  Economics and experience teach that breaking up such firms is almost surely necessary in order to make the companies focus on serving customers better rather than on handicapping their rivals.  We review the evidence, discuss the alternatives, and provide guidance for how structural separation can be employed in bringing competition to the tech sector.

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The House Antitrust Subcommittee has concluded its milestone study of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google with a lengthy report entitled “Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets.” Despite that title, the report is in fact not so much about the weakness of competition in digital markets as it is a report on the weakness of competition policy toward digital markets. After all, the bulk of the report documents the unimpeded rise to dominance of these giants over online search, ecommerce, social media, and advertising, and how this dominance has “diminished consumer choice, eroded innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy, weakened the vibrancy of the free and diverse press, and undermined Americans’ privacy.” Since these object...

As antitrust issues in the tech industry have become an increasing topic of discussion — and litigation — a more fundamental question has also become central: is current antitrust law sufficient to adequately preserve competition in the digital sector?  The Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee believes not.  In a lengthy report summarizing the committee’s extensive investigation into the effects of market power online, committee leaders provide an ambitious legislative plan intended to increase competition in the digital markets.  The majority’s proposals are likely to be subject to vigorous debate in Congress during the next term, with lawmakers deciding whether the current antitrust laws have proved insufficient to foster robust competition in this increasingly important sector of the U.S. economy.  This article looks at the ambitious proposals in the House Report and the likelihood of bipartisan consensus regarding the appropriate level of oversight of digital markets.

The House Report assembles a large amount of information about competition in digital markets and will be a valuable resource for those who want to understand the leading digital platforms.  It falls far short, however, of its stated objectives of examining “whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct” and whether existing antitrust laws “are adequate to address those issues.”  As to the former, it does not say what it means by anticompetitive conduct, often fails to examine possible exculpatory explanations of the conduct and documents it discusses, and does not address issues of efficiency and economic welfare that are central to antitrust analysis.  As to the latter, it does not discuss whether antitrust law is or might become adequate to address the issues it describes or the costs of the policy changes it recommends.

Highlights from the OECD Roundtable on the Role of Competition Policy in Promoting Economic Recovery – by Caroline P. Boisvert (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)*
Click here for a PDF version of the article
On December 2, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) competition committee held a roundtable on the role of competition policy in promoting economic recovery, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. While the roundtable was a closed-door, off-the-record event, the country submissions and speaker presentations are publicly available on the OECD’s website.1 Below are highlights from submissions by various countries and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC at OECD).
 
Background – Competition Authorities’ Role in Economic Recovery
After a year of government measures in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the roundtable focused on how “competition policy and competition authorities [can] contribute to a faster and more sustained economic recovery.”2 As articulated by the secretariat’s background note, competition authorities’ “expertise in how markets function and the key role of competition in ensuring conditions for economic growth and recovery make them privileged stakeholders in a wider policy context.”3
Perhaps reflecting COVID-19’s disparate health and economic impact across countries, participants’ submissions reveal that they undertook a wide range of initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis. As but a few examples, participating countries and their competition authorities have: advocated for the prioritized development of ultra-broadband telecommunications infrastructure,4 advocated for state intervention in the aviation sector to mitigate its significant financial losses,5 and provided technical guidance to local policymakers on assessing the impact of their competition decisions.6 This article focuses on three types of initiatives undertaken by multiple participants: (1) issuance of guidance for recovery-related collaborations, (2) increased vigilance around exploitative pricing and related unlawful conduct, and (3) analysis of whether existing merger standards ought to be relaxed in times of economic crisis.
 
Recovery-Related Collaborations
Seeking to ensure the continued provision of essential goods and services and encourage innovation in response to the COVID-19 crisis, several competition authorities have issued guidance on recovery-related collaborations between competitors. The secretariat’s background note identifies that permissible collaborations generally have three common key criteria: “i) the necessity and indispensability of . . . address[ing] a specific market disruption due to the Covid-19 crisis; ii) a positive impact of the co-operation on consumers; and iii) a strict time limit.”7  
The U.S. submission focuses on the March 2020 joint statement from the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which committed to account for exigent circumstances and provide expedited antitrust guidance for collaborations related to COVID-19.8 Since March 2020, the DOJ has approved four COVID-related collaborations through their expedited business review process — three related to the manufacture and distribution of personal protective equipment and/or medication, and a fourth related to the production of pork.9 Of particular note, the DOJ permitted various pharmaceutical companies to “exchange limited information about the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies that may be developed to treat COVID-19” in order to expedite innovation in vaccine production.10
Italy’s competition authority issued a similar statement in April 2020, announcing that it “d[id] not intend to oppose any necessary, temporary and proportionate measures taken to avoid shortages of supply.”11 Since then, Italy’s competition authority has provided guidance in two instances. First, it declined to oppose a cooperative agreement between two pharmaceutical distributors for the joint purchasing and distribution to pharmacies of disposable surgical masks.12 Second, it declined to investigate a common scheme among financial providers of consumer loans to defer customers’ main loan terms for a limited time period.13 In both instances, the authority concluded that the “exceptional health emergency” permitted such collaborations for a limited duration.
The European Commission similarly adopted a temporary framework for addressing antitrust issues in projects aimed at addressing the shortage of essential products and services during the COVID-19 crisis.14 The framework contemplates the issuance of “ad hoc written comfort” letters for specific projects. The Commission’s only letter to date favorably assessed a cooperation between pharmaceutical manufacturers to combat the shortage of critical medications for the treatment of COVID-19.15
Declining to interfere with such collaborations illustrates how competition authorities can exercise discretion in their enforcement powers to address the issues arising from an economic shock. But, as the secretariat’s background note cautions, while such collaborations help prevent supply chain disruptions and encourage critical innovation, “[s]ectors where co-operation between competitors arose as a response to the crisis should be made the target of stricter scrutiny as soon as circumstances change.”16
  
Vigilance Around Exploitative Pricing and Related Unlawful Conduct
Participants across the board showed increased sensitivity to exploitative pricing and other unlawful conduct arising from the COVID-19 economic environment. But, as the secretariat’s background note acknowledges, “[d]istinguishing legitimate from illegitimate pricing practices, as well as how best to deal with the latter, has created substantial challenges for competition authorities.”17 As a result, the roundtable submissions reflect various approaches.
In the U.S., the DOJ created a COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force. While the U.S. (unlike, for example, the EU) does not regulate pricing or prohibit exploitative abuses, the Task Force “is charged with developing effective enforcement measures and best practices, and coordinating nationwide investigation and prosecution of illicit activities.”18 Since its creation, the Task Force has aided the investigation of a range of conduct, including the sale of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) at exorbitant prices, fraudulent attempts by individuals to sell PPE they did not possess and had no means to acquire, and foreign countries’ shipment to the U.S. of misbranded and defective PPE.19
By contrast, rather than exercising purely legal authority, Italy’s initial response to crisis-related abusive conduct relied upon “a form of moral suasion.”20 Specifically, Italy’s competition authority requested information on price spikes in the food and health sectors and announced the changes with a press release, which often prompted corrective action. For example, a press release about various laboratories’ prices for antibody tests caused the laboratories to significantly reduce those prices, in some cases by nearly 70 percent.21 In another effort to prevent abusive conduct through increased transparency, Italy’s competition authority also requested grocery retailers to report on the trend of prices for “basic groceries, detergents, disinfectants and gloves.”22 Such reporting helped the authority distinguish legitimate price increases from those that caused concern.
With respect to other types of unlawful conduct, Canada’s submission highlighted its Competition Bureau’s issuance of warning letters to businesses which “sought to benefit from the fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 by selling products that allegedly prevented, treated or cured the disease.”23 In the United States, too, the FTC and the Food and Drug Administration have issued over 90 joint warning letters to companies marketing products as COVID-19 treatments or cures.24
 
Assessment of Existing Merger Standards
Finally, participants’ submissions reflect that many have reassessed whether existing merger standards — in particular, the failing firm defense — ought to be loosened in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The failing firm defense allows for approval of an otherwise anticompetitive merger if certain criteria are met, including that the acquired firm is in danger of failing and exiting the market altogether. Though the possibility that more businesses will fail as a result of the COVID-19 crisis has provoked a second look at the defense, the consensus is that rigorous enforcement of existing merger standards remains the securest path towards economic recovery.
For some historical context, similar discussions arose in 2008 and 2009, stemming from the notion that relaxed standards might help businesses better weather the then-ongoing financial crisis. At that time, participants in an OECD roundtable on the failing firm defense concluded that its “criteria should not be relaxed in times of crisis.”25 The secretariat’s current background note reaffirms this conclusion, noting that past crises suggest that that suspension of antitrust laws holds back recovery and that relaxed merger control does not improve long-term resilience.26
The roundtable participants tend to agree. For example, the U.S. submission states that the DOJ and FTC’s “view of key U.S. antitrust standards has not changed.”27 With respect to the failing firm defense in particular, the agencies assert that they continue to apply the same test  and to “require the same level of substantiation as was required before the COVID pandemic.”28 The EU submission takes a similar view, noting that “the crisis cannot and should not serve as a pretext for approving mergers that would hurt consumers and hold back recovery.”29 The positions taken by the U.S., the EU, and others reflect concerns that relaxing merger control based on economic uncertainty, standing alone, would set a challenging precedent and distort competition law in the long-term.
As a counterpoint, the OECD’s BIAC, which represents a network of companies across the globe, took a more flexible view. The BIAC submission suggests that the defense “may justifiably be partially relaxed” by, for example, “specifically allow[ing] competition agencies to take imminent job losses into account.”30 Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that countries will change their views in response to this recommendation from the business community.
 
Conclusion
Despite the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine, rising case numbers and new lockdowns have left many countries and their competition agencies in the emergency phase of pandemic management. Understandably, then, most country submissions to this roundtable focused on short-term, immediate measures to lessen the most disruptive economic impacts of the crisis — a necessary first step. But the true test of competition policy’s role in promoting economic recovery is still to come, when, in the recovery phase, “the focus [will turn to] building back the economies in a speedy and sustainable manner.”31

Highlights from the OECD Forum on Competition, Day One – By Melanie Kiser (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
As governments around the world contemplate calls for fundamental reforms to competition policy, the OECD Global Forum on Competition convened virtually to exchange views and ideas on December 7, 2020. The four-day event began with a keynote address and panel titled “Competition Policy: Time for a Reset?” moderated by OECD Competition Committee Chairman Frédéric Jenny.
Discussion revolved around whether public interest goals should be added to prevailing competition standards and how best to address the unique issues presented by digital platforms, among other topics.
 
Problems with “Public Interest” Goals in Competition Law
Much of the panel discussion focused on whether the consumer welfare standard (“CWS”) should be replaced with a standard looking beyond effects on competition to reflect other public interest goals such as employment. With one exception, the panelists generally expressed skepticism and/or concern towards the idea of incorporating public interest goals into competition policy.
Keynote speaker Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission’s “A Europe Fit for the Digital Age” task force, was first to address the question of whether it is “time for a reset” in competition policy. “The answer very much depends on what you mean by a ‘reset,’” she said. “If we are asking if it’s time to change the aims of competition policy,” as advocates for a public interest standard have argued, “the answer has to be no,” she said. “Quite the contrary, it’s more important than ever that we take effective action to keep competition working the way it should.”
This view was echoed by U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Christine Wilson, who said that she “remain[s] confident that competition is the best way to achieve the best results for consumers, and that antitrust law informed by economic analysis is the best way to achieve the most good for the greatest number.”
Panelists generally agreed that many public interest goals are better served through other policy tools. People often “lose sight of the fact that [competition law] is one tool in a broader toolkit that really does include a variety of levers that we can use to address larger public policy problems,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.
South Africa’s Approach – Chairman Jenny observed that the presence of public interest goals in some countries’ laws may reflect differences in the value placed on competition. On one hand, there are jurisdictions such as the United States and European Union, “where there is enough support for competition as a value to society.” On the other, there are certain developing countries, often with higher unemployment, “where it is not so evident to people that competition is a good thing, and where the only way to actually promote competition is, in fact, to have some public interest goal in the law.”
Panelist Thando Vilakazi offered views from South Africa, a country falling into the latter category that has long integrated public interest considerations into its competition law.2 In that region, the question is not whether such goals should be included but whether they should be broader and whether they are performing as intended, said Vilakazi, the executive director of the Centre for Competition, Regulation, and Economic Development at the University of Johannesburg. In South Africa, current law provides for consideration of a merger’s effects on “(a) a particular sector or region; (b) employment; (c) the ability of small businesses, or firms controlled or owned by historically disadvantaged persons, to become competitive; and (d) the ability of national industries to compete in international markets.”3
While South Africa has published guidelines describing the process for consideration of these goals, they do not indicate the weight to be given to each factor or how conflicts between the various policy goals will be resolved.4
Transparency & Accountability – Incorporation of public interest goals, as done in South Africa, “puts a premium on the clarity with which policymakers are willing to describe what they’ve done and not hide tradeoffs they’re making,” said Bill Kovacic, professor at George Washington University. This is “a degree of transparency that is hard to achieve in practice” because “the tradeoffs are so hard that there is an enormous temptation to mask them.” Under such standards, regulators “owe it to the public” to do as they would on a math exam and “show their work.”
The addition of public interest goals posed similar concerns for Damien Neven, an Economics Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and Senior Academic Advisor for Compass Lexecon. “If you have multiple objectives,” he explained, “at the end of the day it is difficult to reach a decision for which the agencies can be accountable,” and there is greater risk and scope of regulatory “capture.”
Because antitrust enforcement “is law enforcement,” it is “an evidence-based investigatory process and subject to judicial review,” explained Moss. As such, “concepts of standards and administrability do play in a very important way.” There is also a “danger” of replicating public interest standards already in place for regulated industries at other agencies, Moss said. Speaking from her experience as an industrial policy regulator at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Moss said she and her colleagues there “struggled with [the] public interest standard at FERC.”
Advantages of the CWS – Panelists identified a range of advantages to the prevailing CWS. “Precisely because it is tethered to economic principles,” Commissioner Wilson explained, the CWS “provides predictability to market actors, administrability to the courts, and credibility to the decisions made by competition enforcers.” These elements are necessary for competition law to have legitimacy and buy-in from stakeholders and citizens, she said. By contrast, a public interest approach would require enforcers to engage in an “unavoidably political calculus on who to serve” and “greatly increase subjectivity and uncertainty,” she said.
As a standard for protecting competition, Moss observed that the CWS “is far more competent in addressing issues than it has been given credit for,” noting that it “rightly focuses on the impact of anticompetitive mergers or conduct on market participants adversely affected by exercises of market power.” This focus on the participants affected, she said, enables the CWS to address (1) harm at any level in a supply chain, (2) both short-term static and longer-term dynamic effects, and (3) effects on non-price dimensions” such as quality and new products, she said. It also inherently accounts for the ability of consumers to discipline exercises of market power through consideration of barriers to entry/expansion and other competitive constraints, she said.
 
Dealing with Digital Platforms
The panel discussed several proposals under consideration in the U.S. and Europe that aim to address digital markets in particular.
Europe – The European Union is considering an approach that would designate specific digital platforms for additional regulation.5 These firms would be subject to a list of prohibited conduct (e.g. self-preferencing) and set of obligations to guarantee market contestability, which could include such requirements as data sharing, interoperability, and access to key inputs.
There is a risk with this proposal “of basically only allowing innovation by small firms and basically preventing large firms from innovating,” Neven said. The proposal would create “very strong presumptions about what large platforms can do and other platforms cannot do.” These presumptions should be informed by “stable economic theory, enforcement experience, and empirical evidence” that are not yet fully available.
Commissioner Wilson expressed skepticism about the economics underlying the potential obligations. “Economics teaches us that if you force companies to share certain assets with competitors, innovation and investment in those assets will decline.” This means that some proposals “may sound ‘fairer’ in how they would divide the pie, but they actually result in a smaller pie for policy makers to divide.”
United States – The U.S. panelists took a range of views on the idea of digital-specific antitrust legislation, which has been suggested in a recent report by select members of Congress. Moss suggested that further thought must be given “to the advent of the ecosystem business model,” which is “very unique” and gives rise to concerns about leveraging consumer data across platforms and about data and analytics “as assets.”
Commissioner Wilson disagreed, stating that antitrust laws in the United States “are broad enough to take into account the digital sector as it exists and will exist in the future,” and authorities have been grappling with these issues since the D.C. Circuit’s Microsoft case from the 1990s. Kovacic echoed that U.S. officials “have been so attuned to high tech innovation” for many years. “The notion that they were blind to these considerations is such a myth.”

Conclusion
Returning to the overarching question posed to the panel – whether it is “time for a reset” in competition policy – the answer was largely in the negative. While speakers differed in their views on how competition policy could be improved, there was significant skepticism about overhauling its goals or approach.

Highlights from the OECD’s November 2020 Roundtable on Competition in Digital Advertising Markets – By Max Fischer-Zernin (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
Over the past decade competition enforcers across the globe have investigated various aspects of “digital” or “online” advertising. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Competition Committee’s (“OECD’s”) “roundtable on competition in digital advertising markets” suggests enforcers’ interest in the digital advertising sector may continue, if not intensify, in the coming years. At the November 30 virtual roundtable, enforcers, academics, and representatives from the business community gathered virtually to exchange learnings from the past few years and set out an agenda for future market studies and legislative changes.
While the roundtable was an off-the-record meeting, the OECD has published OECD-member country submissions (“Notes”), an extensive OECD briefing document (the “Brief”), and remarks to the Committee by Hal Varian, David S. Evans, and Fiona M. Scott Morton.2 A notable absence is the lack of a submission from the United States.
In this article I draw out some of the key themes from the roundtable material.
 
Market Studies, Enforcement Actions, and Regulatory Initiatives
The country submissions offer a helpful retrospective on major market studies and enforcement actions of the past decade. The Australian Note summarizes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (“ACCC”) recent Digital Platforms Inquiry and the ongoing Digital Advertising Services Inquiry. The French Note summarizes the 2010 and 2018 Autorité de la Concurrence inquiries into digital advertising, and a variety of decisions imposing interim measures, fines, and commitments in the search advertising sector. The UK Note discusses the 2020 Final Report from the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) online platforms and digital advertising market study. And the Japanese Note raises the JFTC’s 2019 Report regarding trade practices on digital platforms.
Some Notes discuss existing or planned specialized competition “units” to oversee digital advertising and other digital sectors. The Australian Note provides an overview of the ACCC’s newly established digital platforms branch, charged with monitoring competition in digital platform markets and taking competition enforcement action.3 The French Note mentions the new digital economy unit in the Autorité¸ established in early 2020.4
The UK Note calls for the creation of a broader “Digital Markets Unit” within the CMA to oversee a new “pro-competitive ex ante regulatory regime” for the digital advertising sector, including an enforceable code of conduct to govern the behavior of platforms with “strategic market status” and a set of “pro-competitive interventions” including data access and interoperability remedies.5 The UK submission views the new Unit as a necessary response to perceived gaps in competition law.
The Spanish Note finds that “competition policy offers a flexible framework to adapt to complex industries such as online advertising” but agrees that “perhaps more and better resources are needed (in specialized units) to deal with the complexity of digital markets.”6
Other country submissions discuss the need for new enforcement powers. The French Note highlighted the importance of the Autorité’s power to issue interim measures (injunctions), and forthcoming legislative enactments that will allow the Autorité to “to start proceedings ex officio when it deems interim measures to be necessary in a given market, without having to wait for a referral by third parties,” as is currently required.7
The Autorité has also made “proposals for possible adjustments to its means of intervention in order to address the challenges and specificities of the digital economy,”8 which call for “implementing a prevention and sanction system specifically for [large digital platform] players.”9
Like the French Note, the Korean submission previews legislation by which the KFTC “has strengthened investigations and monitoring on infringements by online platform operators, while pushing ahead with institutional improvement including revision of laws and regulations to promote competition and establish order for fair trade in the field.”10
The Spanish Note calls for additional scrutiny of mergers in “data-intensive digital services” to identify harms to competition “even if apparently they are not involving potential competitors.”11 The submission concludes that “apart from merger control, antitrust tools can adapt to theories of harm related to potential concerns in online advertising markets,”12 but leaves the door open for “some type of regulation” around issues like data portability and interoperability, and transparency.13
The OECD Brief cautions that the proposed legislative and regulatory responses could have harmful unintended consequences, warning that “it will be important to consider any possible unintended consequences, such as undermining procompetitive digital business models that rely on digital advertising as a main or significant source of revenue.”14
While these Notes do refer to more extensive comments made in market studies and issue papers, they lack an extensive discussion of error costs, administrability, and the risk of chilling procompetitive conduct.15 An exception is the Note by Spain, which states: “If regulation were to be enacted to overcome some of the challenges raised by digitization and, specifically, by online advertising, it is crucial that it is well-designed in order to avoid unintended effects on competition.”16
The OECD Brief also suggests “[i]t will also be important to ensure that related policy experts, such as from data protection and privacy agencies, and consumer protection agencies, are involved to ensure there are no unintended consequences in these adjacent policy spheres.”17 The call to align competition and data privacy initiatives is echoed by the OECD-member countries.18
  
The Structure of the Digital Advertising Sector and Attempts to Define Relevant Markets
Various member countries recognize digital advertising as an innovative sector. Business at OECD19 finds that “[a] common feature of digital media markets, including online advertising, is that they bring fast and potentially disruptive innovation, are characterized by an impressive growth rate as well as by the presence of digital platform intermediaries that have a central role. Online advertising is able to compete with traditional advertising because it has generated unprecedented advantages for businesses and end consumer[s] alike.”20
The French Note states that the display advertising sector “is developing within a powerful technological dynamic” and “[m]any intermediation and data processing service providers have entered the market.”21 The Spanish Note states “[d]igital advertising has been, in general, a positive disruption, increasing the efficiency of campaigns and bringing new innovations.”22
These views find support in other expert analyses, such as the 2020 ACCC submission by Daniel S. Bitton and Stephen Lewis, Clearing Up Misperceptions About Google’s Ad Tech Business. Bitton & Lewis review industry data and conclude that “the ad tech space displays two key features of a highly competitive space: growing output and declining prices.”23
Country submissions also suggest a taxonomy for digital advertising inventory (ad slots on different types of websites and apps). The United Kingdom, Australian, Mexican, and French Notes divide advertising into offline and digital,24 and further divide digital advertising into search, display, and classified advertising, suggesting limited substitutability between the three.25 The UK Note, for example, suggests search and display advertising serve different purposes: search advertising is “aimed at driving consumers to take a particular action” while display advertising is intended for “raising brand awareness and shifting brand perceptions.”26
Catherine Tucker, whose work is quoted extensively in the Business at OECD Note, explains the key determinant is neither the type of format nor the objective of an advertisement, but the advertiser’s measured return on ad spend:
“In the past, advertisers believed that in the upper funnel, because they were competing against clutter, they needed to use storytelling and highly visual formats to gain attention. . . . However, this rule has been replaced by measurement, meaning that advertisers can effectively use any format at any place in the funnel and evaluate whether it is effective for that particular target audience. Ultimately, an advertiser is indifferent between whether it is a video ad, or a static text-laden ad that influences a customer to purchase as long as they can measure how effective that format was relative to its price.”27
The ability to “target” advertising and measure its effectiveness is discussed at length in the country submissions.28 But the Notes largely omit arguments about how targeting and measurement can blur the so-called “marketing funnel.” Targeting could be used in display advertising to elicit an action from the user, such as with “remarketing” advertising, or search advertising could be used for brand awareness, especially when a user’s search query does not suggest commercial intent (i.e., the user is not using search to make a purchase). As the UK Note acknowledges, the CMA has seen “some evidence that display advertising, particularly on Facebook, is increasingly being used for targeting in-market conversions.”29
The French Note also acknowledges that while digital advertising’s innovations in targeting and pricing distinguish it from traditional advertising, like television, “this observation could change in the future depending on the development of targeted and programmatic television advertising.”30
To varying degrees UK, Australian, and French Notes use the taxonomy for digital advertising inventory to suggest separate relevant markets for display and search advertising.31 With the exception of certain adjudicated enforcement actions, the member countries explain that these statements are not intended to provide binding conclusions about relevant market definitions.32 For example, The UK Note states clearly that the CMA market study “did not seek to undertake a formal market definition exercise.”33
In his remarks to the roundtable, David S. Evans cautions against drawing binding conclusions about market definition from market studies: “Market definition is very much tied to whatever it is the conduct is that we are trying to analyze . . . . Trying to make an overarching determination now as part of a market inquiry sort of approach . . . I’m not sure aside from providing general information that that’s really a great thing to do.”34
Business at OECD encourages competition enforcers “to undertake any analysis of online advertising markets with precision to ensure that conclusions are robust and directed at identifiable competition violations, and that remedies are appropriate to address the competition violation at hand [and] to the extent that regulation (rather than enforcement) is considered on the basis of competition concerns, precision in identifying the underlying competition problems is both a necessary precursor and an essential element of an effective framework.”35
 
An Overview of the Ad Tech Stack and its Complexities
The UK, Australian, and Mexican submissions and OECD Brief provide an overview of the “ad tech stack,”36 those services that “assist advertisers and publishers in the automatic purchasing and selling of digital display advertising.”37
The Notes highlight the complexity of the ad tech stack, but do not address arguments that the historical origin of each ad tech service or functionality explains how they increased competition and efficiency compared to the then-prevailing status quo. For example, Bitton & Lewis explain that, when viewed “in the context of market developments that took place over this time,” Google’s publisher ad tech product Google Ad Manager “has a track record of enhancing rather than inhibiting competition, and that its evolution reflects Google’s responses to rapid technological and competitive changes, as well as attempts to balance the interests of users, publishers and advertisers.”38
 
Network Effects and Data in the Digital Advertising Sector
There is widespread agreement among member countries that digital advertising platforms are two-sided platforms that exhibit network effects and use user data as an input,39 and that these characteristics contribute to market power in the digital advertising sector.
The UK Note states that “network effects” and “unequal access to user data” “entrench” incumbent platforms’ market power.40 And the Mexican and Spanish Notes argue that network effects and big data facilitate market concentration.41
Regarding network effects, country submissions do not discuss the risks of relying on network effects as indications of substantial power or monopoly power. As the American Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law has written, “[w]hen evaluating network effects, it is important to consider, next to switching costs and multi-homing and other factors, the possibility of negative network effects.”42
As Koren Wong-Ervin has explained: “[n]etwork effects can cut both ways, sometimes leading to highly concentrated markets due to positive feedback loops or ‘tipping,’ and other times hastening the decline of a dominant player.”43
In a prior publication, Evans and co-author Richard Schmalensee explained that “[n]etworks can have exponential growth when every additional customer attracts more consumers. . . . the same principle can lead to exponential decline. Each lost customer induces other customers to leave, which induces more to leave.”44
Regarding the importance of data, the UK submission describes data as “highly valuable” and an “essential input” for ad targeting and measurement,45 two uses of data also highlighted by the Spanish Note.46 The Australian Note also characterizes data as a “source of competitive advantage.”47
Multiple submissions discuss the allegedly unique characteristics of data. The Mexican, Spanish, and Business at OECD Notes agree data is non-rivalrous.48 Business at OECD states data is also non-exclusive,49 but the Spanish Note suggests “regulation actually promotes excludability in general.”50
Wong-Ervin has explained that, while data is a valuable input, new entrants do not need to replicate incumbents’ data to succeed.51 Similarly, Darren Tucker and Hill Wellford have argued that “[a]n entrant that needs personal data can collect relevant information from its users once the service is operational. Data collected in this manner is free or nearly so. Entering the market and then collecting and analyzing user data is not a theoretical approach but rather the very model followed by many of the leading online firms when they were startups or virtual unknowns, including Google, Facebook, Yelp, Amazon, eBay, Pinterest, and Twitter.”52
The Mexican Note states that, despite its risks, “the collection of large datasets and analysis of data could lead to benefits for consumers, such as access […] to better and personalized services.”53 Business at OECD also explains that targeted advertising results in efficiencies as advertisers waste a smaller portion of their budget advertising to an overly broad audience.54
 
Types of Potential Conduct Raising Competition Risks
The OECD Brief provides a summary of the structural issues and conduct that were raised in countries’ submissions as potential issues to examine in the digital advertising sector: conflicts of interest in vertically integrated firms, self-preferencing that raises rivals’ costs, leveraging market power, opaque data practices, and more general market opacity that gives dominant platforms the ability to create market distortions.55
 
Concluding Thoughts 
The OECD’s Competition Committee’s “roundtable” offers a helpful summary of how key competition enforcers have approached the digital advertising sector. This article highlights some areas of agreement among countries as well as the disagreements and misunderstandings that still remain.
As David S. Evans told the roundtable, showing monopoly power or dominance in a relevant market is a fact-specific inquiry that must be conducted in the context of the merger or conduct at issue. Market studies, white papers, and submissions to the OECD may provide helpful general information but they are not dispositive. In the context of the digital advertising sector it is helpful to consider some of the arguments made by Business at OECD, Wong-Ervin, and Tucker regarding the complexities of network effects and data inputs.
Looking ahead, as certain member countries pursue new legislative initiatives, it will be important that they clearly identify market failures and consumer harms to be remedied, any actual gaps in competition law, and how the new regulation will mitigate error costs, administrability issues, and the risk of chilling procompetitive conduct. Member countries will often find that their existing competition regimes are the more appropriate channel for competition enforcement in the digital advertising sector.

OECD Roundtable on Market Studies: Consensus on the Strengths and Limitations & Divergence on Binding Remedies – By Pauline (Shi) Tang (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider)1
Click here for a PDF version of the article
On December 10, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (“OECD”) Competition Committee held a roundtable on “Using market studies to tackle emerging competition issues.” The country submissions and speaker presentations are publicly available on the OECD’s website. The Secretariat’s background note, country submissions by the United States, Japan, and Mexico, and the submission by Business at OECD (“BIAC”) represent some of the key opinions on the use of market studies. The submissions explore the strengths and limitations of using market studies to diagnose and solve novel competition issues; the utility of using them beyond traditional enforcement actions; and the potential dangers of imposing market-wide binding remedies following market studies absent a finding of violation of the law, especially in dynamic sectors.
  
OECD Background Note: Market Studies Used as a “[F]lexible” and “[F]orward [L]ooking” Tool, But Remedies That Follow Should Be Proportionate and Principle-Based 
The Secretariat’s background note describes how market studies can be used by competition authorities as a “flexible tool” to examine new and evolving challenges “outside the context of merger reviews or antitrust investigations.”2 The submission by BIAC finds that “holistic yet structured assessments” are better suited to evaluate new business models with “overlapping ecosystems of suppliers and customers.”3
Market studies are useful, according to the Secretariat, in part because they are forward-looking and market-wide in nature. Enforcement actions are limited to historical or ongoing anticompetitive practices by specific companies. Market studies, by contrast, can look at potential scenarios in the entire market and “identify and diagnose emerging competition issues.”4 The Secretariat considers such a holistic tool important, especially in dealing with certain structural features such as “large economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, high barriers to entry, and ‘winner-takes-most’ dynamics” that risk leading to high concentration, even if no anticompetitive conduct has yet been taken by incumbents.5 In other words, market studies provide opportunities to “focus the analysis on the process of competition and not just on outcomes.”6 The Secretariat’s background note states that such a tool applies not only in digital markets, but also in any type of “challenger” businesses with “innovative business models and new technologies” that will potentially disrupt the existing markets.
The Secretariat believes market studies are good at creating “synergies” between competition law and other policy areas by analyzing the market from the perspectives beyond competition to include consumer protection or data and privacy considerations.7
The Secretariat’s background note also points out potential limitations of market studies. Substantively, the Secretariat cautions that even though the studies can offer more predictability to companies entering the market, agencies need to avoid offering static recommendations or remedies that no longer fit market reality by the time the study is published, especially in fast moving digital markets. To solve that issue, the Secretariat encourages broad “principle-based primary legislation,” to be followed by secondary legislation or guidance tailored to new sector conditions later on as needed.8
The Secretariat acknowledges the difficulty to implement recommendations coming out of market studies as they will not be legally binding in most jurisdictions. The note suggests putting the burden on lawmakers to explain why they opt out of adopting any recommendations of the competition authority. By contrast, for the few jurisdictions that can issue binding recommendations (including potentially the European Commission given the “New Competition Tool” currently being considered), the Secretariat believes such power should “com[e] with very tight governance and procedural checks and balances to ensure the competition authority remains within its remit and is accountable for its interventions.”9
The Secretariat believes there are clear benefits for different competition authorities and governments to work together and develop a “shared international approach” as the emerging competition issues are global in nature, and common issues deserve common approaches.10
 
Submission by the United States: Cautiously Optimistic About Market Studies’ Offering of Holistic Insights in Evolving Sectors Limited to “a [S]napshot in [T]ime”
The U.S. submission states that market studies may be appropriate in sectors with evolving competition landscapes, and when the competition authorities need to be educated on certain novel market conditions or past wins and losses therein.11 The submission finds market studies helpful as they provide agencies with “stakeholder, academic, industry and consumer feedback,” and data that allow agencies to perform empirical research in support of policy recommendations.12 As pointed out by the background note, the U.S. submission also recognizes that market studies can only provide information “relevant to a snapshot in time.”13 Any remedy based on the market study findings needs to be carefully evaluated as the snapshot captured by the market study might have already shifted. Moreover, the submission acknowledges that such studies are “extremely resource intensive” for the agencies and “burdensome to companies both in terms of time and cost of compliance.”14
The submission introduces the U.S. agencies’ market studies portfolio, including workshops, retrospective studies of consummated mergers, and market studies conducted without a specific law enforcement purpose under the FTC’s 6(b) authority.
The submission briefly summarizes several recently held workshops on evolving market trends, including a workshop on “Venture Capital Investment and Antitrust Law.”15 It covered trends in venture capital investment since the 1990s, tips from investors on how to “identify nascent competitors” and why some competitive alternatives to the market-leading platforms have tended to become less attractive investment opportunities in recent years.16
The retrospective studies are intended to analyze whether the agencies’ reporting threshold for mergers has been too high, how effective the tools used by the agency economists are in predicting effects of proposed mergers in the markets, and how effective merger remedies are in maintaining or restoring competition lost due to a merger.17
The submission also illustrates how the FTC is currently using its 6(b) authority to study the “acquisition strategies” of the largest technology firms — including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — by looking at acquisitions falling below the reporting threshold.18 Information gathered from this study will be analyzed to examine to what extent those firms are making acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors, and whether those below-the-thread deals or agreements have raised competitive concerns.19 Although this study of below-the-thread deals may offer insights into whether current merger control is effective in digital markets, how agencies will manage the scope and frequency of similar studies given the submission’s acknowledgement of high burdens relating to market studies remains to be seen.
 
Submission by Japan: Market Studies — Leading to Recommendations for Businesses’ Voluntary Improvement — Considered “[N]ecessary” to Obtain a “[F]ull [P]icture” of a Market
Japan’s submission considers market studies “necessary” to gather reliable factual findings and to obtain a “full picture” understanding of market structures or trade practices, and eventually to ensure appropriate implementation of competition law and policy.20 “[F]act-finding surveys” conducted by the JFTC also aim to “prevent” anti-competitive practices before they materialize, as mentioned in the background note.21
The submission points out fact-finding surveys, conducted by the Economic Affairs Bureau, bear no direct relationship with actual party-specific investigations conducted by the Investigation Bureau.22 The JFTC, however, will issue letters to companies that may “potential[ly] infring[e]” antitrust law, as found in the surveys, and encourage them to “voluntarily improve such practices in [a] pro-competitive way.”23
The submission describes its recent market study on code payment services (one of the cashless payments methods). The JFTC interviewed over 50 banks and fintech companies and issued questionnaires to more than 100 businesses, during which the JFTC finds that the market condition made it “indispensable for nonbank code payment providers to make contracts with banks,” thus granting banks “incentives to exclude nonbank code payment providers from the market.”24 The survey report therefore recommended that banks should consider “developing an environment” in which nonbank providers can have access to the Application Programming Interfaces used by large banks, and then develop substitutes for banks’ services.25
 
Submission by Mexico: Enthusiasm for Article 94’s Authority to Issue Binding Remedies Following Market Studies. Expectations for More Jurisdictions to Adopt Similar Approaches
Mexico’s submission discusses the Federal Economic Competition Commission’s (“COFECE”) uncommon authority to issue legally binding recommendations following a “market investigation” under Article 94 of the Federal Law of Economic Competition. The submission describes Article 94 as a “hybrid” competition and regulatory tool, allowing the Mexican agency to conduct a thorough market assessment aiming to identify “structural problems [and] order their correction through various remedies.”26 Recommendations could be subject to judicial review if an appeal were filed.27
The submission states that this tool has been effectively used by the COFECE to intervene in digital markets, when the issues are typically “unnoticed” by traditional antitrust tools.28 Due to the “winners-take-all” dynamics in digital markets, the submission argues that Article 94 allows the Commission to intervene at an early stage, before any single market participant acquires substantial market power. The submission finds Article 94 useful in analyzing behaviors that “do not necessarily fit in the list of abusive of dominance practices” but were identified in the international discourse as potentially problematic, such as self-preferencing practices, imposition of abusive contractual terms, or collusion using algorithms.29
Only the United Kingdom, Iceland, Greece and South Africa have similar broad authorities as Article 94 to impose binding remedies after a market study.30 But the submission observes that the international community has started to recognize the effectiveness of similar ex-ante market study authorities independent from an entity’s specific anticompetitive conducts, especially in the analysis of digital markets, citing the EU’s contemplation of the “New Competition Tool.”31 Indeed, there is an ongoing debate on whether antitrust law needs a reform vis-a-vis the digitalization of markets and market-wide remedies may be more effective in tackling certain types of issues. However, as the Secretariat’s note cautioned, with great power comes great responsibility, such market-wide remedies need to come with strong procedural checks and balances. It is also worth considering whether one-size-fits-all remedy packages that will accurately target the issues corresponding to businesses with diverse business models truly exist.
 
Critiques by BIAC: Market Studies Not Predictive in Nature, Remedies That Follow Should Be Recognized as an “[E]xtraordinary” Power 
BIAC’s submission cautions against unrealistic expectations for market studies and discusses several of their limitations and dangers.
First, BIAC explains that market studies are not inherently “predictive.” To the contrary, market studies are to some extent limited by agencies’ preconceived beliefs on how antitrust law is failing because they tend to focus on “markets with known and observable existing systematic challenges.”32 As a result, the submission expresses doubt on market studies’ potential as a “panacea” for resolving emerging and future issues in markets.
Second, to prevent market studies from becoming “burdensome fishing expeditions,” BIAC emphasizes the need for a “clearly articulated test for when a study is warranted,” including why existing competition powers are insufficient.33 The submission does not believe “vague notions of concentration and profitability” are sufficient reasons, for example, to launch market studies. BIAC opines that a clearly-set out scope and objectives may potentially avoid subjecting companies to “mission creep.”34 To properly manage the scope and minimize unnecessary burden on companies, BIAC believes preliminary inquiries in the format of pilot questionnaires or consultations of key stakeholders in the preliminary stages can be useful.35
Third, BIAC points out that the ability for a competition authority to impose remedies on businesses in the absence of any infringement is an “extraordinary power” without the “democratic legitimacy of an elected legislator.”36 BIAC thus “strenuously disagrees with the need for powers to impose remedies” to be included in market studies.37 The preferred route, rather, is for market studies to “analyze, diagnose and inform, but for changes to be achieved through other means.” Avenues like individual voluntary commitments, code of conduct, or legislation should all be options.38 BIAC’s warning is on point because authority to issue binding remedies following market studies risks turning agencies into regulators.
If remedy powers are to be included, the submission stresses the need for agencies to “proceed cautiously and proportionately,” as market studies are not the place for “creative and speculative theories of harm.”39 BIAC states that agencies should design remedies that are “effective and proportionate to the issues identified,” and avoid remedies that may “chill innovation.”40 BIAC also suggests the importance of a “merits-based judicial review of any remedies” that come out of market studies, and to put in place structures to “revisit remedies over time” especially in dynamic markets.41 Agencies should recognize the potential need to allocate long-term resources to keep the code of conduct up to date because otherwise, a rigid outdated code of conduct may instead stifle innovation in fast-moving sectors.
Lastly, BIAC warns that the many emerging competition issues, especially the ones in digital markets, are inherently global, and therefore “inappropriate for consideration, and certainly unsuitable for remedy, at the level of a single jurisdiction.”42
 
Conclusion
The country submissions reveal a varying degree of enthusiasm for the use of market studies in terms of how useful they will be in tackling emerging competition issues beyond the existing enforcement tools, and whether any legally binding remedies should come out of those studies. Overall, the submissions recognize market studies’ utility in obtaining a market-wide picture of evolving sectors, but also counsel that, before fully grasping the strengths and limitations of market studies, agencies should remain realistic about what they can achieve and stay vigilant to the danger of overusing them due to the high compliance costs they impose on companies. BIAC’s submission also urges agencies to keep in mind that imposing binding, one-size-fits-all remedies on companies without any specific violation may lead to unintended consequences. These may include preventing the flexibility needed, particularly in fast-moving and dynamic markets.

Parler asked for an emergency order to reject Amazon’s shutdown of its account, saying it was the equivalent of “pulling the plug on a hospital patient on life support,” reported Politico.
On Monday, January 11, Parler hit back at Amazon, filing a lawsuit accusing the tech giant of violating antitrust law by cutting off the conservative-friendly social media site’s presence on the web.
In a complaint filed in federal court in Washington state, Parler claimed that Amazon’s decision was “motivated by political animus” and designed to reduce competition to the benefit of Twitter, which is also a customer of the online retailer’s Amazon Web Services division.
Parler asked for an emergency order to reject Amazon’s shutdown of its account, saying it was the equivalent of “pulling the plug on a hospital patient on life support.”
Amazon “will kill Parler’s business — at the very time it is set to skyrocket,” the complaint stated.
Google and Apple also kicked Parler’s app from their respective app stores over the weekend, on similar grounds.
Parler has become a popular alternative to Twitter and Facebook as those firms have cracked down on content posted by President Donald Trump and others. Last year, about 10 million people downloaded Parler, according to mobile app analytics company Sensor Tower, with about 80% of those in the United States.

Alfred A. Knopf announced on Monday, January 11, that Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and former presidential candidate, will write about monopolies and her recommendations for how they should be challenged in a book slated for release in April, reported The New York Times.
The book, “Antitrust: Taking on Monopoly Power From the Gilded Age to the Digital Age,” is a mix of history, law, personal anecdotes, and politics, encompassing such companies as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Amazon, and pharmaceutical corporations. It is also a blueprint for how Congress and the incoming Biden administration might adjust the United States’ approach to their regulation.
“Corporate consolidation, monopoly power, dark money, and rising levels of income inequality are problems that require a newly invigorated pro-competition agenda,” Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement. “My book traces the history of America’s antitrust movement, explaining why it mattered when the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed by Congress in 1890 and why it matters even more today. It shows how new laws and more effective enforcement are essential to protecting American consumers and free enterprise.”
Ms. Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is the ranking member on its antitrust subcommittee. Her upcoming book sprang from a conversation about three years ago with Victoria Wilson, a vice president and senior editor at Knopf. At that time, Ms. Klobuchar had already written a memoir, “The Senator Next Door,” and during their talk, Ms. Wilson encouraged her to write a different kind of book.

Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell called for antitrust action against Big Tech for “canceling conservatives” after Amazon, Apple, and Google took action against Parler, an alternative social media app drawing conservative users, reported Fox News.
“Big tech is doing what we were all told was a crazy conspiracy, canceling conservatives. Now they’re after [Parler]. Don’t let them win! Join me there @brentbozell,” Bozell wrote on Twitter Saturday, January 9.

“BigTech has declared war not just on the right but on the American ideal of freedom. Apple, Google and Amazon are dangerous monopolies and must be smashed. Deluge them with calls and emails,” he continued.
Bozell’s comments come after all of Big Tech appeared to come together to block President Trump following Wednesday’s sacking of the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday said Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts will be blocked “indefinitely” and for at least the next two weeks before Inauguration Day on January 20.
Twitter announced the permanent suspension of Trump’s account Friday, January 8, following months of flagging his tweets with warnings. The social media company stated the president was spreading disinformation that could incite further violence.
Parler was crippled after Amazon, Apple, and Google booted it from their platforms, citing numerous posts that they say incite violence. Amazon said in a statement that Parler lacks sufficient controls on violent content.

110,"January 7, 2021",Big Tech Likely To See Pressure From Biden Administration,"


By PYMNTS
Out of all of the chaos that has engulfed politics and, specifically, the nation’s capital these last few days, it bears sifting through the headlines and the tumult to see what’s to come.
A Biden administration will take root in two weeks with a majority in the House of Representatives and Senate. That makes it a lot easier to get a policy to make the leap from concept to reality, from proposal to law – at least theoretically. To be a bit more realistic, it should be noted that the Democrats now control the Senate with the slimmest of majorities, and that the current roster of senators might be deemed more moderate than has been seen in past “classes” of senators. That means would-be legislation is no slam-dunk.
If there is one near-certainty coming to pass, though, it would be that Big Tech is likely to see some real pressure on the Hill and across the legal landscape. Last month, a slew of attorneys general and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust suit against Facebook. There’s a separate antitrust suit in place against Google. Hill hearings featuring tech CEOs seemed the norm last year, and we can expect to see more of the same this year and beyond.
Biden is inheriting an economy that can best be described as uneven, with unemployment still stubbornly high at about 6.7 percent, according to the November reading. Businesses are still struggling, and the roadmap to a post-pandemic recovery may hinge on more stimulus payments and direct aid to SMBs and individuals/families alike.
But, of course, administrations and new Congresses shape all manner of industries at once – and the financial services industry may see new efforts to expand access to traditional banking services, while changing (through technology) the way those services, including payments, are delivered.
The ways in which people bank are changing – and it follows, too, that the Hill would adapt to and promote those changes.
As PYMNTS has examined in past coverage, the lines are “blurring” between FinTechs, Big Tech and traditional banks. Just 7.4 percent of consumers surveyed reported that their primary bank is a digital-only bank (4.2 percent) or PayPal (3.2 percent).
We’re already seeing some movement by regulators to broaden and modernize payments through some announcements from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).
On a broad level, the OCC has called for proposed personal banking regulations intended to level the playing field across demographics and incomes. New initiatives would guarantee that everyone would have equal access to banking services offered by national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign bank organizations, the statement indicated.
And as noted in this space,  through an interpretive letter, the OCC said that regulated financial institutions (FIs) can participate in independent node verification networks (INVN for short – namely, a blockchain network). As a result, these FIs have been cleared to issue stablecoins for a range of activities, including payments.
These types of broad regulatory missions – and others, where, for example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been looking more closely at open banking – are likely to continue in 2021 and beyond. As is also germane to the CFPB, Biden has called for the creation of the Public Credit Reporting Agency, which would exist within the CFPB itself. That public credit agency, it’s been floated, would tap into “nontraditional” data sources such as utility bill payments as part of the processes of helping would-be lenders in their decisioning activities.
He has also signaled how he will approach certain matters, such as taxes, which will impact how and where enterprises – including banks, FinTechs, card networks and others – will allocate their resources. He has proposed rolling back at least some of the corporate tax cuts that were put in place during the previous administration, which would mean boosting the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent.

A subsidiary of UnitedHealth has been indicted on antitrust charges that it maintained years long agreements with rival health-care firms not to recruit each other’s senior-level employees, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA) was indicted on two counts in a federal district court in Texas. The Justice Department hasn’t yet announced the case, but the indictment returned by a grand jury was posted on the court’s docket late Wednesday, January 6.
SCA is a leading provider of surgical centers around the US, with more than 200 facilities. UnitedHealth’s Optum health-services arm acquired the company in 2017.
The Justice Department in previous years has brought civil cases challenging no-poach agreements, especially in the tech sector, against companies including Apple, Google, and Intel. When businesses agree not to recruit or hire each other’s workers, it robs employees of opportunities, information, and the ability to use competing offers to negotiate better terms, the Department has argued.

113,"January 3, 2021",Facebook May License Code To Competitors To Ease Antitrust Concerns,"


Facebook has put forward the idea of easing antitrust concerns by allowing a competitor to license access to its code and its users’ collection of relationships to allow for the easier development of a rival social platform, according to unnamed sources in a report from The Washington Post.
The social media company didn’t provide the Post with company executives to talk about the matter, but company representative Chris Sgro told the outlet that “we will continue to vigorously defend the ability of people and businesses to choose our free services, advertising, and apps because of the value they bring.”
Facebook provided the offer to state and federal investigators who were preparing two antitrust suits against it, according to the report, which noted that investors ended up turning down the idea.
Facebook and Google are encountering many antitrust lawsuits in addition to probes by European and American regulators. For example, Facebook faces an antitrust suit backed by the US Federal Trade Commission and 46 states, while Google has been hit by an antitrust suit filed by a group of 38 state attorneys general.

115,"December 29, 2020",Little Law And No New Regulator: What’s Missing In The House Antitrust Report,"
By: Neil Chilson (Pro Market)
It might be hard to believe the report is missing anything. After all, the subcommittee under Cicilline’s leadership spent more than a year investigating digital markets, held seven hearings with 38 witnesses, collected nearly 1.3 million documents, interviewed more than 240 market participants, and received 38 written submission from 60 antitrust experts. At the end, the Democratic staff released 449 pages distilling the results of their investigation and offering 30 pages of recommended changes. What could possibly have been left out? It turns out the Cicilline report has two defining absences.
Missing Legal Analysis
The report is primarily a narrative document, not an argumentative one. It gathers and lays out many factual findings but does not apply the law to those facts to reach any legal conclusions. Even the narrative is circumscribed; for example, the report does not describe the existing state of antitrust law. Part V spends 267 pages—more than half the report—describing the business practices of four specific technology companies: Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. (Speaking of things that are missing, where is the description of Microsoft, the second-largest tech company in the world?)
The report’s tone often indicates that staff are critical of a particular business practice. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find in the report even one business practice that staff considers valuable to consumers. For example, Amazon Prime has made free next-day shipping so commonplace that people barely remember that just 10 years ago, standard shipping took six to eight weeks…

By: Mel Silva (Google)
The Australian Government has introduced its News Media Bargaining Code into Parliament.  
Unfortunately, while the Government has made some changes, the legislation still falls far short of a workable Code. As the legislation goes to a Senate committee for inquiry, it has serious problems that need to be worked through. 
The Code has changed—but still isn’t workable
Since the plan for a mandatory code was first announced in April 2020, we’ve engaged closely with the Government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We’ve explained consistently why earlier versions of the Code weren’t workable for Google or the people who use our services. And we’ve set out options to fix the most significant issues. We’ve said we’re willing to invest in a strong future for the news industry and made concrete progress on a new approach to doing that globally, through Google News Showcase. We’ve agreed that commercial negotiations are the best option for securing this investment, and that a form of binding arbitration within the Code could be a reasonable backstop — so long as that arbitration model is fair…

Honeywell International agreed to pay US$1.3 billion for Sparta Systems, an industrial software provider that specializes in life sciences, in what would be the largest acquisition since CEO Darius Adamczyk took the helm in 2017, reported Bloomberg.
The all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter, Honeywell said in a statement Tuesday, December 22. Sparta, based in Hamilton, New Jersey, is part of the portfolio of private equity firm New Mountain Capital. Founded in 1994, the software maker employs about 250 people.
The deal bolsters Adamczyk’s strategy of marrying software capabilities with Honeywell’s industrial technology. Sparta, the largest pure software provider that Honeywell has bought, will complement the manufacturer’s years of experience in providing automation equipment to the life-science industry. Sparta has more than 400 customers, including 42 of the world’s top 50 pharmaceutical companies, Honeywell stated.
While Sparta “will initially help us expand our capabilities for our existing breakthrough initiative in life sciences, we plan to leverage Honeywell’s global footprint and expertise to quickly expand Sparta’s capabilities to serve other markets,” said Rajeev Gautam, president of Honeywell’s Performance Materials and Technologies unit.

Facebook will transition its UK users into new agreements with its California headquarters, effectively going around the EU’s stringent privacy regulations as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Google unveiled a similar move earlier this year.
Google, Facebook, and a number of other Big Techs have based their European subsidiaries in the Republic of Ireland, which is remaining in the EU even as the neighboring UK prepares to leave via Brexit.
“Like other companies, Facebook has had to make changes to respond to Brexit and will be transferring legal responsibilities and obligations for UK users from Facebook Ireland to Facebook,” Facebook’s UK division stated, per Reuters. “There will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK”.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the panel discussion, Effective Competition Frameworks: Enabling Competition and Innovation with a Global Mindset, from the final chapter of our series, Towards a Competition Enabling Framework in Asia Pacific: Opportunities & Challenges.

David EVANS:
Hello everyone. This is David Evans. I’m sitting here in Boston, Massachusetts at the moment, but we’re going to be talking today about the Asia-Pacific region. There’s a robust digital economy in the region. Western tech firms are very active in lots of places. Chinese tech giants are more active in Asia-Pacific outside of China than in the West. But there’s a lot of innovation by domestic and regional players. And there’s also a great diversity in the digital ecosystems across countries. India is very different than Japan, which is very different than Australia. Just like everywhere else in the world competition authorities and others are really thinking very hard about the right regulatory framework for the digital economy. And they’re doing that in a context in which market investigations and proposals are quite far along in Europe and to a lesser extent in the United States. And of course, China, the giant of the area has recently announced proposals or actually a framework for the digital economy.
In today’s session we’re going to be hearing the perspectives of people who are really in the trenches, who are ...

120,"December 21, 2020",Artificial Intelligence and Antitrust in a Post-Qualcomm World,"
The questions in FTC v. Qualcomm are consequential in setting competitive norms in an economy anxious about the exercise of market power. Like many other antitrust cases, this one shows symptoms of antitrust law’s inherent vulnerability to ideology stampeding facts and data. Seen as an algorithm, antitrust has had patches and updates over the years. Still, few have recognized the breadth and depth of transformation artificial intelligence (“AI”) can bring to antitrust adjudication. AI enables courts to better render evidence-based decisions. As a tool, it is non-ideological and enables courts to minimize ideological stampeding. As a powerful new partner in making sense of the complex, dynamic, and fast-moving licensing markets many businesses operate in, courts and agencies can harness its ability to model price and innovation effects more precisely. There are challenges to implementing AI with data accountability, data availability, and data bias. These challenges can be addressed. The time to retool antitrust is now.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many antitrust stakeholders will remember 2020 as the year of its rebirth. Congressional politics, network economics, missteps on privacy, and corporate hubris converged to catalyze a profound reassessment of antitrust law. While much of the attention over excessive private power has focused on Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, it remains to be seen whether current efforts to rein them in will generate any m...

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the panel discussion, Online Advertising, Market Competition, Data and Transparency: Opportunities & Challenges for the Ads Ecosystem in Australia, from the fourth chapter of our series, Towards a Competition Enabling Framework in Asia Pacific: Opportunities & Challenges.

George SIOLIS:
Okay, well, welcome to this session on online advertising, market competition, and data and transparency, opportunities and challenges for the ads ecosystem in Australia. My name’s George Siolis. I’m a partner with RBB Economics in Melbourne, and I’m very pleased to moderate the session today. This topic is the hottest of hot topics at the moment. And in Australia it feels like we’re at ground zero with the debate. The Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019 was along with the Furman report in the UK and the Kramer report in Europe, some of the earliest forays into this area. ACCC has since launched a number of other investigations, including investigations into the EdTech sector. And it’s developed a mandatory code of conduct to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media businesses and digital platforms, specifically Google and Facebook. The ACCC is right at the forefront of the debate here.
And our job is to take you through some of the issues that have been raised by both here, but, but across the region and the world. The way we’ve constructed the session is to take...

122,"December 16, 2020",Big Tech and Antitrust: A Path Forward,"


By Matt Perault, Wall Street Journal
As the debate over big tech and antitrust intensified over the past year, certainty reigned.
On one side are those who are certain that companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies, dominant in individual markets like search, social networking, e-commerce and app stores. They are certain that mergers between companies like Facebook and Instagram reduced competition. And they’re certain that antitrust law has calcified, unable to account for new technologies. As a recent report by the House Judiciary Committee claimed, “companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups…have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.”
On the other side of the debate are those who are certain that competition is flourishing in the tech sector, with innovation yielding great products at ever-lower prices, and companies like TikTok and Snap emerging to challenge incumbents. They are certain that mergers have benefited consumers. And they’re certain that we don’t need to re-examine antitrust doctrine because it’s flexible enough to evolve with technology.
In the course of this debate, I’ve espoused my own certainties. When I worked for Facebook, it never felt like we could afford to be complacent. We faced real competitive threats. If I had shown up at a meeting and announced that Facebook didn’t compete with Google, Apple or TikTok, I would have been laughed out of the room. And I saw Facebook’s investment in developing new features for its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and improving the safety, security and infrastructure of both products. So it’s hard for me to reconcile my experience in the tech sector with the antitrust arguments now being waged against it.
But if November’s election taught us anything, it’s that our assumptions are often wrong. With polls predicting a blue-wave election that never materialized, predictions that seemed certain before the election now seem flimsy in the wake of it.

123,"December 16, 2020","A Note on Antitrust, Labor, and “No Cold Call” Agreements in Silicon Valley","

By Russell Pittman (US Department of Justice)1
 
The issue of how to provide incentives for a private firm to invest in the knowledge and capabilities of its labor force is one that has intrigued economists since at least the time of Alfred Marshall.  Marshall wrote in his Principles of Economics:
A good deal has already been said of the technical training of adults, of the decadence of the old apprenticeship system, and of the difficulty of finding anything to take its place. Here again we meet the difficulty that whoever may incur the expense of investing capital in developing the abilities of the workman, those abilities will be the property of the workman himself: and thus the virtue of those who have aided him must remain for the greater part its own reward.2
Gary Becker advanced this discussion by differentiating between “general” training – “useful in many firms in addition to the firm providing it” – and “specific” training – “training that increases productivity more in firms providing it” or, at the extreme, “has no effect on the productivity of trainees that would be useful in other firms.”3
Becker argued that firms would invest in the “general” training of their employees only if the employees absorbed the cost themselves with a contemporaneous lower wage, since otherwise competing employers could “free ride” on the expenditures of the firm providing the training by hiring away the trained workers.  On the other hand, “specific” training, having little or no value to other employers, would not raise the opportunity wage of the workers, and so the firm providing the training could expect to reap the benefits from its expenditures on training in terms of higher worker productivity in the future.
Later authors have found that firms in fact do pay for general training, and that Becker’s strong prediction otherwise rests on an assumption of perfectly operating labor markets.4  In a world of imperfect labor markets, firms seem to pay for a variety of types of worker training, including training in skills potentially useful to their competitors, seeking to discourage ex post opportunistic behavior by trained workers through a variety of behavioral and contractual devices.  Two such devices in particular seem to occur frequently and have attracted a good deal of attention by competition agencies and litigants in recent years.
The first is non-compete clauses in agreements between the employee and employer:  contractual obligations for current employees to “refrain from accepting employment in a similar line of work for a specific period in a certain geographic area.”5  A variant is a contractual obligation to refrain from soliciting existing customers or clients upon moving to a new employer, also usually for a specific period of time.
Such clauses are a common component of employment contracts in the United States, from the least skilled to the highest paid workers.  The most popular justification offered for them is the protection of the employer’s trade secrets as well as customer goodwill and relationships, but the maintenance of employer incentives for training and the development of human capital is also frequently put forth.
The record of the recent USFTC workshop on this topic suggests a number of relevant stylized facts:

Non-complete clauses are present at least as often in contracts for low-skilled, low-wage workers as for higher-paid, higher-skilled workers;
These contracts are usually “contracts of adhesion”: standardized contracts agreed to by the worker rather than the outcome of bilateral negotiations;
In the U.S., the enforceability of such contracts varies a great deal by state, including what is perceived as virtual unenforceability in California;
Even in states where they are not enforced, such contracts may be imposed on poorly informed workers and used as an effective threat if they consider leaving;
The likely result is fewer job opportunities and lower wages, particularly for workers in the lower range of skills and wages.

A variety of reform proposals have been put forward, at the FTC workshop and elsewhere, to restrict the ability of firms to impose non-compete clauses on their workers, especially in those sectors and for those workers for which trade secrets, intellectual property, and extensive training are not obviously relevant – for example, fast food franchises.6  Proposals for FTC enforcement actions include those focusing on both the antitrust and consumer protection provisions of the FTC Act.
The second device of apparently widespread use and increasing enforcement interest is anticompetitive agreements among firms competing with each other as hirers (or “buyers”) in labor markets – in particular, wage-fixing and “no-poach” agreements.  Wage fixing agreements are what they sound like – price fixing among competitors when the price fixed is the wage rate, at a particular level or within a particular range.  No-poach agreements are agreements variously not to approach, solicit, or hire the employees of competitors.7
In this case an early treatment of the issue comes from a source even older than Alfred Marshall.  In 1776, Adam Smith wrote:
We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines upon this account that masters rarely combine is as ignorant of the rule as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual price.  To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual, and one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy….8
As U.S. enforcers have come to observe and understand an apparently increasing number of anticompetitive agreements of these types, they have made the points strongly that a) the antitrust laws are as concerned with anticompetitive behavior in purchasing (monopsony) as in selling (monopoly), and, in particular, b) the antitrust laws apply to labor markets just as much as they apply to markets for other commodities.9
Box 1:  A Note on Monopsony.  Some defenders of the use of monopsony power in labor and other markets argue that monopsony, by lowering the price of the input, results in a lower price of output downstream, and thus benefits final customers.  This argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of microeconomic theory.  Upstream market power may be accompanied by either downstream competition or downstream market power.  A move to monopsony when downstream markets are competitive cannot affect downstream prices (by definition); its result is a misallocation of resources upstream, as willing suppliers choose to withdraw from this market in response to anticompetitively low prices and too little of the affected input is utilized.10  A move to monopsony by a firm with existing downstream market power results in the same upstream resource misallocation and reduction in quantity used of the affected input, and this generally translates into a downstream quantity reduction, and therefore an additional welfare loss.11
The Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals issued by the Antitrust Division and the FTC in October 2016 cites three cases brought by one or the other agency in the 1990’s against forms of wage-fixing and six cases brought by the Division since 2007 against forms of either wage-fixing or no-poach agreements.  Most recently, as noted by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim at the USDOJ’s workshop on competition issues in labor markets, the Division successfully challenged a no-poach agreement between the world’s two largest rail equipment manufacturers (U.S. v. Knorr-Bremse and Westinghouse Air Brake, 2018) and, bringing merger law into this arena, successfully challenged the proposed merger of two of the largest U.S. health care insurers, partly on the grounds of a likely increase in buying power over the reimbursement rates paid to physicians and other health-care providers (U.S. v. Anthem and Cigna, 2016).
One of the most interesting of the successful challenges to no-poach agreements came in the tech sector.
On September 24, 2010, the Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust complaint, as well as a proposed settlement, that attacked various bilateral agreements among Adobe, Apple, Google, Intuit, and Pixar not to solicit each other’s employees – “no cold calls” agreements.12  The complaint alleged agreements not to solicit each other’s “specialized computer engineers and scientists” for employment among the following firms:  Apple and Google, Apple and Adobe, Apple and Pixar, Google and Intel, and Google and Intuit.  The complaint indicated that the agreements “were created and enforced by senior executives of these companies.”  The proposed settlement “more broadly prohibits the companies from entering, maintaining or enforcing any agreement that in any way prevents any person from soliciting, cold calling, recruiting, or otherwise competing for employees.”13  The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued its Final Judgment approving the proposed settlement on March 17, 2011.
Several aspects of this case reward a closer look.
First, in its Competitive Impact Statement the Division reaffirmed that Section 1 of the Sherman Act applies to monopsonistic as well as monopolistic behavior.
There is no basis for distinguishing allocation agreements based on whether they involve input or output markets. Anticompetitive agreements in both input and output markets create allocative inefficiencies. Hence, naked restraints on cold calling customers, suppliers, or employees are similarly per se unlawful.
Second, though the complaint claimed a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, it was brought as a civil rather than a criminal allegation.  On some occasions, the Division has brought civil actions before bringing subsequent criminal actions for similar behavior.  For example, the Division’s first criminal prosecutions for price fixing among health care professionals – U.S. v. Alston (1994), against dentists in Tucson, and U.S. v. Lake Country Optometric Society (1994), against optometrists in Texas – followed earlier similar cases brought as civil enforcement actions.14  At the DOJ labor workshop, Assistant Attorney General Delrahim reaffirmed his intention to bring criminal cases for per se violations in this area going forward.
Third, again as made clear in the Competitive Impact Statement, agreements that restrict competition may under some circumstances be evaluated under the “rule of reason” rather than the per se rule.
[A]n agreement that would normally be condemned as a per se unlawful restraint on competition may nonetheless be lawful if it is ancillary to a legitimate procompetitive venture and reasonably necessary to achieve the procompetitive benefits of the collaboration. Ancillary restraints therefore are not per se unlawful, but rather evaluated under the rule of reason, which balances a restraint’s procompetitive benefits against its anticompetitive effects. To be considered “ancillary” under established antitrust law, however, the restraint must be a necessary or intrinsic part of the procompetitive collaboration. Restraints that are broader than reasonably necessary to achieve the efficiencies from a business collaboration are not ancillary and are properly treated as per se unlawful. (Citations omitted)
The Division determined that while various of the Defendant companies did indeed engage in “legitimate collaborative projects,” the no-cold-call agreements were not “tied to any specific collaboration, … narrowly tailored to the scope of any specific collaboration,” or otherwise “ancillary” to those collaborations under the antitrust laws.
Finally, because the Division brought the case under the per se rule, there was no requirement to prove that the Defendant firms individually, bilaterally, or collectively possessed market power in the hiring and employing of “specialized computer engineers and scientists,” nor to determine and demonstrate whether the geographic metes and bounds of such a product market might be local, regional, national, or worldwide, nor to demonstrate the magnitude of the anticompetitive effect alleged on workers.  A comparable rule-of-reason case would likely have required such a showing, as would a comparable provision in a merger challenge alleging harm in particular labor markets.15  A follow-on class action suit filed on behalf of 64,000 employees of the Defendant firms resulted in settlement agreements for payments of hundreds of millions of dollars to members of the class.16
As is standard with such judgments and decrees in the modern era, the Final Judgment also enumerates steps that the Defendant firms must take to ensure compliance, and establishes enforcement jurisdiction with the Court for five years.17
Returning to the question with which we began, are there ways for firms to protect their investments in training of skilled workers from the “free riding” of their competitors?  The answer appears to be yes, but within carefully defined limits.
Regarding non-compete clauses in employer-employee agreements, there remains serious debate as to what level of “training” merits protection from free riding by competitors.  Is the training provided to a high school graduate as a new fast-food employee comparable to that provided to a software engineer at a Silicon Valley firm for these purposes?  If the former is indeed worthy of such protection, is there a meaningful difference between free riding by a fellow franchisee of the same franchise and by a franchisee of a rival franchise?
Many of the enforcers, practitioners, and scholars at the FTC conference exhibited some skepticism that, as a general matter, low-skilled workers received training that qualified as a legitimate justification for employer restrictions on their mobility post-job.  On the other hand, such restrictions for highly skilled workers – all the way up to top executives – were generally considered legitimate and perhaps even desirable if set with reasonable limits.  It was emphasized both that the FTC’s jurisdiction over such agreements – in either a legal challenge or a rule-making – is untested, and that the current situation features great variation in the enforceability of such agreements among U.S. states.
Regarding wage-fixing and no-poach agreements, the law seems clearer.  “Naked” agreements among firms not to compete on wages or not to solicit each other’s employees will be treated as per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and may well result in criminal prosecution in the future.  As per se violations, they are not in general subject to defenses arguing that the benefits of such restrictions outweigh the competitive harms.  As a caveat, however, note that while trial courts have declined to dismiss per se enforcement actions, none have yet had a full trial on the merits.
Finally, if the defendants establish that the agreements are reasonably necessary to achieving efficiency-enhancing benefits of legitimate cooperative activities among the firms (such as a research joint venture), then they may be treated under the rule of reason rather than as per se violations.  In that case, the government or another plaintiff would be required to demonstrate that the firms possess power in a well-defined antitrust labor market, and, if the defendants establish a procompetitive benefit of the agreements, that the benefit could be achieved through less restrictive means or that the anticompetitive effect of the agreement outweighed any procompetitive benefit.  Similar detailed economic investigations would likely be required in a challenge to a merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act that alleged competitive harm in labor markets.

124,"December 15, 2020",How the Facebook Case Could Revitalize Our Broken Antitrust Law,"


By Chris Sagers, SLATE
For years, critics of Silicon Valley have been talking about a coming “techlash” in American antitrust law, but it’s only in recent months that we’ve seen what one looks like. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of nearly every U.S. state filed antitrust suits against Facebook, following pending cases by the Justice Department against Google (to crack its dominance in search) and by Epic Games against Apple (to break its grip on the App Store). The Facebook suits are huge and ambitious, seeking to slice off the company’s largest subsidiaries. They’re also probably the most technically important. In a few specific ways, they could revitalize the tools of a broader style of antitrust enforcement.
For a long time, government has left most of our antitrust law unused, focusing on only the narrowest kinds of misbehavior—the most serious, explicit conspiracies among separate firms. That conduct is the easiest to challenge, because our very conservative courts have made it hard to use the rest of the law, which consists mainly of a rule against anti-competitive mergers and another rule against exclusion of competitors by monopolists. You can’t do this and expect to have a working competition policy, one that protects average folks from monopolies and checks concentrated power. If the only thing you ever stop is conspiracy, firms just find other ways to squeeze the same money out of people’s wallets.
The long, detailed Facebook complaints tell a very compelling story of anti-competitive animus and abuse, documented with a rich collection of internal communications, including many damaging admissions by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company’s second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, as well as dozens of other juicy zingers that would make any defense attorney impulsively clench. One Facebook engineer, in an email quoted in the complaint, wrote that the company’s abuses of smaller tech firms “just makes me feel like a bad person.”
The case focuses on two theories of liability that have been gathering dust for decades: “nonhorizontal mergers” and “unilateral refusals to deal.” The revitalization of either would be very desirable for the law.
American law has come to view one firm buying another as essentially never a concern unless they compete “horizontally”—that is, they currently sell the same goods to the same customers. The acquisitions that make up the primary challenge in the Facebook suits—Facebook’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp—were not horizontal, or at least they didn’t look like it at the time. But they were neutralizations of nascent, developing threats. The law’s decadeslong indifference to such deals is coming to seem like a major mistake, not just in Silicon Valley but throughout the economy.

126,"December 15, 2020",Jeff Rosen To Become Acting US Attorney General,"


The investigator leading the US Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google will become the nation’s acting attorney general, President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday, December 14. Deputy AG Jeff Rosen will assume the top job at the Department after AG Bill Barr submitted his resignation on Monday, reported CNET.
Rosen will take over on December 23, but his time at the helm will likely be short-lived. President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on January 20, will appoint his own attorney general. 
In October, the Justice Department filed a landmark case against Google, accusing the tech giant of monopolies in search and search advertising. 
“As the antitrust complaint filed today explains, [Google] has maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary practices that are harmful to competition,” Rosen told reporters at the time. “If the government does not enforce the antitrust laws to enable competition, we could lose the next wave of innovation. If that happens, Americans may never get to see the next Google.”
The lawsuit alleges that Google broke antitrust law by cutting deals with phone makers like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine on their devices, a move that boxed out competitors. Google has also been accused of taking advantage of the dominance of its Android operating system to pressure device makers into preloading its apps on phones powered by the software.

Hwang LEE:
How are you? I’m very happy to moderate this interesting session. First of all, I’d like to thank CPI and staff for organizing this wonderful event. Today we are going to discuss the topic about the future of mobile ecosystems, the dominance of market players, and customers in Korea. The world entered the Mobile Era with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Growth has been made since in all fields of both hardware and software. Many participants, such as app developers, mobile service providers, and end consumers, have been forming our mobile ecosystems. Such mobile ecosystems have provided more opportunities for businesses, as well as more choices to consumers. All these have been possible through more innovations, which in turn, have led to more innovations The reason that made such win-win situations possible is because the dynamic competition mechanism was driving the market However, lately, many are pointing out that the overall speed of such innovations and changes is slowing down. These voices of criticism manifest themselves as many legal conflicts or executions of competition laws against the major mobile business entities such as Google ...

Tech giants could face fines as high as 10% of annual revenue if they don’t comply with new European Union rules on data usage to be unveiled Tuesday, December 15, according to Bloomberg News.
Companies that could include Google, Amazon, and Apple will be banned from using any data from business users to compete with them or from treating their own services more favorably in rankings, among other obligations.
A company that “systemically infringes” the obligations could face orders by the European Commission to make behavioral and structural changes, such as divesting businesses. Companies will be considered to be in systemic non-compliance if the EU has issued at least three fines within a period of five years.
The rules are still in draft form and could be subject to revisions. A spokesperson from the European Union declined to comment. 
The gatekeeper regulation is part of a wider package of tech policies due to be unveiled on December 15. The EU will also propose separate rules that will force greater responsibility on platforms for what users post on their sites, threatening fines as high as 6% of global revenue for very large social media platforms if they don’t comply with orders to remove terror propaganda or other illegal posts.

Aditya BHATTACHARJEA:
Good evening, good morning, or good afternoon, depending on where you are when you are hearing this. It is my very great privilege to be moderating this extremely distinguished panel to discuss the competition issues related to the mobile ecosystem, especially with reference to India. The topic is very vast. As I understand it, the mobile ecosystem at its core consists of manufacturers of mobile devices, the semiconductors that go into them, the telecom or internet service providers that provide the access to the net, the developers of operating systems and the app stores that are embedded in these devices, the app developers who place their apps in the app stores into those devices. That is the core of the mobile ecosystem.
But of course, it is that ecosystem that gives us all access to the myriad services that we avail of from these devices. And especially in the last six months, we have learned the hard way how dependent we are on that little device which so far was just a convenience for chatting or for occasional transactions. We have really come to depend on this access for our daily needs, more or less. E-commerce social media, of course, pay...

130,"December 14, 2020",Rebooting Digital Market Power,"

By David Teece & Henry Kahwaty1
 
I. Introduction
The European Commission is considering legislative proposals to address the perceived market power of online platforms. The proposals include the use of ex ante rules to require certain conduct and prohibit various other types of conduct without an assessment of the effects on consumer or overall welfare in any specific case. The assumption is that large firms have market power, and this market power causes anticompetitive outcomes. Competition policy – and government policy more broadly – are often based on a static view of industries and markets – a snapshot in time – rather than being viewed as part of a dynamically evolving ecosystem. This applies to the Digital Markets Act currently under consideration and the proposed ex ante remedies.
Under a static view of an industry or model of a market, the technologies available to firms are fixed or given, and rivals make decisions on price and/or innovation investment when deciding how to compete in the narrowly circumscribed “product market.” Future innovation driven changes in markets, or possibly even market redefining innovations and the potential development of entirely new markets, play only a peripheral role in the analysis. This analytical frame of reference may be sufficient in some markets or industries where market opportunities depend on competitors’ size, or where innovation capabilities are limited, but in digital industries, adopting a static frame of reference misses key dimensions of competition.
There is a great deal of focus now on adapting competition policy to the digital economy, and the Digital Markets Act under consideration is one possible approach. Standard and familiar tools, developed over decades, are used to analyze competition in industrial and other markets, and are also commonly applied directly to the digital economy to diagnose concerns and prescribe interventions. But this approach risks missing the fundamental nature of digitally enabled competition. In the digital economy, while static competition may drive incremental innovation, it is the threat and potential for market redefining innovation that drives dynamic competition.
 
II. Dynamic Competition
Dynamic competition is fierce rivalry between firms to develop new products or services, new means of delivering services to consumers, new business models to combine assets in different ways, and new production techniques.2 This innovation competition can come directly or indirectly from entities active in an industry or in an adjacent one, and it can also come from entirely unexpected entrants, including new businesses.
Innovation competition is critical to economic performance because it drives productivity growth and economic value creation. Examples of this include the development of vaccines in medicine and the development of refrigeration for food storage in the house and during transportation. Magnetic resonance imaging both substituted for and complemented decades old x-rays. Jet airplanes substituted for and complemented propeller airplanes, both internal combustion and gas turbines. 5G mobile wireless is a step function improvement over 4G/LTE.
Innovation can be incremental or fundamental and radical, leading to entirely new categories of products or services, new and better business models, or new production techniques. Disruptive innovation can have large effects on markets and the products and services available to consumers and can be driven by existing firms or new entrants.
Netflix, for example, disrupted the creation and distribution of video content to consumers in numerous countries. It started in the 1990s as a mail-order service for DVD rentals. Consumers would order DVDs that they would receive by mail and then return through the mail after viewing. As a new entrant, its business model disrupted the video rental stores that occupied local street corners at the time. It now has about 200 million subscribers streaming content in 190 countries around the world and has dramatically changed video distribution and related markets – disrupting the businesses of large cable television providers and even affecting the theatrical exhibition of new, feature-length films.
 
III. The Digital Economy
The digital economy is very dynamic, and this dynamism is driven by the creation of the internet and the developments in microprocessors, memory, and optical fiber. Digital businesses have developed new products and services and developed new ways of delivering services to consumers, often through the use of new business models. Think of the feature rich communication services offered by apps on a cell phone, including arranging accommodations via Airbnb, ride-hailing via Lyft, food delivery via Deliveroo, or playing music via Spotify. By bypassing traditional channels and leveraging technological innovations, the digital economy has grown the overall productive capacity of the economy.
Leading businesses and new digital entrants compete with each other in a myriad of ways, leading to dynamic competition with various entities trying to out-innovate each other. Virtual (personal) assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana are pushing the boundaries of search. Sony, Facebook, and Microsoft are pushing the boundaries of Virtual Reality. Apple now challenges Intel in microprocessors and outpaces all of Switzerland in timepieces.3 Netflix rivals most of Hollywood in terms of both audience and content.4
Innovators, however, need not be large businesses, and disruptions can come from entrants that start with no scale in the market. As the Netflix example shows, size is no protection from competition in digitally enabled markets. Successful businesses in digital commerce need to maintain their innovative activity or they will be overtaken by other, more nimble and creative rivals.
 
IV. Competition Policy Tools and Dynamic Settings
A fundamental concept in competition law and economics is market power. How do you measure market power in the digital economy? Standard measures like mark-ups over cost have little meaning when services are offered to consumers for free, and market shares may have little meaning in dynamic settings. Market shares are often based on revenue, but revenue-based market shares are not informative when services are provided for free or in exchange for data. If competition is driven by rivalry among ecosystems, such as Android and Apple’s iOS together with the hardware, software, and services from many businesses that are associated with them, defining markets around a component of an ecosystem and calculating market shares for that component would miss much of the vibrancy of the competition between the ecosystems.5
In the merger context, for example, market shares need to be forward-looking because the analysis is usually about predicting the effects of a potential transaction in the future.6 Market shares that are snapshots of the present or compilations of the past are often assessed in the light of future projections and the competitive constraints arising from rivals, including any “mavericks” currently active in the market. Such projections may not mean much in digital markets when innovation is on-going and entry can come not only from adjacent markets but also from other areas entirely.
Before you can assess market shares, you need to know “shares of what”? Markets are defined as a tool to assist with the assessment of market power. They should capture the nature of the competitive situation facing businesses.7 Competition analysis typically views suppliers offering similar or identical products as being close competitors that place constraints on each other, and markets are defined around the supplies of these similar products or services. But if a fundamental driver of competition in the digital economy is innovation to offer new, potentially market redefining services, tools designed to define markets for industrial products will miss this core element of competition, especially if innovation may come from a range of different sources. A market defined in a manner that does not take primary methods of competition into account can no longer meaningfully inform competition enforcement or public policy.
Proposed new policy frameworks include abandoning measures of market power and instead focusing on size, with policy interventions targeted at the largest digital platforms because bigger platforms are viewed as wielding disproportionately more power in markets characterized by network effects and ‘winner-takes-all/most’ competitive dynamics. Competition law and economics has long recognized, however, that while size may be easy to measure, large firms can lack market power or face significant competition. One must remember that market power, not size, is a gating characteristic for successful market intervention. With vibrant dynamic competition, even a “winner-take-all/most” outcome is only temporary as entities look for means to develop better, more convenient, or higher value offerings for consumers, while seeking to displace the incumbent platforms (even if these platforms are “large” as measured by the number of users or some other metric).
In the absence of meaningful measures of market power, analysis should focus on traditional antitrust concepts based on evaluating the core competitive capabilities of the firm or firms involved and determining how scarce these resources are. In manufacturing, the key assets may be specific types of production facilities, and these may be few in number and difficult to replicate. This approach could be applied to the digital economy. It is conceivable that there are impossible to replicate advantages; where these are found, they are usually due to some form of government restriction.
Market power held by players in the digital economy due to their prior dynamic capabilities and strategic investments are not inherently objectionable, in the same way that a government granted exclusivity on patented technology is not objectionable. The rewards to successful innovation are what incentivizes innovative efforts, which benefits inventors, drives productivity growth, and develops and expands the broader economy. The policy question is whether there are barriers to dynamic competition, and, if so, what are they?
The key strategic assets and competitive strengths in the digital economy are the features that drive dynamic capabilities and investments in innovation: access to data scientists and programmers, deep R&D capabilities, creativity, an innovation culture, visionary management, willingness to adopt innovative business models,8 and a supportive policy and investment environment more generally. While the mix of assets and the strategic vision and other factors differ across firms, these assets are not bottlenecks in the traditional antitrust sense.
 
V. Conclusion
Innovation is critical for economic advancement and growth and is the key handmaiden of competition in the digital economy. While the proposals under consideration may on the surface appear to be targeting the market power of “gatekeeper” platforms, by failing to take into account the dynamic nature of the digital economy and the competition that flows from innovation, these proposals may instead serve only to limit the potential for future disruptive innovation and dynamic competition in the European economy. It would be tragic and ironic if the European authorities were to cripple innovation and competition in the name of advancing them. More static competition but less dynamic competition means anemic competition overall, less innovation, reduced productivity growth, lower wages, and lower growth in the overall economy. The risk of mistakes is high when the competitive dynamics of the digital economy at issue are poorly or only partially understood.

Hyundai has agreed to buy an 80% stake in robot maker Boston Dynamics from SoftBank, the South Korean automaker announced on Friday, December 11. The deal values the robot firm at US$1.1 billion, Hyundai said, suggesting it offered US$880 million for the 80% stake.
Boston Dynamics is best known for its robot dog, Spot, which went viral.
Hyundai can leverage robot technology to expand automation at its unionized car factories, as well as design autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars, drones, and delivery robots, reported The Financial Times.
Google bought Boston Dynamics, a pioneer in mechanical robotics that originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in late 2013, and later sold it to SoftBank in 2017.  
At the time, SoftBank agreed to buy Boston Dynamics as well as Japanese robotics group Schaft in a deal valued at more than US$100 million.

132,"December 10, 2020",Vertical Restraints in a Digital World,"
The subject of vertical restraints is well-trod territory in antitrust. Most of the cases, and economic literature, have focused, however, on the physical world of manufacturers and distributors. This paper considers what’s new and different about the digital world that matters for the antitrust analysis of vertical restraints. Cases and economic learning from the physical world remain highly relevant. What makes the digital world different is the prominence of intermediaries, most of which are multisided platforms, and the implications of the Internet and other information technologies for these intermediaries and the businesses that rely on them. After describing key features — including critical mass, multi-homing, and platform governance regimes — this paper considers important aspects of analyzing vertical restraints in the digital world. It then considers several applications involving platform rules, exclusive contracts, and MFNs for digital intermediaries.

133,"December 10, 2020",Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,"


By Jennifer Newstead (Vice President & General Counsel, Facebook)
Billions of people use Facebook’s products every day. To earn their time and attention, we compete fiercely against many other services across the world. As the internet has grown over the last 25 years, the ways in which people share and communicate have exploded thanks to dynamic competition. The most successful platforms mature and adapt to people’s changing preferences. Our products became and remain popular for this very reason — we constantly evolve, innovate and invest in better experiences for people against world-class competitors like Apple, Google, Twitter, Snap, Amazon, TikTok and Microsoft. We innovate and improve constantly because we have to.  
We provide many ways to communicate, share and connect — with people, businesses, news and entertainment. We also help millions of businesses reach and engage with their customers. More than 200 million businesses use our free tools and services to connect with customers, hire new employees and grow their businesses. Most of our advertisers are small businesses, many of whom have benefitted by moving online to reach their customers during the pandemic.   
The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general today attack two acquisitions that we made: Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. These transactions were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did. Both of these acquisitions were reviewed by relevant antitrust regulators at the time. The FTC conducted an in-depth “Second Request” of the Instagram transaction in 2012 before voting unanimously to clear it. The European Commission reviewed the WhatsApp transaction in 2014 and found no risk of harm to competition in any potential market. Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward because they did not threaten competition. 
Now, many years later, with seemingly no regard for settled law or the consequences to innovation and investment, the agency is saying it got it wrong and wants a do-over. In addition to being revisionist history, this is simply not how the antitrust laws are supposed to work. No American antitrust enforcer has ever brought a case like this before, and for good reason. The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today. And, notably, two FTC commissioners voted against the action that the FTC has taken today.  
Now the agency has announced that no sale will ever be final, no matter the resulting harm to consumers or the chilling effect on innovation. When we acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, we believed these companies would be a great benefit to our Facebook users and that we could help transform them into something even better. And we did. This lawsuit risks sowing doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s own merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the legal process. It would also punish companies for protecting their investment and technology from free-riding by those who did not pay for the innovation, making those companies less likely over the long term to make their platforms available to spur the growth of new products and services.

134,"December 9, 2020",FTC & 46 States Hit Facebook With Antitrust Suits,"


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and more than 40 states accused Facebook on Wednesday, December 9, of becoming a social media monopoly by buying up its rivals to illegally kill competition, reported Bloomberg.
Federal and state regulators, which have been investigating the company for over 18 months, stated in separate lawsuits that Facebook’s purchases, especially Instagram for US$1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for US$19 billion two years later, eliminated competition that could have one day challenged the company’s dominance.
The FTC’s case is its most ambitious in recent memory and it seeks to unwind Facebook’s prior acquisitions of the photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, reported the Wall Street Journal. It comes just weeks after the Justice Department brought an antitrust lawsuit targeting Google’s flagship search engine business. Each federal agency now has its own once-in-a-generation case at the same time, a signal of the level of US concern about the power of dominant online platforms.
The suits come roughly 14 months after New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office was leading a group of attorneys general in investigating Facebook for potential anticompetitive practices. More than 40 attorneys general ultimately signed onto Wednesday’s complaint. The FTC, meanwhile, has been conducting its own antitrust investigation of Facebook since June 2019.
“For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,” said Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into the company’s in parallel with the federal agency.
The lawsuits, filed in the US District Court of the District of Columbia, underscore the growing bipartisan and international tsunami against Big Tech. Lawmakers and regulators have zeroed in on the grip that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple maintain on commerce, electronics, social networking, search and online advertising, remaking the nation’s economy. President Trump has argued repeatedly that the tech giants have too much power and influence, and allies of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. have made similar complaints.

Federal and state antitrust regulators could file lawsuits against Facebook very soon, Bloomberg reported on Monday, December 7, citing sources.
The social media giant could be accused of stifling rivals by taking advantage of its own powerful position, the sources said, per Bloomberg.
Lawsuits could be filed this week on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a group of state attorneys general led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to the sources. The sources further told Bloomberg that on the state level, new lawsuits are being planned against Google and could be filed in the coming weeks.
The Google case will be up to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration to advance. The Facebook case will be handled by the next FTC chairman, unless the present chair Joe Simons, appointed by Trump, stays on with the agency, according to the Bloomberg report.
The upcoming lawsuits are expected to target Facebook’s reported antitrust violations. Two of the main complaints were from startup investors, privacy activists and antitrust experts following Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram for US$1 billion, and its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp for US$22 billion. Simons has said antitrust enforcers should watch for bigger firms acquiring emerging startups in their same fields.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is completing regulatory plans outlining how online platforms should remove illegal content quickly and refrain from using their power to quash rivals or push their own products on their sites. The Commission plans sanctions for violators that include fines and possible separation of assets, according to people familiar with the matter.
Under the plans, the bigger and more influential a company, based on criteria including market share and revenue, the more obligations it will shoulder. The rules, though not targeting any specific company, are likely to apply to US tech companies including Alphabet ’s Google, Facebook, and Amazon, according to EU officials.

138,"December 3, 2020","Arbitration Over Competition – The Strange Case of Amazon, Reliance, and Future Retail","
By Subhomoy Bhattacharjee1
 
Strangely while the battle between Reliance Industries (“RIL”) and Amazon India (“Amazon”) for market share in the business-to-business segment of the Indian retail market should be fit for the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) to decide, it has transmogrified into an arbitration battle instead.
When it comes to adjudicating competition in the Indian retail business, forums other than the competition regulator seem to take center stage. Amazon had earlier lost the business-to-consumer market due to the FDI policy prohibiting an inventory-based e-commerce model for foreign corporations.2 Now the acquisition of Future group’s retail business by Reliance has been challenged by Amazon by virtue of the latter’s holding rights in Future group. In the process it could drag the Government of India into the fray. Yet it is prima facie a struggle to decide who gains primacy in the Indian retail market estimated to reach $1.6 trillion by 2025 and especially its fastest growing segment, that of online business, currently at less than 10 percent of the market.3
On Friday, November 20, the Competition Commission of India tweeted it has approved the takeover of Future Group by two RIL entities.4 Yet this approval means relatively nothing to the stakes between India’s largest company by market capitalization and Amazon. The regulator’s subsequent press note said its detailed order will follow soon.5
 
A Competition Issue but not with CCI:
In January 2019, Amazon had invested a 49 percent share in Future Group company, named Future Coupons for Rs 1,431 crore. As part of the agreement, Amazon had been granted a call option. This option allows Amazon to acquire all or part of the promoters’ shareholding in Future Retail and can be exercised in three or ten years. So, in August this year, when RIL’s two entities bought for Rs 25,000 crore six companies, namely Future Retail, Future Lifestyle Fashions, Future Consumer, Future Supply Chains and Future Market Networks in a slump sale, all of which will be merged into one company, Future Enterprises Limited (“FEL”), Amazon had challenged it. It has argued the sale has denied it the Rights of First Refusal for the deal with Future Group.
Yet Amazon has not challenged the RIL/Future deal in the competition regulator’s court, it has decided to challenge it as an arbitration issue. The competition question is therefore left simmering. The Competition Commission of India’s press release has ruled that RIL entities Reliance Retail Ventures Limited and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited have its permission to acquire the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses of Future Group. The RIL entities, in their notice to the Commission for approving the acquisition, had clearly stated the market where the combined entity shall operate is the one for business-to-business sales in India. It is the same market where Amazon also has got the license to operate. The stakes are massive as the B2B segment is reckoned to be six times bigger than the consumer facing retail stores business within the overall retail pie.6 “I suspect the regulator has differentiated between the brick and mortar market and the online market to draw its conclusion that there shall be no dominance by the RIL-Future Group deals,” said Mandar Kagade, Principal, Black Dot Public Policy Advisors.
In September, the Commission had cleared Amazon of charges of alleged abuse of dominance brought on behalf of apparel company Beverly Hills and Polo Club, which could be the reason the company has not tried to block the RIL deal there.7 The CCI order had noted both Amazon and Flipkart have a market share of around 35 percent each in this market so there is no abuse of dominance. But at the same time, the competition regulator has launched an investigation against the Jeff Bezos owned company for an antitrust claim brought by more than one Indian sellers’ organizations. Each of them has made similar charges. They allege Amazon offers preferential treatment to some sellers as well as indulges in predatory pricing. The Karnataka High Court has stayed the regulator’s hands but then again, the Supreme Court in late October has asked for the stay to be decided upon either way, within six weeks.
Clearly Amazon’s legal teams also feel they have more chance to block the deal through the arbitration courts. To what extent does this speak about the efficiency of the CCI is a debatable point. Amazon may have been able to argue (hypothetically) that there is a loss of competition in the economy against war RIL has claimed.
But to adjudicate better on the issue, the regulator possibly needed to examine the deal from the consumers point of view. In other words, has there been any welfare loss for the economy? But the Commission has not been often able to make this focus clear. It has instead chased market share as an evidence of anti-competitive behavior as it has done in the case of Google. Geeta Gouri, former member of the Commission says the regulator must decide from the principle of what benefits the consumer the most. “The Commission frames the questions from the point of view of market share but the centrality of the interest of the consumer is often missed. Mainly because they do not define who is the consumer.”
 
Implications for the Government of India
The battle has therefore moved on to a challenge in arbitration forums. This has implications for the government of India and will therefore not go down just as a commercial battle between the domestic and foreign retail giants. It is because of India’s uncomfortable position vis a vis such awards handed out by foreign courts. This has happened twice this year. In September, Vodafone International Holdings won an arbitration award at The Hague arbitration center against the Indian government against a retrospective taxation demand. Now, Amazon has secured an interim order from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to block the deal between Future Retail and RIL entity Reliance Retail Ventures. Amazon has claimed it was denied the Rights of First Refusal for the deal with Future Group.
At first blush, these do not seem to offer any common ground. The Vodafone award challenged a government’s tax policy, the Amazon-RIL case is a commercial dispute. Yet it turns out, there are massive similarities.
New Delhi operates under its domestic Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1995, which it has subsequently revised in 2015 and then last year. While India aspires to become an international arbitration venue it has not been able to reconcile the domestic act with the global architecture of arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) convention to which more than 150 countries are signatories.
India is instead a member of the softer UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) convention on arbitration or what is known as the New York Convention. Here too, India has signed on with caveats. The most important of those is that arbitration awards will only apply where the disputes are plainly considered as commercial under domestic law and does not challenge India’s “public policy.” For instance, India does not recognize the relationship between tax department and assesses as a commercial relation. Courts in India have also upheld this logic though of late, the Supreme Court has tried to soften this logic.8
As a result, companies have found this an excellent loophole to exploit. Even Bibek Debroy, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and who has often advised the government on clearing India’s legal mess, has noted this problem. “Challenging arbitral awards on grounds of public policy has become an Achilles heel for arbitration in India: a means by which losing parties can attack arbitral awards, on much broader grounds than are permitted in other countries”.9 His observation comes in a paper he coauthored for Niti Aayog to help build India’s credentials as an arbitration center.10 He also points to other problems, chief among them being the lack of clarity of the financial model on which such a centre shall operate and whether there should be one or more spread across the country.
Future Group has used this cover of public policy to buttress its proposed Rs 27,000 crore deal with the RIL entity. The brick and mortar retail group has argued in the Delhi High Court that the interim order by the Emergency Arbitration, constituted under the SIAC Rules, was passed without jurisdiction. The key word the company has used is that the award is alien to India’s Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1995. Whereas armed with the order from Singapore Amazon has also brought in the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange asking them to consider the interim order before they approve the deal between Future Retail and Reliance Retail Ventures.11
Amazon has been rather astute in getting a Singapore arbitration award. The island nation is the only one with whom India has a mutually recognized arbitration route. It was signed as part of the India Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2005. It also helped that both the Future Group and Amazon had written in the role of Singapore as the seat to resolve any dispute. But under the way arbitration game occurs across countries, it was open for Amazon to have approached any other arbitration forums too, like those in The Hague, London, or Paris.
The single judge bench of the Delhi High Court shall soon give its judgment on the dispute. Any recognition of the emergency arbitration by the bench could end up deciding if Vodafone International, among others can claim its victory in an off-shore arbitration award shall also be recognized in India. Gouri says the questions thrown up by the arbitration case are salient to decide what sort of money India gets from the world markets.
Either way this could be one of the most profound judgments with cascading impact on India’s treatment of foreign investors. Because of India’s iffy legal treatment of foreign inflow most portfolio investors prefer Singapore as the seat from where to invest into India. Any move by the government to retract any aspect of this arrangement has been resisted by them. This year itself finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had to change the tax laws to recognize that FPIs organized as trusts will pay only 15 percent tax on their dividend income against a proposed 25 to 37 percent range. Domestic investment trusts do not get this advantage. The walk back happened this year when government could use any additional money. It is the price India pays for keeping its arbitration laws disconnected from global best practices. How RIL-Amazon dispute shapes up could therefore be of far more significance than it already is.

139,"December 2, 2020",US States Led By New York To Sue Facebook Next Week,"


A group of US states led by New York is investigating Facebook for possible antitrust violations and plans to file a lawsuit against the social media giant next week, reported Reuters.
The complaint would be the second major lawsuit filed against a Big Tech company this year. The Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc’s Google in October.
More than 40 states plan to sign on to the lawsuit, one source said, without naming them.It is not known what the states plan to include in their complaint. One allegation often made against Facebook is that it has strategically sought to buy small potential rivals, often at a big premium. These include Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

On Monday, November 30, in a letter, president elect Joe Biden was urged to reject the influence of Big Tech companies on his administration by 32 antitrust, consumer advocacy, labor, and related groups.
Biden’s transition team contains more tech executives than those opposed to tech influences, Reuters reported. That, to analysts, could indicate the kinds of thoughts that will influence his presidency.
The letter from the consumer advocates urged the incoming administration to exclude executives, lobbyists, and consultants who have been affiliated with Big Tech, including companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, or Microsoft. According to the letter, those companies’ practices have generally hurt the American consumer.
“We believe that eliminating the decades-old revolving door between Silicon Valley and your administration will only help your cause,” the letter stated, according to Reuters.
The letter also stated that the new administration “must confront the threats posed by the monopolistic Big Tech companies. … however, we can only bring these companies to account if you do not rely on affiliates of these very companies to make up your government,” according to Reuters.
Signatories include Public Citizen, American Economic Liberties Project, Open Markets Institute, Progressive Democrats of America, the Revolving Door Project, and Athena.

141,"December 1, 2020",Big Tech Platforms and Schumpeter’s Creative Destruction,"
By: Nicolas Petit (Pro Market)
In antitrust policy circles, Joseph Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” theory is often mentioned but seldom listened to. The Schumpeterian neglect is understandable, but unfortunate. [Understandable, because the historical record of the economy involves mostly incremental/imitative entrants rather than the radical breakthroughs associated with creative destruction (Teece, 2018).]
My recent book Big Tech and the Digital Economy: The Moligopoly Scenario sheds light on how Schumpeter’s insights give us a useful model of “indirect entry” that fits the tendencies of competition in digital industries. Schumpeter considered that the main source of economic competition is wrought by product differentiation, complements, or new combinations, not by imitation, replication, and substitution of existing products. He colorfully stressed that this is as powerful “as bombardment is in forcing a door” (Teece, 2020).
The issue matters because the theory of government regulation of industry operates on a different assumption. The main source of competition that keeps markets free and competitive comes from entry of substitute products. And a suspicion of anticompetitive conduct by incumbents or of structural market failure arises when direct entry is not observed. The recent US antitrust charges against Google bring a good example. The engine of the case against Google brought by the Department of Justice is that by purpose or effect, Google’s payments to Apple and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for pre-installation restricted the entry of rival search engines like DuckDuckGo.
But when the Schumpeterian model of “indirect entry” is added to standard assumptions and suspicions, a refined policy emerges. The prescription is neither less nor more Government intervention, but a different one. To see this, let us consider first models of indirect entry (1) and why they suit digital industries (2), explore high-level implications for policymaking (3), and discuss concrete illustrations by looking at two ongoing cases against big tech firms (4)….

By: Alison Jones (Le Concurrentialiste)
Introduction
Competition agencies across the world are facing pressure to deal with an ever-expanding set of concerns. For example, many are being urged to do something about increasing consolidation and concentration in markets, to do something about the conduct of leading firms, especially those operating in the digital economy such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (GAFA), to tackle ‘excessive’ prices charged in the healthcare and technology sectors and ‘collusion’ facilitated by algorithms, to ensure that their policies and enforcement priorities protect consumers and address sustainability issues and inequalities in society (including those arising from race and gender), and to consider how competition law should react to, and analyse, market adjustments that are occurring as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
These matters, many of which have been discussed in previous Concurrentialiste guest articles, are requiring competition authorities, legislators, policy-makers, antitrust practitioners, and academics to think deeply about a growing number of broad questions, including whether current competition laws are capable of reaching, or can be adapted to reach, all of the competition issues arising (especially in the digital economy), whether adjustments or amendments to antitrust laws are required, how antitrust policies should interface with other public policy objectives or whether competition laws need to be expanded to encompass a more egalitarian set of goals, and/or whether additional mechanisms including regulation or new market investigation tools are required to deal with the myriad of complex issues arising. Indeed, across the world, these discussions have sparked a proliferation of papers, investigations, inquiries, reports, and consultation processes debating whether, and if so how, competition law and policy should adapt. The complex issues and the mixed effects of much of the conduct under scrutiny, are understandably challenging policymakers and competition agencies and inevitably consuming much of the latter’s time, energy, and resources.
This short paper, however, seeks to serve as a reminder that competition agencies should not allow this plethora of important and taxing matters to distract them unduly from one of their other core missions – the detection, punishment, and deterrence of cartel activity (anticompetitive arrangements between competitors to fix prices, restrict output, to share or divide markets, or to rig bids), described in 2004 by the US Supreme Court as the ‘supreme evil’ of antitrust (see Trinko). Indeed, my recent research (with Robert Anderson, Professor William Kovacic, and Professor Caio Mario da Silva Pereira Neto) suggests that if competition agencies ensure that some of these resources are preserved for, and dedicated to, the fight against cartel activity, bid-rigging or collusive tendering, impacting on public procurement processes (the public purchasing of essential goods, services, and works), they can combat conduct which not only harms consumer welfare but which, in many cases, also produces much broader harm to a nation and its citizens, especially the more vulnerable and those most reliant on the public services procured…

143,"November 29, 2020",EU’s Brenton: Big Tech That Break New Rules Face Fines,"


Thierry Breton, EU’s digital chief, says tech giants breaking the bloc’s new rules could face fines or more severe punishments like breaking up their European businesses, Reuters reported.
Breton is set to present the draft rules, called the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The new rules could affect major players including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
Under the DSA, companies will have to explain how their algorithms work, open up advertising archives for regulators and researchers, as well as do more to fight hate speech, damaging content, and fake products on their platforms. And the DMA will target online gatekeepers for new requirements such as sharing some kinds of data with rivals and regulators, and outlaw other practices such as favoring their own services over others’ products, along with sanctions, according to Reuters.
“We start with a fine, then you have a bigger fine, then you may have a temporary remedy, specific remedies, then you may have at the end of the day, what we have also in the competition rules, structural separation,” Breton said per reports, adding that breaking up a company would be the last resort.
Breton said the separation was “not an objective” of the rules and that it was just supposed to be an option in the case that it would be needed.
The laws are still only proposed for now, though, and will have to be approved after negotiations between The European Commission, the EU countries, and the European Parliament, Reuters reported.

144,"November 29, 2020","For Big Tech, Biden brings a new era but no ease in scrutiny","
By Dr. Robert Epstein (American Institute for Behavioral Research &Technology) 
The Obama-Biden administration was a charmed era for America’s tech companies — a moment when they were lionized as innovators, hailed as job creators and largely left alone.
Now Joe Biden is coming back, this time as president. But times have changed. The halcyon days of an adoring Washington are unlikely to return when Biden takes the oath of office in January, with mounting legislative and regulatory challenges to the industry — including stronger enforcement of antitrust laws — nearly certain to outlast the tenure of President Donald Trump.
“The techlash is in full force,” said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.
In the years since Barack Obama and Biden left the White House, the tech industry’s political fortunes have flipped. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have come under scrutiny from Congress, federal regulators, state attorneys general and European authorities. Twitter has found itself in frequent run-ins with lawmakers over its policies for moderating content on its platform. And companies have seen their political support in Congress erode.

The UK government is setting up a watchdog to “oversee a pro-competition regime for platforms including those funded by digital advertising, such as Google and Facebook”. A dedicated Digital Markets Unit (DMU), under the wing of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will work closely with Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to introduce and enforce the new code.
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it plans to create a Digital Markets Unit (DMU) to enforce “a new code to govern the behavior of platforms that currently dominate the market, such as Google and Facebook.”
The code is designed to ensure that consumers, small businesses, and news publishers aren’t disadvantaged by actions taken by tech giants, the government said.
Under the new code, some of the world’s biggest tech companies may have to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they use consumers’ data. They may also be forced to give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalized advertising, and they won’t be able to place restrictions on customers that make it difficult for them to use rival platforms. 
The DMU, which will be part of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will start work in April 2021.

Data portability (the ability to transfer data without affecting its content) and interoperability (the ability to integrate two or more datasets) significantly affect the use of data, with important implications for antitrust policy. Allowing for improved data portability can facilitate the ability of consumers to switch services, which would substantially increase competition. However, barriers to data portability can increase market power and be a major source of social inefficiency. This paper lays out the pros and cons of a move towards requirements of data interoperability and portability. Of further note is the need to account for the fact that increasing the scale and scope of data analysis can create negative externalities in the form of better profiling, increased harms to privacy, and cybersecurity risks.

Data portability is attracting attention, especially due to recent portability laws in Europe and California, and the hope that it can reduce the market power of digital platforms. This article discusses the potential pro-competitive and other benefits of new data portability requirements, including for lock-in effects, network effects, and barriers to entry. There are significant risks and costs from mandating portability, including privacy and cybersecurity risks if individuals’ personal data is not carefully protected. The discussion applies the framework of the Portability and Other Required Transfers Impact Assessment (“PORT-IA”) to antitrust law. The PORT-IA provides a structured set of relevant questions, to assist legislators, regulators, enforcement officials, and others to evaluate whether proposed mandatory data sharing is likely to be net beneficial. The article concludes with analysis of how the PORT-IA may appropriately be included in merger review, enforcement discretion, fashioning of remedies and other aspects of antitrust law.

Data portability has become a hot topic in competition law. Although some commentators have suggested that data portability represents low hanging fruit compared with more complex remedies such as interoperability, the debate about how to implement any such mandate, presumably under the essential facilities doctrine, remains underdeveloped. Key issues that remain unresolved include the impact of the distinction between structure and unstructured data on essentiality, the significance of regulatory regimes that can provide access to data, the tension between portability and privacy, and the difficulties associated with ordering, provisioning, compatibility, and standardization of data. Closer examination of these challenges reveals that data portability is not a panacea and that enforcement officials will have engage in the type of nuanced, fact-specific determinations that characterize classic antitrust analysis and the implicit limitations of the essential facilities doctrine.

Data portability has a hybrid nature. What emerged as a data protection concept is now also becoming part of policies aiming to stimulate competition and innovation. To reap the full benefits of data portability, this article argues that there is a need for regulators to steer its implementation and to provide guidance on how data controllers should handle tensions between different interests and overlapping legal entitlements. Data portability can empower individuals and business users to make better choices but more asymmetric enforcement is needed to ensure that data portability will stimulate competition. And as a tool to promote data-driven innovation, data portability is a necessary but probably not a sufficient condition to keep data-driven markets open to newcomers.

Mandatory access to digital platforms’ data is one of the remedies proposed to address potential failures in digital markets. In addition to the high costs of implementing a governance framework for data access, such remedy is likely to involve important trade-offs that should be carefully balanced by regulators. In particular, data access is likely to undermine competition on the merits and the incentives to offer services to consumers free of charge. Furthermore, it could distort companies’ incentives to innovate with user data. To avoid these unintended effects, this article proposes to focus instead on prohibiting exclusionary practices by large digital platforms.

Brennan Hawkings, an 11-year-old boy from Utah, was found after being lost for more than four days in rugged terrain at a Boy Scout camp.2 Brennan’s parents later discovered why it had taken so long to find him: he had avoided passers-by, including the search teams looking for him. The boy was afraid that someone would steal him, as he’d been told “not to talk to strangers.”
Brennan’s case is a textbook example of the so-called Law of Unintended Consequences. Not talking to strangers is a universal lesson taught by well-intentioned parents to protect their children. In the context of Brennan’s disappearance, however, it had the unintended effect of leaving him unprotected.

A top Democrat on the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust has his sights set on Big Pharma. He believes it should be the next target after wrapping up a more than year-long investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.
Rep. Joe Neguse (Democrat – Colorado), vice chairman of the subcommittee, is calling for a hearing to probe federal enforcers’ approach to evaluating pharmaceutical mergers, reported CNBC.
He made the request in a letter sent Monday, November 23, to committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (Democrat – New York) and subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island). From there, Neguse told CNBC, the committee could determine if a full investigation is warranted.
“I think that this first hearing could be a starting point of sorts in providing both the committee and the American public with a better understanding of the scope of issues,” Neguse said in a phone interview. “And from there, depending on what we glean during that hearing regarding the FTC’s merger policy, I think it could very well lead to a broader investigation similar to the investigation that the committee undertook in the digital economy and Big Tech.”

154,"November 19, 2020",Facebook’s Instagram & Whatsapp Deals Face US Antitrust Suits,"


State and federal regulators are moving closer to filing an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. 
The antitrust case would largely focus on Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively, and whether those moves helped Facebook build a social media monopoly.
State and federal lawmakers could also accuse the company of using its already huge supply of user data as a resource to beat competitor apps, the Post reported, citing those familiar with the matter.
Three unnamed sources told the Post that state and federal probes into the acquisition strategy of the Menlo Park-based social media titan are in their final phases. One question investigators are pondering is whether to argue in the expected lawsuits against Facebook that its high-profile purchases have had the effect of leaving consumers with worse services and fewer privacy protections.
With the text-messaging service WhatsApp, in particular, Facebook had promised users that it would preserve the messaging company’s independence and strong privacy protections when it was purchased in 2014. It made the same commitment to regulators, who then gave a greenlight to the deal. But Facebook reversed course years later and has sought to integrate its users’ data with the social networking site’s other services, a controversial move that has raised fresh concerns given the tech giant’s past privacy mishaps.
Facebook along with other Silicon Valley giants like Alphabet and Apple, as well as Seattle-based Amazon, are being investigated over their business practices. In October, the federal government filed its first significant antitrust lawsuit in more than two decades against Alphabet-owned Google.

155,"November 18, 2020",German Federal Cabinet’s Draft for Amendments to the Act Against Restraints on Competition,"

By Dr. Raphael Reims (Willkie Farr & Gallagher)1
(I) Tenth Amendment to the Act Against Restraints on Competition
On October 19, 2020, the German Federal Cabinet submitted the revised draft for the tenth amendment to the Act Against Restraints on Competition (“ARC”) to the German Federal Parliament.2 The revised draft covers various changes in the area of (i) merger control, (ii) abuse control, (iii) administrative proceedings, (iv) cartel damage proceedings and (v) EU ECN+ directive.
In the next step the German Federal Parliament debate the revised draft and one should anticipate implementation this year to ensure a timely implementation of the EU ECN+ directive, which is due no later than February 4, 2021.3
(i) Merger Control
The revised draft proposes the following changes to the German merger control rules:
A German merger filing is inter alia required if the global revenues of all parties to a merger are EUR 500 million or more, or if one party has revenues of EUR 25 million or more in Germany and one other party has revenues of EUR 5 million or more in Germany. The revised draft proposes to raise, in Section 35(1) No 2 ARC, the first Revenues in Germany threshold from EUR 25 million to EUR 30 million and to raise the second Revenues in Germany threshold from EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million to allow the Federal Cartel Office to focus on more complex merger proceedings and to relieve small and medium-sized companies.
As a consequence, the revised draft proposes the elimination of Section 35(2) sentence 1 ARC. This is because it exempts mergers with small companies, i.e. those with global revenues of less than EUR 10 million, from the obligation to notify, regardless of whether the revenues thresholds have been met.
The revised draft also proposes to include a new Section 39a ARC, giving the Federal Cartel Office the right to extend the German merger control regime to previously investigated economic sectors where it has objectively comprehensible indications that further concentrations could significantly impede effective competition and the company has a 15 percent share in those sectors. In such cases the Federal Cartel Office shall be entitled to oblige individual companies with global revenues of more than EUR 500 million, by individual order, to notify any planned acquisition in the sector concerned. This amendment is a reaction to successive acquisition strategies in regional markets where the revenue thresholds have not been met.
According to Section 36 (1) sentence 2 No 2 ARC, a concentration which would significantly impede effective competition, in particular a concentration which is expected to create or strengthen a dominant position, shall exceptionally not be prohibited by the FCO if these requirements are fulfilled on a market in which goods or commercial services have been offered for at least five years and which had a sales volume of less than EUR 15 million in the last calendar year. The revised draft proposes to raise this de minimis market threshold from EUR 15 million to EUR 20 million in order to strengthen consolidation opportunities for small and medium-sized companies and to allow the Federal Cartel Office to focus on cases of high economic importance.
(ii) Abuse Control
The revised draft also focuses on German abuse control. It proposes to implement inter alia the following powers of intervention to the Federal Cartel Office in Section 18 et seq. ARC:
When determining market dominance, “access to data relevant for competition” shall be added as an appraisal criterion. In addition, the concept of intermediary power shall be introduced in order to take appropriate account of the intermediary and steering function of platforms in multi-sided markets. In this way the revised draft aims to respond to the current challenges of the digital economy.
For the same reason, a dominant company’s refusal to grant access to data, networks, or platforms necessary to operate on an upstream or downstream market is to be prohibited if the refusal threatens to eliminate effective competition in that market. While companies must comply with data protection rules, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation, it should be verified whether the restriction on data access on grounds of data protection does not hinder effective competition.
The revised draft also proposes to replace “abusive exploitation of a dominant position” with “abuse of a dominant position.” The revised draft thus aims to clarify that cases in which market power is manifested in the anticompetitive outcome but not in the behavior leading to that outcome should also be covered. This was disputed between the Federal Cartel Office4 and the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf5 in view of the Facebook decision.6
Finally, the revised draft provides for far-reaching powers of intervention for the Federal Cartel Office against “companies of paramount significance for competition across markets.” The revised draft thus targets digital companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook. The Federal Cartel Office can then in particular prohibit such companies from favoring their own offers over those of competitors, or from withholding data which they receive as part of their services thus creating unjustified dependencies. The burden of proof that the respective behavior is justified shall be borne by the companies. This would make it much easier for the Federal Cartel Office to attack certain practices of digital companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
(iii) Administrative proceedings
In addition, the revised draft proposes some administrative procedural changes, including the following:
In order to ensure more efficient public enforcement of competition law, the revised draft foresees an amendment as regards interim measures. At present the Federal Cartel Office may order interim measures in urgent cases if there is a risk of serious and irreparable damage to competition. The high hurdle of proving irreparable damage to the competition process is achieved by reducing it to inter alia a “predominant probability” of an infringement to Section 32a(1) ARC.
The revised draft also proposes to include Section 32c(2) ARC, opening up the possibility of an announcement by the Federal Cartel Office of an exception to the self-assessment principle. Companies with a substantial legal and economic interest are entitled to an announcement by the Federal Cartel Office, stating that it refrains from initiating proceedings in accordance with the scope of its discretionary powers. In this way, the revised draft aims to increase legal certainty.
(iv) Cartel Damage Proceedings
The revised draft also proposes the following changes regarding cartel damage proceedings:
At the end of 2018, the Federal Court of Justice rejected the double prima facie evidence with regard to cartel bias and with regard to the cartel causality of a price increase,7 thus strengthening the procedural conditions of defendants. The revised draft therefore proposes to include the following Section 33a(2) sentence 4 ARC: “It is reputably presumed that legal transactions concerning goods or services with cartel participants that fall within the scope of a cartel in product, time and geographic terms were covered by the cartel.” This again is intended to strengthen the procedural conditions for plaintiffs.
The Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf decided, also at the end of 2018, that the claims to have evidence surrendered and information disclosed for the calculation of damages pursuant to Sections 33g (1) and (10) ARC cannot also be applied to cartel damage claims which arose before those Sections entered into force in 2017.8 The aim of the revised draft is to clarify in Section 186 (4) ARC that these claims can indeed be applied to cartel damage claims which arose before Section 33g (1) and (10) ARC entered into force. This will again strengthen the procedural conditions for plaintiffs.
(v) EU ECN+ Directive
Finally, the revised draft also proposes some changes regarding the EU ECN+ directive9:
The directive provides that more powers shall be granted to the Member States’ competition authorities to ensure more efficient public enforcement of competition law. The current German competition legislation is, for the most part, already in line with the directive. However, the revised draft also proposes some amendments in Section 48 et seq. ARC such as codifying the Federal Cartel Office’s leniency program and rules on mutual assistance between the Federal Cartel Office and national competition authorities of other EU member states.
(II) Law to Mitigate the Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Competition Law
For the sake of completeness, on May 29, 2020, the law to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in competition law, cf. Section 186 ARC, was also implemented. The law covers the following changes:
For merger filings received by the Federal Cartel Office during the acute phase of the corona COVID-19 pandemic, between March 1 and May 31, 2020, the examination periods of Section 40 ARC for Phase I were extended from one to two months, and for Phase II from four to six months.
The obligation to pay interest on cartel fines according to Section 81(6) ARC is suspended until June 30, 2021 if payment facilities (for example a deferral) have been granted for fines.
(III) Outlook
While the law to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in competition law only leads to short-term changes, the official name of the revised draft for the tenth amendment to the ARC as the “ARC Digitization Act” already shows its long-term ambitions. If the law is implemented in this form, the Federal Cartel Office will probably have far more instruments at its disposal in the field of digital markets than any other European competition authority and will continue to be one of the most active authorities in this field.

156,"November 16, 2020",ANALYSIS: Is Antitrust Litigation at a Crossroads in 2021?,"


By Eleanor Tyler (Bloomberg)
Antitrust litigation, in the form of both public and private enforcement, looks to be entering a period of serious upheaval.
Both the U.S. and the European Union have begun a fundamental policy debate about the purpose of their antitrust laws, their appropriate scope, and who should be allowed to enforce them. As this debate simmers among U.S. antitrust stakeholders, for the first time since the 1970s, the practice may be in for a tectonic shift.
The four developments with the most potential to impact antitrust and trade litigation in 2021 are:
the introduction of possible new tools for enforcers,the pending Supreme Court cases that could kick the FTC out of the consumer redress business,the court battle over further narrowing the right to bring class actions, andthe rise of more enforcers worldwide.
New Enforcement Tools?
The U.S. and EU have separately proposed to give enforcers new tools to attack anticompetitive conduct. Both attempt to address how digital markets differ from traditional markets, and what many perceive as overweening power for a few digital platforms. The reforms could spell a reset of digital markets, and of antitrust law more broadly, in 2021 and beyond.
A much-awaited report from the U.S. House of Representatives proposes sweeping legal changes to private and public antitrust enforcement to “recalibrate” U.S. antitrust law. It also puts a bullseye on the back of the tech giants.
Among other recommendations, the House report advocates moving the U.S. toward an “abuse of dominance” standard like the EU’s. It also supports legislatively erasing court precedents that have critically narrowed the path to winning lawsuits filed under Sherman Act § 2.
Given that the last major change to U.S. antitrust statutes was in 1976, if enacted, the proposed changes likely would begin at least a decade of new lawsuits reckoning with concentrated markets. Meanwhile, the DOJ has challenged Google Inc.‘s online empire under the existing law, a rare public enforcement case alleging monopoly.
The report’s recommendations are controversial, and the outcome of the U.S. Senate elections likely will dictate whether legislative change materializes. David Cicilline (D-RI), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, has pledged to propose legislation based on the report as soon as possible.
In the EU, the Competition Commission has proposed a “new competition tool” that would permit the commission to intervene in tipping markets even before a player becomes dominant. The proposed new tool will be part of a Digital Markets Act for use in those markets, where the “winner take all” effect makes early action crucial to preserving competition. It could still be used outside of digital markets, because the tool isn’t yet a reality. But even in limited use, the proposed tool represents a radical change for EU enforcers: an experiment in stopping potential problems to competition before they mature into legal violations.

Uber is in talks to sell its autonomous vehicle unit to startup competitor Aurora Innovation, TechCrunch reported. Eighteen months ago, Uber’s  self-driving car unit, Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ARG), was valued at US$7.25 billion following a US$1 billion investment from Toyota, DENSO, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.
In March 2019, Uber avoided criminal charges in the 2018 death of Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona, the first-ever death involving an autonomous car. Federal investigators found that Uber, the safety driver behind the wheel of the car, and the state of Arizona all shared a portion of the blame for the incident. The accident ended Uber’s test program in Tempe, but the company resumed testing in Pittsburgh, where UberATG is headquartered.
And according to Uber’s most recent earnings report, while its “ATG and other technologies” segment had revenues of US$25 million in the third quarter, the segment saw a net loss of US$303 million for the nine months ended September 30, according to TechCrunch.
Aurora was founded in 2017 by Chris Urmson, the former lead engineer for Google’s self-driving project. Much of its focus has been on developing technology for self-driving trucks.

158,"November 11, 2020",Regulating Multisided Platforms? The Case Against Treating Platforms As Utilities,"


By Rosa M. Abrantes-Metz (The Brattle Group) & Albert Metz (Global Economics Group)
The bloom is off the Big Tech rose. It seems nearly the entire political spectrum is angry with Amazon, Google and Facebook for one reason or another. This has led to a great deal of discussion on whether and how to regulate (or even break up) these platforms, including whether they should be regulated as utilities. Over the last several years, if there is one issue which might support a somewhat broad political consensus it is the desire to regulate large internet platforms like Amazon, Google and Facebook.Our purpose with this article is simply to caution against some forms of regulatory treatment which emphasize the utility-like nature of large platforms. We choose the word “caution” because we are not necessarily arguing that such regulation is in all instances inappropriate or uncalled for. Instead, all we mean is that there are counterarguments which should be considered, and in this article we give voice to some of those arguments.The basic economic argument for utility-like regulation of internet platforms is that these platforms can become “natural monopolies” which tend to forestall competition. While there is merit to this argument, internet platforms have also been a source of tremendous innovation which in turn has allowed entrants to unseat what were once thought to be entrenched incumbents. Regulation risks quashing such innovation and harming consumer welfare.Furthermore, internet platforms, unlike traditional utilities, are sometimes amenable to multi-homing, meaning that customers of one platform may also choose to be customers of additional similar platforms. Multi-homing can be critical in enabling successful entry into the market.While examples of entry do not disprove the possibility of market power abuse by some platforms, they do remind us that the economics of platforms can be more complex and nuanced than the classical utility model would suggest.

As governments in different parts of the globe clamp down on possible Big Tech antitrust contraventions, an Australian regulator is looking into ways to reshape Australian merger regulations in 2021, CRN, an Australian news outlet, reported.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chair Rod Sims said the watchdog was keeping a close eye on worldwide antitrust initiatives related to the significant digital platforms.
“The ACCC is focusing on the media bargaining code, our ad tech inquiry and our study examining app stores, and we have noted the Epic Games proceedings against Apple and Google in the US in regards to the latter,” the official said, as per the report.

160,"November 10, 2020",China Introduces New Legislation To Curb Online Shopping Giants ,"


China’s market regulator has taken its first major step towards curbing the monopolistic power of its tech giants, drawing up draft antitrust rules that have sent shares in companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Meituan tumbling, reported the Financial Times.
Until now, Chinese regulators have taken a relatively hands-off approach to antitrust, even as authorities in the US and Europe launched inquiries and investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Google, and others.
This is in spite of the fact that Chinese tech companies have been building increasingly captive ecosystems, with users being prevented from using WeChat Pay to purchase products in Alibaba’s Taobao online store, for instance, or easily sharing links to Taobao goods within WeChat.
The new guidelines mark the first time the State Administration for Market Regulation has directly tackled anti-competitive behavior in the internet sector. 
“It signals the end of an era — it will fundamentally change the competition landscape in China for internet companies,” said Scott Yu, an antitrust expert at Zhonglun Law Firm.

161,"November 9, 2020",New EU Platform Regulations Could Be A Problem For Airbnb,"


According to a report from CNBC, Airbnb could be among the targeted platforms when the European Union presents a raft of tougher regulations targeting tech companies next month.
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is expected to overhaul the management of content on platforms like Google and Facebook with its Digital Services Act — the first regulation of its kind since 2000.
Its overall aim is to ensure fair competition in the European market, but the rules are expected to require dramatic changes to the business models and practices of Big Tech.
One of the big uncertainties is which platforms will have to abide by the new rules. The Dutch government wants Airbnb to be among them.
“To tackle the side effects of ‘short-term holiday rentals’ on European cities and enforce legislation, we need better access to data from platforms such as Airbnb,” Kajsa Ollongren, deputy prime minister of the Netherlands, said on Monday, November 9.
In a document seen by CNBC, the Dutch government argued that short-term holiday rentals “can have negative effects on public interests, such as the housing market, liveability, social cohesion, safety and the level playing field for other providers of such accommodation.”

162,"November 8, 2020","As the Trump era comes to an end, what happens to Big Tech?","


By Brian Contreras, Los Angeles Times 
In the days before the 2020 election was called for Joe Biden, President Trump was on Twitter — doing battle with Twitter.
As the incumbent tweeted through the slow vote-tallying process that would ultimately end in his loss, Twitter had covered much of Trump’s timeline with warning labels cautioning that the president’s posts contained disputed and potentially misleading information. Trump responded by tweeting a reference to Section 230, the obscure, decades-old law that shapes content moderation on social media.
Such feuds with Silicon Valley companies have been a through-line of Trump’s presidency; he has often criticized Facebook and Twitter for conspiring against him, siding with liberals and stifling conservative voices, even as Facebook helped get him elected and Twitter remained his soapbox of choice.
He has blasted Amazon and spearheaded a resurgence of Big Tech trust-busting that found purchase among Republican congresspeople, red state attorneys general and his own Justice Department.
His focus on tech also bled into his long-running trade war with China, as he issued executive orders to keep Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei out of America and ban the Chinese-owned apps WeChat and TikTok (unsuccessfully so far, in the case of both apps).
Now, as Trump enters his lame duck period and Biden readies for the transition of power, there is opportunity for change — but how much can actually be expected?
The paradigm that comes next is not entirely clear. Aside from calls for the social media giants to more aggressively fight misinformation, Joe Biden did not make Big Tech a major focus of his campaign. The makeup of Biden’s Cabinet remains uncertain as well.

163,"November 4, 2020",Shifting the Burden in Acquisitions of Nascent and Potential Competitors: Not so Simple,"

By Jay Ezrielev (Elevecon)*
 
I. Introduction
There is a heated debate in antitrust today about what lawmakers, courts, and enforcers should do about mergers between potential competitors. A number of commentators have raised concerns that acquisitions of potential and nascent competitors may be harming competition by enabling the incumbents to take out competitive threats before they mature into significant competitors.1
What are nascent and potential competitors? The uses of these terms differ across authors. I use the term “nascent competitor” to describe a firm that is not yet present in the market in a significant way, but may over time develop into a significant competitor. I define the term “potential competitor” as a firm whose competitive significance in a market is not reflected in its current market share. Under my definition, nascent competitors are also potential competitors, but potential competitors also include established firms that are currently not in the market but may enter the market relatively quickly.
Acquiring potential competitors may harm future competition because, but for the acquisition, a potential competitor may develop into a significant competitor to the acquirer in the future.2 The U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies have a substantial record of challenging mergers where an alleged antitrust violation is the loss of future competition.3 However, despite numerous previous challenges of mergers between potential competitors, critics argue that there may be under-enforcement of such mergers.4
Several scholars and researchers have proposed reforming antitrust to address concerns about acquisitions of potential competitors. A common element of these proposals is shifting the evidentiary burden from the enforcers to the merging parties to demonstrate that the acquisition would not harm competition. Those calling for a shift in the evidentiary burden include the authors of a recent report on digital platforms by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State (hereafter, the “Stigler Center Report”), authors of a recent European Commission report on competition policy and digital markets, and numerous other scholars and researchers, including Carl Shapiro, Tommaso Valletti, Diana Moss, Jonathan Baker, Fiona Scott-Morton, Scott Hemphill, and Tim Wu.5 The long-anticipated House Antitrust Subcommittee majority staff report (hereafter, the “House Report”) also called for a “presumption against acquisitions of startups by dominant firms.”6
In this Article, I caution against adopting current proposals to shift the evidentiary burden to the merging parties. Although the advocates of reform have raised legitimate theoretical concerns about acquisitions of potential competitors, they have not provided any credible empirical evidence for the need of reform. The advocates offer no compelling evidence of under-enforcement of acquisitions of potential competitors.
The proposed reforms to shift the evidentiary burden to the merging parties would cause significant administrability problems. There are three main problems with the proposals. First, the proposals do not clearly identify the set of transactions that would be subject to the evidentiary burden shift. The lack of clarity in the rules for identifying the transactions for which there would be a shift in the evidentiary burden would create confusion, complicate the adjudication of cases, and increase transaction costs. Second, it may be exceptionally difficult for the merging parties to demonstrate that their transaction would not harm future competition even if the possibility of future harm is quite remote. Given the low odds of overcoming the presumptions of harm to competition, the proposed reforms may be tantamount to a prohibition against a broad segment of mergers regardless of their effect on competition. Third, there is no evidence or economic analysis to suggest that the proposed reforms would effectively target anticompetitive transactions.
Rather than enhancing competition, the proposed reforms may harm innovation and the economy. The reforms would likely deter a significant number of transactions, including some that may generate efficiencies and spur innovation. Deterring acquisitions of nascent firms would also limit exit options for investments in risky and innovative startups backed by venture capital. Limiting exit options of venture-backed startups may reduce investments in these firms. Venture capital investments have been an important driver of innovation and economic growth, and reforms that limit acquisitions of nascent firms may lead to less innovation and slower economic growth.
The advocates have not provided a compelling rationale for the proposed reforms. They argue that reforms are needed because acquisitions of potential competitors can harm innovation and lead to other harmful effects as a matter of theory. But this argument has no limiting principle as there is always a theoretical possibility of harm in mergers. Acquisitions of potential competitors can also be beneficial, and the advocates offer no reliable methodology for distinguishing between harmful and beneficial acquisitions. To make a more compelling case for the proposed reforms, the advocates should identify specific harms that the reforms would address, such as diminished levels of innovation or output. The advocates should also show that the reforms would effectively remedy the harms.
 
II. Evidence of under-enforcement
Advocates of reform rely largely on theoretical arguments in making their case for stronger enforcement of mergers between potential competitors. Hemphill and Wu argue that “[g]iven the incentive and ability of incumbents to destroy or coopt innovative threats, avoiding that outcome is an important target for enforcement.”7 They suggest that acquisitions of nascent competitors can harm consumers because nascent competitive threats are “a key source of disruptive innovation” and because displacement of incumbents “often brings multiple benefits to consumers, including an improved product, a new distribution of surplus between producers and customers, and an openness to further entry in this and adjacent businesses.” 8 They further contend that the “risk of lost innovation [from incumbents’ actions to destroy or coopt innovative threats] strongly tips the balance in favor of a bias to action.”9
The theoretical possibility of competitive harm is not reason enough to adopt the proposed reforms. Policy makers should instead consider whether the proposed reforms would target anticompetitive transactions not otherwise enforced, and whether the costs associated with type II errors (false negatives) under current policy outweigh the costs associated with type I errors (false positives).
There is a dearth of empirical evidence on whether there is under-enforcement of potential competition merger cases. It is difficult to identify cases of type II enforcement error in allowing an anticompetitive acquisition to proceed because identifying such cases requires a reliable prediction of the “but-for” world or the outcome but for the acquisition. Indeed, advocates of reform have not demonstrated a single instance where enforcers failed to challenge a potential competitor acquisition that caused significant competitive harm.
A number of advocates point to Facebook’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram as an instance of under-enforcement in a nascent competitor acquisition case.10 However, the advocates offer no evidence to demonstrate that Facebook’s Instagram acquisition caused competitive harm. Facebook’s Instagram acquisition may have caused competitive harm if (1) but for the acquisition, Instagram would have continued to improve its products and services and would have challenged Facebook’s position as the leading social media platform; and (2) post-acquisition, Facebook reduced the level of Instagram’s innovation or service quality to protect Facebook’s legacy business. There is no basis to conclude that either of these propositions is true.
In fact, Instagram experienced a high level of growth after the Facebook acquisition. The number of Instagram users increased from 30 million at the time of the acquisition, to more than one billion by 2018.11 It is also unclear how much growth Instagram would have achieved or whether Instagram would have even survived without the Facebook acquisition. Other social media platforms did not fare as well. For example, Path, another photo-sharing application that existed at the time of Instagram’s acquisition, did not ultimately survive.12 Google+, a social media platform launched in 2011, also did not survive in spite of being backed by Google.13 The recent UK Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel (chaired by Jason Furman) acknowledges that “[i]t is of course unknown how Instagram would have developed without the [Facebook] merger. Facebook may have aided its development, for example through expertise in social networks and financial investment.”14 A study commissioned by the UK Competition and Markets Authority also found no evidence that Facebook’s Instagram acquisition resulted in harm to competition.15
A study by Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer, and Song Ma (the “Killer Acquisitions” study) finds evidence of competition loss from potential competitor acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry.16 Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma define “killer acquisitions” as acquisitions in which an incumbent acquires “an innovative target and terminate[s] the development of the target’s innovations to preempt future competition.”17 They find that between 5.3 percent and 7.4 percent of the acquisitions in the study’s sample (or about 46 to 63 pharmaceutical acquisitions per year) are “killer acquisitions.”18 The study does not identify specific instances of killer acquisitions but instead estimates the number of killer acquisitions through econometric analysis.
The “Killer Acquisitions” study does not provide empirical support for the proposed reforms to address potential competitor acquisitions. In particular, Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma note that the “the overall effect [of killer acquisitions] on social welfare remains unclear.”19 Moreover, the study’s criteria for identifying potentially problematic transactions are different from those under the proposed reforms. The critical difference between the “Killer Acquisitions” study and the proposed reforms is that the study examines the effects of “overlaps” in product portfolios between the acquirer’s and target’s projects, whereas the proposed reforms would use other criteria (such as presence in adjacent markets) to identify potentially problematic transactions.20 Cunningham, Ederer, and Ma explain that it is “crucial to accurately measure overlap between the acquiring firm’s portfolio and the target’s project and to quantify competition in the relevant product market.”21
It is also worth noting that the “killer acquisition” conduct appears to be addressable under current doctrine, potentially obviating the need for reform to address the conduct. In fact, the only “killer acquisition” example that the authors cite in their paper is Questcor’s 2013 acquisition of the U.S. development rights for Synacthen—an acquisition that was challenged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC and Mallinckrodt (Questcor’s parent company) settled the matter after Mallinckrodt agreed to license the development rights for Synacthen to another company and pay $100 million in equitable monetary relief.22
There are other reasons to be cautious in applying the findings of the “Killer Acquisitions” study to implement significant changes in antitrust policy. The study’s results have not yet been replicated or confirmed by others. Moreover, the study’s findings for the pharmaceutical industry may not apply to other industries.23 There are also reasons to be skeptical of the study’s findings. The study estimates the number of killer acquisitions as the number of incremental project terminations attributable to purchases by buyers with overlapping projects. But there are alternative explanations for why an acquirer with an overlapping project may be more likely to discontinue the acquired project than other acquirers. For example, the acquirer may be purchasing the project to assess whether it offers any improvements over the overlapping project rather than looking to preempt competition. If the acquired project is inferior to the overlapping project, it would be rational to discontinue the acquired project.
 
III. Proposals for reform
Advocates of reform propose shifting the evidentiary burden to the merging parties to demonstrate that their acquisitions of potential competitors are not anticompetitive. There are three main problems with the proposals. First, the proposals do not clearly identify which cases would be subject to the evidentiary burden shift. Second, it is unclear how the parties could possibly meet the burden of demonstrating that a transactions is not anticompetitive when the presumed competitive harm is in the future, the harm is speculative, and the presumption does not rely on evidence of likely future entry. Third, there is no evidence to suggest that the proposed reforms would target anticompetitive transactions. To demonstrate the problems with the proposed reforms, I consider the proposals from Carl Shapiro, the Stigler Center Report, Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu, and the House Report.
Shapiro argues that “the agencies and the courts could express greater wariness when a dominant incumbent firm seeks to acquire a firm operating in an adjacent market, especially if the target firm is well positioned to challenge the incumbent’s position in the foreseeable future” by “lowering the evidentiary requirements necessary for the government to prevail in a merger case based on a loss of ‘potential competition.’”24 Shapiro proposes a standard where “the government could meet its initial burden by showing that the target firm is reasonably likely to become a rival to the acquiring firm in the foreseeable future, even if the target firm has not yet made specific plans to do so.”25
Shapiro’s proposed standard fails to articulate clear guidelines for determining when the government would meet its initial burden for blocking the acquisition. It is unclear what principles the courts would apply to determine whether a target firm is “reasonably likely to become a rival to the acquiring firm in the foreseeable future.” How likely is “reasonably likely”? Is a 25 percent probability of entry in the next ten years or a 20 percent probability of entry in the next five years “reasonably likely”? How would a factfinder assess the probability of future entry? How far into the future do the courts need to peer to determine whether rivalry is “reasonably likely”? How robust does the future hypothetical rivalry need to be between the acquirer and target for the government to meet its initial burden? How would a court determine the contours of a future market for assessing the degree of hypothetical future rivalry between the acquirer and the target when the demand characteristics of this future market are unknown? Attempting to answer these questions is an invitation to speculate about future competition and to apply arbitrary rules.
The Stigler Center Report proposes a standard where “antitrust law might be revised to relax the proof requirements imposed upon antitrust plaintiffs in appropriate cases or to reverse burdens of proof,” where “[m]ergers between dominant firms and substantial competitors or uniquely likely future competitors should be presumed to be unlawful, subject to rebuttal by defendants.”26 The Stigler Center Report further proposes that “when an acquisition involves a dominant platform, authorities should shift the burden of proof, requiring the company to prove that the acquisition will not harm competition.”27 However, the proposal does not explain what it means for a target firm to be a “uniquely likely future” competitor.28 It also appears to apply special rules for acquisitions by a “dominant platform” without defining this term. The Stigler Center Report provides neither a clear definition of what constitutes a “platform” nor a workable methodology for determining when a firm is a “platform.”29
Hemphill and Wu identify “nascent competition as a distinct analytical category” and propose “a program of antitrust enforcement to protect” nascent competition.30 They define a nascent competitor as “a firm whose prospective innovation represents a serious future threat to an incumbent.”31 They argue that relevant evidence in the government’s prima facie showing that an incumbent’s acquisition of a nascent competitor is anticompetitive may include evidence of “beginnings of direct competition” or the “existence of competition in markets adjacent to the incumbent’s primary market.”32 Hemphill and Wu contend that their “proposed approach is very far from a general ban on the acquisition of unproven companies” and they “would discourage, at most, acquisition by the firm or firms most threatened by a nascent rival.”33
Hemphill and Wu’s proposed antitrust enforcement program is likewise unworkable because it does not explain how a court could determine when a transaction would lead to a presumption of anticompetitive harm. It is unclear how a court would determine whether a particular innovation is a “serious” threat to an incumbent. For example, in the case of Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram, how could a court determine whether Instagram was a “serious” threat to Facebook? Instagram did not offer unique or difficult to replicate functionality. At the time of Facebook’s Instagram acquisition, Path, another photo sharing application, had functionality similar to Instagram’s.34 What made Instagram a “serious” threat to Facebook?
It is also unclear how courts could distinguish the “beginnings of direct competition” from insignificant direct competition between the merging parties. Hemphill and Wu do not explain why the “beginnings of direct competition” between the merging parties would be a relevant factor for identifying anticompetitive mergers between potential competitors.
It is likewise unclear how the courts would determine when there is “competition in markets adjacent to the incumbent’s primary market.” For example, Hemphill and Wu do not explain how a court would determine whether a market is “adjacent” to another market. When are two markets adjacent? Are sports cable networks and news cable networks in adjacent markets? Are different types of chemicals in adjacent markets? Are hospitals and outpatient centers in adjacent markets? Hemphill and Wu also do not explain how courts would use the evidence of market adjacency to determine whether the government made its prima facie showing that the acquisition in question lessens competition.
The House Report recommends “strengthening the Clayton Act to prohibit acquisitions of potential rivals and nascent competitors.”35 The House Report defines potential rivals as “firms that are planning to enter or could plausibly enter the acquirer’s market” and defines nascent competitors as “firms whose ‘prospective innovation represents a serious future threat to an incumbent,’” quoting Hemphill and Wu’s definition.36 In addition, the House Report suggests “codifying a presumption against acquisitions of startups by dominant firms, particularly those that serve as direct competitors, as well as those operating in adjacent or related markets.”37
The House Report’s recommendations are likewise unworkable for identifying potentially problematic transactions. How would courts determine when a target “could plausibly enter the acquirer’s market”? “[P]lausibly enter” over what period? What is the “acquirer’s market”? Does that include markets where the acquirer is a minor participant? How would a court determine when a firm operates in “adjacent or related markets”?
The second problem with the proposed reforms is that the merging parties may face an exceedingly high burden in rebutting the presumption of harm to competition. Under the proposals, the merging parties may need to rebut the presumption of harm even if the acquisition target has no plans to enter the relevant market absent the merger, entry would not occur until sometime in the distant future, and the target’s future entry may be unlikely. Merging parties may rebut a government’s prima facie showing “by producing evidence to cast doubt on the accuracy of the Government’s evidence as predictive of future anti-competitive effects.”38 But how do the parties rebut the presumption of competitive harm if significant doubt about the accuracy of the effects is part of the presumption?
In cases where there is a presumption of harm to future competition, the parties’ burden would be to offer evidence about future competitive effects. But given that there is often significant uncertainty about future market outcomes, it is unclear how the merging parties could rebut the presumption without engaging in some speculation about what future markets would look like.39 Analyzing future competitive effects would be especially difficult for dynamic markets undergoing rapid technologic change, frequent entry and exit, and evolving demand. The parties would also find it difficult to rebut the presumptions of harm by claiming that the transaction will generate significant efficiencies, as courts and enforcement agencies have been skeptical about such claims.
If the procompetitive and mitigating effects of a merger are just as uncertain as the potential anticompetitive effects, should courts treat the effects symmetrically? Could the parties offer efficiency justifications that are just as speculative (or would occur with equally low probability) as future competition between the acquirer and target? Or could the parties rebut the presumption by arguing that the incumbent will face new rivals when the new rivals’ entry is just as uncertain as future competition between the acquirer and target? As a practical matter, it may be impossible for a court to resolve disputes between opposing speculative views about future competition without also speculating about future market outcomes.
The third problem with the proposed reforms is that it is not at all clear that the proposals are targeting the right set of transactions. The advocates of reform offer no empirical basis for identifying potentially harmful transactions. The proposed criteria for identifying potentially anticompetitive transactions lack credible support.
For example, Shapiro, Hemphill and Wu, and the House Report suggest that courts consider whether the acquirer and the target are present in “adjacent” markets in determining whether there is a prima facie showing of harm to competition. Notwithstanding the lack of a clear definition of what it means for markets to be “adjacent”, there is no empirical basis for using this criterion to identify anticompetitive transactions.
Hemphill and Wu also suggest that “a firm’s broader pattern of acquiring nascent competitors” might be evidence of anticompetitive intent in acquiring these firms.40 However, a pattern of acquisitions of nascent or young firms is perfectly consistent with a procompetitive motive such as engaging in transactions that create synergies. There is no basis for inferring anticompetitive intent from a pattern of acquisitions of nascent firms.
In addition, Hemphill and Wu argue that overpaying for an acquisition relative to offers of other potential acquirers “may suggest an anticompetitive purpose.”41 There is no basis for such an inference. The acquisition price may reflect the value of merger-specific synergies created from combining complementary assets. An acquisition by an alternative buyer may create fewer synergies, leading to a smaller bid for the target. Other firms may also bid less (or not bid at all) because they have a less optimistic view of the target’s growth prospects. Hemphill and Wu offer no evidence of any link between a target’s acquisition price and likelihood of anticompetitive effects.
The Stigler Center Report notes that the presumption of anticompetitive harm “would be valuable, not because it would identify anticompetitive mergers with precision, but because it would shift the burden to the party with the best access to relevant information on issues of competitive effects and efficiencies from the merger.”42 But the merging parties always have access to some information that is unavailable to the enforcers. Shifting the evidentiary burden to the merging parties is not costless. Such a shift would impose significant costs on the merging parties and, without evidence of likely anticompetitive effects, may deter some procompetitive transactions.
 
IV. Potential harm from over-deterrence
The proposed reforms would likely deter a broad segment of transactions because of the increased risk of an antitrust challenge, higher transaction costs, and delays in completing transactions. The deterred transactions may include procompetitive transactions. Although the proposals would allow the parties to rebut the presumption of anticompetitive harm, merging parties would likely face low odds of overcoming the presumptions even if there is a reasonable likelihood that the merger would yield procompetitive benefits.
Moreover, although the merging parties may ultimately meet their burden of showing that the transaction would not harm competition, the costs and delays of having to make this showing may outweigh the benefits that the parties would derive from the transaction. The prospect of having to rebut a presumption of anticompetitive harm would likely deter some firms from pursuing the merger in the first place. The merger deterrence effects may be especially strong for acquisitions of smaller firms, where the potential value from the deal may be less than the transaction cost. The greater costs of obtaining approvals for transactions may make it prohibitively expensive for smaller acquisitions to go forward and may result in a large firm bias in acquisitions.
Deterring mergers may harm competition and innovation in two distinct ways. The first harm is the loss of procompetitive benefits that the deterred transactions would have created. The procompetitive benefits include efficiencies that could enhance competition and innovation. The second harm is limiting exit options for risky and innovative startups by deterring their acquisitions. Limiting exit options for risky and innovative startups may reduce incentives to invest in such startups.43 Hemphill and Wu acknowledge that “[i]f acquisitions were unduly curbed, pre-acquisition investments in risky startups might dry up, resulting in lost innovation. Moreover, synergies might be lost, as incumbents steered clear of buying and incubating promising new technologies.”44
Mergers may yield significant synergies that enhance the merging firms’ ability to innovate.45 For example, an acquisition of a startup by an established incumbent may enhance the merging firms’ ability to innovate by combining a startup’s expertise in a new technology with the established firm’s staff of engineers who could effectively deploy the new technology in new products. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize the role of innovation synergies in spurring innovation: “[t]he Agencies also consider whether the merger is likely to enable innovation that would not otherwise take place, by bringing together complementary capabilities that cannot be otherwise combined or for some other merger-specific reason.”46 Innovation synergies are just one mechanism through which mergers may spur innovation. Mergers may also increase innovation incentives by increasing the ability of the innovator to capture the benefits of the innovation.47 Apart from spurring innovations, mergers may also create efficiencies and costs savings through more efficient use of resources, leading to greater output and lower prices.48
Acquisitions may also have a significant role in spurring innovation by providing incentives to invest in innovative startups. Acquisitions of nascent firms by incumbents provide an important exit option for startups backed by venture capital.49 Exits are a critical part of the venture capital cycle that feeds capital to startup firms.50 For some firms, entry may not be profitable without the possibility of being acquired by an incumbent.51 According to the National Venture Capital Association data, the exits of U.S. companies backed by venture capital funds in 2019 included 836 exits of via mergers and acquisitions and only 82 via an IPO.52
Limiting exit options for risky startups would potentially reduce the financial returns for venture capital investors, consequently weakening incentives to invest in such startups.53 Economic research suggests that venture capital is a significant source of innovation and investment.54 Given the importance of venture capital for innovative startups and the role that venture capital had in driving growth and innovation in the U.S. economy, limiting acquisition exit options could have negative consequences for innovation, economic growth, and prosperity.
Hemphill and Wu suggest that their proposed standard would not significantly limit exit options for nascent firms because their “proposed approach is very far from a general ban on the acquisition of unproven companies,” and they “would discourage, at most, acquisition by the firm or firms most threatened by a nascent rival.”55 However, they offer no workable methodology for limiting the deterrence effects to firms most threatened by a nascent rival. Moreover, there could be a significant reduction in a venture capitalist’s return on investment in a startup even if only a single buyer were deterred from acquiring that startup.56
 
V. Conclusion
The proposals to shift the evidentiary burden to the merging parties in cases of potential competitor acquisitions would likely cause significant administrability problems. The proposals do not clearly identify the transactions that would be subject to the evidentiary burden shift. Under the proposals, it would be exceptionally difficult for the merging parties to demonstrate that their merger does not harm future competition even if the possibility of future harm is quite remote. There is also no evidence to suggest that the proposals would target anticompetitive transactions. Workable reforms to address acquisitions of potential competitors require empirical studies that could identify the types of transactions that are likely to produce harmful outcomes. Without such studies, the proposals are engaging in guesswork and speculation and may actually cause more harm than good.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the panel discussion, Open v. Closed Ecosystems from an Antitrust Perspective, from the final episode of our series, Antitrust In an Election Year: Challenges Ahead.

Richard SCHMALENSEE:
I believe it’s time to start the panel discussion. Our topic today is closed versus open ecosystems from an antitrust perspective. We have three distinguished panelists to explore this issue, this topic. Maureen Ohlhausen from Baker Botts, Darren Tucker from Vinson & Elkins, and Hal Varian from Google. Those of you who are participating in hopes of seeing Nikhil Shanbhag from Facebook will be disappointed because he had to cancel at the last minute.
This is an area in which there are a lot of buzzwords, and terms are thrown around as if their definitions are well understood, but to paraphrase Barney Frank, while we’re all entitled to our own opinions, we shouldn’t all be entitled to our own definitions. So I want to ask the panelists when they make their opening remarks to say a word or two about what makes an ecosystem open or closed. Is the key the role of open standards? Something else? A number of things? Let’s lead off with Maureen.

Maureen OHLHAUSEN:
Well thanks Dick, thanks for having me. I’m delighted to be here to speak. On the question of what’s an open system or a closed system, I think those are more terms of general description than of falling into any particular buc...

Leah NYLEN:
Thanks to CCIA and Competition Policy International. I’m Leah Nylen, Politico’s Antitrust reporter. And with me today is Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. Makan, welcome and thanks for joining us.
 

Makan DELRAHIM:
Good morning, Leah. Thanks so much for having me.
NYLEN:
Great. So let’s start with some really fresh news. Last night the Justice Department filed a petition in Federal Court in Massachusetts, against the management consultancy, Bain & Company, for failing to turn over documents the Division requested as part of its Visa Plaid merger review. Can you tell us a little bit about that action?
DELRAHIM:
Well, all I can say is what was in the press release and the redacted filing that we made in court. I believe, at least I’m told and was surprised, frankly, that it had been more than a quarter of a century since we had actually gone to court to enforce one of our CIDs. One of our important functions is to have the data to properly analyze transactions. And it’s really important for parties to turn over the documents that we require. And so if there’s inappropriate claims of attorney client privilege for some docum...

166,"November 2, 2020",Vestager: New EU Digital Rules Draft May Not Include Big Tech Breakup,"


The European Union’s chief antitrust regulator told a German newspaper in an interview published Sunday, November 1, that she sees no reason to break up Google or other big tech companies, according to Reuters.
Margrethe Vestager did, however, say regulators may need new powers to oversee the markets dominated by Google and other large tech players.
The Danish diplomat made her remarks in an interview published by Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. She is scheduled to release a proposal for new regulatory schemes on December 2.
As for breaking up the tech giants, she reportedly told the newspaper, according to Reuters, “It will never come to that. Up until now we haven’t had any cases that could lead to such a move.”
Other European Union officials, including Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, have said breaking up tech giants may be necessary if they pass certain thresholds of market dominance, Reuters reported.
Meanwhile, Democrats in the US House of Representatives and Japanese regulators also are exploring the market power of big tech companies and publicly questioning whether new regulatory structures or powers are necessary.
Some industry experts, however, are cautioning that there’s a risk lawmakers will react too swiftly or without adequate understanding of the consequences new government actions could create.

167,"November 1, 2020",Big Tech Will Have To Explain Their Algorithms Under New EU Rule,"


Dominant tech companies will have to explain how their algorithms work under proposed new EU rules and also open up their ad archives to regulators and researchers, Europe’s digital and antitrust chief said on Friday, October 30.
The move is likely to impact US online giants such as Alphabet unit Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, with their treasure troves of data and lucrative online advertising businesses, reported Reuters.  Advertising algorithms help companies target ads at the users that advertisers want to reach.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the goal was to shed light on how these algorithms work and to make sure that companies are accountable for their decisions.
“And the biggest platforms would have to provide more information on the way their algorithms work, when regulators ask for it,” she told an event organised by research agency AlgorithmWatch and the European Policy Centre.
“They’d also have to give regulators and researchers access to the data they hold – including ad archives,” Vestager said.
She will announce two sets of draft rules known as the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act on December 2, underlining the EU’s determination to rein in tech giants and force them to play fairer.

Britain’s market watchdog is working on plans that could see Google and other internet giants blocked from gobbling up smaller companies with potential to become global rivals, reported The Daily Mail.
At present, the Competition and Markets Authority rarely intervenes on takeovers by tech titans unless there is strong probability that the deal could damage competition. 
It now wants to be able to step in even if there is only a modest chance that competition will be harmed years in the future.
The watchdog, which is lobbying the Government to give it the green light to launch a crackdown, is concerned the tech giants have grown more powerful as people spend more time online during the pandemic.
It has warned that digital giants could take advantage by making more attempts to buy up other tech start-ups.

169,"November 1, 2020","Restoring Balance to Digital Competition – Sensible Rules, Effective Enforcement","

By Philip Marsden & Rupprecht Podszun1
 
The EU Commission is stepping up efforts to come up with new regulations for digital gatekeepers. Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager proposes a “New Competition Tool” and some form of “ex ante regulation” for platforms.
We offer proposals for sensible ex ante rules and enforcement frameworks to restore balance to digital competition. Other studies have established that there is a need for a better legal framework for digital gatekeepers. We now move on to the “how”:

How do we design new tools and regulation to correct market failures in relation to digital platforms before the abuses of market power happen?
How do we re-set the balance so that genuine innovation and choice prevail, and all businesses have an equal opportunity to compete in the marketplace?
How do we ensure that the best product wins, not just the platform that offers it?

Three principles should guide the search for new rules: freedom of competition, fairness of intermediation, and the sovereignty of economic actors to take their decisions autonomously. These principles are described intentionally as having a constitutional character and importance and thus should be the foundation of any new EU regulation in this area.
These principles inform our new Sensible Rules – or “Do’s and Don’ts” – which set out obligations and prohibitions relating to Platform Openness, Neutrality, Interoperability and On-platform Competition; Non-discrimination; Fair terms; Controllability of algorithmic decisions and Access to justice; and Access to information; Respect for privacy; Choice on the use of data, and Choice for customers; Simplicity, not Forcing.2
The most important part, however, is the stage of enforcement. What institutional design do we need? How do we enforce new rules? This is the core issue of the whole debate, not least since classic ex post antitrust enforcement takes too long and has achieved too little so far. Our proposal is the following:





The European Commission may trigger Market Investigations, conducted by an independent panel (the New Competition Tool). Such Market Investigations shall be modelled on the UK system with strict timelines, transparent processes and strong order-making powers.
A new Early Alerts Unit would be formed within DG COMP to monitor market developments, particularly movements to unnatural tipping, and the consequent ramifications for application of our Sensible Rules. This unit would report particularly when conditions are arising such that the New Competition Tool should be deployed.
A new Platform Compliance Unit in DG CNCT would be formed to ensure that the new rules remain fit for purpose given such market developments reported by the Early Alert Unit, including the rules’ interpretation and scope of application. These two units would work closely together to ensure the effective application of the new rules, including issuing guidance.
A new Platform Complaints Panel would be set up to deal swiftly and independently with private complaints of violations of the rules, e.g. regarding access to data.





Effective enforcement must keep pace with market dynamics, and requires sensible and flexible rules. As the underlying study underpinning our thinking was written during the German Presidency of the EU, and in the context of discussions leading up to enactment of a Digital Markets Act, and creation of a New Competition Tool, our proposals are necessarily European in institutional focus.  However, we welcome developments to create Digital Markets Units and ex ante regulation in other jurisdictions, and thus hope our proposals will offer inspiration for how all competition authorities and digital regulators can work best together to restore digital competition.
The reasons for new regulatory efforts vis-à-vis digital giants are obvious: Some market platforms and aggregators have tipped the balance of market power among themselves, and others – particularly small businesses and consumers. Some of the fundamentals of commerce have changed as business has moved to a digital environment. There are many benefits from this as well – in terms of increased opportunities from scale, scope and reaching new markets. Consumers have benefitted from greater choice, speed of delivery and a feeling of engagement, tailored solutions and even advertising. However, several government and academic studies and investigations have found violations of antitrust, consumer protection, and privacy law, including combinations of them all. Germany has been a leader in this regard, offering inspiring studies, targeted legislative amendments and leading investigations. Nevertheless, the problems are bigger than any one nation can remedy. And in many cases even European findings of infringements have not always been able to be remedied. They have attracted enormous fines, but only after long and tortuous litigation, with many appeals. And only rarely has the actual ill-conduct been remedied, and if then, all too late or in a piece-meal and incomplete manner.
The actual causes of these ills are asymmetric market power, not only between giant platforms and aggregators on the one hand, and small businesses and consumers on the other, but also as between the tech giants and government itself. The balance needs to be re-set, or a levelling of the regulatory playing field if you will. This calls for new thinking to address new problems, and new competition tools and asymmetric and ex ante regulation to address the growing and troubling asymmetry of market power and its resulting inequities. The crucial task is to implement this new and necessary set of instruments without undoing or jeopardizing the many benefits of the new digital environment, to do so “in real time,” and to do so in a way which ensures that competition law, consumer protection, and privacy guarantees are upheld and balanced. To do nothing is not an option. First, because the inequities of the imbalances of power will only worsen. Second, because this in turn would lead to political calls for vast regulatory change which could stultify what are undoubted exciting and vibrant markets. What is needed – we argue – are sensible rules, backed up with effective enforcement. Relying on ex post law enforcement is insufficient: we urgently need new rules, and new institutional capabilities to guarantee effective enforcement.
To make one point clear: A new regulatory approach is not the ultimate and only answer to the many transformations of digitization. European politicians need to do much more – incentivize innovation, create a digital infrastructure, take care of those left behind, or educate children in using digital tools. All this is beyond our study – the regulatory framework for gatekeepers is merely one part of restoring balance.
 
Rules for Effective Enforcement
Effective enforcement of ex ante rules relies on three key factors:



Compliance with these rules should be automatic and swift.
Enforcement requires new institutional capabilities, and a strong interplay between these functions and the responsible officers (e.g. both within and between DG COMP and DG CNCT, with national institutions, and market actors).
Rules need to be flexible enough so that they can be updated without legislative proceedings that are too complicated.



As such, we welcome enactment of a new Market Investigations Regime, as contemplated in the consultation for the New Competition Tool, implemented by DG COMP. We note insights from the similar tool in the UK show how it has already operated in some markets to impose interoperability and data portability remedies on platforms, accelerating innovation, technological development, and competition. Market investigations can be readily implemented at the EU level, including related to binding timelines, open processes, and independence of decision-making. The read-across between market investigations remedies, themselves a form of ex ante regulation, and a regulatory regime is clear. We see a need and opportunity for a strong interplay between market investigations by DG COMP, and evolving regulation, for example, by DG CNCT.
 
Securing the Interplay in Brussels
We propose a much stronger interplay between, in particular, DG COMP and DG CNCT in enforcing the new rules effectively.
Making the DGs act much more in concert means to look at their specific qualities: DG COMP is the only body in the European Commission having a vast experience in direct contacts with undertakings. Officials there are used to leading investigations, interpreting data, defining remedies and sanctions, sometimes battling with parties. Direct enforcement should rest with this body. DG CNCT and DG GROW are strong policy-making departments that have a broader view on economic and social needs in the EU. They can assure that the legal framework for platforms is not out of touch with two essential aims of this Commission: Building the digital single market and unleashing the power of digital innovation. They also have a view on the social costs that may come with certain platform behavior as well as with regulation. It is important to connect their policy-making power with the competition principles that are primarily pursued by DG COMP.
 
Market Investigations and Ex Ante Rules
Clearly, we support the introduction of a tool on the European level that is close to the Market Investigation tool in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The charm of these investigations is that the team looking at markets can investigate without prior infringement or suspicion of infringement. The focus is much broader: Do markets function? Such investigations start as a fact-gathering endeavor with all market participants joined at the table, and it moves to remedies that are discussed and may address individual undertakings, but also regulatory boundaries. We find it important that governments and the EU may also be targeted by such investigations and that the teams come up with suggestions of how to amend the market framework. In the UK, this has led to the much-applauded Open Banking initiative, for instance.
Equally clearly, while we view market investigations as a valuable addition to the Commission’s competition toolkit (with enforcement of Art. 101, 102 TFEU and merger control remaining in full force), they are unlikely to provide a complete solution to competition concerns in digital platforms. As such, the Commission’s proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large digital platforms is necessary. Ex ante rules in the form of do’s and don’ts provide clear guidance for companies. We need to move beyond the P2B-regulation with its requirements of transparency since transparency does not help if you are dependent or in an unfavorable bargaining position.
As such, and to assist both of its competition and regulatory initiatives, we recommend that the Commission establish two new units. First, at DG CNCT, a Platform Compliance Unit for new and specific regulatory obligations. And second, within DG COMP, an Early Alert Unit relating to tipping markets. Additionally, for the New Competition Tool, we propose to have independent Market Investigation Teams.



Market Investigation Teams
For Market Investigations with the New Competition Tool, we suggest that each investigation gets its own terms of reference and is conducted by an independent panel that is composed of experts – including, of course, Commission staff. The decisions of this panel should be independent.






The Platform Compliance Unit
At DG CNCT, a new “Platform Compliance Unit” would be formed that is competent for the ex ante regulation of platforms, monitoring platforms and issuing compliance orders, as well as forward-looking guidance. To this end, the P2B-regulation would have to be amended and turned into a regulation that provides a framework for digital platforms in the European Union.
In order to retain flexibility, the regulation should foresee two special features: Firstly, there should be a possibility to subject certain undertakings and sectors to a special rule (asymmetric regulation). Secondly, the Platform Compliance Unit would need some flexibility in defining new rules without going through the burdensome procedure of an amendment of an EU regulation. This speaks in favor of a more flexible legal provision that can be amended in an easier fashion. Such a rule could take the form of a delegated act, provided that the essential features of rules on remedying structural imbalances in markets are set forth in the basic regulation. New rules should be based on the outcome of a market investigation.
The Platform Compliance Unit would also be in a position to exempt certain platforms from some or all of the obligations. This will be particularly helpful for new market entrants or platforms with less deep pockets so that concentration processes of the large companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook) may have a counterweight in the market. Before declaring these obligations binding, the parties would of course be heard and the Early Alert Unit at DG COMP consulted.






The Early Alert Unit 
Within DG COMP, an Early Alert Unit would investigate where a tipping of markets is suspected of developing. To this aim, the Early Alert Unit should regularly monitor markets where it is likely that a platform may change the market structure in the near future. Such an investigation would not be as elaborate as a sector inquiry or a market investigation, but simply amount to a monitoring and largely be fueled by publicly available information and voluntary information provided from market players.
If the Early Alert Unit has indications that a competition for the market is going to take place and a “tipping” is likely in the near future, based on scenarios experienced so far, it could suggest that the set of substantive rules are made binding for the relevant platform and be complied with. This would require early communication and concurring decision-making with the Platform Compliance Unit at DG CNCT. This is not to hamstring a nascently successful platform, or impede it from growing swiftly to a position of genuine success, or what we call natural tipping. But that growth must not be through anti-competitive acts or features for example, through exclusionary acts, banning multi-homing, self-preferencing, or non-transparent practices or misuse of data, nor must the tipping itself jeopardize the effective functioning of markets, through, for example, exclusionary or exploitative behavior.



 
An example of the interplay
We foresee the Early Alert Unit as having the ability to identify the causes of tipping markets, engage with platforms and others to identify the extent to which a further market investigation is warranted, and throughout be able to engage with the Platform Compliance Unit in DG CNCT, to ensure that reasonable rules have been complied with during the platform’s growth. The role of the Early Alert Unit could thus be described as that of an investigatory arm of DG CNCT’s Platform Compliance Unit. The Early Alert Unit’s function extends to recommending a market investigation. If it appears that behavior is occurring that involves a violation of our rules, and this is contributing to the platform’s growth and a potential unnatural tipping of the market, then the solution is not to await another two years of further market investigation. The first act instead is to communicate with the Platform Compliance Unit and get the rules obeyed, and the platform in compliance. This may avoid the rationale for a market investigation and its attendant delay for worthwhile remedies. The operating principle throughout should always be to remedy problems as expeditiously as possible, ideally through mandating compliance with our ex ante rules. To enable quick measures, an appeal against such a compliance order would not have suspensive effect unless otherwise ordered by the courts.
The Early Alert Unit would also be able to propose new substantive rules for the platform regulation to the Platform Compliance Unit at DG CNCT. The proposal would also be vetted by DG COMP’s Chief Economist Team and the Legal Service before being made to DG CNCT. DG CNCT would have an obligation to consider and reply substantively to the proposal within a set period of time.
The Early Alert Unit should closely cooperate with national competition agencies and could delegate some of its market monitoring powers to these authorities depending on usual principles of effectiveness. In this regard a more active engagement of the European Competition Network is viewed as useful, as well as proportionate.
Ex ante rules and compliance with them can be monitored by the Platform Compliance Unit, akin to a supervisory function, but there needs to be an actual enforcement mechanism to handle disputes, as well as build up precedent.



The Platform Complaints Panel We suggest introducing a Platform Complaints Panel that works like an arbitration mechanism or an ombudsperson for platforms. It should draw on independent adjudicators, potentially with experience in the sectors affected, and offer a rapid remedy to violations that are observed by market participants. The system would thus give a quick remedy to those who wish to stop certain practices by the operator at fast pace. Instead of leaving this to the public judiciary or the Platform Compliance Unit that may be easily overburdened or to an arbitration mechanism set up by the platform operator, it would be best to have an independent panel to regulate the claims. Upon direction by the Platform Compliance Unit, certain platforms of a particular status would be subjected to submitting to such a panel. In this regard we recommend a standing panel of independent adjudicators, supported by staff from DG CNCT, and with powers to decide on complaints brought by private parties where an allegation of a breach of the rules is made. This Platform Complaints Panel would operate swiftly, relying on a paper-based adjudication mechanism with strict timelines, with the only operating principle being to identify whether a platform is in violation of the rules, identify any objective justifications, and order corrective measures if necessary to restore competition. Appeals may be on the merits, but would necessarily be swift, given the adjudicative approach intended.
The panel would be competent to deal with individual concerns and complaints relating to conflicts of users with the platform, but also users on the platform with each other. A typical example may be that a supplier of goods on a marketplace complains that the platform does not disclose transaction data as required in a possible ex ante rule. The Platform Complaints Panel would look at the case and order a quick remedy for the parties.



 
Conclusion
In our view, it is necessary to define the principles first that should govern our vision of living in a digitized economy. We stick to the principles of free competition, fair intermediation, and sovereignty of users in decision-making. This leads to sensible rules – in the following Appendix – that have to be respected by platforms due to the unique characteristics of digital platforms (operating with network effects and large amounts of data). These rules, often coming from individual competition cases, should go into an ex ante-rulebook for platforms. Whether all platforms should be targeted in the same way is a different question. We think that some rules may extend to all digital platforms, some platforms may be exempted, remedies may be tougher for large gatekeepers.
Secondly, it is vital to model the New Competition Tool according to the experiences in the United Kingdom with the Market Investigation Tool. The advantage of such a regime is that it enables the body to look into the whole market without biases or pre-determination. It also makes sure to come up with tailored remedies that at a next stage could go into the rulebook as ex ante rules. Obviously, certain safeguards for this regime are vital. In particular, we advocate to make the panel conducting a market investigation largely independent from other institutions and to have external experts on board.
The third pillar of effective enforcement is a regime that is tailored to the deficits with competition cases in the platform economy. Since competition law enforcement proved to take too long, we advocate an interplay of DG CNCT overseeing the reasonable ex ante rules and DG COMP as the strong enforcement body of the Commission. We wish to secure their interplay combining their strengths. An Early Alert Unit is to be set up at DG COMP to step in where a platform is about to gain a “winner takes it all” position. A Platform Compliance Unit is to be set up at DG CNCT dealing with policy and the ex ante rules for platforms. Both bodies need a close cooperation mechanism. Finally, enforcement should foresee a Platform Complaints Panel that resolves the issues of compliance with the help of market participants in a swift manner. These three bodies strictly address only situations where there is a structural imbalance of powers.
The ideas sketched in this paper are just that – ideas. They do not represent a final conclusion, but are an invitation to discuss with public and private stakeholders how the institutional set-up could be further developed to be fit for the platform economy.
 

Appendix
Sensible rules



Rules for free competition
Openness: Platforms must not impose undue restrictions on the ability of users of the platform (business or consumers) to use other providers that compete with the platform or to compete with the platform themselves. 
This rule is aimed at exclusivity arrangements. Such arrangements can take the form of direct contractual obligations or indirect obligations having the same effect or technical restrictions that make it impossible to switch to other providers without a substantial loss.  A particular form of this affecting suppliers and customers are attempts to hinder portability of data. If customers cannot move their acquired information, contacts, etc. to another platform or service provider, competition will not be possible.
Neutrality: Platforms must not mislead users or unduly influence competitive processes or outcomes by employing means to self-preference their own services or products (or where the platform derives a commercial benefit) over services or products of competitors. 
Such a differential treatment, for instance through rankings that are based on the profitability for the intermediary platform, may be misleading for customers, drain companies that depend on the platform and harm competition. The rationale for this rule can be found in the Google Search (Shopping) case, the practice is also currently under investigation in the complaint by Spotify against Apple.
Interoperability: Platforms must make it possible for undertakings to build products that are interoperable. 
Interoperability guarantees competition, it must not be unreasonably restricted. Similarly, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) must be open so that third party technology can be integrated and become a competitive tool. Interoperability has become key in the digital economy – where this does not work, the provider of the foreclosed technology will be able to set up technological lock-ins for suppliers and customers. Interoperability is an established feature of competition law ever since the Microsoft case.
On-platform competition: Platforms that have created marketplaces must ensure that there is free on-platform competition.
If, for instance, competitors agree on prices or discriminate against others, it is the platform operator who needs to take the first steps. This may be a matter for competition by design (taking technological precautions, for instance against the visibility of certain information for other suppliers) or a part of the liability of the organizer of a forum for what happens in that forum. Whoever makes the rules in a marketplace needs to respect the ordre public – including antitrust rules.



 



Rules for fairness of intermediation
Non-discrimination: Platforms must not discriminate against individual suppliers seeking access to the platform, and may only base any exclusion on substantive, transparent, and objective grounds.
In a scenario where one platform won the race for organizing the market, competition takes place at the periphery. Suppliers of goods and services need to get access to the platform. In such a gatekeeper situation, discrimination would amount to foreclosure of the market for specific suppliers. It would no longer be the customer who acts as the referee in the market, but the platform operator. Competition on the merits would be reduced. Such kinds of discrimination are viewed critically in competition law.
Fair terms: Platforms must trade on fair and reasonable contractual terms, without exploitative pricing or acts
The basic assumption of contract law is that the contractual partners meet on a level playing field and thus are able to secure a win-win-situation. Where one partner has such a structural advantage that the bargaining position is completely out of balance, the law needs to step in and find remedies.
Controllability of algorithmic decisions, AI and reviews: Platforms must be transparent and fair about the working of their algorithms – and this needs to be controllable. 
Platforms may have considerable influence over the businesses of suppliers using the platform to match with customers. If such platforms change their terms & conditions, their rankings or other parameters, they may spark a domino effect for companies using the platform. The most stunning examples can be found where ranking algorithms are changed and thus companies tumble in their positions, making it virtually impossible for some to reach out to customers.
Access to justice: Platforms must submit to an independent arbitration mechanism.
Market actors enjoy the right to seek redress if there are conflicts with business partners. Since the public judiciary is often too slow and too costly for many disputes, platforms should bind themselves to an arbitration system – for disputes between the platform and users (be it commercial or consumers), but also for disputes among users of the platform.



 



Rules for sovereignty of decision-making
Access to information: Platforms must give access to customer and transaction data to the suppliers involved in that transaction.
Platforms squeeze in between suppliers and consumers. For companies offering goods or services this means that they may lose the interface with their customers. Information and transactions are often operated by the platform in a way that does not necessarily guarantee a flow of relevant information to the supplier. This means that important business signals (such as price data) may be lost. Therefore, platforms must give access to customer and transaction data to the suppliers involved in that transaction. This idea forms part of the Amazon investigations and is also to be found in Section 19a of the German Draft Bill.
Respect privacy: Platforms must offer a real choice on the use of data (which data, which application, which sources, combination of data). 
As the German Federal Court of Justice has argued, this is not just a matter of privacy rules, but – as in the Facebook case – a matter for competition and constitutional law. As a starting point, platforms need to keep the use of data in line with the principle of data minimization (only asking for the data essential for the service) unless customers had a real choice to decide otherwise.
Give a choice: Platforms must allow customers to take decisions. 
These decisions should relate to the most important economic decisions: What services to use, how to spend money. The more such decisions are taken by the operator, the more users and suppliers are driven out of their decision-making capacity (example: introduction of a payment service that has to be used mandatorily, or providing a browser with the operating system without leaving the user a real choice). As in the Microsoft browser case, offering a drop-down-menu may serve as a countermeasure.
Keep it simple: Platforms must give users the service they ask for, but not impose mandatory extensions of service.
Again, this follows from the line of reasoning set out be the German Federal Court of Justice in the Facebook case. Providing all sorts of services, usually aiming at making the customer more dependent or incentivize her to stay for longer in the digital ecosystem, resembles the problem of illegal tying: Competition on the merits is again replaced by the use of leverage effects. Remedies include a fair design of default modes so that informed customer choice is really facilitated.

170,"October 30, 2020",Diversification Is At The Heart Of Competition,"
By: Richard N. Langlois (Truth on the Market)
Market share has long been the talisman of antitrust economics.  Once we properly define what “the product” is, all we have to do is look at shares in the relevant market.  In such an exercise, today’s high-tech firms come off badly.  Each of them has a large share of the market for some “product.” What I appreciate about Nicolas Petit’s notion of “moligopoly” is that it recognizes that genuine competition is a far more complex and interesting phenomenon, one that goes beyond the category of “the product.”
In his chapter 4, Petit lays out how this works with six of today’s large high-tech companies, adding Netflix to the usual Big Five of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.  If I understand properly, what he means by “moligopoly” is that these large firms have their hands in many different relevant markets.  Because they seem to be selling different “products,” they don’t seem to be competing with one another.  Yet, in a fundamental sense, they are very much competing with one another, and perhaps with firms that do not yet exist.  
In this view, diversification is at the heart of competition.  Indeed, Petit wonders at one point whether we are in a new era of “conglomeralism.”  I would argue that the diversified high-tech firms we see today are actually very unlike the conglomerates of the late twentieth century.  In my view, the earlier conglomerates were not equilibrium phenomena but rather short-lived vehicles for the radical restructuring of the American economy in the post- Bretton Woods era of globalization.  A defining characteristic of those firms was that their diversification was unrelated, not just in terms of the SIC codes of their products but also in terms of their underlying capabilities.  If we look only at the products on the demand side, today’s high-tech firms might also seem to reflect unrelated diversification.  In fact, however, unlike in the twentieth-century conglomerates, the activities of present-day high-tech firms are connected on the supply side by a common set of capabilities involving the deployment of digital technology…

By: Steven J. Cernak (The Antitrust Attorney)
On October 6, 2020, the Antitrust Subcommittee of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee issued its long-anticipated Majority Report of its Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets.  As expected, the Report detailed its findings from its investigation of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon along with recommendations for actions for Congress to consider regarding those firms.
In addition, the Report included recommendations for some general legislative changes to the antitrust laws.  Included in those recommendations were proposals for Congress to overrule several classic antitrust opinions.  Because this blog has summarized several classic antitrust cases over the years (see here and here, for example), we thought we would summarize some of the opinions that now might be on the chopping block.  This post concerns two classic Supreme Court opinions on refusal to deal or essential facility monopolization claims, Trinko and linkLine.
House Report on Refusal to Deal and Essential Facilities
The Report’s recommendations for general changes in the antitrust laws included several aimed at increasing enforcement of Sherman Act Section 2’s prohibition of monopolization.  In particular, the Report recommended that:
Congress consider revitalizing the “essential facilities” doctrine, or the legal requirement that dominant firms provide access to their infrastructural services or facilities on a nondiscriminatory basis.  To clarify the law, Congress should consider overriding judicial decisions that have treated unfavorably essential facilities- and refusal to deal-based theories of harm.  (Report, pp. 396-7)
The two judicial opinions listed were Verizon Commc’ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398 (2004) and Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U.S. 438 (2009)…

172,"October 30, 2020","How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria (or, say, Big Tech)","
By: Pinar Akman (Chilling Competition)
Nicolas Petit’s book Big Tech and the Digital Economy comes at a time of increasingly polarised and politicised debates on how one solves a “problem” like big tech.[1] It presents a meticulously studied anatomy of six big tech companies – Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix. It offers nuanced prescriptions of what one can do about this group of companies, which displays levels of growth, size, and market capitalisation that are unheard of in economic history. Petit’s proposals are primarily aimed at competition law and regulation, but the book has a wide scope that will be of appeal to a broader audience due to the book’s incorporation of management, technology, economics, and different areas of law such as tax and data protection.
Petit’s book easily distinguishes itself from the crowd by its clear-headed inquiry into whether there is a problem with big tech and, if so, what competition law can and should do about it. His analysis is objective, yet critical, unlike the – what Petit calls – “airport books” on the topic, where everyone can find a narrative about what’s right or wrong with big tech to suit her personal taste or “echo chamber”. Petit’s book, in contrast, displays the best qualities of public discourse on a subject of contemporary significance (such as open-mindedness), whilst avoiding the worst (such as the ad hominem). It is both very accessible for the non-specialist and full of thought-provoking ideas for the specialist. This particular piece will discuss one such important and interesting theory put forward in the book, namely that traditional antitrust principles modelled on “rivalry” should be abandoned or radically altered in digital markets.[2]
According to Petit, the protection of rivalry is not always socially beneficial in industries with increasing returns to adoption, such as the digital markets under scrutiny.[3] Petit’s theory is premised on the idea that “in industries with increasing returns, economic forces … produce incentives on structural monopoly firms to compete by indirect entry in untipped markets, and avoid privately and socially inefficient rivalry in tipped markets”.[4] According to Petit, “[r]ivalry in tipped markets is privately inefficient because it is very costly for the direct entrant, and it is socially inefficient when there are increasing returns to scale due to rising marginal benefits”.[5] Thus, “[a] sound antitrust regime should … preserve competitive pressure on monopoly firms in markets that have tipped and in which incentives to indirect entry have therefore disappeared”.[6] One implication is that “antitrust should focus on cases of harm to competition in markets that have tipped, and be more forgiving toward the leveraging of market power in untipped markets”…

173,"October 30, 2020",To Comment or not to Comment on the Ex Ante Rules for Gatekeepers (+ 9 Other Questions on the Draft Proposals),"
By Alfonso Lamadrid (Chilling Competition)
Until today, I had avoided commenting publicly on the ex ante regulatory instrument that the Commission is considering for “platforms acting as gatekeepers”. There were three reasons for this. First, unlike the New Competition Tool, I did not see this initiative as a threat to competition law as we know it. Second, I do understand that there is a certain public anxiety about digital markets (to some degree justified, to some degree exaggerated by interested stakeholders), and a margin for regulation to legitimately address that anxiety and improve things. Third, my opinions could be legitimately criticized as biased because an important part of my work is to advise and represent companies targeted by this initiative. My thinking was that there were already enough people with professional interests making noise in all directions for me to contribute to the cacophony.
Alas, my reasoning on those three fronts has changed after reading the bold leaked drafts that circulate widely since last week. First, I now see a risk that the ex ante rules might have a much greater impact on competition law than I had anticipated. Second, it seems that the current plans might not always be addressed at the issues causing public anxiety, but to a large extent target issues at the core of pending competition cases. Third, I will not falsely pretend my opinions are neutral, but I hope they might add some value to the debate. Experts working against my clients have also  authored some of the influential reports that the leaked documents cite as evidence supporting the need for intervention and, to be sure, I don’t think their views should be disqualified. In addition, given that the rules appear to be crafted to affect only a remarkably limited number of services, it is likely that a majority of stakeholders will feel relieved and/or might not have incentives to voice out concerns, so you might not be exposed to many contrarian views. And even if you are, a lot of the commentary out there seems somewhat radical.
As in other matters, there is excessive polarization here, and even a tendency to look at things through myopic and binary (progressive vs conservative) lenses. Some partisans of regulation invoke “progressive” attitudes as a reason to favor these initiatives. Others claim that they oppose them in line with “conservative” principles. In reality, though, this debate has very little to do with politics. There are media companies who support Trump, Brexit and deny climate change that also support these initiatives (provided they only target their rivals, of course). There are also conservatives who want more regulation and antitrust intervention (even if arguably not always for the right reasons; e.g. at a recent antitrust hearing a Republican Congressman claim Google should be regulated because it favours WHO health advice over Trump’s…). And then there is a vast majority of other perfectly reasonable companies or stakeholders who have legitimate commercial/professional interests in these initiatives passing, or not passing, regardless of politics.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the panel discussion, Digital Platforms: In Need of Regulation?, from the third episode of our series, Antitrust In an Election Year: Challenges Ahead.

Maria COPPOLA:
Hi there. I am delighted to be here today on the CPI session to engage with some of our best and brightest thinkers on this topic of digital platforms. As moderator, I will certainly try to avoid offering my views, but should I fail to do so, they are my own.
Another point on my moderating role, I think many of you saw the traffic after the first presidential debate suggesting that the moderator should have been any mother who had been home with her children since March. In that spirit and without the ability to benefit from a mute button for speakers, I’ll just note that I have spent several months as a single parent working for the FTC teaching at night and dealing with two rowdy boys. Speakers you are forewarned.
Our panel today is going to talk about regulation. This is part of a four series CPI event that has looked at whether our innate trust tools are sufficient, online advertising, I think we’re going to address open versus closed ecosystems later in the week. But today we’re talking about regulation and you’ve just heard Senator Klobuchar’s remarks. She highlighted, of course, the challenges of bringing merger in section two cases in her proposed legislative solutions. I would be remiss not to say that she ...

Leah NYLEN:
Thanks to CCI and Competition Policy International. I’m Leah Nylen Politicos Antitrust reporter. And with me today is Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. The top Democrat on the Senate judiciary’s Antitrust Subcommittee. Thank you for joining us.

Amy KLOBUCHAR:
Well, thanks, Leah. And this is very timely that we’re doing this interview. I think, you know what’s happening, not just before the pandemic, but with the pandemic, we’ve just seen so much more consolidation, slow up, where we call, “The startups slump” and this consolidation just is not good for anyone, whether it’s in tech or other industries as well.
NYLEN:
Well, thank you, let’s get right to it. The Justice Department filed its long awaited antitrust suit against Google over search last week. I know it is still early days, but do you have any immediate reaction to the suit and/or the statement by Democratic attorneys, general, including Minnesota AG Keith Ellison, that they are taking a wait and see approach right now?
KLOBUCHAR:
Well, this is a long overdue start to get this suit going, and I am glad that they have filed this suit. Do I like the timing, just a few weeks before the election? No, because I think that undercut...

176,"October 29, 2020","Vestager Looks For Tighter Rules, Not Break Up Of Big Tech","


European Union digital chief Margrethe Vestager has argued against breaking up Big Tech companies, which is contrary to what some officials want to see in terms of dividing Amazon or Apple into smaller companies, according to a report from 9to5Mac.
Vestager, quoted in a report from The Information, said although these types of companies could be broken up, doing so might pose more challenges, according to 9to5Mac.
“I don’t think it is something that should be introduced in this legislation, and I think one should be very careful with that type of remedy because one should be very sure how it would actually work,” Vestager said, according to the report. “It would tie you up in court for a very, very long time. I think it’s important we try these routes first with the platforms.”
Vestager has pursued robust legislation against companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google in the last few years. Big Tech has been under scrutiny in recent months for concerns of overt dominance, and Vestager’s opinion isn’t necessarily shared by her colleagues, the report stated. Among them is Thierry Breton, Europe’s internal market commissioner, who has expressed a desire to break up the companies in question.
Amid the scrutiny on Big Tech, the EU has stated it will write new rules based around those companies’ dominance. The focus will be on disinformation campaigns, particularly related to the pandemic, with an eye toward making the companies own up to their responsibility in that regard.

The U.S. antitrust agencies function as law enforcers and competition advocates. Giving the Federal Trade Commission market investigation and  remedy  powers  like  those  of  the  UK’s  Competition  and  Markets  Authority would transform the FTC into a market regulator. This kind of authority would be a poor fit for the FTC, given the very different history and context of the U.S. economy and laws – particularly the role of judicial process. The agency should focus on using its existing market study tools to remain abreast of market developments, to guide its own enforcement initiatives, and to provide input to sectoral regulators and legislative bodies on how to enhance competition.

The  recent  hearings  on  digital  markets  rest  upon  the  assumption  that  these markets exhibit unique attributes that the current version of the antitrust  laws  cannot  address.  Specifically,  proponents  of  revising  the  antitrust laws argue first, that there are unique competitive issues with digital  markets  that  are  likely  to  entrench  dominant  firms  and  retard  innovation; second, that digital markets are not behaving in a compet-itive manner; and third, the antitrust laws should be modified to deal with the unique issues in these markets. The truth that digital markets are not unique, except for the fact that there is actually far more entry in these markets than in other sectors of the economy.  Indeed, it seems that that those pushing for reform to the antitrust laws have a broader goal  in  mind,  namely  to  bring  large  American  companies  to  heel  re-gardless of whether they are in the tech sector or not.  Such new rules and regulations are likely retard innovation and investment throughout the American economy, making it potentially easier for less innovative and lower quality competitors to compete, a result that is most certainly harmful to American consumers and the economy as a whole.

Judges can be too demanding of plaintiffs and thereby stymie meritorious cases, but that is not what happened in FTC v. Qualcomm. The FTC challenged several of Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and sought to reduce the royalties it collected from makers of cellular devices. But the litigation failed to elicit a cogent economic theory explaining how the tactics Qualcomm used to obtain higher royalties had the effect of undermining  competition  among  modem  chip  suppliers,  as  the  FTC  alleged. The Ninth Circuit kept antitrust out of matters dealt with by contract and patent law. If the Democrats are swept into power, courts might find it necessary to keep antitrust out of all sorts of matters.

The majority staff of the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law recently published detailed allegations of anticompetitive conduct against four tech giants — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.2 The antitrust cognoscenti might be reminded of the 50th Congress, when the House Committee on Manufacturers published hearings on four industrial giants — the Cotton Bagging Trust, the Standard Oil Trust, the Sugar Trust, and the Whisky Trust. Senator John Sherman followed up with his anti-trust bill on the first day of next Congress, and after extensive revision, the Sherman Act became law on July 2, 1890.3

What  should  the  US  do  about  Big  Tech?    This  essay  proposes  antitrust  rule-making  by  the  Federal  Trade  Commission.    Case-by-case  litigation  is too slow and too piecemeal, and the Sherman Act jurisprudence is too conservative.  Break-ups  are  unlikely  to  be  ordered;  even  divestitures  of  anticompetitive  acquisitions  may  prove  difficult  to  implement  where  a  platform  has  deeply  integrated  those  acquisitions  into  its  operations.    Legislative restructuring and a required separation of functions raise the need  for  on-going  supervision  and  the  potential  for  regulatory  capture.    In comparison, the FTC is an established agency with competition as a core mission.  It already has significant evidence of Big Tech’s economic power  and  how  they  use  it  to  stifle  competition  and  take  advantage  of  people as consumers, users, and budding competitors. The FTC uniquely has  power  over  anticompetitive,  unfair,  and  anti-consumer  tactics,  can  address the problems holistically, and can best assure that Big Tech plays by  the  rules.    With  rule-making  proceedings,  the  United  States  would  finally join the international conversation over how to deal with the global challenge that Big Tech platforms present.

Antitrust sits at the cusp today. That is driven at least in part by the rise of the great digital tech firms of the day and uncertainty about whether antitrust is the right tool to respond to the issues that they raise.

As I write this, we are seven months into the global coronavirus pandemic and the feared fall second wave seems to have arrived with no obvious end in sight. China’s economy seems to be growing, but other economies are stalled or shrinking as consumers shrink back from a host of normal economic activities. And it is roughly one week before the 2020 U.S. election. There is certainly the possibility of a new President and a new Democratic majority in the Senate (it seems almost certain the Democrats will retain the House).
The House antitrust subcommittee recently released its enormous report on its sixteen-month investigation into digital marketplaces. On Tuesday, October 20, 2020, the long-awaited U.S. antitrust case against Google finally arrived. It is clearly the most significant U.S. antitrust case in the tech section since the 1998 case against Microsoft. That case, of course, would ultimately find that Microsoft had illegally maintained its operating system monopoly in its eff...

The  COVID-19  virus  has  upended  our  lives  and  forced  individuals,  businesses, and governments alike to adapt with urgent creativity.  The U.S.  antitrust  enforcement  agencies  in  particular  have  taken  steps  throughout  the  pandemic  to  keep  their  operations  running  smoothly  and  streamline  competitor  collaborations  to  address  the  health  crisis,  but have resisted any major changes to their enforcement philosophy.  In the U.S. economy more broadly, the pandemic has sparked a wave of bankruptcies across many different industries.  Even if the technicalities of the “failing firm” defense are not met, purchases of distressed com-panies that raise antitrust issues are sure to be affected by the implica-tions of collapsing industries.  Finally, COVID-19 has highlighted our reliance on technology platforms for our everyday lives and business, as shown by simultaneous investigations by the U.S. and European anti-trust enforcers and the U.S. House of Representatives.  There are calls for  sweeping  changes  in  antitrust  law  targeted  at  the  big  technology  platforms,  which  would  entail  flipping  presumptions  of  legality  and  overturning decades of court precedent.  These trends are creating the greatest amount of uncertainty in antitrust policy and enforcement in decades.

The DOJ’s No. 2 in its antitrust division has left the Department to return to private practice after a three-year stint helping lead many of the biggest merger investigations of the Trump administration, reported Bloomberg.
Barry Nigro, who was the division’s principal deputy assistant attorney general, is returning to his old law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP in Washington, where he will chair the global antitrust practice, the firm announced Monday, October 26.
“We are pleased to welcome back Barry as chair of our Antitrust and Competition Department,” said David J. Greenwald, chairman of Fried Frank. “His experience leading significant antitrust matters at the Department of Justice and previous service as Deputy Director overseeing the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, coupled with his extensive experience in private practice, will provide critical insight to our clients in M&A transactions and antitrust investigations and litigation.”
Nigro joined the antitrust division from Fried Frank in August 2017, about three months before the administration sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, a lawsuit the Justice Department ultimately lost. The case marked the first time in decades the government sued to block a merger between companies that didn’t compete directly, but it was clouded by politics because of President Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of Time Warner’s CNN.
After AT&T, Nigro went on to work on other high-profile deals, including Bayer AG’s US$66 billion takeover of Monsanto and T-Mobile US’s US$26.5 billion acquisition of Sprint. In both investigations, the Justice Department required asset sales worth billions of dollars to resolve concerns the deals would harm competition. States unsuccessfully sued to stop the Sprint deal earlier this year.
Nigro, who worked under Makan Delrahim, the head of the antitrust division, said Bayer is among the biggest accomplishments during his tenure. The 2018 settlement required the companies to sell US$9 billion of assets to resolve the government’s concerns the deal would harm competition, one of the largest merger divestitures ever. The Department came close to filing a lawsuit to block the merger, Nigro said in an interview.
Nigro and Delrahim were recused from the government’s lawsuit last week against Alphabet’s Google, accusing the search giant of abusing its monopoly. The lawsuit marked the most significant monopoly case in the US in two decades.

State and federal investigators are planning to slap Facebook with antitrust charges as soon as November, four people familiar with the matter told the Washington Post.
Such a lawsuit would mark the government’s latest crackdown on the biggest names in the tech industry, including Apple, Google, and Amazon, for holding monopolies on their respective markets.  
On Thursday, October 22, the Federal Trade Commission met privately to discuss the probe, and plans to file charges within the upcoming weeks, the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the outlet. However, they cautioned that since work is ongoing, that timeline is still be ironed out and may be subject to change. 
Another investigation led by New York Attorney General Letitia James that 46 other state attorneys general joined last year has also been scrutinizing Facebook on antitrust claims, particularly the company’s strategy of buying out potential competitors only to gut their businesses. 
Sources said that state officials are “in the late stages of preparing their complaint” per the Post. A fifth person familiar with the matter told the outlet that investigators expect to have “an initial roster of participants” by Friday.

A request from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to change a decision that let Google and Apple keep providing WeChat for download in app stores in the United States had been turned down by a federal judge in California, Reuters reported.
US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler said the government’s new proof did not modify her view on the Tencent mobile program. DOJ has contended that WeChat poses a risk to national security, as it has with the TikTok video program.
On Friday, October 23, Beeler wrote, “The record does not support the conclusion that the government has ‘narrowly tailored’ the prohibited transactions to protect its national-security interests.”
The judge indicated that the proof “supports the conclusion that the restrictions ‘burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.”
For their part, users of WeChat have contended that the government looked for “an unprecedented ban of an entire medium of communication” and provide just “speculation” of harm from those in the US harnessing WeChat.
WeChat is a mobile app that brings together offerings much like Venmo, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook and is said to be an important part of daily life for many in China.
The app has an average of 19 million daily active users in the US. It is well-used by American ex-pats in China, Chinese pupils, and some Americans who have corporate or personal connections in China.
In September, Beeler blocked a US Commerce Department order to become effective on Sunday, September 20, that would have mandated that the mobile program be taken down from American app stores.
The Commerce Department had indicated on September 18 that providers would be prohibited from distributing WeChat and TikTok.

While the five commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) debate if an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook should be pursued, FTC staffers are in favor of moving forward with the case, according to a Wall Street Journal report (WSJ) on Friday (Oct. 23), citing sources familiar with the matter.
It has been over a year since the FTC started investigating complaints that the social media giant stifled competition. The sources told the WSJ that the commission is expected to vote and hand down a decision in a few weeks.
Even though the investigation has been in progress for more than 12 months, Facebook is still “making its case to the commission.” 
The sources told WSJ that FTC commissioners — three Republicans and two Democrats — held a virtual meeting among themselves to determine their next move. Per rules, the commissioners have to announce a formal meeting in order to discuss any enforcement actions as a group.
One part of the FTC investigation focuses on Facebook’s purchases of companies that could be considered possible rivals. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.
The FTC meeting comes on the heels of an antitrust filing against Google by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The suit says that Google uses anti-competitive measures to protect its search monopoly.

The accord is part of Snam’s expansion in the technology after the European Union put hydrogen at the heart of its measures to cut greenhouse gases and become climate neutral by 2050. Hydrogen, if made with renewables, could replace coal, oil, and eventually natural gas, and help eliminate about a third of emissions from industries like steel and cement by mid-century, according to Bloomberg.

191,"October 22, 2020","Forget Antitrust Laws. To Limit Tech, Some Say a New Regulator Is Needed.","


By Steve Lohr, New York Times
For decades, America’s antitrust laws — originally designed to curb the power of 19th-century corporate giants in railroads, oil and steel — have been hailed as “the Magna Carta of free enterprise” and have proved remarkably durable and adaptable.
But even as the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday for unlawfully maintaining a monopoly in search and search advertising, a growing number of legal experts and economists have started questioning whether traditional antitrust is up to the task of addressing the competitive concerns raised by today’s digital behemoths. Further help, they said, is needed.
Antitrust cases typically proceed at the stately pace of the courts, with trials and appeals that can drag on for years. Those delays, the legal experts and economists said, would give Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple a free hand to become even more entrenched in the markets they dominate.
A more rapid-response approach is required, they said. One solution: a specialist regulator that would focus on the major tech companies. It would establish and enforce a set of basic rules of conduct, which would include not allowing the companies to favor their own services, exclude competitors or acquire emerging rivals and require them to permit competitors access to their platforms and data on reasonable terms.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is based in France, announced that its worldwide tax reform blueprint will be put in front of the Group of 20 finance ministers.
If a consensus is formed, the framework could be put in place by the middle of next year, the Associated Press reported.
However, the OECD cautioned about the potential of an international trade war brought by different nations rolling out digital services taxes on their own to assist in their economic rebounds from COVID-19 in the event nations don’t all agree on the new tax regulations.
The OECD has been trying to find a compromise among more than 135 countries on digital taxes, spurred by long standing demands from France and other European Union nations for US digital giants like Amazon and Google to pay their fair share. The US, however, has resisted.
“The last thing you want is, at this time of COVID-19, to have to deal at the same time with further trade tensions,” OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said in an online press briefing.

As reported by the Financial Times, regulators in the European Union are crafting a “hit list” of roughly 20 companies, Big Tech marquee names among them, that will face tougher rules over market competition and other operational activities.
Citing unnamed sources, the FT reported that the companies on the list will be selected based on market share of revenues and number of users – and though the actions are ostensibly not targeting individual companies, many firms such as Facebook (and Google and Apple) will fall within the criteria governed by the list.
According to reports, the new rules would also change the way these firms gather and use data.
The new regulations would also reshape the manner in which these companies collect and harness information. It is probable that size and market share will be determining factors in who lands on the “Big Tech hit list.”

Russian search giant Yandex said in a statement on Friday, October 16, that merger talks with TCS Group Holding (Tinkoff) have fallen apart. 
“Yandex regrets to confirm that it has not been able to agree to definitive transaction terms with the core shareholders of Tinkoff, and accordingly that the parties have mutually agreed to terminate discussions regarding a possible offer by Yandex for 100% of the share capital of Tinkoff,” Yandex stated in a press release.
Yandex, incorporated in the Netherlands, is one of the biggest internet firms in Europe and the largest ride-hailing and search platform in Russia. The merger deal was originally announced last month. TCS Group Holding is the parent company of the Russian lender Tinkoff Bank.
“We wish to express our appreciation for the efforts Tinkoff has made in pursuing our discussions, and our continued respect for the Tinkoff team. We wish them well for their future endeavors,” Yandex stated in the release.
Last month’s preliminary deal was set at US$5.5 billion in cash and shares, according to a Bloomberg report. According to a letter seen by Bloomberg to employees at TCS Group Holding, Russian billionaire founder Oleg Tinkov wrote that the merger talks discussed creating “Russia’s biggest non-state company. It turned out they just wanted to buy Tinkoff Bank.”
Tigran Khudaverdyan, deputy chief executive officer of Yandex, sent a letter to its employees, also seen by Bloomberg, that announced plans to build its own FinTech capabilities. 
“We were constantly making concessions to Oleg and were eager to keep his role in managing the bank and helping Yandex as well,” Khudaverdyan said. “Unfortunately, after each stage of negotiations Oleg raised new requirements.”
Yandex is considered Russia’s Google and its technology offerings and capabilities include a 15-minute grocery delivery service that was launched in January.

196,"October 19, 2020",WSJ Tech Conference Shows Bipartisan Agreement On Curbing Big Tech,"


At the Wall Street Journal’s virtual conference, both Democrats and Republicans commented on believing that tech companies have too much power, and thus antitrust authorities should move to curb it. 
Where they disagree, however, is exactly how to rein in the companies, especially when it comes to regulating perceptions of political bias on the platforms. 
Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri both called for stronger antitrust enforcement and privacy protections for users of technology products during a panel discussion Monday, October 19, at the WSJ Tech Live conference. 
Sen. Hawley said authorities should bring an antitrust case against Google-parent Alphabet and probably Facebook. He also urged reform of the Federal Trade Commission to strengthen its enforcement of antitrust rules.
Rep. Cicilline agreed that laws and federal agencies needed to be modernized to give the government new-enforcement capabilities. “What we really want is antitrust enforcement that brings real competition back into the marketplace,” he said.
Even as they agreed on the power tech companies wield, the two lawmakers disagreed on the question of conservative bias. 
Sen. Hawley said that Facebook’s actions last week to throttle a New York Post article based on email messages allegedly taken from the laptop of Joe Bidens’ son, Hunter Biden, amounted to an abuse of monopoly power. “I believe in a free press and when you have a monopoly on Facebook that is attempting to stop the distribution of the news, we have a problem,” he said.
Rep. Cicilline disputed the idea that Facebook was biased against conservatives, saying that conservative voices are regularly among the most dominant on the platform. “If there’s a conservative bias on this platform, they’re doing a pretty lousy job,” he said. 
But the two lawmakers did agree that privacy protections was an area where the US government could push back on tech companies power. “Consumers ought to have more control over their data,” Mr. Hawley said.

Japan is teaming up with the US and Europe to develop tough new regulations to take on big tech, according to a Reuters report on Monday, October 19.
Kazuyuki Furuya, new chairman of Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), said Tokyo could launch an investigation on any big deals or collaborations with Fitbit fitness tracker maker.
“If the size of any merger or business-tie up is big, we can launch an anti-monopoly investigation into the buyer’s process of acquiring a startup (like Fitbit),” Furuya told Reuters. “We’re closely watching developments including in Europe.”
EU antitrust regulators in August started probing a US$2.1 billion acquisition deal for Google to buy Fitbit. Furuya added that Japan will align closely with the US and Europe, “and respond to any moves that hamper competition. This is an area I will push through aggressively,” he said.
The big tech giants Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, also known by the acronym “GAFA,”  are facing numerous antitrust investigations from the west.
Global collaboration is important, Furuya said, since GAFA and other tech platforms have similar business practices worldwide.
Furuya also told Reuters that the JFTC would analyze Japan’s mobile phone market to find ways that could increase competition, which could help cut Japan’s mobile phone charges.

198,"October 15, 2020",France & Netherlands Unite To Back EU Big Tech Legislation,"


The EU’s markets regulator has been called on by French and Dutch officials to take preemptive measures against US tech giants to curb their ever-growing influence on markets.
French digital minister Cedric O and Netherlands secretary of state for digital affairs Mona Keijzer have put forward a paper calling on European regulators to act decisively against “gatekeeper” platforms, according to the Financial Times.
The EU has been devising legislation to regulate these companies, including the likes of Apple, Google, and Facebook, with regulators seeking broader powers to clamp down on anti-competitive industry practices.
Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, told the FT last month these new powers could also include the ability to break up or sell off operations in Europe if their dominance is deemed too dangerous to small businesses. These powers may even stretch to excluding big companies from the single market altogether.
The paper proposed by the French and Dutch ministers explore similar measures, including forcing these companies to allow users to take their private data to a competing platform. Other proposals include banning firms from promoting their own services, such as Google advancing its other interests ahead of similar services offered by smaller rivals.
“France and the Netherlands have different cultures and come from different positions,” said O, according to the FT. “But we have a common interest, from a sovereignty point of view, from a competition point of view to regulate tech players.”
Keijzer, meanwhile, added that regulators should devise rules that prevent platforms from becoming too big, adding “breaking up big companies can be a possibility.”

Professor Joshua Wright — a University Professor of Law at George Mason University, Director of the law school’s Global Antitrust Institute, a former FTC Commissioner, and one of the nation’s leading scholars of antitrust law and policy. Professor Wright and Jan Rybnicek recently co-authored an essay on recent calls to use antitrust law to regulate or break up “big tech” companies. The essay is titled “A Time for Choosing: The Conservative Case Against Weaponizing Antitrust,” and it is among the first essays in a series published by National Affairs, a quarterly journal on policy.
The series, edited by the Gray Center’s Executive Director, Adam White, is “Big Tech, Big Government: The Challenges of Regulating Internet Platforms.” In this episode, Professor Wright discusses his essay, particularly in light of the new House Judiciary Committee staff report calling for government regulation or break-up of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.

200,"October 14, 2020",EC Narrows Focus Of Amazon Probe,"


EU antitrust regulators may narrow the scope of their year-long investigation into Amazon to speed up the case against the US online retail giant, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Splitting up the Amazon case could address complaints by rivals that antitrust enforcers take too long to address harm done to them through anti-competitive practices and that rulings fail to keep pace with evolving markets.
EU regulators adopted a similar tactic against Alphabet’s Google by first addressing complaints about its price comparison shopping service, and then opening investigations into other areas of the company’s business.
The European Commission started an investigation into Amazon in July 2019, focusing on whether its dual role as a marketplace for merchants and also as a competitor selling the same products might give it an unfair advantage.
The investigation is also looking at the role of data in the selection of Amazon’s “Buy Box” winners which appear on the right of product pages saying “Buy now” or “Add to basket” and drive about 80% of sales.
However, the EU’s competition enforcer is now considering splitting the two issues to focus on one, making it easier to move forward with the case, one of the people told Reuters.
“The data case seems weaker,” a person said, adding that no final decision had been made on whether to split the case, nor which angle to focus on first.

Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates told CNBC Wednesday morning, October 14, he had been naive about the government scrutiny that comes with getting large when he was running Microsoft.
“Whenever you get to be a super valuable company, affecting the way people communicate and even political discourse being mediated through your system and higher percentage of commerce through your system, you’re going to expect a lot of government attention,” Gates said in the “Squawk Box” interview.
Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust released a report concluding that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google hold monopoly power.
“I was naive at Microsoft and didn’t realize that our success would lead to government attention,” Gates said, referring to Microsoft’s antitrust challenges from over 20 years ago. “And so I made some mistakes , you know, just saying, ‘Hey, I never go to Washington, DC’ And now I don’t think, you know, that naivete is there.”
Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO in the middle of the US Justice Department’s antitrust case, which charged the company had tried to monopolize the web browser market when it bundled Internet Explorer with Windows. The company settled with the DOJ in 2001.

202,"October 13, 2020",Vestager To Take On Big Tech By Merging Antitrust Legislation,"


The EU has put significant resources into taking on “big tech,” including Apple, in recent years. According to Politico, that is only set to increase.
Under Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s executive arm is planning to merge two major legislative initiatives on competition into a single text, EU officials told Politico. 
One is the so-called New Competition Tool, a market investigation tool that would allow competition enforcers to act more swiftly and forcefully. The other is a part of the Digital Services Act, which is a new set of rules due to be unveiled in December for companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon. 
Combined, the new powers would be known as the Digital Markets Act and would carry a hefty wallop for tech giants targeted in its crosshairs. “We’re working on a new legislative proposal focused on digital markets, which would feature two complementary pillars, a combination of ex ante regulation and case-by-case enforcement,” Vestager said in a speech.
The Commission started seeking feedback in June on the New Competition Tool (NCT) as well as on the Digital Services Act (DSA), which will include a list of do’s and don’ts for so-called “gatekeeping platforms” — or those who are indispensable for other companies to reach consumers online — to curb what it sees as anti-competitive behavior.

According to this information, YouTube began asking select creators to tag products in their videos through provided software, and the company is also exploring the possibility of integrating Shopify to sell items directly from the video platform.
The information is still not very clear, since it is not known how YouTube will generate income through these sales or the commission it will charge. However, it is clear that Google is looking for new ways of monetization through this platform.
Without a doubt, the great advantage of YouTube over ecommerce stores, such as Amazon or Mercado Libre, is the number of hours of videos that exist on the platform and include unboxing of products or makeup tutorials, cooking, among others.

204,"October 12, 2020",Europe is walking a tightrope with its looming antitrust reforms,"


By David Meyer, Fortune
The Financial Times reports that the European Commission is drawing up a “hit list” of Big Tech firms that need to be reined in with stronger and more easily enforced competition rules. Unsurprisingly the list is said to include major U.S. players such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon.
The Commission has been planning for some time to reform its antitrust rules, which look set to finally appear next year. There are many reasons for this, including a desire to allow the creation of “European champions” where competition rules currently make this difficult (case in point: the Siemens-Alstom merger, the thwarting of which earned competition chief Margrethe Vestager significant criticism from Germany and France.) But one of the biggest drivers is the growing mismatch between the lightning pace of technological development and the glacial pace of European antitrust enforcement.
As Alan pointed out last week, regulatory measures are sometimes ill-conceived. And perhaps the worst situation can be found where rules are designed to be hard-hitting but, as times change, become practically ineffective.
That is arguably the case with the EU’s regulation of competition in the tech sphere. The bloc may have fined Google nearly $10 billion for various antitrust abuses over the last few years, but a) that’s a limited deterrent for a company with annual revenues north of $160 billion, and b) it took the best part of a decade to get to that point, during which time Google’s abusive activities continued largely unchecked.
As one unnamed insider told the FT, “the immense market power of these platforms is not good for competition.” Hence the Commission’s reported desire to force the companies to share business data with their rivals (a longstanding aim of Vestager’s) and to stick to tougher rules than those applying to their smaller competitors.

205,"October 12, 2020",Antitrust Regulation in the Digital Economy,"
I distinguish between data-based digital antitrust cases and non data-based cases. So far, the emphasis has been on traditional cases where data did not play a direct role. Although new names are used, the theories of harm are also traditional: bundling, exclusive dealing, and foreclosure. While the remedies obtained in some cases have been criticized, I believe that they are appropriate “looking forward” (preventing continuing damage to competition). There might however be a need to focus more on the “damage repairing” function of remedies. There have been few data-based cases. One of the reasons is that property rights on data and basic regulatory rules have not yet been spelled out. In this sense the ongoing allocation of tasks between regulation and antitrust is important.

By Pierre Regibeau1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
While the digital revolution has brought many new products and improved on the delivery of goods and services, it has also raised concerns about increased concentration and potentially abusive conducts that might not be captured adequately by a traditional application of competition policy tools. Of particular note is the increasingly powerful position of so-called digital “gatekeepers,” i.e. digital platforms with significant market power – or even a dominant position – in at least one of the markets in which they are active. While the GAFAMs are the posterchildren of digital gatekeepers, other strong digital players such as various booking platforms, matching platforms or marketplaces might also well fall within the category, now or in the near future.
The competitive issues raised by digitalization of course extends beyond the realm of “platforms” – in the domain of standard setting for example – and they have implications for the fool toolset of competition authorities, from merger review to state aid. However, in this short note, I will limit myself to the “antitrust” part of the EU’s portfolio, with special emphasis on gatekeepers. In doing so I will discuss not only the application of traditional antitrust instruments within the framework of Articles 101 and 102, but I will also comment on the possible emergence of a new “market investigation” tool and the necessary balance between traditional approaches, the new tool and ex ante regulation.
I begin by discussing what I see as the main characteristics of the digital economy in general and digital platforms in particular, briefly sketching out why these features matter for competition policy. I then briefly review the main antitrust actions in the digital sector before coming back in more detail to some of the concerns raised in the first section. I conclude with my thoughts as to how “new instruments” might help us address the specific competition issues raised by the digital sector.
 
II. FEATURES OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
While the digital economy shares many relevant competition characteristics with non-digital sectors, it is nonetheless with a number of features that make it sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate analysis. In order to set up the scene for the following discussion I briefly review these features. I start with aspects that seem fairly unique to the digital sector and then move to characteristics which, although common in other sectors, seem to assume a particular importance in a digital context.
A. “Unique” Features
“Digital” technologies deal with data, be it accumulated data sets, or the information exchanged in any interaction over electronic means of communication. So, data treatment is inescapably at the core of any digitalized sector. What makes the digital economy special though is the manner in which it deals with data: data can be stored and made accessible in huge quantities, they can be processed or analyzed at high speed and they can travel over large distances in the blink of an eye. These characteristics have consequences for competition analysis.
Firstly, they affect market definition both because physical distance becomes less relevant (geographic markets) and because the availability of consumer-specific data enables individually-tailored offerings. Secondly, because data is central to the digital sector, the creation, accumulation, sale, and use of data can have important implication for competition. As discussed further below, this raises important questions about the nature of the data, their ownership, and their transferability. Finally, both organized data storage and data processing at speed and scale rely on the use of ever more sophisticated algorithms. Unfortunately, algorithms are often complex, are constantly modified and, since they can be key competitive advantages, they are closely held. This makes both the detection of abusive conduct and the enforcement of effective remedies challenging.
B. Other Relevant Features
The digital economy is also characterized by a few factors, which are also found in other sectors, but take on a special importance in the digital context. The main such feature is the ubiquity of “platforms,” i.e. of undertakings simultaneously involved in several interdependent markets. In the digital world, such interdependence has two major sources: the fact that there are direct or indirect network effects across markets linked to the platform and the fact that information collected in one market can be economically valuable in another market. So again, potential economies of scope and scale in data matter. Still, the greatest concern stemming from the prevalence of platforms, some of which have significant market power, is interoperability: interoperability between different sides of the platform so that undertakings with more limited scope are not at an undue disadvantage, and compatibility of data. Ensuring that data exists in a well ordered (standardized?) format has two main advantages. Firstly, it facilitates the emergence of “data markets” and data intermediaries. This enables smaller players to (at least partially) bridge the data gap with larger players. Secondly, it also simplifies potential data-sharing remedies if, for example, some of the data controlled by an undertaking were judged to constitute an essential facility.
A second feature of interest is that, currently at least, most digital sectors are “fast moving.” This has a number of countervailing implications for competition policy. On the one hand, one cannot assume that large market shares can be sustained for very long, as the risk that a current position is undermined by drastic innovation might be substantial. This, of course, has been the mantra by which many large digital platforms defend themselves against a finding of dominance. On the other hand, precisely because new technologies usually offer quite significant improvements, consumers are keen to switch to new, innovative platform. In other words, entry, at least entry based on drastic innovation, might impose a more significant competitive constrained than in other sectors. What is the correct balance between these two opposing forces, and how might such a balance be achieved?
Finally, whenever some of the cross-platform externalities relate to the supply of complementary products (“indirect” network effects), platforms might become dominant in the corresponding aftermarkets. The best known of such digital aftermarkets are probably the “apps stores” run by both Apple and Google on their respective IOS and Android platforms. Of course, the extent of the market power enjoyed in these markets depends itself of the degree of interoperability existing between various platforms.
 
III. ANTITRUST
Over the last five to ten years, competition authorities have investigated a number of potentially anti-competitive conducts by digital platforms. These can be organized into data-related cases and other, more traditional cases.
A. Non-Data Cases
So far, the investigation of digital platforms has focused on three broad types of conduct2 – and hence of theories of harm.

Theories of Harm

As discussed above, hotel booking platforms were investigated for their contractual MFN clauses. While not an explicit agreement between horizontal competitors, such clauses soften competition between rival platforms by modifying the hotels’ optimal response to platforms offering reduced commissions. We are therefore in the traditional category of “clauses that reference rivals,” such as “meet any price.” While such clauses are generally considered anti-competitive3 they might also be a defense against “show rooming,” which is the practice of getting product-related information at a full-service site before completing the transaction, at a better price, at a bare-bones site. The only specifically “digital” aspect of these cases is that such “free riding” might be more prevalent in the online world than when brick and mortar outlets are concerned, as potential clients can “travel” more easily from one seller to the next.
Digital platforms have also been investigated for allegedly leveraging their dominance in one market into another related market. In the Google Android case, for example, both the Russian antimonopoly Bureau and DG Competition is also, at first sight at least, a traditional bundling/ exclusive dealing case where dominance in one market (Google store) was used to improve or entrench Google’s position in mobile search. Interestingly, the formal economic theory of harm had to make allowances for the fact that Google does not normally charge for users’ access to either their browser or their store. While such zero, or even negative, prices on one side of the platform is not unique to the digital world, it is still more likely to arise in this context: if marginal costs are low, accounting for cross-platform externalities can easily lead to no charge or even bonuses (payment cards).
The growing number of cases involving “self-preferencing” fall in the same broad category in the sense that dominance in one market is used in order to help the digital platform succeed in other market. However, this involves direct deterioration of rivals’ access to a crucial input rather than contractual means such as bundling or exclusive dealing. I believe that it is important to underline that, in many respects, “self-preferencing” is not a new theory of harm. It is just the application of traditional input foreclosure/access degradation theories of harm to a context where access is managed through opaque algorithms that the dominant platform can readily manipulate to its advantage.
The fact that important aspects of the daily competitive conduct of some digital platforms are driven by non-transparent algorithms is problematic indeed, both for establishing competitive harm and for finding – and enforcing – effective remedies. The Google Shopping case illustrates these difficulties. Without direct access to and, crucially, complete understanding of the search algorithm, determining whether or not price comparison sites were actually discriminated against is not an easy task. Moreover, even if one observes a change in the treatment of those sites overtime, one needs to determine that this was not the result of a legitimate change in the ranking algorithm. Moreover, if the algorithms are also modified for legitimate business reasons, one must also examine whether there was any other way of pursuing a legitimate business objective with less collateral competitive damage. Carrying out these tasks required enormous use of resources for DG Competition. As for remedies, the flexibility of algorithms makes it relatively easy to achieve a similar anticompetitive effect without infringing the formal commitments or, at least, without making such a breach obvious and hence easy to monitor.
Other theories of harm depend on the business model of the digital platform. There are two broad templates. In the first approach, most of the platform’s activities are aimed at gathering data, which are then mostly monetized through online advertising. Because data is so central, issues relating to the advertising market will be (briefly) touched upon in the next section. The second dominant business model is that of the digital marketplace. This model has two important variants, one where the platform is mostly a marketplace (think Amazon) and another where the access to the marketplace involves the acquisition of hardware and/or operating systems (Apple being the purest example). This second business strategy naturally leads to aftermarkets.
Overall then we see that, so far at least, non-data antitrust cases in the digital sector have not in fact focused particularly on the specific features of digital sectors discussed at the beginning of this note. In this sense, while we can already identify a significant number of antitrust cases in the digital sector, one might say that the era of digital antitrust enforcement has barely begun. This, however, does not mean that these “traditional,” cases do not themselves have a strong “digital” flavor, as they at least consider specific aspects of pricing and platform organization in the digital sector.

Antitrust versus Regulation

Over the last several years, there has been a growing clamor to regulate some aspects of the behavior of large digital platforms. This is coming to a head with DG Competition’s recent consultation about the introduction of a “new competition tool) and DG Connect’s own regulatory plans. While the final form of any regulation and of its relationship with antitrust is yet to be determined, some clear principles are emerging.
Ex ante regulation offers three main advantages over competition policy: it saves resources, it is faster, and it generally provides greater legal certainty. Regulation is also best applied to conducts that have clear-cut implications for competition and consumer welfare and can be applied to a sufficiently large, and well-defined, population of undertakings. This creates some trade-offs. On the one hand, regulation can react quickly to the evolution of the industry, but a fast-moving sector is also likely to accelerate the obsolescence of current rules. This introduces a trade-off between responsiveness and legal certainty. The scope of application of digital regulation also requires some careful balancing. Limiting its application to a few undertakings might help find types of behaviors that are uniformly harmful or pro-competitive across all undertakings. The larger the set of sectors or undertakings to which the digital regulation would apply, the least ambitious this regulation can be as it can only apply to the “common denominator” of good and bad conducts. In this respect, it seems worth remembering that the GAFAMs themselves display such variety in terms of their conduct and business model that the number of rules, which could sensibly apply to all of them is already likely to be limited. There might then be little additional loss in extending the scope of application of the regulations to more digital platforms and/or digital sectors.
I would welcome a division of tasks between antitrust and regulation. From my personal point of view, regulation would be especially helpful in dealing with what we usually refer to as “unfair business practices,” over which DG Competition does not have jurisdiction and with matters of transparency. So, for example, transparency in the rules applied by marketplaces and robust appeals procedures would seem to be a low-hanging fruit. One might also set up basic about “display boxes” which are a feature of several platforms, at least requiring transparency in the criteria applied and a guarantee that these criteria are applied uniformly. More controversially, perhaps, one might even consider a broader type of “access regulation” to platforms, which might encompass technical conditions, contractual clauses, or even the amount of the access fee.
Digital platforms are complex objects, relying on technologies that make their conduct less than transparent. Complexity and lack of transparency complicate the task of developing appropriate theories of harm and of tying them to the facts. In this perspective then, “clearing the decks” by entrusting several dimensions of this environment to a regulator would, one would hope, lead to more targeted and rigorous antitrust enforcement. Clearly though, the relationship between regulation and antitrust must remain fluid. In particular, it would make sense to start with regulation of a moderate scope, adding to the rules as we learn more about other types of conducts. Some of this learning can come from traditional antitrust. Take the example of “self-preferencing.” In my view, jumping to a regulatory rule banning this type of conduct in general would be premature as self-preferencing can take many forms and entail different effects. However, antitrust investigations can improve our understanding of this family of conducts to the point where some more specific conduct can safely pass in the hands of regulators.
The development of a “new tool,” making it possible to investigate the obstacles to competition in particular digital sectors or subsectors might also smooth the interface between antitrust and regulation in two respects. Firstly, such a tool could be used even in the absence of dominance. Not only does this increase the number of investigations that could be opened, thereby increasing the speed of our learning, but it also means that potentially anticompetitive conduct, or potentially anti-competitive aspects of an industry’s environment can be identified before they have led to excessive concentration or even to “market tipping.”
B. Data Cases

The Problem with Data

As mentioned at the outset, the digital sector revolves around data. It is therefore somewhat odd that, while rumors of investigations abound, we have not yet much in terms significant data-related decisions (the German Facebook case standing as a rather lonely exception). There are two main reasons for this state of affairs. Firstly, property rights over various types of data have not yet been clearly established. Secondly, the use of some types of data and the competitive advantage that they might confer are still poorly understood.
Digital companies, and digital platforms in particular collect different types of data. Broadly, one can distinguish between information about how users behave on the platform and information about consumer behavior outside of the platform (e.g. through cookies). Furthermore, for digital marketplaces, one can add a third category: information about interactions between consumers and non-affiliated sellers in the marketplace. It should be clear that unambiguous property rights are a pre-condition for rigorous antitrust analysis. For example, a dominant platform demanding the right to use the first type of data (platform interaction), without providing a viable alternative for access, might conceivably be seen as an exploitative abuse if the consumer has property rights over this data. This line of argument would not be appropriate if the legal view were that this type of data is actually created by the platform. The allocation of property rights is also crucial to enable (if desired) the trading of data. In turn, such trading might enable smaller players to piece together datasets, which are not dwarfed by the data available to the larger players. Such trade would also be facilitated by the development of interoperability standards for online data sets.
In order to develop coherent theories of harm we also need to understand what the three different types of data mentioned above are, or can be, used for. We know that data about the interaction with the platform can help improve the user’s experience. This, for example seems to be the situation in search. We also know that information about a user’s purchasing behavior or about characteristics that are closely related to her purchasing behavior (and can come from outside the platform) improves the targeting of online advertising, allowing the platform to charge heftier fees to its advertising clients. But can the same data also be used for different purposes, especially when combined with other data sources? And what about data about the interaction between users and undertakings hosted by the platform? Is it used mostly to further improve matching, or can it also help the platform operator get a leg up on competitors?
Finally, we also need to understand the extent of the competitive advantage conferred by the exclusive use of specific data sets. Search provides a good example in this respect. All known search engines process millions of queries every day. This generates much information about the search behavior of users very fast. Clearly, however, the larger players – and in particular Google – have information about many times more searches that smaller rivals. While it seems clear to a layperson that more experience and data about search make it possible to further refine the search algorithm, what is relevant for antitrust enforcement is the size of the advantage conferred by larger datasets. In other words, how large are the economies of scale in the gathering of search information? The unfortunate answer is that we still do not know much about this.
In the case of search, it seems that, even for a company like Google, further data helps improve the accuracy of the search algorithm for “tail” queries, which represent a substantial part of an individual’s daily interactions with the search engine. However, how much do consumers value such further refinements? Also, how durable is this advantage, i.e. how fast does past information become obsolete? Similar issues arise for data fed to advertising matching algorithms…or indeed any algorithm.

(Potential) Theories of Harm

Due to the dearth of actual data-based cases, we can only discuss what seem to be the more likely theories of harm in this area.
Essential Facility
Many policy makers and commentators are troubled by the amount of information that some companies, in particular Facebook and Google are amassing on various aspects of the characteristics and behavior of their users. Not only might such a large data advantage help these companies entrench their position in a number of markets where they already have significant market power, but there are also concerns that they might leverage their alleged data dominance into other markets. If the data advantage of some firms becomes indeed so large as to preclude the participation of rivals in a number of markets, one could consider building a theory of harm based on the control of an essential data facility. If such theory of harm were to be confirmed, a natural remedy would be to impose some sharing of data with potential rivals. As mentioned before, the existence of standards for data transferability would facilitate such remedies.
However, as explained above, the fact that we know so little about the marginal returns from ever bigger data sets and even less about the magnitude of the competitive advantage that the merging of data sets collected in several markets offer, would make it hard to demonstrate that any current data set should qualify as an essential facility. While such demonstration might become easier as we learn more about data-based competition, I believe that, in the short to medium term, encouraging interoperability and the emergence of markets for data is likely to be a more fruitful policy approach.
Privacy
Where a society stands on issues of privacy is not the province of competition policy. Moreover, as mentioned above, antitrust can only perform well if there are clear rules about property rights on various type of personal data. Nonetheless, it can be fruitful to think of privacy as, partly at least, an additional dimension of product or service “quality.” In this view then, it would be entirely proper to ask whether a merger would lead to a substantial decrease in privacy for users and to impose appropriate remedies, such as data segregation or limitation on data use without the users’ consent.
The implications of “privacy as quality” for antitrust are less clear. One could conceivably worry about conduct by a dominant platform that makes it harder for rivals – or indeed any undertaking operating on the platform – to compete with high-privacy services. I am not aware of any complaint about such conduct so far. Alternatively, it would be logical to consider exploitative theories of harm for lack of provision of adequate levels of privacy in the same way as one can pursue a dominant undertaking for excessive pricing. A problem with this approach (as exemplified by the German Facebook case) is that, while economics provide natural benchmarks for what would be a competitive price, establishing an equivalent benchmark for privacy can be challenging. Moreover, given the reluctance of antitrust authorities to pursue excessive pricing cases, one should not hope that theories of harm based on “insufficient privacy” are likely to flourish.
Raising Rivals’ Costs
An interesting direction might be to look for conducts that deprive rivals or even platform users (potential competitors) from access to data generated by their own activity or conducts that force these undertakings to share these data with the dominant platform. Broadly speaking, both types of conducts could be construed as a manner of “raising rivals’ costs” as they weaken its relative ability to compete.

206,"October 12, 2020",Highlights of the Much-Awaited U.S. Vertical Merger Guidelines,"
The new U.S. Vertical Merger Guidelines close the gap that was long manifest between the old guidance and both the economic theory and the agencies’ practice. The calls for a revision of the guidelines intensified with the AT&T/Time Warner unfolding, which raised awareness as to the need for pedagogy regarding the agencies’ approach to vertical mergers. The guidelines are now clear on the interdependence between EDM and incentives to foreclosure and develop on bargaining theory, even if abstracting from explaining the logic of threats in a negotiation process. These were key issues raised in the AT&T/Time Warner ruling. The guidelines do not, however, uncover the veil on the approach of the agencies to new challenges, such as mergers involving digital conglomerates.

I. INTRODUCTION
On June 30, 2020, the DOJ and the FTC issued the final version of the long awaited new Vertical Merger Guidelines (“VMG”). The guidelines aim at providing “the principal analytical techniques, practices, and enforcement policy for vertical mergers.”2
The document replaces the 1984 Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines (“NHMG”), which did not experience any revision for over three decades. This is in sharp contrast with the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which were reviewed three times (1992, 1996, and 2010), since the 1984 document was issued.
With few exceptions, there was wide consensus that the 1984 NHMG were outdated and in need of revision. The gap between the old guidance and the economic theory is obvious when recalling that the “post-Chicago” literature on vertical integration arose around the time the 1984 NHMG were issued.3
Drafting guidelines is a challenging process and more so for vertical mergers because of the interdependence between harms and benefits. That is not to say that vertical mergers cannot do any harm or that they should be presumed pro-competitive and social welfare increasing. The new VMG rightly stay away from pro-competitive presumptions regarding vertical mergers.
Most notably, the new VMG are issued in the aftermath of the District Court and the Appeals Court decisions on the first vertical merger litigated in the US, in the last 40 years – the AT&T/Time Warner case. These decisions raise important points of discussion regarding several key aspects of vertical mergers´ competitive assessment – from the treatment of the elimination of double marginalization (“EDM”) to the bargaining models that assist the assessment. The VMG must have inevitably been influenced by the unfolding of AT&T/Time Warner.
There are, however, further relevant trends that surround the release of the new VMG. I would highlight, in particular, the digitalization of the economy and the debate regarding competition law enforcement in labor markets.
In what follows, I discuss some highlights of the new VMG, with the backdrop that I just described.
 
II. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE NEW VMG
A. Elimination of Double Marginalization – “Special” Efficiencies?
The first topic I would highlight concerns EDM.
EDM results from internalizing a pricing externality. When EDM is present, it should be treated as flowing from the alignment of incentives between the merged entity upstream and downstream divisions. On this regard, the new VMG state that “it arises directly from the alignment of economic incentives between the merging firms.”4
However, EDM needs not to follow from vertical integration in all industries. EDM depends crucially on modelling assumptions, such as linear pricing, but need not be present in models with more general pricing rules. There are several market circumstances in which EDM would not result from a merger.5 Thus, EDM cannot be treated as an automatic inevitability of mergers in all industries.
The most relevant issue regarding EDM is on merger specificity. EDM can sometimes be achieved through contractual arrangements with non-linear pricing, such as two-part tariffs. The draft VMG acknowledged this explicitly, stating that “[t]he effects of the elimination of double marginalization may be lower if, prior to the merger, the merging parties already engaged in contracting that aligned their incentives.”6 In the final version of the VMG, however, this statement was eliminated, and the agencies focus the guidance on evidence that may be relevant regarding EDM’s merger specificity, such as “existing contracting practices” and “contracts between similarly situated firms in the same industry and contracting efforts considered by the merging firms.”
Just like with other merger efficiency claims, the burden of demonstrating EDM lies on the merging parties. However, the new VMG also state that the agencies “do not, however, reject the merger specificity of the elimination of double marginalization solely because it could theoretically be achieved but for the merger.”7 Can this read as, if no incentive-aligning contracts exist pre-merger, by default, EDM is presumed to be merger specific? Is this a presumption that flips the burden of proof on to the agencies?
This aspect of the VMG is probably the most debated in what regards EDM. In particular, it raises important questions as to the practical treatment of EDM by the US agencies. It also touches upon a topic that has triggered different views within the competition community. Most notably, Steven Salop is among those arguing for EDM as deserving no “special” treatment in terms of burden of proof vis-à-vis other cognizable efficiencies. On the other side, with Geoffrey Manne among the most vocal, are those claiming that the latter approach abstracts from practical realities concerning bargaining environments and overestimates the outcomes of contracting.8
But, in fact, we know that the failure to reach EDM in the pre-merger world does not necessarily mean that contractual agreements are out of reach as an alternative to a vertical merger. The burden of demonstrating merger specificity of EDM should thus fully remain on the merging parties’ shoulders.
B. (Digital) Conglomerates: The (Shy?) Inclusion in the Final Version of the VMG
One of the most noticeable aspects of the draft VMG was the absence of an explicit reference to complementary products mergers. The draft VMG coverage was, or could be seen as being, limited to mergers concerning vertically related products. Indeed, in the draft VMG, related products were defined as “a product or service that is supplied by the merged firm, is vertically related to the products and services in the relevant market, and to which access by the merged firm’s rivals affects competition in the relevant market.”9
This absence triggered several comments during the public consultation naming this as a big miss in the draft VMG. As a result, contrary to the draft document, the final text explicitly states that the guidance applies to a “range of non-horizontal transactions,” including “diagonal” mergers, thus staying away from the narrow applicability to vertical deals.10
The introduction of other non-horizontal mergers in the scope of the VMG is certainly warranted, particularly in the context of the digital economy. Indeed, if one could name only one advent as the most prominent since the VMG were first issued in 1984 that would have to be the digitalization of the economy. But the main question is whether the VMG provide guidance as to the specificities of conglomerate mergers in the digital era.
Complementarities, network effects, economies of scope and sharable inputs are all relevant in the digital economy. The main source of competition left to discipline large digital conglomerates that are otherwise shielded from competition is often that of potential entry. Dominant platforms may seek to protect incumbency profits through pre-emptive mergers aimed at eliminating potential competition.
As a result, conglomerate theories of harm have gained an added relevance in the context of the digital economy. Novel theories of harm have developed (see, e.g. Bourreau & de Streel, 2019).11 In digital markets, an adjacent product or service can often be a privileged, or the only, entry point to an otherwise closed digital platform or ecosystem. Digital conglomerates may pursue a merger policy driven by strategic incentives to eliminate threats to the incumbent platform or ecosystem through envelopment of their small competitors. Furthermore, the interest of these new theories of harm has gained added thrust with empirical evidence showing that circa 60 percent of all the firms acquired by Google, Amazon and Facebook were four-year-old or younger when they were acquired by these digital giants (Argentesi et al, 2019).12
Given that these novel theories of harm are not addressed in the guidelines, the approach of the agencies to these issues will have to emerge from decision making.
C. A Closure to the AT&T/Time Warner Saga?
The new VMG were issued a little over a year on from the U.S. Court of Appeals decision upholding the District Court ruling, signed by Judge Leon, in favor of the defendant. The decisions cleared the way for the AT&T/Time Warner deal to go ahead. The merger had been challenged by the DOJ on the grounds of a raising rivals’ costs theory of harm.
Among the several points of criticism laid down on Judge Leon’s ruling regarding the case put forward by the DOJ, there are two that are particularly relevant from the point of view of the fundamental economic principles underlying vertical mergers’ competition assessment.
The first point has to do with the treatment given in the ruling to the extent in which profits from the upstream and downstream divisions are integrated to govern strategic decisions. In particular, the ruling relies on statements from business representatives to conclude that the downstream division’s (DirectTV) profits would not be considered by the upstream division (Turner) of the merged entity, thus softening concerns with the raising rival’s costs theory of harm. However, by the same token, the rational for EDM would be broken, as the incentive alignment that may follow from vertical mergers would not occur. But the ruling does not extract the necessary consequents of accepting that argument for the treatment of EDM, leading to an inconsistency.
The view that vertically integrated entities have no regard for joint profits is at odds with the economic literature and with the empirical evidence. Crawford et al (2018),13 for example, estimate, with a structural model of the multichannel television industry, that a vertically integrated distributor internalizes $0.79 of each dollar of profit accrued by the upstream vertically integrated channel, and that regional sports networks fully account for the gains, to the downstream division, of denying access to content to rival distributors.
The second point has to do with the dismissiveness regarding the Nash bargaining model used by the DOJ to represent the negotiations between content providers and content distributors. In particular, the ruling deems the threats of blackouts, and thus their role in leveraging the ability of the content provider to obtain more favorable terms from the negotiation, as not credible because of the costs a long-lasting blackout would bring to the content provider.
These two points, and how they abstract from well-established economic theory, are illustrative of the relevance of guidance and the need for pedagogy, and intensified the calls for an update of merger guidance. And, indeed, both of these issues are addressed in the final version of the VMG.
The interdependence between EDM and the raising rivals’ costs theory of harm are explicitly addressed in the new VMG. In particular, the VMG now state that EDM arises from incentive alignment and that “the same source drives any incentive to foreclose or raise rivals’ costs,” such that the evidence to assess EDM and the harm resulting from the merger overlap substantially.14
The draft version of the guidelines was notoriously scant on bargaining theory. However, the topic was densified in the final version of the new VMG. The document, however, does not explicitly address the logic of threat points, and that they need not have to materialize to provide leverage in a bargaining negotiation.
The question surely is whether the guidelines are enough to resolve the scars left by the AT&T/Time Warner rulings. And I believe that, while they are a key step in cementing a well-established framework for the analysis of vertical mergers, the discussion would certainly benefit from an ex-post assessment of AT&T/Time Warner. Maybe this would bring closure to the saga.
D. A Side Note on Labor Markets
Competition in the labor market has been in the spotlight of competition policy in the U.S. in recent years. The interest on the macroeconomic implications of market power has been prompted by the influential papers by De Loecker & Eeckhout (2017) and Autor et al. (2020),15 associating the trends of increasing concentration and the decline in the labour share of GDP.
Furthermore, a number of papers (e.g. Marinescu & Hovenkamp, 201916) have been published claiming that merger enforcement is overly focused on the supply side of products and services markets, and rarely on competition concerns driven by concentration in the buyer side of the market, in particular in labor markets.
At the agencies level, FTC Commissioner Phillips stated that “the FTC has now made it standard practice to screen for harms from enhanced labor monopsony power as part of every merger review. This process has just begun.”17
This U.S. trend is discernible in the public consultation launched by the agencies to the VMG. Among the comments submitted in the public consultation to the VMG are those of the major American labor unions. The unions argued that the draft ignored harm to workers, and called for labor market implications of mergers to be factored into the merger review.
The strengthening of labor monopsony power is, however, more of a potential concern in horizontal mergers than in vertical deals. There is no reference in either the draft or the final version of the VMG to labor markets. It is however noteworthy the addition in the final version of the guidelines comparing the harm from “monopsony power” to that of market power in the sellers’ side, and clarifying that the agencies use an analogous framework for assessing vertical mergers that strengthen the market power of buyers.
 
III. FINAL REMARKS
The vertical merger guidelines were issued in the midst of several calls for an invigorated merger enforcement. The public discussion that followed the release of the draft version in January 2020 was prolific and played an important role in shaping the final version of the document.
The document closes the gap between the U.S. agencies’ assessment of vertical mergers and the guidance made available to the stakeholders. It incorporates the agencies practices for the recent past, but it does not uncover the veil on the approach to new challenges, in particular regarding the digital economy

207,"October 12, 2020",Mergers in High-Tech: A Response to Critics,"
Faced with the growing power of tech giants, a number of antitrust analysts advocate for a reversal of the burden of proof in merger review: let the acquirer prove in court that the merger is pro-competitive. I argue that such reform would likely have a significant chilling effect on mergers (which is not surprising) and in turn would likely reduce the rate of innovation (which is more controversial) and ultimately would lower consumer welfare. I respond to a series of objections to this view. I also suggest that a combination of ex ante and ex post regulation provides the best approach to rein in the high-tech giants’ excessive market power.

By Luis Cabral1
 
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
There is general consensus among analysts, politicians and the public at large that something needs to be done about the power of, and abuse of power by, high-tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (“GAFA”). The consensus breaks down when it comes down to specific proposals, but very few — if any — would agree that going on with business as usual is an acceptable solution.
A number of antitrust analysts — from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond — advocate for a stronger merger policy in the digital space. The so-called Stigler report (Scott-Morton, 2019), for example, calls for a reversal of the burden of proof in merger review: let the tech giants prove in court that their proposed acquisition is pro-competitive.2 Other industry experts advocate similar proposals.
I would like to present a cautionary note, namely that the kind of merger reform that is being widely proposed would likely have a significant chilling effect on mergers (which is not surprising) and in turn would likely reduce the rate of innovation (which is more controversial) and ultimately would lower consumer welfare.
Before getting to my main argument, however, I want to make two points. First, in a recent anonymous referee report I was told that:
I have seen enough pieces coming from Google & Co calling for a cautionary note. I see little reason for adding to this advocacy. In fact, I would argue that a message like this one can be misleading for readers who know little about competition policy.
I have no fears regarding the latter possibility, as my readers are surely well versed in competition policy, probably more than I am. But I do resent the suggestion — indirect as it may be — that my work is a work of advocacy. To be crystal clear: I have never worked, directly or indirectly, for any of the giant tech firms that I write about in this paper (or for any of their competitors, for that matter).
The second preliminary note is that, while mine is clearly the minority view when it comes to mergers, overall there is more consensus than disagreement when it comes to tech giants and public policy. Like most, I am very concerned about the extent of market power and abuse of dominant positions among GAFA (or GAFAM or any extension thereafter). Like most, I believe U.S. merger policy has largely been characterized by under-enforcement (think healthcare, airlines, etc.). Like most, I agree that many of the mergers we observe are preemptive in nature.
All of the above notwithstanding, I believe the proposed treatment of mergers and acquisitions in the digital space, especially when it comes to GAFA-like tech giants, is unwarranted and would cause more harm than good. To understand this point, it’s important to understand that the “digital” space differs in several important ways from the typical industry that merger policy was designed for. First, in the digital space it is difficult to predict business models and how they evolve. As a result, the vast majority of acquisitions are motivated by option value, not by preemption value. Second, it is difficult to protect and transact intellectual property, and as a result the threat of imitation looms constantly. Third, and related to the previous point, acquisitions play an important role in transferring technology. Fourth, there are frequently significant synergies: the value of innovation is higher with a large firm than with an entrant, for reasons that have little to do with market power. Finally, and perhaps most important, the prospect of acquisition serves as an important incentive for startup innovation. In Cabral (2020) I develop each of these points in detail.3
 
II. CRITICISM
I am well aware that my view on mergers in the digital space places me clearly in the minority camp. I am also aware that it raises multiple objections. I know that because I have read or heard multiple ones. In what follows, I list those I can recall and address them the best that I can. Specifically, the following are arguments — weak arguments, in my opinion — in support of the idea of reversing the burden of proof in merger approval.
A. Resource Asymmetry
The tech giants have considerably more resources than the regulatory agencies. Therefore, it makes sense for them to carry the weight of an investigation, which you effectively do by reversing the burden of proof. My response is that there are many ways of solving the resource issue other than reversing the burden of proof. It would be considerably more efficient to charge the merging notifiers a fee, possibly a fee proportional to the estimated transaction value. Alternatively, the agency in charge could choose one or two or three experts to work on the case and ask the merging parties to cover the costs. Or there could be a rule such that all experts are paid by the merging parties, but for each expert who testifies “in favor” of the merging parties the agency has the option of appointing a “counter expert” of their choice.
B. Status-quo Bias
The U.S. legal system places a disproportionate weight on defendants, thus creating a high bar for agencies intending to block a merger. I agree that reversing the burden of proof would significantly tilt the system in the direction of making it easier to block a merger. However, if the U.S. legal system is biased in favor of civil case defendants, then we need to reform the U.S. legal system, not the merger approval process. A merger should be approved if, on balance, the positive effects outweigh the negative ones. There should be no room for “beyond reasonable doubt” criteria, which should be reserved for criminal cases.
Although the proposal of placing the burden of proof on the acquirer seems to have been well received in Europe and the UK, it’s also not clear how the above argument (disproportionate weight on defendants) applies. And speaking of multiple jurisdictions, one must not forget that a tech giant merger must be approved simultaneously by multiple agencies (i.e. we’re talking about “global” mergers). Given that, is the current system really tilted in favor of would be acquirers?
C. Killer Acquisitions
Cunningham, Ederer and Ma (2020) provide compelling evidence that many mergers are preemptive in nature, thus anticompetitive.4 I have great admiration for this paper and its authors. Their theoretical model is sensible and the empirical analysis tight. However, I have read more than one academic paper and op ed piece that mentions the high-tech giants and the Cunningham-Ederer-Ma paper in the same paragraph. My point is that this amounts to mixing apples and oranges. The digital giants are simply not like pharma (the industry of focus in the Cunningham-Ederer-Ma paper).
D. Kill Zone
Kamepalli, Krishna, Rajan, and Zingales (2019) provide a theoretical analysis and suggestive empirical evidence for the existence of “kill zones” in the digital space, the idea that acquisitions by big tech have a discouraging effect on innovation.5 I do not have a formal empirical study to counteract their argument, but my experience from observing (and talking to) startups is that the prospect of acquisition is frequently an integral part of their “business model.” In fact, the startup’s main fear is not to be acquired by a tech giant but rather to be imitated by a tech giant, what Cabral (2019) refers to as the shadow-of-Google effect.6
E. Data Availability
The merging parties have considerably more and better data than the agencies. There is no question about the asymmetry in the amount of available data. But there are better ways of addressing this — for example, requiring the merging parties to provide the data requested by the agencies. The argument could be made that the merging parties could then be very selective in the data they disclose, but this problem applies just as well when the merging parties are asked to make their pro-competitive case: they would certainly make a highly selective use of their private information. Which leads me to the next point.
F. Asymmetric Information
The merging parties have better information about the business rationale for the merger than the agencies. This is in general true, but one of the points I try to make is precisely that, when it comes to digital high tech, it’s more a case of uncertainty than of asymmetric information. Moreover, at a theoretical level it is not clear what the effect of asymmetric information is on the optimal sequence of events in merger review. Games with asymmetric information where the informed party moves first frequently result in information unraveling, whereby the information received from the informed party is essentially meaningless.
G. Zero Enforcement
Of the hundreds of acquisitions by GAFAM since 2000, not one has been blocked. Clearly, this is a case of merger review under-enforcement, in fact, zero enforcement. Not quite. First, enforcement refers to the effort by merger authorities (which did review a number of cases), not necessarily the outcome. Second, under or over enforcement is a relative concept, relative to the optimal level. Third, and more important, my note of caution refers to the proposed merger reform, not the current setting; and the proposed reforms would swing the pendulum to a point of almost surely over-enforcement.
H. Scrambled Eggs
The “scrambled eggs” metaphor reminds us that, in the digital world, ex post divestiture is difficult if not impossible: you cannot unscramble the eggs. If merger approval is an irreversible decision, then we should err on the side of caution. This is a valid argument. However, it’s important to understand that divestiture is not the only ex post remedy. In fact, it is frequently the worse possible remedy (because, for example, of network effects). There are many alternatives, including in particular behavioral regulation.
I. Theoretical Analysis Shows that Digital Mergers can be Preemptive
Two recent papers provide different narratives leading to a pre-emptive view of acquisitions in the high-tech space: Fumagalli et al (2020)7 and Katz (2020).8 As often happens in economic analysis, the results depend on the assumptions you make. I believe that, when it comes to the digital space, more often than not my perspective on mergers is more relevant than the alternatives. This is not to say that there are no preemptive mergers or that I propose we abdicate from merger review. I am only providing a word of caution with respect to a wholesale reform as the reversion of the burden of proof would imply.
 
III. REGULATION
So as not to appear overly negative, and consistently with my initial claim that something needs to be done, I next propose a possible plan of action. Competition policy (and antitrust) is typically thought of as a set of three bins: collusion, mergers, and abuse of dominant position. When it comes to GAFAM, collusion has little bite; and mergers, for the reasons I presented earlier, should not have much bite. We are thus left with addressing situations of abuse of dominant position. I next address this approach.
A reasonable system of digital firm regulation requires that we address at least three points: First, what firms are subject to regulation. A good start would be “whatever size thresholds include GAFAM.” One might add other thresholds so as to include, for example, platforms and gatekeepers that are effectively “essential facilities” even if their size is not even close to GAFAM.
The second point to address is the definition of what behaviors are considered anti-competitive. I think an examination of the EU and U.S. cases involving GAFAM in the past 20 or 30 years provides a good starting point: self-preferencing would likely be on top of the list, but there are certainly other issues.
Finally, the third decision required for a robust regulatory system is the balance between ex ante and ex post regulation. My proposal here would be to have a (possibly evolving) list of presumed anti-competitive behaviors (e.g. self-preferencing). While these would not be considered per se illegal, the anti-competitive presumption would signal that the firms would need to have a clear efficiency and/or pro-competitive justification so as to prevent ex post regulation.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
I agree with most industrial organization economists that the current state of affairs in the high-tech sector is unacceptable. However, policy experts are barking at the wrong tree when they insist on drastically increasing the bar for high-tech mergers. If technical change in the 1970s and 1980s moved us away from sectoral regulation, the nature of high-tech platforms all but requires that we seriously consider this option as the best means to preserve the benefits from innovation and network effects – and make sure those benefits get to the consumer.

208,"October 11, 2020",Judge Allows Apple To Block Fortnite From App Store,"


Apple won’t be forced to put popular video game Fortnite back in its App Store after a US federal court denied a preliminary injunction filed by Epic Games, reported Mashable. 
In this motion for preliminary injunction, Epic Games had asked the court to force Apple to reinstate Fortnite to its App Store while the game developer continues its antitrust dispute against the iPhone maker. This is despite its acknowledged breach of its licensing agreements and operating guidelines. The game developer also demanded that Apple refrain from terminating its affiliates’ access to developer tools for other applications, including Unreal Engine, while it litigates its claims.
“The Court maintains its findings from the temporary restraining order and hereby grants in part and denies in part Epic Games’ motion for a preliminary injunction,” District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in the ruling. “Epic Games has strong arguments regarding Apple’s exclusive distribution through the iOS App Store, and the in-app purchase (IAP) system through which Apple takes 30% of certain IAP payments.”
“However, given the limited record, Epic Games has not sufficiently addressed Apple’s counter arguments,” Rogers wrote.
The dispute picked up speed back in August, when Apple announced the termination of Epic Games’ account on its App Store and the removal of the Fortnite game. This means Epic is no longer able to submit new apps or updates, and the game can no longer be downloaded or re-downloaded. The dispute hinges on Epic’s use of direct in-game payments in the Fortnite app. Apple’s rules state all purchases must be made through its proprietary payment system.
“We’re grateful the court recognized that Epic’s actions were not in the best interests of its own customers and that any problems they may have encountered were of their own making when they breached their agreement,” Apple said in a statement. “For 12 years, the App Store has been an economic miracle, creating transformative business opportunities for developers large and small. We look forward to sharing this legacy of innovation and dynamism with the court next year.”
Separately, the court put out an order to set a new date for Apple and Epic Games to face each other in court on May 3, 2021, instead of the previously anticipated July date.

209,"October 11, 2020",UK’s Top Antitrust Enforcer Thinks All Tech Mergers Should Be Scrutinized,"


According to Bloomberg, the UK’s top antitrust enforcer laid out plans for a new regulator, saying the largest tech companies would face scrutiny for any transaction.
Andrea Coscelli, who leads the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said he wanted to see a “special parallel regime” for the tech giants that have strategic market status. The new program could also apply a stricter test before clearing any deal, Coscelli said in a speech delivered remotely to a New York conference.
The CMA is increasingly voicing concerns about internet giants swallowing up smaller firms and the new system would automatically have oversight of deals like Facebook’s purchase of Giphy. The renewed effort to roll back the dominance of these companies comes as the UK’s departure from the European Union gives the CMA leeway to devise new approaches to antitrust.
“For me, the case for regulation is clearly made,” Coscelli said. The largest firms can use their strategic position “to exploit the many consumers and businesses who rely on them and act to exclude or quash innovative competitors.”
Coscelli, who has long been keen to challenge the power of firms such as Google, said the new scrutiny could include a test that goes beyond the CMA’s current approach to mergers. It builds on an idea the regulator has floated since the spring, when Coscelli first described the possibility of a separate merger track.

210,"October 11, 2020",Revising the Competition Law Rulebook for Digital Markets in Europe: A Delicate Balancing Act,"

By Kris Van Hove & Argyrios Papaefthymiou1
 
Introduction
It is a truism to say that digitalisation has brought with it a revolution in economic life and consumer experience in the 21st century. Developments in digital technology unfold in rapid speed, markedly upgrading the quality of life, but also requiring constant review of legal and economic thinking to keep up with the pace of digital evolution.
Competition law has been at the epicentre of this re-evaluation process, as the field of law that moves most closely in tandem with economic thinking and business models. It is thus no surprise that there has been an onslaught of policy and legislative developments in recent years in the competition law space to tackle what is perceived by some as an “overexpansion” of the market power held by big tech companies (commonly identified as “GAFA” – Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple). In parallel with these developments in the policy and legislative space, competition authorities around the globe are increasingly stepping up their scrutiny of various practices implemented by digital companies.
The present article seeks to provide an overview of the key competition concerns identified in Europe in the digital sphere and the main approaches that are currently being discussed to tackle those concerns, with a focus on the EU. Although the digitalisation of the global economy presents specific challenges for competition law enforcement, which may require tweaking the existing regulatory framework to some extent, the article attempts to critically assess whether the reform proposals that have been put forward are necessary and proportionate to the perceived challenges. This assessment is made in light of the tools that are already available and that have been employed to address competition concerns in the digital sector by competition authorities in the EU. While the proposals that have been put forward centre on the rules on abuse of dominance and merger control, the analysis that follows is conducted through the prism of antitrust, with references to merger control as it relates to the interplay between ex ante enforcement (merger control) and ex post enforcement (rules on abuse of dominance).
 
A. Main Competition Concerns in Digital Markets: The View in Europe
Over the past couple of years, public authorities in Europe, both at EU and national level, have commissioned expert studies and reports on the application of competition law in the digital era. An indicative list includes: the European Commission’s report on “Competition Policy for the Digital Era,”2 the UK Furman Report on “Unlocking Digital Competition,”3 and the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (the “CMA”) market study on online platforms and digital advertising,4 the German “Competition Law 4.0” report,5 the Italian6 and Franco-German7 reports on big data and competition law, the French study on competition and e-commerce8 and the French report on digital economy competition challenges,9 etc. From this body of expert studies and reports, it is possible to distill some key insights into the characteristics of digital markets and the perceived competition concerns they generate. These are addressed briefly below.
1. Characteristics of Digital Markets
Digital markets are often characterized by strong economies of scope, favoring the development of ecosystems and giving incumbents a strong competitive advantage. The economies of scope are considered to result from other features of digital markets, and in particular from:

high returns to scale (meaning that the cost of producing a digital service is much less than proportional to the number of customers served);
network externalities (meaning that the more users join a digital technology, e.g. a social media platform, the more convenient it becomes); and
the importance of data as an input for many digital services (meaning that, where applicable, those with significant data collection and processing capabilities have a sizeable competitive advantage).

These features and the strong economies of scope they generate are increasingly considered in enforcement and policy circles as facilitating large incumbents’ market power to become ever more entrenched and as potentially allowing anti-competitive strategies to materialize unencumbered.
2. Self-Preferencing
The European Commission’s Digital Experts’ Report defines “self-preferencing” as a practice engaged in by a platform operator that gives preferential treatment to the operator’s products and services when they compete with products and services of other entities using the platform. This practice has been at the forefront of many discussions on digital competition policy. Whether or not it is as such problematic from a competition perspective is the subject of ongoing debate. Yet, alongside data-related practices, it is the conduct most closely associated with competition concerns that big tech companies raise. Headline cases such as the EU Google Shopping case10 have featured this practice as the principal conduct under scrutiny.
3. Retail Most-Favored-Nation (“MFN”) Clauses
Retail Most-favored-nation clauses or MFNs11 are contractual obligations imposed by a buyer on a seller that require the seller to offer the buyer terms and conditions that are at least as favorable as the best terms and conditions offered by that seller to other buyers. The terms and conditions concerned may be either price-related or non-price-related. Such clauses are commonly divided into two categories:

“narrow” Retail MFNs, which dictate that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website (but can do so on other platforms); and
“wide” Retail MFNs, which dictate that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website or on any other platform.

Retail MFNs have been particularly pertinent in the digital context, with “platform MNFs” being scrutinized both at EU level (Amazon E-books MFNs case12) and at national level (antitrust investigations by the German, French, Italian and Swedish national competition authorities into MFNs in agreements between hotels and online travel agents (Hotel Reservation Service (HRS),13 Booking.com,14 and Expedia15). Generally speaking, “wide” Retail MFNs are considered more problematic from a competition law perspective than “narrow” Retail MFNs.
4. Switching Costs and Multihoming
Switching from a product or service offered by one firm to a functionally similar product or service offered by another firm may generate so-called “switching costs.” These are costs associated with certain investments made by the user in the ecosystem of the first firm (e.g. the time spent familiarizing with the particular features of that ecosystem) which have to be re-incurred when the user switches to the ecosystem of the second firm. Switching costs are also conceptually linked to “multihoming,” which is a consumer’s ability to use different competing online services simultaneously (e.g. platforms).
Depending on the circumstances, a dominant platform may try to retain its user base on an exclusive basis by making switching or multihoming more costly or more difficult otherwise. Such conduct could enable the platform to entrench its market position with potentially negative effects for competition.
5. Big Data and Data-Related Practices
“Big Data” is a dataset with three features which are commonly referred to as the “three V’s.”  It consists of:

large Volumes of data (that is, large amounts of data generated through online or offline transactions),
data with significant Variety (it can be structured or unstructured data and human-generated or machine-generated data), and
data generated with high Velocity (that is, incoming data flows are processed in real-time).

Big Data and its interplay with competition policy is a key focus in many competition authorities’ ongoing evaluation of the digital sector. Particular attention is paid to data leveraging strategies that, under given circumstances, may amount to anti-competitive unilateral conduct. For instance, a refusal to provide access to data that is unique and indispensable for a competitor to provide services (so, data that constitutes an “essential facility”) may be considered to amount to an exclusionary abuse. Another example of potentially abusive conduct is discrimination by a vertically integrated platform with downstream activities in the provision of access by retailers to competitively strategic data. Furthermore, competition authorities are increasingly sensitive to issues of “data portability” and “interoperability.” “Data portability” (giving end-users the freedom to transfer their data to alternative digital service providers) as well as “interoperability” (ensuring compatibility between software of different ecosystems) are considered valuable means to keep switching and multihoming viable for end-users. But these are not the only issues competition authorities are looking into. For instance, at EU level, the European Commission has launched a formal investigation into Amazon’s use of sensitive data obtained from independent retailers selling on Amazon’s marketplace and competing with Amazon’s retail business (July 2019).16 The Commission is also conducting antitrust enquiries into Facebook’s and Google’s data-gathering and monetization practices (since 2019).
An additional concern that recently came to the fore in relation to data-related practices centers on the interaction between privacy protection (legislated at EU level through the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR17) and competition law. This interaction is highlighted in the German Facebook case. In that case, the German competition authority found that Facebook had abused its dominant position in the market for social networks by making access to its social network conditional on the collection of user data from multiple sources, including third-party websites. The German authority thus ordered Facebook to cease applying the abusive clauses.18 The authority’s decision was appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, which issued a suspension order against the decision, noting serious doubts about its legality.19 The decision was, however, reinstated by Germany’s Supreme Court20 pending a final decision on the merits of the case from the Higher Regional Court. The German Facebook case has sparked an intense debate on the theory of harm put forward by the German competition authority, with critics finding its focus on consumer protection problematic for the purpose of identifying the competition concerns. It is expected that the final outcome of this case will have significant implications for the use of data-related theories of harm in competition law enforcement.
6. Killer Acquisitions
A strongly contested practice that some consider is taking place in the tech sector in recent years is the acquisition by established players of start-ups that have the potential of strongly competing with the incumbents, with a view to “killing off” future competition from those start-ups. Such acquisitions are commonly referred to as “killer acquisitions.” The concept originated in the pharma sector, where – according to some – the practice of buying up start-ups, only to subsequently eliminate pipeline projects that might have increased competition for the incumbent’s offerings, would have been empirically observed.21 In the context of the digital sphere, however, this concept appears to mean something different, as the acquisitions considered by some to be controversial (e.g. Facebook/WhatsApp,22 Facebook/Instagram) have not resulted in the “killing off” of the acquired firm’s offerings. Rather, what is meant by “strategic acquisitions” in digital markets relates to a counterfactual where the acquired firm, in light of its subsequent evolution into a strong market player, might have exerted intense competitive forces on the acquiring incumbent, with positive results for competition and consumers, had it not been acquired. The existence of harm to competition arising from these acquisitions is not beyond dispute. On the one hand, arguably, the acquisition of innovative start-ups can in some cases reduce future competitive constraints on the incumbent. On the other hand, for many start-ups, being acquired by an established market player at a lucrative price point can serve as a key incentive for innovative research and development.
In any event, in various European jurisdictions there is a strong current towards reforming the rules on merger control to address what is perceived to be an excessively lax approach to controlling acquisitions in the tech sphere. Reform proposals have taken various forms. One commonly pronounced suggestion is to lower the jurisdictional turnover thresholds to account for the fact that, at the time of acquisition, the turnover of many innovative start-ups is too low to trigger a notification. Another proposal is meant to address the fact that turnover may not be the most appropriate metric to assess the need to exercise merger control over a tech acquisition. It consists in adding an alternative threshold based on the value of the transaction, where a high purchase price (despite low turnover) triggers mandatory notification due to its indications of innovative potential. This proposal has in fact already been adopted in certain jurisdictions and notably Austria and Germany. Finally, at the more “radical” end of the reform spectrum, some jurisdictions (such as France) have been considering to implement an ex post merger control regime, whereby certain transactions (particularly in the digital sector) may be re-evaluated even years after they have been consummated, should market developments in the transaction’s aftermath indicate that the transaction might have generated adverse effects on competition.
7. Conclusion
The discussion presented above has direct implications for the debate on digital-specific reforms of the competition rules: if the concerns delineated have merit, then more ex post scrutiny may be required. For example, a history of relatively lax merger control could be viewed as a factor that has contributed to the proliferation of self-preferencing cases which focus on perceived anti-competitive differential treatment by vertically integrated businesses. The intensifying review of data-related abusive practices could perhaps also be partially attributed to a perceived overexpansion of big tech firms.
 
B. Reform Directions: A Critical Overview
Competition authorities in Europe have been engaged in intensive public discussions on how to approach the perceived problems identified above for competition in the digital sector. From the flurry of policy activity and legislative initiatives on this subject, it is possible to extract the key proposals presently on the table, and to critically assess their necessity and proportionality. Each of these proposals is addressed below.
1. Mandating Pro-Competitive Conduct and Prohibiting Anti-Competitive Conduct under an Ex Ante Regulatory Regime
In June 2020, the European Commission launched a public consultation to gather views on two legislative proposals. A first proposal relates to a “Digital Services Act.” This proposal would introduce, inter alia, a targeted, sector-specific ex ante framework regulating the conduct of large online platforms that benefit from significant network effects and that act as “gatekeepers” of their respective platforms. A second proposal relates to a “New Competition Tool.” This proposal would give the European Commission new powers to investigate entire sectors of the economy and impose remedies where it finds dominance-related or market structure-related competition problems (on this second proposal, see section 2 below).
The Digital Services Act package considered by the Commission in its Inception Impact Assessment23 puts forth different policy options for enhancing the “fairness and contestability” of markets where large online platforms operate. While two of these policy options focus on enhancing transparency obligations for platforms in the context of the Platform-to-Business Regulation24, the third option – which has received the most public attention – proposes the adoption of a new ex ante regulatory framework that governs specific trading practices of large online platforms benefiting from significant network effects and acting as “gatekeepers.”25  The platforms concerned would be identified on the basis of predetermined criteria such as significant network effects, the size of their user base and/or their capacity to leverage data across sectors.
Two separate components are considered for the ex ante framework. A first component would lay down predetermined prohibited trading practices (“blacklisted practices”) and predetermined obligations. An example of a blacklisted practice subject to a horizontal prohibition would be intra-platform self-preferencing. A second component would provide for the possibility for the regulator to impose tailor-made remedies. Examples of such remedies would be the imposition of platform-specific non-personal data access obligations and the imposition of specific interoperability and data portability requirements. The two components are not mutually exclusive and could be introduced as complements. The idea of ex ante prohibitions of certain platform conduct (e.g. self-preferencing) is also endorsed in the proposed 10th amendment of the German Act Against Restraints on Competition,26 as well as in the French competition authority’s study on competition and e-commerce and the French report on digital economy competition challenges.
Similar to the notion of ex ante regulation, the UK Furman Report puts forth the idea of drawing up binding codes of conduct for certain platforms with “strategic market status” (broadly defined as a position of enduring market power over a strategic gateway market, giving the platform a powerful negotiating position and making other undertakings dependent on it). Adherence to the codes of conduct would be monitored and enforced by a dedicated Digital Markets Unit within the competition authority (such a unit has already been established within the French competition authority, with a mandate to assist in cases with a significant digital dimension27). As opposed to the focus of the ex ante regulatory approach on the prohibition of specific types of conduct in addition to required compliance with specific obligations, the focus of the codes of conduct approach would be only on mandating pro-competitive conduct. This more flexible form of regulation could be seen as an incentive for large platforms to work in partnership and share their input in drawing up codes and as a means perhaps of avoiding exogenously imposed obligations and prohibitions that may go “over the top” in their response to the perceived problems they seek to address. The idea of codes of conduct specifically for large online platforms has also been supported in the German Competition Law 4.0 Report.
It further bears observing that, for a practice to qualify as an ex ante prohibition, it is rather logical to assume that such practice’s harm to competition must be significant, acknowledged to a degree of (near-)consensus, and context-independent – almost, in a sense, like a “by object” restriction under EU competition law. However, certain of the practices identified in policy proposals, such as the Digital Services Act and the relevant German and French studies, are still the subject of much debate as regards their anti-competitive nature. The most indicative example in this respect is self-preferencing, which some commentators view as a natural consequence of vertical integration, and its horizontal condemnation as near-equivalent to competition law engaging in the imposition of specific business models on companies.28 Furthermore, depending on the context in which it is observed, self-preferencing could be viewed through the lens of classic theories of harm that have already been successfully applied by EU courts to deal with instances of integrated firms favoring their own affiliates, such as a refusal to supply an indispensable input (Bronner, IMS Health, Slovak Telekom) or tying (Microsoft I).29 In any event, the uncertainty that surrounds self-preferencing as a self-standing theory of harm might call for a more nuanced approach than outright banning practices that can be labelled as self-preferencing.
Of course, self-preferencing is not the only conduct that is targeted by the ex ante regulation approach and, for instance, proposals mandating interoperability and data portability in specific circumstances may be less controversial. However, these practices could just as easily be imposed through codes of conduct. This approach would arguably be preferable, as it may provide a step – rather than a leap – in the exploration of ways to address competition concerns relating to the behavior of large incumbents in digital markets. Codes of conduct are likely more easily adjustable to account for developing market dynamics and insights drawn from their enforcement practice than formal legislation (especially at the EU level where the legislative process includes up to three different institutions, i.e. the European Commission, the Council of the EU, and the European Parliament).
2. Leveraging Market Investigation Tools
In parallel with the Digital Services Act addressed above, the European Commission has been gathering views on a proposed “New Competition Tool” (or “NCT” for short). This tool would allow the Commission to investigate entire sectors of the economy and impose behavioral or structural remedies to address what it perceives to be dominance-related or market-structure-related risks to competition. The NCT could be used pre-emptively, that is, before actual risks to competition materialize. Its scope of application would be limited to markets within the digital sphere, or be open-ended.30 If the tool would be open-ended and targeting market structure risks, it would resemble a classic market investigation mechanism, such as the one available in the UK as well as in certain other jurisdictions worldwide (e.g. Greece, Mexico, Israel). Although the European Commission already has a sector-wide probe tool at its disposal, i.e. the sector inquiry, that tool can result only in findings but not in remedies, which may be imposed only in subsequent individual infringement proceedings.31 In contrast, an NCT investigation could result in the immediate imposition of market-wide remedies.
A market investigation mechanism would be a very powerful tool in the hands of the European Commission, with significant implications for competition enforcement in the EU at large. Cases that have centered on challenging theories of harm could be dealt with through an NCT-like process in an easier manner, dispensing with the hurdle of proving to the requisite legal standard the elements of a “traditional” antitrust infringement (e.g. specific abusive conduct). The Commission’s antitrust investigations in landmark digital cases have often spanned multiple years (the Google Android32 case took over three years and the Google Shopping case took seven years for the Commission to complete). Critics have argued that the duration of these investigations, especially in rapid-changing markets, has made it impossible to effectively reverse the damage that the conduct at issue has allegedly caused to competition. By the time a decision is issued, the undertaking concerned would have derived most, if not all, potential competitive advantages from the infringing behavior, and would have further entrenched its dominant market position. The duration factor may have played a significant role in motivating the Commission to seek market investigation powers.
The NCT proposal has, however, not been met with unequivocal approval. Stakeholders have expressed concerns that the tool is too far-reaching, disproportionate to the issues it seeks to address, and legally questionable (its legal basis is at least partially the antitrust provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, despite the fact that the NCT’s application – as envisaged – cannot result in a finding of infringement). Also, the design of the NCT itself is raising questions: the profound impact the tool may have on markets and market players, especially in its broadest possible form, requires meticulous design of the different parameters for its use, namely: when use of the tool would be appropriate, who would be empowered to request the launch of an NCT investigation, what the legal thresholds and substantive standards of assessment would be, and what precise form the rights of defense would take. Yet, most notably, in the 40+-page questionnaire of the NCT public consultation, only one question addresses rights of defense, which is arguably the most burning concern for stakeholders. Since the NCT is evidently intended to facilitate swifter intervention, there is a pressing need to ensure that this speedy and more flexible approach does not discount on any of the rights of defense that are available to companies in regular antitrust proceedings as provided for in Regulation 1/2003. 33 In fact, beyond the uncertainty as to what form the rights of defense would take, there may be a broader systemic issue in play here: due to the relatively loose concepts involved compared to those in regular antitrust enforcement (e.g. “structural competition concerns” vs “abuse of a dominant position”), market investigation instruments have the potential to go much further with respect to the conducts targeted and the remedies that can be imposed. This far-reaching nature justifies strong checks and balances and recourse to an efficient and effective judicial oversight system.
A final observation with regard to the NCT relates to its scope of application: while two of the four policy options put on the table by the Commission are limited to certain digital or digitally enabled markets, the other two are horizontal. As the rationale presented by the Commission for the need of an NCT is heavily focused on the reform of competition enforcement in the digital sector, the proposal of a horizontal tool is somewhat puzzling. Yet, the horizontal option may be sensible in a “future-proofing” strategy: as the EU legislative procedure is rather cumbersome, and expanding the tool’s scope in the future, should the need arise, would be time- and resource-consuming (as well as uncertain), choosing the broadest possible option from the outset could make practical sense. However, the fact remains that, based on its reasoning to date, it is questionable whether the Commission has made a convincing case for a horizontally applicable market investigation tool.
3. Facilitating the Burden of Proof
The European Commission’s Digital Experts’ Report observes that highly concentrated markets with strong network effects and high barriers to entry may require the imposition on the incumbent of proving the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. In terms of specific conduct to which this burden of proof shift would apply, the Report suggests that, where a dominant platform tries to expand into neighboring markets, a presumption should exist in favor of a duty to ensure interoperability and the burden to reverse that presumption should be on the platform. The Report further notes that a presumption of interoperability could also be justified where a dominant platform controls specific competitively relevant sets of user or aggregated data that competitors cannot reproduce but need in order to compete and again the burden to reverse that presumption should be on the platform. With regard to self-preferencing, the Report makes the proposition that, if a platform serves as an important intermediary with a “regulatory” function on its platform, then that platform should bear the burden of proving that a given self-preferencing practice has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets.
The proposals for shifting the burden of proof from the investigating authority to the investigated undertaking constitute a significant departure from established norms in EU competition law. As provided for in Regulation 1/2003, the burden of proof in antitrust proceedings falls on the party making the claim at issue. It is therefore unclear how these proposals could come to pass without revision of this Regulation. It is little surprise that proposals on altering the burden of proof allocation have not been widely endorsed in other policy reports or legislative proposals in this area. Furthermore, the need for such a significant change to a fundamental procedural rule in a selective manner for a specific group of companies is not apparent in practice: the European Commission as well as national competition authorities in the EU have managed to issue decisions with findings of infringement by big tech companies in the past without having presumptions of illegality at their disposal (e.g. the EU Google Shopping case).
4. Adapting Existing Antitrust Tools to the Digital Era
Certain EU jurisdictions have recently been examining amendments to their competition laws aimed at facilitating a more effective enforcement in the digital context. The most notable and coherently laid out proposal for reform to date in the EU has come from Germany, which in late 2019 introduced for deliberation a 10th amendment to its Act Against Restraints on Competition, which is suitably dubbed “Digitalisation Act.” This draft legislation introduces modifications to German competition law focusing on its update for the digital era. It encapsulates many of the reform directions that have been put forth in the policy discourse on the subject.
The German draft amendment proposes to supplement the criteria for assessing dominance with two new criteria, namely access to data relevant for competition, and “intermediary power.” The first criterion in essence expands the “essential facilities” doctrine to expressly cover data that is necessary as a resource for effective competition. The second criterion attempts to capture the importance of intermediation services in multi-sided markets for access to purchase and supply markets. This modification targets specifically the bottleneck power of digital platforms that act as “gatekeepers.” Their market power is considered particularly enhanced due to their ability to control market access for suppliers that use the intermediary services through features such as search result rankings.
In addition to these adjustments of the dominance criteria, the 10th amendment proposes to expand the German competition authority’s powers so that it will be able to investigate in a time-efficient manner undertakings with “paramount significance for competition across markets” and the business practices they engage in. To assess whether an undertaking holds such “paramount significance,” the authority will in particular take account of:

the undertaking’s dominant position in one or more markets;
its financial strength or access to other resources;
its vertical integration and activity in interconnected markets in ways other than through vertical integration;
its access to data relevant for competition; and
the importance of the undertaking’s activities for access to purchase and supply markets by third parties, as well as the influence of those activities on business activity.

What is particularly notable about these expanded powers is that, to sanction certain practices that are considered anti-competitive, the competition authority will no longer have to prove an undertaking’s dominant position in a particular market. Rather, it will be sufficient for the authority to look at the undertaking’s overall position across multiple markets, and if it meets the paramount significance threshold, the authority will be able to block practices considered anti-competitive at an early stage, even before the undertaking entrenches a dominant position in the market at issue. The provision is considered to be targeting specifically the big tech companies which, due to their particular features such as network effects and data advantages, may outpace the competition authority when leveraging their strong market positions in certain markets to rapidly build up such positions in neighboring markets so that regulatory intervention is no longer effective. By dispensing with the arduous process of establishing an undertaking’s dominance in a specific market, this amendment’s apparent aim is to give the German competition authority powers to curb leveraging practices at a much faster pace.
Once the authority has issued a decision that finds a particular undertaking to hold “paramount significance for competition across markets,” it will be able to order that undertaking to refrain from certain practices, namely:

engaging in “self-preferencing,” that is, in its capacity as provider of access to purchase and sales markets (i.e. in its capacity as a platform), providing preferential treatment to its own products or services to the disadvantage of competing products and services;
directly or indirectly hindering its competitors in markets where the undertaking in question can rapidly expand its position even without being dominant, if the hindrance is likely to significantly impair the competitive process;
using competitively relevant data collected in a market where the undertaking in question is dominant to establish or enhance barriers to entry in markets where the undertaking is not dominant;
making the interoperability of products or services or the portability of data more difficult, thereby hindering competition; and
inadequately informing commercial users about the scope, quality or success of the service provided or commissioned, thereby making it difficult for them to assess the value of this service.

By expressly listing these practices in the legislation as potentially the subject of a prohibition, the competition authority will be able to dispense of developing detailed theories of harm, thereby facilitating faster intervention.
The 10th amendment also proposes to broaden the German competition law concept of “relative market power.” This concept is the German law manifestation of the “economic dependence” doctrine, which – irrespective of market dominance – seeks to prevent abusive practices by undertakings on which other undertakings are business-dependent. While the application of the current version of the provision is triggered only when abusive practices take place vis-à-vis economically dependent small-and-medium size enterprises (“SMEs”), the proposal expands the doctrine to business-dependent undertakings of all sizes.
Finally, the draft amendment proposes to facilitate the ability for the competition authority to impose interim measures (a sort of injunctive action). It does so by changing the threshold for such measures from the risk of serious and irreparable damage to competition to the predominant probability of an infringement finding coupled with the necessity to prevent harm to competition or to avoid an imminent and serious threat to another undertaking. This change in effect amounts to a lowering of the threshold, as the constitutive elements of the new test are likely more easily met than the stringent requirement of proving serious and irreparable damage to competition. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the draft amendment was proposed around the time the European Commission decided to impose interim measures for the first time in 18 years (this was in the Broadcom case).34 This “resurrection” of interim measures at EU level in a sector closely associated with the digital sector (chipsets for TV set-top boxes and modems) is no accident: in the context of the broader debate on the efficacy and speed of antitrust enforcement, the digital sector (equally characterized by rapid evolution of market dynamics) has been earmarked as the prime candidate for increased imposition of interim measures. As noted by Competition Commissioner Vestager after the Broadcom interim measures decision: “[I]nterim measures are one way to tackle the challenge of enforcing our competition rules in a fast and effective manner. And this is why they are so important. Especially in fast-moving markets. Whenever necessary, I am therefore committed to making the best possible use of this important tool.”35
5. Introducing Ex Post Merger Control 
The idea of introducing an ex post merger control regime, which has recently been circulating among policy circles in the EU, is arguably closely related to the perceived inadequacies of the abuse of dominance rules. These inadequacies, it is claimed, would have contributed to the creation of “mega-players” in the digital sector.
In 2018, the French competition authority launched a public consultation on a proposal to introduce a new ex post review mechanism into the French merger control regime. Under this system, unreported past mergers that did not meet EU or national filing thresholds would be open to investigation by the French competition authority if the latter would determine after implementation that the transaction is raising substantial competition concerns in France.36 The French authority originally proposed a post-transaction deadline of between six months and two years, after which ex post intervention would no longer be possible. However, more recently Isabelle de Silva, head of the French competition authority, has expressed support for the possibility of reviewing “killer acquisitions” in certain sectors, most notably the digital sector, years after the conclusion of the transaction, invoking as inspiration the US merger control system which allows for a review of mergers years after their completion.37
Although the view that the entrenchment of certain firms’ market positions is a fait accompli that can perhaps only be undone by essentially rewinding the clock on those firms’ years-long expansion may be understandable in some cases, the introduction of an ex post review would constitute a significant shift for merger control standards in the EU. Merger control has traditionally operated within the EU in an ex ante fashion, and for good reason: the legal uncertainty that an ex post regime entails could be too significant and therefore have an inhibiting effect, especially if the deadline for intervention post-transaction is very long. On the other hand, to effectively take account of the real effects of a merger on competition, a longer time horizon may be necessary.
Striking a balance between these conflicting considerations is certainly not easy. However, other proposals that have been voiced on the subject – although not perfect themselves – could be more prudent. For example, a wider introduction of transaction-value-based thresholds would be a more modest way of capturing acquisitions of start-ups by big tech firms that fall under the radar in a pure turnover-based threshold system. Another way of tackling the specific concern of “killer” acquisitions, although indirect, is offered in the UK Furman Report: for companies with the “strategic market status” designation, all acquisitions could be made subject to mandatory notification.  A more modest approach to address “killer” acquisitions has very recently been advanced by Competition Commissioner Vestager suggesting that the European Commission could be empowered to review transactions referred to the Commission by national competition authorities even if those authorities themselves do not have the power to review these transactions because they fall below the national turnover thresholds.38 Finally, a more vigorous application of interim measures in the context of abuse of dominance investigations could contribute to a more speedy and efficient antitrust enforcement, thereby preventing the risk of systematic consolidation and expansion of such firms’ market power.
  
C. Conclusion
The ongoing vigorous policy debate on reforming the application of antitrust law in the digital sector is not without reason. The digitalization of the economy has brought with it notable challenges for maintaining competitive conditions in digital and digitally enabled markets. However, certain challenges in the digital sphere are not novel and have already been dealt with by competition authorities and courts in both digital and non-digital markets using the existing antitrust toolset with success. While the digital economy’s particularities may require some tweaks to the enforcement mechanism, it is important to assess each proposal against robust necessity and proportionality standards, while placing the need to guard procedural defense rights – and, in a sense, the rule of law – at a prominent place in that reform process.
Some proposals and general policy directions for reform are uncontroversial, such as enhancing and facilitating the application of interim measures. However, before implementing concrete reforms, it is equally important to carefully study the implications of each initiative that might bring about deeper and lasting changes to the foundations of competition law enforcement in the EU. Ex ante prohibitions, the establishment of expansive market investigation powers and ex post merger control are just some of the proposals that require intense scrutiny to avoid generating chilling effects: first in their rationale, and second, if considered desirable, also in their design. It remains to be seen how this delicate balancing act will play out in practice.

211,"October 8, 2020",Trump Administration Appeals Federal Injunction Stopping TikTok Ban,"


The US is appealing a temporary block on President Donald Trump’s ban on TikTok, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
The Trump administration set out to block TikTok earlier this year due to national security concerns. If a sale wasn’t completed in time, the Chinese-owned video-sharing app would effectively have been shut down in the US.
However, a judge granted a preliminary injunction against the ruling September 27, with the position that the Trump administration had likely exceeded its legal powers.
As of Thursday, October 8, the Trump administration has set about filing a notice of appeal, beginning the process of objecting to the injunction, Bloomberg reported.
If TikTok is actually banned in the US, it will be removed from stores run by Apple and Google, which make up a large majority of the app marketplace in the country. That would mean people who didn’t already have the app wouldn’t be able to get it, and those who did, wouldn’t be able to access updates to keep upgrading the app.
The issue also covers another app, WeChat, which the Trump administration is also trying to ban. The proposed ban on WeChat was also blocked in court, and the US also appealed that last week.
Earlier this month, China announced it had found the World Trade Organization (WTO) as an ally in the fight over the proposed TikTok and WeChat bans. The WTO is a Geneva-based organization that aims to make sure global trade flows as well as possible. An unnamed China official said a closed WTO meeting had involved discussions saying the US’s measures don’t align with the WTO’s rules.

212,"October 8, 2020",Big Tech Responds To House Antitrust Report,"


The US’s four largest tech firms all responded to a congressional antitrust report that suggested Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have become too powerful and might need to be broken up, reported Techcrunch. 
The companies claimed that they all compete fairly, with Amazon slamming “fringe notions” of antitrust in a blog post filed shortly after the report’s release.
The House Judiciary Committee released its tech antitrust report, concluding that the big tech platforms should face additional regulation. The report has prompted forceful responses from four of the companies targeted by the report: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.
In a blog post entitled “Fringe Notions on Antitrust Would Destroy Small Businesses and Hurt Consumers,” Amazon stated it’s done nothing to deserve such criticisms.  Amazon dismissed the committee’s views as “fringe notions” and “regulatory spitballing,” while Apple stated it “vehemently” disagrees with the report’s conclusions.
In a similar rebuttal statement, Google protested that a forced break-up would only hurt consumers, claiming that the committee report used outdated, inaccurate allegations made by the company’s rivals.
“Free products like Search, Maps and Gmail help millions of Americans and we’ve invested billions of dollars in research and development to build and improve them,” Google stated. “We compete fairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry. … Americans simply don’t want Congress to break Google’s products or harm the free services they use every day. The goal of antitrust law is to protect consumers, not help commercial rivals.”
Facebook took exception with congressional assertions that the social media giant acquired burgeoning new companies to clone them and then put them out of business. “Facebook is an American success story,” the company stated, according to published reports. “We compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them. Acquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people.”

214,"October 6, 2020",Antitrust Enforcers Gather at the ICN 2020 Virtual Annual Conference to Tackle Challenges Presented by Digital Markets,"

By Susan Zhu (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP)1
 
On September 14-17, the International Competition Network (“ICN”) held its 2020 Annual Conference. This year’s conference was jointly hosted by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was held virtually and, for the first time, was open to the public.2 Over the course of the four-day conference, more than 3,000 attendees heard from top competition enforcers and experts from around the globe.
The focus of the ICN 2020 Annual Conference was on challenges posed by digital markets and online platforms to competition policy. Participants remarked that the topic was especially relevant because the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the rate of digital development, but has also led to protectionist tendencies by some governments and calls to relax antitrust standards in deference to industrial policy.  The DOJ and FTC expressed their conviction that antitrust enforcers should push back against these tendencies and ensure robust competition in the marketplace. Other enforcers agreed that antitrust enforcement is critical, and many expressed an urgency to meet these new challenges and advocate domestically for the importance of competition policy. Enforcers also agreed that going forward, competition policy in the digital age will become increasingly interconnected with data privacy and consumer protection.
Substantively, the main challenges identified by antitrust enforcers were alleged monopolization/abuse of dominance conduct by large online platforms; so-called “killer acquisitions” (acquisitions of small startup companies); and pricing algorithms. It was apparent during the conference that the U.S. agencies and non-U.S. agencies, notably the European Commission (“EC”), had divergent approaches to digital markets and online platforms, especially as they pertain to monopolization/abuse of dominance claims of the Big Four (Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook). While certain non-U.S. enforcers, such as the EC and the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”), elaborated on new regulations and tools they are developing, the U.S. enforcers reiterated their position that the existing laws and tools in the U.S. are flexible enough to meet any challenges posed by digital markets. Top U.S. enforcers also repeatedly and strongly cautioned against new regulatory regimes and tools, including ex ante rules and interim measures, as “blunt tools of government mandated technology solutions” that are subject to “regulatory capture” and are likely to chill competition and innovation rather than promote them. There was, however, more consensus among U.S. and non-U.S. enforcers that merger thresholds may need to be adapted to catch acquisitions of small startups by large players and that companies need to adjust their compliance policies to address digital challenges, such as pricing algorithms.
 
Some Consensus…
As a general matter, competition enforcers and experts around the world agreed that the world has become rapidly digitized and the development may accelerate even more in the near future. Indeed, digitization is no longer confined to “technology” markets, but has permeated almost every facet of the economy. Many enforcers and experts also commented that digital markets, particularly online platforms, often have characteristics that may present challenges to competition policy, such as multi-sided platforms, zero-price business models, and indirect network effects.
In responding to these challenges, enforcers across various jurisdictions agreed that it is important for competition authorities to invest in new internal resources relevant to digital markets. To that end, many jurisdictions have reorganized or newly established staff who are exclusively focused on the digital economy. For example, the DOJ reorganized its Technology and Financial Services Section to focus exclusively on technology markets and platform business models. Other jurisdictions have brought in non-legal staff like data scientists and IT experts to strengthen their internal knowledge base and skill set. For example, the Korean Federal Trade Commission (“KFTC”) recently hired fifteen digital forensic experts. Moreover, many enforcers are utilizing sophisticated technology tools and large volumes of data to detect violations or monitor compliance, particularly in the cartel space. Enforcers also emphasized that companies need to make sure that their compliance programs are updated appropriately to address potential new areas of liability, such as machine pricing algorithms.
Enforcers across multiple jurisdictions further agreed that one of the challenges posed by digital markets are acquisitions of small companies that are below merger filing thresholds because they do not yet have significant revenues, but nevertheless may have other assets that pose a competitive threat, such as a large user base or a large amount of data. Enforcers from many jurisdictions indicated that they have implemented or are considering alternatives to turnover thresholds to address this issue, such as transaction value or market share thresholds. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons stated that the FTC is conducting a 6(b) study of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft with regards to their acquisitions of nascent companies that are below the merger filing thresholds. The FTC hopes that the study will allow it to “examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals,” “learn more about how small firms perform after they are acquired by large technology firms,” and help it consider “whether additional transactions should be subject to premerger notification requirements.”3
  
… and Some Differences
Despite consensus on many important issues, the conference also laid bare some key differences in how competition authorities view the need for new legal frameworks to address digital markets. The divergence was most apparent between the U.S. agencies and the EC. EC Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager described digital markets and online platforms as unique because they are often winner-take-all and prone to tipping, meaning that winners can capture dominant market shares and become gatekeepers that put up barriers to keep other competitors out. Enforcers from other non-U.S. jurisdictions agreed that large market shares and high concentrations are potentially problematic. U.S. enforcers and experts disagreed for the most part. In his keynote speech, Professor Herbert Hovenkamp opined that for the most part, large online platforms like the Big Four are not winner-take-all (or natural monopolies) because there is significant product differentiation. FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson agreed that the winner-take-all assumption does not describe most online platforms. She also highlighted that consumers can benefit from network effects, so the existence of a platform with strong network effects does not necessarily mean there is a need for stronger enforcement. Similarly, Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim reminded the audience that “digital” is not just one thing and digital companies have different business models, which modify their incentives.
This divergence plays out in the agencies’ responses to challenges posed by digital markets. Several non-U.S. jurisdictions have established or are working on new regulatory regimes and tools. EC Commissioner Vestager spoke about two initiatives: 1) the New Competition Tool (“NCT”); and 2) the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) ex ante rules for large online platforms. (The NCT would allow the EC to investigate and impose remedies in markets when it believes the market structures are inherently anticompetitive without a prior finding of infringement by any specific companies. Several European enforcers also expressed hope that the NCT may be a useful tool to investigate tacit collusions as a result of AI and machine pricing algorithms. The DSA ex ante rules would be a list of dos and don’ts for what the EC considers to be large gatekeeper platforms.) Another example discussed was the ACCC, which is working on the News Media Bargaining Code to address bargaining imbalances between platforms and businesses.
U.S. enforcers, including FTC Chairman Simons and Assistant Attorney General Delrahim, expressed the U.S. position that new regulatory regimes, especially ex ante rules, are not the answer, and that the U.S. antitrust laws are flexible enough to adapt to big technology companies and reach conduct that undermines competition. As Delrahim said, “[b]y timely using our existing laws to ensure robust competition in the digital marketplace, we can prevent having to resort to the blunt tool of government mandated technological solutions, which can stifle the very innovative atmosphere that our competition laws seek to promote.”4  Simons similarly advised “strong caution before adopting any regulatory regime rather than relying on a competition regime” because U.S. history shows that regulatory regimes are often subject to “regulatory capture and political influence, resulting in entrenched dominant firms and artificial barriers to new competition.”5  Delrahim agreed that agencies “get captured by the industries they regulate” because “the rules cannot adapt, and what happens is that businesses innovate to those rules rather than innovating for the consumer ultimately.”  For instance, Simons explained that the EC’s proposed ex ante regulations for “gatekeepers” will need to have “some kind of a threshold at which somebody becomes a gatekeeper or some other kind of dominance threshold that triggers the regulation and what you have to worry about there is creating an incentive to stop competing before or to pull your punches before you hit that threshold,” which is “very damaging to consumer welfare.”  Delrahim also emphasized that competition authorities have to make sure that any new regulations and tools do not “expand beyond the reach of competition law under the guise of competition laws.” In summary, he iterated U.S. jurisprudence’s long held conviction that “antitrust laws represent an effort to avoid detailed government regulation of business by keeping competition in control of prices” and government should “confine its responsibility to seeing that a true competitive economy functions.”
 
How to Remedy
By the same token, the divergence was reflected in the agencies’ approach to remedies. EC Commissioner Vestager explained that because digital markets are prone to tipping, it is sometimes appropriate to utilize interim measures during a pending investigation to ensure that there is no irreversible anticompetitive harm, as the EC did in Broadcom.6 U.S. enforcers, on the other hand, cautioned strongly against interim measures, both for due process concerns and because several U.S. studies have concluded that antitrust remedies in past monopolization cases have largely been ineffective. As FTC Commissioner Wilson stressed, “if history demonstrates remedies in unilateral conduct cases have been at best irrelevant and at worst have inflicted harm on consumers, I worry that imposing interim measures before an investigation has completed increases the likelihood that we may harm rather than benefit consumers.”  For the same reason, Wilson stated that structural remedies are less likely to be appropriate in Section 2 monopolization cases, which Professor Hovenkamp also agreed with. Indeed, Wilson suggested that if there is no viable remedy available, enforcers should seriously consider whether to pursue enforcement.
Enforcers did generally agree that data will be an important aspect of remedy assessment because it plays a crucial role for many digital markets and online platforms. However, there was no consensus on what form a data remedy might take. Data access, interoperability, transparency, prohibition of data aggregation were all mentioned as potential remedies, but enforcers acknowledged that each has drawbacks and it can be difficult to devise an effective remedy.  Indeed, U.S. enforcers have observed in the past that forced sharing of data “reduces the incentive to invest in innovation” and is an “inherently regulatory” approach, which is why U.S. laws generally do not impose a duty to share one’s assets (data or otherwise) with competitors.7 They have also cautioned that “legally mandated data access, data sharing, or data pooling involves significant administrative costs” and mandatory data sharing may “cause enhanced risks of cartelization.”8
 
ICN Going Forward
As the ICN is entering its third decade, it will be interesting to see how it evolves and responds to the new challenges its members face. Participants at the conference praised the ICN for creating a forum for competition enforcers to collaborate and share best practices, as well as helping new competition agencies grow. Going forward, ICN plans to focus further on diversity and inclusiveness (especially inclusion of developing countries and new competition agencies) in composition, participation, and agenda. ICN members acknowledged that there is, and there will be, skepticism of the importance of competition law, especially during times of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic or in a jurisdiction where the competition authority has been established only recently. Many ICN members expect that they may need to tackle political questions or collaborate with other relevant government agencies, such as consumer protection and data privacy. ICN members also acknowledged that continued outward-looking advocacy (i.e., ICN as an external advocate) will be critical for the future of competition law and committed to continue to advocate for competition enforcement.

215,"October 6, 2020",House Panel Proposes Sweeping Antitrust Reforms To Curb Big Tech,"


On Tuesday, October 6, a House panel proposed a series of sweeping antitrust reforms to curb the power of US technology giants including Amazon and Alphabet ’s Google, the result of a yearlong antitrust investigation that found the companies are abusing their dominance, reported Bloomberg Law.
After a 16-month investigation into competitive practices at Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust has released its findings and recommendations on how to reform laws to fit the digital age. The report concludes that the four Big Tech companies enjoy monopoly power and suggest Congress take up changes to antitrust laws that could result in parts of their businesses being separated, reported CNBC.
The Democratic majority staff laid out their takeaways from hearings, interviews, and the 1.3 million documents they scoured throughout the investigation in a 450-page report. They conclude that the four Big Tech companies enjoy monopoly power and suggest Congress take up changes to antitrust laws that could result in parts of the businesses being separated.
The recommendations from Democratic staff include imposing structural separations and prohibiting dominant platforms from entering adjacent lines of business. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicillin (Democrat – Rhode Island) has previously referred to this method as a type of “Glass-Steagall” law for the internet, referring to the 1930s era law that separated commercial from investment banking.
The Democrats also would like to instruct antitrust agencies to presume mergers by dominant platforms to be anticompetitive, shifting the burden onto the merging parties to prove their deal would not harm competition, rather than making enforcers prove it would. And preventing dominant platforms from preferencing their own services, instead making them offer “equal terms for equal products and services.”
Republicans have voiced objections to some of the bolder proposals in the report, like imposing structural separations. Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado), a key ally of the subcommittee majority who has been in favor of antitrust reform, has prepared his own response to the report outlining areas of “common ground” and “non-starters,” according to a draft version obtained by CNBC.

216,"October 6, 2020",House’s Big Tech Findings May Be Released In Three Reports,"


The US House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee’s findings on the business practices of four large tech companies is expected to be broken up into three reports, according to Reuters, as bipartisanship among committee members appeared to break down.
The report from a Judiciary Committee panel focuses on how the business practices of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc hurt rivals. A majority Democrat-led staff report is likely to be issued, along with two others from Republican members on the panel, the sources said.
Details of the House’s antitrust probe have been leaked, CNBC also reported in this video.

The committee, led by Democratic Chairman David Cicilline, is expected to release the highly anticipated report this week. 
The two reports from Republicans are likely to come from Representatives Ken Buck and Jim Jordan. A draft of Buck’s report and recommendations was released on Monday, in which he said efforts such as those aimed at breaking up tech companies is not going to be supported by conservatives.
The report from Jim Jordan is likely to focus on the issue of conservative bias, Reuters reported. 
Jordan’s response to the majority report is expected to criticize Big Tech for allegedly stifling conservative voices; urge that they be stripped of some protections under Section 230, a federal law that protects internet companies; and call for rigorous enforcement of existing antitrust law, according to a Republican spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee.
Democrats are urging Republicans to sign on to Buck’s response because it is positive with regards to the majority report, according to a source familiar with the matter.

217,"October 6, 2020",Cicilline: Congress Needs “The People’s” Help To Rein In Big Tech,"


Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island) says passing antitrust regulation to rein in companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google is going to be tough, reported Venture Beat.
Cicilline  believes Congress will need the American people’s help to enact any meaningful reforms. Cicilline is chair of the antitrust subcommittee in Congress and spoke Sunday, october 4, at a Yale University School of Law conference on antitrust and Big Tech.
His remarks precede the anticipated release of what Cicilline calls the most extensive antitrust law reform investigation by Congress in over 50 years. Identifying anticompetitive behavior by big companies is pretty easy, he said, but developing solutions and gathering the political support needed for reform is a challenge.
“We’re going to have to combat companies that have an enormous stake in maintaining the status quo, which has been enormously profitable for them, and so this will be a big fight,” he said. “We’re going to need the support of the American people when we move forward with this legislation. It will only happen if we can rally the country around it because we’re fighting against strong economic forces and powerful corporations that are likely to oppose what we’re trying to do. And getting the American people on our side to understand it matters in their daily lives is going to be really critical.”
Cicilline said it’s important for the American people to understand that the rise of Big Tech companies has resulted in declines in innovation, trustworthy news sources, consumer choices, quality, and worker power, along with increased costs for consumers.

218,"October 6, 2020",Parties At Odds In Final Stages Of House’s Big Tech Report,"


According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, partisan divisions are emerging in the final stage of a congressional inquiry into US technology giants.
The disagreements between Democrats and Republicans on the House Antitrust Subcommittee are focused on policy recommendations growing out of the panel’s 16-month-long probe into the market power of Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google, and Facebook according to congressional aides.
The House panel is preparing a report detailing its conclusions. It had been expected to publish Monday, but hasn’t yet been released.
Republicans are privately balking at some ideas in the draft report, which was penned primarily by Democratic staff, reported the WSJ. GOP lawmakers don’t support a Democratic proposal to separate large online platforms from other lines of business, the aides said. Some Republicans are also disappointed the report doesn’t discuss the companies’ power to moderate online speech, a hot-button issue for conservatives, the aides said.
Other recommendations have bipartisan support, including boosting resources for US antitrust enforcers and making legal changes that could make it harder for a large tech company to buy another firm, the aides said. One proposal aims to put a heavier burden on companies to prove a merger doesn’t hurt competition. Another would require tech companies to report more mergers to US antitrust authorities to review.

219,"October 5, 2020",ANALYSIS: Federal Antitrust Complaints Sliding Into Year End,"


By Eleanor Tyler (Legal Analyst) & Jacquelyn Palmer (Research and Data Analyst)
Antitrust complaints in federal court are up this year compared to 2019 — but antitrust complaints during 2020 have been on a long slide downward since a very strong February.
That’s not terribly surprising. Starting in March, most federal courts have been under modified procedures that make prosecuting a lawsuit (particularly one in which the right to a jury trial is important) more uncertain. Furthermore, many companies that might file an antitrust lawsuit are struggling to regain their own footing as markets fundamentally shift. It might not be the natural time to file “bet the firm” litigation in federal court.
And yet the number of filings for the year continues to be pretty robust when compared to last year. By the end of the third quarter this year, 468 complaints had been filed in federal court under the “antitrust” nature of suit code (410), according to an analysis of Bloomberg Law dockets. During the same period in 2019, plaintiffs had filed 397 antitrust suits. Last year, the fourth quarter was the strongest for antitrust complaints, led by 84 new complaints filed in October. This year, no month has come close to the 97 complaints plaintiffs filed in February.
Overall, it’s hard to say that this year’s complaint filings are looking up. Instead, it looks like they are sliding downward throughout the year. Of course, if the Department of Justice files a complaint against Google before year end, as expected, follow-on civil litigation could reverse that trend swiftly. Only time will tell.

220,"October 4, 2020",Facebook Claims Gov Breakup Of Whatsapp & Instagram Defies Established Law,"


According to Facebook, a government effort to break up Facebook from Instagram and WhatsApp would defy established law, cost billions of dollars, and harm consumers.
The 14-page document, produced by lawyers at Sidley Austin and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, offers a preview of the social-media giant’s defense as federal antitrust enforcers and members of Congress continue to pursue investigations into Facebook’s power and past competitive behavior. Probes of other technology companies such as Alphabet, Google, Amazon, and Apple are also ongoing.
The House Antitrust Subcommittee this month is expected to release the findings of its investigation into Facebook and other companies, reported the WSJ. 
The report stated separating the two apps from Facebook would be nearly impossible to achieve, cost billions, weaken security of the services, and harm users’ experience.
“A ‘breakup’ of Facebook is thus a complete nonstarter,” the document stated, according to WSJ.
But Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who has said Facebook should be broken up, told WSJ that Facebook’s insistence that the government’s approvals of the acquisitions in the past should limit action in federal court today is “surprisingly weak.”
He said the DOJ lawsuit would probably rely on the argument that Facebook made these acquisitions to reduce competition. That’s a question that wasn’t considered when the FTC chose not to oppose the Instagram and WhatsApp deals, he said, according to WSJ.
Wu also noted the fact that it would be difficult and expensive to break up the company’s divisions would not carry any weight in a courtroom.
“There is no ‘it’s too hard’ defense,’” Wu told WSJ.
In July, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the acquisition of Instagram to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. He said it was a natural extension of its global social media business and not an attempt to remove a potential competitor from the marketplace.
“It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed,” Zuckerberg said. “In hindsight, it looks obvious that Instagram reached the scale it has, [but] at the time, it was far from obvious.”

221,"October 1, 2020","Senate Committee Issues Subpoenas To Zuckerberg, Pichai & Dorsey","


Thursday morning, October 1, the Senate Commerce committee voted unanimously to issue subpoenas to the CEOs of Facebook, Google, and Twitter; showing a significant escalation in Congress’s ongoing efforts to reexamine the liability protections of Section 230. The three CEOs will now be ordered to appear before the committee at a date still to be scheduled.
The hearing comes as the committee considers a new bill from Sen. Lindsay Graham, intended to limit the scope of “Good Samaritan” moderation that receives legal protections under Section 230. But the senators’ concerns reached far beyond 230, with different members also raising questions about privacy protections and broader antitrust issues.
“Big Tech, I believe, poses the single greatest threat to free speech in our day, and the single greatest threat to democracy in our day,” Sen. Ted Cruz (Republican – Texas) told the committee. “It should speak volumes that every member of our committee just voted to issue these subpoenas.”
A number of tech regulations have stalled out during this congressional session, ranging from privacy measures like the Browser Act to more recent bills to add an ambiguous “good faith” requirement to Section 230. Most recently, lawmakers attempted a bipartisan compromise in the PACT Act, which aims to address concerns of market power and ideological moderation bias in a single measure. But with only weeks to go before the national election, none of the bills are likely to proceed in this Congress.

222,"September 30, 2020",De-classified: What Really Happened to Newspapers,"
By Nic Hopkins (Google Australia Blog)
In the mid-1990s the status of newspapers as the main source of news to society felt both indisputable and permanent.The Internet was a novelty. We accessed the web on dial-up modems, surfed pages using Netscape and searched for information on Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. Around the same time, across the Pacific, Amazon had only just launched an obscure online bookstore. In 1995, I began my career as a journalist at The Advertiser in Adelaide. The web was so niche that there were fevered debates about whether we would need one “Internet terminal,” or perhaps two, for an entire newsroom.
Newspapers back then could afford to take their time with technology – there was no rush. They were unassailable and spectacularly profitable, thanks largely to classified advertising. Rupert Murdoch once described classifieds as “rivers of gold”.Today, as we all know, the landscape is vastly different. The print rivers of gold have dried up, print circulation has sharply declined. On the face of it, the news business has never looked so vulnerable. To me, and anyone else who has worked in print or simply loves newspapers, this has been a painful process. My dad worked in newspapers – it’s in our blood…

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, democratic lawmakers are expected to call on Congress to curtail big technology companies, possibly through forced separation of online platforms, as a House panel concludes its probe into Big Tech companies.
The House Antitrust Subcommittee is nearing completion of a report wrapping up its 15-month investigation of Alphabet’s Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. The report follows the committee’s collection of more than one million documents from the companies and competitors, as well as a July hearing with CEOs of the four tech giants.
Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), who chairs the subcommittee, has indicated the panel is poised to recommend significant measures targeting Big Tech’s power, including requiring owners of huge technology platforms to separate those platforms from other businesses.
Mr. Cicilline hasn’t released details, but such a law could potentially ban Amazon from competing with sellers on Amazon.com, or Google from offering services that consumers look for on its search engine.
“You can’t set all the rules, control the marketplace and also sell on it, in the way that Amazon does, for example,” Mr. Cicilline said in a recent podcast for the Brookings Institution think tank.

Canadian lawmakers want Google and Facebook to pay for content, saying that “the government will act to ensure web companies’ revenue is shared more fairly with our creators and media” and adding that “corporate tax avoidance by digital giants” is next on its list. Members of Canada’s governing Liberal party last week renewed calls to legislate changes to force Big Tech platforms to pay media producers a cut of ad dollars.
CBC reported that “in its throne speech on [Sept. 23], the Liberal government put it this way: ‘Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities.’” That speech was delivered by Gov. Gen. Julie Payette, who pledged that “things must change, and will change.” 
Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault has been signalling his intent to take on the Silicon Valley companies for months, but amid the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic crisis, there was no guarantee that it would remain a legislative priority.
“We’ve felt for a long time that we’re contributing a lot to these platforms and getting nothing back,” Payette told CBC News in an earlier interview. “It’s because we’re in this essentially powerless position that we’re asking government to intervene.”

Cloud services like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google need more competitors so European businesses have more choice about where to store their data, the European Union’s tech and antitrust chief says at an online conference Monday, reported Bloomberg Law. 
“We need competition to the cloud solutions that we see today,” said European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, adding it was important that European businesses “feel they have real choices when it comes to how and where to store their data.”
Speaking at an event on Online Competition staged by the German Presidency of the EU in early September, the Commission’s Vice-President for Digital, Margarethe Vestager, also noted how Europe’s online marketplaces should not be controlled by a handful of dominant gatekeeper platforms.
“Europe’s online marketplaces should be vibrant ecosystems, where startups have a real chance to blossom. They shouldn’t be closed shops, controlled by a handful of gatekeeper platforms,” she said.
In wider EU attempts to clamp down on so-called ‘gatekeeper platforms,’ the EU executive will, alongside the Digital Services Act, also present before the close of the year a New Competition Tool, which will be designed to mitigate structural risks in markets and intervene in situations whereby a market is close to ‘tipping.’

227,"September 27, 2020",How FTC Commissioner Slaughter Wants To Make Antitrust Enforcement Antiracist,"


By Lauren Feiner, CNBC
Like workers across America, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter has been thinking this summer about how to make her workplace antiracist. She was on maternity leave as the country erupted in unrest, demanding an end to racial injustice in protests spurred by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. 
Unlike many workers, however, Slaughter’s decisions can have a substantial impact on consumers around the country as one of five commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission. In that role, Slaughter, a Democrat, votes on enforcement actions and policies involving consumer protection and competition.
During her tenure, the FTC has fined tech companies including Facebook and Google over allegations the companies misused users’ data. The agency is currently investigating Facebook on antitrust grounds and has reportedly interviewed Amazon sellers about the firm’s competition practices.
In an interview Thursday, Slaughter expanded on a series of tweets she sent earlier this month describing the ways she believed the FTC could take steps to ensure greater equity in its enforcement decisions.
Slaughter told CNBC she had long found it “bizarre” that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. has often striven to be “value-neutral.” She emphasized that whether the FTC chooses to bring an enforcement action or not, it will have consequences on consumers within existing structures, making it impossible for enforcement to be truly neutral.

The EU’s General Court ruled that the commission wrongly declared in 2016 that Apple was given illegal state aid when it struck a low tax rate agreement with Irish authorities.

A group of Apple’s critics including Spotify Technology, Match Group Inc and “Fortnite” creator Epic Games  have joined a nonprofit group that plans to advocate for legal and regulatory action to challenge the iPhone maker’s App Store practices, reported the New York Times.
Apple charges a commission of between 15%-30% for apps that use its in-app payment system and sets out extensive rules that apps must comply with to appear in its App Store, which is the only way Apple allows consumers to download native apps onto devices such as the iPhone. Those practices have drawn criticism and formal legal complaints from some developers.
The Coalition for App Fairness, structured as a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. and Brussels, said it plans to advocate legal changes that would force Apple to change. Beyond Epic, Match and Spotify, other members include smaller firms such as Basecamp, Blix, Blockchain.com, Deezer, and Tile, along with developers from Europe including the European Publishers Council, News Media Europe and Protonmail.
Sarah Maxwell, a representative for the group who previously worked at financial technology firm Blockchain.com and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, said the group was founded out of “a lack of hope that things will ever change” and aims to recruit more developers.
“While it’s great that we have big names like Epic and Spotify in the group, we’re not speaking just for them,” she said in an interview.
Epic is suing Apple over antitrust claims in a US federal court in California, while Spotify has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union. Maxwell declined to comment on how much funding the Coalition for App Fairness has raised and from whom.
The group on Thursday also laid out 10 “App Store Principles” it plans to demand, including that “No developer should be required to pay unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory fees or revenue shares.”

230,"September 23, 2020",The Need For Regulation Of Big Tech Beyond Antitrust,"


By Tom Wheeler, Phil Verveer & Gene Kimmelman, Brookings
The nation’s antitrust laws, developed in response to the industrial age, have become the focus of attention in the internet age. Hearings by the House Antitrust Subcommittee revealed substantial evidence of how Big Tech sustained and expanded their market dominance with anticompetitive practices. The Justice Department is reportedly preparing an antitrust action against Google. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is similarly reported to be preparing an action against Facebook.
Enforcement of the antitrust statutes is an important tool for the protection of competitive markets. Yet, it is a blunt instrument unable to reach many nuanced competition and consumer protection issues created by the digital economy. It is inherently uncertain in outcome, reliably lengthy in process, and an after-the-fact response rather than a broad-based set of rules.
Without a doubt, Big Tech has delivered wonderous new capabilities. However, the “move fast and break things” mantra of Silicon Valley has meant that digital companies move fast and make their own rules. Antitrust statutes reflect a time when markets were relatively stable because technology was relatively stable. Today, the rapid pace of digital technology means companies can move rapidly to advantage themselves by exploiting consumers and eliminating potential competition.

Is it an antitrust offense to sell face masks at a high price in the midst of a pandemic? In this essay I address this question by examining two recent decisions in South Africa that found the high prices for face masks charged by two retailers were excessive under South Africa competition law, even though neither firm was shown to be dominant by traditional methods. In addition to discussing the two cases, I argue that South Africa’s effort to use competition law to prevent this kind of price increase has important lessons for antitrust enforcement elsewhere, including the United States. Specifically, the two cases remind us of the importance of price in antitrust analysis; the need to pay attention to justice in antitrust analysis; our over-willingness to rely on market corrections rather than acknowledging market failures; and our need to change our culture of antitrust enforcement. It may be that the “supreme evil” of antitrust is not collusion, but a failure to pay attention to how antitrust can advance justice.

Is it an antitrust offense to sell face masks at a high price in the midst of a pandemic?
In the United States, this rhetorical question would be answered with another question. Why does the pandemic matter? It’s not an antitrust offense regardless of when or where. Conventional antitrust wisdom is that high prices don’t violate the antitrust laws so long as the high prices are set by a single seller, even b...

232,"September 20, 2020",Could New York’s 21st Century Antitrust Act Usher a New Chapter in the History of Anti-Monopoly Legislation?,"

By Shaoul Sussman (Institute for Local Self-Reliance)1
 
Over the last year, much-deserved attention has been paid to the ongoing Congressional antitrust investigation of Big Tech and the antitrust case that the DOJ is apparently building against Google. But at the same time, an important, but much less eye-catching effort to bring Big Tech to justice is brewing in the New York State Senate.
Earlier this summer, Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris introduced a Bill that would make it easier for the State and New Yorkers to sue Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple, among others, in our courts.2
On Monday, September 14, the New York Senate held a public hearing to discuss the Bill. One of the Bill’s most notable supporters is the State’s Attorney General, Letitia James, who argued that currently her office is “handicapped” by the limitations of existing antitrust law and that New Yorkers are suffering as a result. In her testimony on Monday, AG James also revealed that her office is conducting several investigations into Big Tech – perhaps signaling that State AG will utilize the new bill if passed later this year.
The Senate invited me to testify on behalf of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and during the hearing I also argued in favor of the Bill, pointing out that the pandemic has exposed the economic concentration problem our communities are facing at this moment of crisis. I argued that the wealth of the few has reached unparalleled levels while the earnings for the average worker have barely increased, leaving many New Yorkers with no cushion to blunt the force of the downturn when COVID-19 struck.
 
Overview of the Proposed 21st Century Antitrust Act  
Unlike the federal Sherman Act, New York’s existing antitrust law, the Donnelly Act of 1893, does not contain a provision that explicitly prohibits single-firm anticompetitive conduct or monopolization claims.  As a result, the case law in interpreting the scope and the reach of the act is a mixed bag.
The bill put forward by Senator Gianaris, S.8700-A, seeks to remedy this outcome by expressly allowing monopolization claims styled similarly to those brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
But the bill goes a step forward by introducing the legal concept of abuse of dominance – which is prevalent in many foreign jurisdictions. In Europe and other jurisdictions the abuse of dominance standard encompasses firms with market shares of 50 percent or less as opposed to a market share of roughly 65-70 percent required under existing federal law precedent. During the hearing, AG James suggested that the market share threshold under New York law should be set at 40 percent.
In addition, many foreign jurisdictions impose on dominant firms a “special responsibility” to avoid certain types of conduct that could potentially harm competition. It is unclear whether such a duty will be imposed under New York law, but supporters of the bill such as Jay Himes argued for the adoption of the standard.
Finally, in jurisdictions where the “abuse of dominance” standard is enforced, additional types of conduct are deemed anti-competitive and therefore prohibited, such as monopoly leveraging, margin squeezing, essential facilities, refusal to deal, excessive pricing, and more. But again, it is currently unclear whether, and to what degree, this existing precedent will inform New York’s elected officials.
In fact, in its current form, the bill does not provide a precise definition of the term “abuse of dominance,” adopting broad and expansive language that emulates the Sherman Act to great extent.
 
Opposition to the Bill in Its Current Form
During the hearing, various parties opposing the Bill argued that adopting a new and undefined standard will introduce uncertainty, confusion, and compliance difficulties and thus have a “chilling” effect on both large and small firms that operate in growing or emerging markets.3
During his testimony Himes rejected these arguments. He pointed out that “dominant” firms are rare and therefore the proposed Bill will cover the conduct of only a limited set of companies. He also argued that those larger firms also possess the financial resources and expertise to guide and even defend their conduct in the courts.
 
The Criminal Provisions in the Bill 
Some supporters of the Bill raised concerns surrounding the implementation of criminal charges for unilateral anticompetitive conduct. I personally think that these concerns are unwarranted.
When serving as Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement in the Antitrust Division under President George W Bush, Scott Hammond made a convincing case for enhancing criminal liability for antitrust violations. In the context of cartels, he argued that that an increase in criminal penalties “will bring antitrust penalties in line with those for other white-collar crimes and will ensure the penalties more accurately reflect the enormous harm inflicted by cartels in today’s marketplace.”4 And I believe that this statement accurately reflects both the need and the justification for imposing criminal liability under the new law.
In my testimony, I pointed out that monopoly power undermines small businesses and is harming dairy farmers in Central New York. It has also contributed to desolation of Main Street in many small towns and urban neighborhoods in the State and to the death of many vital local New York newspapers. I also mentioned that recent studies have linked monopolies to racial inequality.5 Other studies have also demonstrated that monopolies harm working people by foreclosing competition over labor which forces tens of thousands to rely on “gig” non-union jobs.6
Accordingly, the Bill must include criminal penalties to more accurately reflect the enormous harm inflicted by monopolists in today’s marketplace.
In addition, it will be erroneous to make any special distinction with respect to criminal liability based upon the fact that the Bill will potentially reach new classes of offenders or new types of unilateral conduct. It is true that currently criminal liability is imposed almost exclusively by courts in Section 1 cases, but as Judge Learned Hand pointed out, a firm’s power to set a monopolist’s price is exactly the same species of evil as the unlawful power of conspirators to fix their price.7 The power to fix prices is the gist of monopoly power, and when monopoly power is unlawfully obtained or employed, the monopolist pursues the same proximate goal for himself as the price-fixing conspirators aim to share together.8 After all, bank robbers are prosecuted even if they act alone.
 
A Private Cause of Action 
Other supporters raised concerns with the Bill’s provisions which provide for a private cause of action. These concerns echo similar concerns that are often raised on the federal level by various think tanks and members of the defense bar.
But from a purely economic perspective, allowing for a private cause of action will not increase the costs of compliance with the new law. The only perceived additional cost to firms will emanate from more frequent litigation of alleged antitrust violations. But our court systems already possess the tool to deter frivolous and meritless litigation by imposing high pleading standards and sanctioning parties that bring pointless legal action. And there can be no serious argument that meritorious action should not be brought only due to the nature of the party bringing suit.
On the other hand, the elimination of private cause of action under the new abuse of dominance standard will greatly increase the danger of regulatory capture. If New York would be the only state in the nation to possess the means to bring Big Tech to heal, and the AG’s office would become the only entity that could do so, the risk of such capture will become even greater.
Perhaps more importantly, in the Harvard Law Review article “A Capture Theory of Antitrust Federalism,” Judge John Shepard Wiley Jr.’s pointed out that even the perceived threat of regulatory capture had led courts, including the Supreme Court to impose new and elaborate burdens in cases brought by state agencies.9
 
What Can Be Improved
New York has a particularly long and illustrious history of combating monopolies and curbing corporate power. For example, in 1838 New York’s legislature passed the first anti-monopoly law in the nation, which broke-up the stranglehold large and well-connected banks imposed on New Yorkers. Similarly, the rise of the Robber Barons during the Gilded Age drove the State to pass the Donnelly Antitrust Act in 1893.
Surprisingly, the-now-largely-ineffective-127-year-old-Act remains the only major antitrust law New York has on its books today. But for decades this wasn’t a problem, because New Yorkers could rely on our Federal courts and agencies to effectively police and prosecute monopolists.
However, over the last 40 years, our federal judicial system and enforcement agencies began to reverse course and significant antimonopoly precedent was eroded. The magnitude of the shift cannot be overstated: The Supreme Court stealthily overturned existing precedent and unleashed the relentless growth of the corporate goliaths, and our communities are footing the bill.
This experience must inform New York. It should not leave the job of interpreting its new “abuse of dominance” standard to the judicial branch. In fact, I would argue that the concentration and monopoly crisis we are currently facing is due, in part, to the limitations set by courts upon broad statutes such as the Sherman Act and their adoption of a narrow interpretation of their purpose and scope. The courts may still strike down the Bill if it finds it arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, but we should be wary of allowing the Judiciary to once again erect their prejudices into legal principles. Our democratically elected representatives, being familiar with local conditions, are in the best position to formulate and articulate this legal standard. And for those who doubt their ability, recent examples such as the Amex10 and Qualcomm11 decisions demonstrate that at times the judiciary is equally out of touch with market realities.12
By setting bright-line rules and clearly articulating what constitutes a violation of the new law, New York could become a leader and an example for future Federal or State legislation.
One such rule should be the imposition of a presumption of anticompetitive behavior when a certain market share or market power threshold is met. Another, is clearly articulating a lower market-share-threshold under the abuse of dominance standard than that currently applied under the Sherman Act.
Historically, New York has been at the forefront of the fight against monopoly power. It is now time for New York to reinvigorate its antitrust laws and lead the antimonopoly movement once again. By introducing such bright-line rules, our elected officials will ensure that this momentous legislative achievement is not squandered by bad precedent and judicial prejudice.

233,"September 18, 2020",Trump Admin To Ban TikTok From US App Stores Starting Sunday,"


The US Commerce Department has issued a new order to block people in the US from downloading the popular video-sharing app TikTok as of September 20th, Reuters first reported Friday.
The full order was published by the Department of Commerce on Friday morning. “Any transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd,” the order reads, “shall be prohibited to the extent permitted under applicable law.” It is set to take effect on September 20th.
Over the last few weeks, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, has been engaged in talks with US companies like Microsoft and Oracle to create a new company, TikTok Global, that would meet the Trump administration’s concerns over user data security. Earlier this month, President Trump sparked negotiations after calling for US TikTok operations to be shut down unless sold to a US company by September 15th. Microsoft has dropped out of the bidding, leaving Oracle and Walmart as the leading candidates to hold stake in the new TikTok company. Still, the administration has yet to strike a deal that meets all of its requirements.
Officials told Reuters that a Commerce Department rule banning US downloads of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps like the messaging platform WeChat could be issued as early as Friday. That rule would reportedly go into effect Sunday, September 20th, banning new downloads of both WeChat and TikTok.
Reuters said that the administration’s ban would bar Apple and Google from offering any of these Chinese-owned apps in their app stores for US users. The tech companies would still be allowed to offer TikTok to users outside of the US. US-based companies would not be barred from conducting business with the Chinese-owned apps, like how Walmart and Starbucks allow users to make transactions through WeChat.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Reuters Friday, “We have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.”

Hi. I’m Randy Picker, and I’m a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. The House Subcommittee on Antitrust has been undertaking an extensive investigation of platforms. They had this epic hearing just Wednesday with the four horsemen of the apocalypse. I think that’s who was there. So it was great. I can’t tell you the last time I’ve watched television for five and a half hours consecutively, but that is what I did on Wednesday. In connection with the House hearings, they asked people to write some statements and I wrote a statement and there were a bunch of statements and CPI, who’s hosting all of this, has put those statements up on the website, so you can go there and get those. They’re very much worth reading. I then sent out a tweet and on LinkedIn and said, “Oh, we should have some sessions on these. These are great papers.”
Academics talk about papers, workshop culture. That’s what we do. And CPI reached out and said, “That’s a great idea. Let’s do it.” So that’s why we’re here, and so this is a fourth of them.

238,"September 16, 2020",FTC Wants Texas Regulators To Block Community-Shannon Merger,"


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked Texas not to approve mergers between Shannon Medical Center and Community Hospital. 
The FTC’s position is that the merger of San Angelo’s hospitals will lead to a loss of competition, resulting in higher prices and harming consumers.
The commission made similar arguments for the proposed Hendrick’s acquisition of Abilene Regional.   
Community Health Systems announced Monday, April 20, 2020 that a subsidiary of the company has signed a definitive agreement to sell 171-bed San Angelo Community Medical Center (SPAC) in San Angelo and its associated assets to subsidiaries of Shannon Health System. The company later announced the proposed merger of 231-bed Abilene Regional Medical Center to Abilene-based Hendrick Health System.
Changes to Texas state law in 2019 opened a pathway for the merger of the hospitals by trading federal oversight for state oversight, a move supported by the CEOs of Shannon and Hendrick during testimony they gave to the state’s Public Health Committee on April 3, 2019.
The San Francisco-based firm wanted to access the public market faster and with more certainty, worried the US presidential election and the second wave of coronavirus could cast a shadow on its growth, according to a person familiar with the discussions. In a SPAC deal, the funds raised by the company are committed upfront.

239,"September 16, 2020",FTC Prepares Possible Antitrust Lawsuit Against Facebook,"


US competition enforcers are preparing a possible antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. 
The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Facebook for more than a year over whether the social media giant has harmed competition and could file a case by the end of the year, said the person, who was granted anonymity because the inquiry is confidential. No final decision has been made, the person added.
A lawsuit by the FTC would mark another major escalation by U.S. officials in their campaign against America’s technology giants, which have come under intense scrutiny in Washington over their dominant market positions. The Justice Department is preparing to sue Alphabet Inc.’s Google in a matter of weeks.
Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the agency’s lawsuit preparation. It is standard practice for antitrust enforcers to prepare for litigation as part of an investigation, and filing a lawsuit would require a majority vote of the FTC’s five commissioners.
Technology giants are grappling with sprawling inquiries by federal agencies, Congress and state attorneys general. The U.S. House antitrust panel is preparing recommendations for reining in the power of tech companies like Facebook after a yearlong investigation of the industry. On Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary panel laid out a case for how Google has used its dominance in search and digital advertising to benefit its products and harm competition.

241,"September 15, 2020",New York Considers Stronger Antitrust Laws,"


A bill to strengthen antitrust laws first drawn up a century ago to break up steel, oil and railroad monopolies would be used to confront today’s high-tech corporations that the proposal’s sponsor says wield a new threat of “abuse of dominance.” 
According to News Day, industry leaders warned in a legislative hearing Monday that the bill threatens free enterprise itself by exposing successful businesses and startups to lawsuits by competitors and criminal action by politically motivated attorneys general.
The bill sponsored by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris would apply antitrust laws to companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google that can’t legally be defined as monopolies, yet have commanding shares of a market. Monday’s sometimes heated debate between progressive lawmakers and trade groups included discussion of dominant hospital groups, pharmaceutical development and sales companies, and corporate farms.
The bill would provide stiffer civil and criminal penalties — some of which haven’t been increased for 45 years — for abuses of consumers through prices and quality of goods and services or abuse of workers in wages or conditions. The bill would empower the state attorney general’s office with a new tool for criminal and civil enforcement. The bill also would provide smaller, competing firms with more legal standing to sue the leaders of their field based on claims of abuse by market dominance.
“It’s about time we updated our laws here in terms of companies taking advantage of consumers,” said Sen. Kevin Thomas (D-Levittown), chairman of the Consumer Protection Committee, which led Monday’s legislative hearing on the proposed bill.
The bill was endorsed by state Attorney General Letitia James, who enforces antitrust laws and consumer protections.

243,"September 9, 2020",Restrictions on Privacy and Exploitation in the Digital Economy: A Market Failure Perspective,"


By Nicholas Economides (New York University) & Ioannis Lianos (University College London)
We discuss how the acquisition of private information by default without compensation by digital platforms such as Google and Facebook creates a market failure and can be grounds for antitrust enforcement. To avoid the market failure, the default in the collection of personal information has to be changed by law to “opt-out.” This would allow the creation of a vibrant market for the sale of users’ personal information to digital platforms. Assuming that all parties are perfectly informed, users are better off in this functioning market and digital platforms are worse off compared to the default opt-in. However, just switching to a default opt-in will not restore competition to the but for world because of the immense market power and bargaining power towards an individual user that digital platforms have acquired. Digital platforms can use this power to reduce the compensation that a user would receive for his/her personal information compared to a competitive world. Additionally, it is likely that the digital platforms are much better informed than the user in this market, and can use this information to disadvantage users in the market for personal information.

244,"September 9, 2020",CPI Talks with James Keyte (Fordham 2020),"
with James Keyte Director, Fordham Competition Law Institute   “We are excited that the virtual conference enables us to offer a chance to interact with various Heads of Authority from around the globe. Usually, they have their own private workshop at Fordham, but with the virtual conference we can do something more creative. Hence, on workshop day, we are planning a break-out session with several HOA who will answer questions and discuss the topics raised: this is unique to the Fordham Conference, where HOA have had their own workshop for over 15 years running.“SEE BELOW TO REGISTER CPI: 
What have been the challenges for FCLI arising from the pandemic?
James Keyte: First, I want to wish everyone at CPI and its readers the best of health and safety – these have been trying and tragic times for many colleagues and family across the globe, including in the antitrust community.As for the Institute, we, of course, were well down the road in planning our live 3-day conference, including workshops, keynote speakers and panels. And, as you know, many participants and firms plan meetings and events around the conference.Given the duration of the pandemic, we realized that we would have to organize the Fordham Conference virtually, but unlike others–for example, the U.S. ABA Spring Meeting–-we had much more time to plan and organize. This primarily meant ensuring that we have the same great keynote speakers (which we do), shortening the programs and ensuring that speakers, sponsors and, most importantly, registrants have a full and interesting virtual experience this coming October 7-9.It also gave us the opportunity to be more creative and reach a broader potential audience. For example, we are incorporating several opportunities for Q and A as well as interactive virtual networking in both plenary sessions and for several of our key sponsors.
CPI: How is the October 7-9 Virtual Program Shaping Up?
James Keyte: Fantastic in all respects. Our keynotes are, virtually, the leading global enforcers in antitrust: Margrethe Vestager (EU), Makan Delrahim (DOJ), Joe Simons (FTC), and Andrea Coscelli (UK). And we have great panels on mergers, tech and our traditional in-house counsel roundtable. Among our speakers are numerous current and former government officials from all over the world, including: Isabelle de Silva (French Authority), Daniel Francis (FTC), Renata Hesse (Sullivan & Cromwell), Bruce Hoffman (CGSH), Andreas Mundt (Germany Authority), Sharis Pozen (Clifford Chance), Howard Shelanski (Davis Polk), Rod Sims (Australian Authority), and Josh Soven (Wilson Sonsini). Our in-house counsel roundtable, chaired by Karen Lent, is equally impressive, with speakers from Google, AMEX, Verizon and Walmart.We are also still featuring the economics workshops on Wednesday, October 7, with the Brattle Group offering two mini-panels on the economics of merger analyses and issues surrounding platform-related competition, while Edgeworth will be doing a panel on the economics of class actions in the pharma space.Also, as part of our plenary networking sessions, I will lead a few “fireside chats”– one with Bill Kovacic (GW) and Barry Hawk (Fordham), the other with Fredric Jenny (OECD) and Terrell McSweeny (Covington, and former FTC Commissioner). These will be informal and forward looking, which should be very interesting in today’s complex and sometimes highly charged antitrust environment.Finally, we are excited that the virtual conference enables us to offer a chance to interact with various Heads of Authority from around the globe. Usually, they have their own private workshop at Fordham, but with the virtual conference we can do something more creative. Hence, on workshop day, we are planning a break-out session with several HOA who will answer questions and discuss the topics raised: this is unique to the Fordham Conference, where HOA have had their own workshop for over 15 years running.
CPI: Will registrants have greater control to participate actively in the virtual conference?
James Keyte: Absolutely. One benefit of a virtual conference, especially one that involves Q & A as well as networking, is that the audience can participate and see their friends and colleagues from around the globe. We will make sure that the Zoom arrangements and networking technology (Remo) is easy to access and follow. The Fordham Conference has always been an international networking event alongside its serious academic and policy focus; the October 7-9 virtual conference allows us to take full advantage of that objective!
CPI: Does FCLI plan to do virtual conferences in the future?
James Keyte: Yes, although we will always have the 3-day live conference at Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus every September or October. And, one silver lining is that this year’s virtual conference allows us to reconnect with those who have attended the live conference in the past and also to introduce the Fordham Conference to many new practitioners, academics and enforcers.As for the future, we are exploring the use of this virtual experience to set the foundation for any number of virtual conferences, training sessions or other educational interactions during the course of the year. The opportunities are limitless as long as we can offer something useful and easy to access. We at FCLI are all excited about that prospect and will be looking for ideas and planning right after the October 7-9 Conference.
CPI: How can people register?
James Keyte: Quite easily, and we provide links below right here.For in-house counsel, junior associates (3 years and below), and law students, they can sign up for free HERE. 
For Government Employees and Academics, they can sign up at a discounted rate HERE. For more senior practitioners and consultants, etc., they can sign up for the entire conference at a much reduced rate HERE. 
And for firms that wish to have access for all of their antitrust practitioners, there is a sustaining sponsorship level that can be accessed HERE.

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet approved draft digital antitrust legislation that will give German authorities more tools to combat market abuse by large tech companies, reported Bloomberg. 
“It’ll help many middle-sized companies, but above all benefit millions of consumers by helping them gauge digital offers better and take decisions without being influenced,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said at a press conference on Wednesday.
The EU is separately working on similar ways to extend oversight for large Internet platforms, including legislation on so-called “gatekeeper” platforms that may control how smaller businesses can reach customers. Antitrust regulators are also debating how to handle Internet sites that may favor their own services over rivals, a frequent complaint from app developers, online retailers and search services about companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google.

Apple on Tuesday, September 8,  filed its response to a lawsuit from Epic Games and made counterclaims of its own, arguing that the Fortnite developer breached its contract with Apple and is violating California laws against unfair competition, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Apple is asking a judge to award punitive damages and restrict Epic from continuing what it describes as unfair business practices. The filing came after Epic sought an injunction on Friday to force Apple to put the popular videogame back in its App Store.
“Epic’s lawsuit is nothing more than a basic disagreement over money,” Apple said in its filing Tuesday. “Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store.”
The dispute began when Epic introduced the payment system on Aug. 13 within the “Fortnite” app that skirted the 30% fee that Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google charge for in-app purchases. Within hours, both companies removed the game from their app marketplaces for violating their rules. Epic later sued Apple and Google in California federal court, accusing both companies of anticompetitive conduct.

247,"September 8, 2020",European Union Regulators Eye Antitrust Rules For eCommerce,"


With the boom of eCommerce both before and during the pandemic, European Union regulators are taking another look at antitrust rules regarding internet sales and distribution platforms.
Online sales in such countries as Spain, an EU member, are expected to grow by 20 percent, according to eMarketer.
The European Commission, the EU’s arm for antitrust regulations, said in a press release that it will examine vertical block exemption regulations (VBER).
“The market has significantly changed, and (our) evaluation has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed,” said the commission’s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition policy. The goal, she added, is “to ensure that the rules remain fit for a world that is increasingly digital and changing at a fast pace.”
The need for an update in these regulations is particularly “due to the growth of online sales and of new market players, such as online platforms,” said the commission. “New types of vertical restrictions, such as restrictions regarding sales through online marketplaces and restrictions on online advertising, as well as retail parity clauses, have become more widespread.”
In addition, the commission wants to look at price comparison websites.
This summer, the EU put out new rules aimed at Google that include regulations on data sharing and the operation of digital marketplaces. The new rules, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), could force Big Tech firms like Google to offer data access to smaller firms and abide by reasonable, standardized and non-discriminatory terms.
In another move targeting Big Tech, the EU is also looking at the issue of limiting “unfair contract terms,” which could target Amazon’s dual status as a marketplace for merchants as well as a competitor.
In addition, Google filed a lawsuit earlier this year after the EU levied a €2.4-billion ($2.6 billion) fine against the company, charging that it used its position in the online world to divert traffic to its own ads rather than the competition.

248,"September 6, 2020",A Topology of Multisided Digital Platforms,"


By Daniel Hanley (Open Markets Institute)
Digital platforms dominate the marketplace. The largest platforms–Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft (collectively known as “GAFAM”)–have an unparalleled financial position in the marketplace, and collectively maintain at least a thirty-three percent market share in fifteen separate markets with user bases in the billions. These corporations are also consistently ranked as the largest companies on Earth by market capitalization. The GAFAM companies transact and function as intermediaries with both buyers and sellers, which designates them as multi-sided businesses–more commonly known as platforms. The conventional business model consists of transacting with only consumers or sellers, known as single-sided firms. Although the veracity and legal significance of this difference between single-sided firms and multi-sided platforms are debatable, this article will accept the current schema that platforms operate under different conditions than their single-sided counterparts. In what follows, because of their market power, user bases, and anti-competitive conduct, this article will use the GAFAM platforms as representative examples of the kind of anti-competitive actions that digital multi-sided platforms can engage in. This article organizes the actions of multi-sided platforms into a framework that categorizes their characteristics and conduct by the goals multi-sided businesses are trying to achieve. This framework consists of three categories: Amassing Characteristics, Entrenching Conduct, and Exploitative Conduct. These categories provide the framework for this article. Part I describes Amassing Characteristics, which are business conditions used by multi-sided platforms to obtain a significant user base. Part II details Entrenching Conduct, which are business practices multi-sided platforms can implement to inhibit users from leaving the platform and maintain their user base. Part III details Exploitative Conduct, which are the efforts and the ability of a multi-sided platform to leverage their existing user base to suppress competition, enhance its market power, and extract value from its entrenched user base. This framework can aid antitrust enforcers and scholars to understand how the characteristics and conduct described in this article interact to facilitate market power, undermine competition, and, particularly when some of these practices are executed by platforms in unison, enable platforms to become resistant to future competition. Such analysis can encourage agencies, governments, and private litigants to use the antitrust laws to curb the market power of multi-sided platforms and provide justification for regulatory changes.

Facebook announced on Thursday, September 3, its users can transfer photos and videos stored on its servers to two new tech platforms, reported Reuters. This is its latest move to address antitrust concerns by giving users an option to easily leave the company’s services. 
The social media company’s new partners are cloud storage firms Dropbox and Koofr – a European Union-based startup. Facebook announced a similar partnership with Alphabet-owned Google Photos in April. 
The feature that allows such transfers is called data portability. It gives users more control over their data and allows the social media company to respond to US regulators and lawmakers who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition.
Facebook’s move comes ahead of a hearing set up by the Federal Trade Commission on September 22 to examine the potential benefits and challenges of data portability. Control of data that hurts competition has become a critical topic in the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe.

A National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) warning came via a letter to the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, reported the Hollywood Reporter. 
A handful of tech giants who are making billions in ad revenue are poised to kill local television and radio journalism, according to a statement submitted to a congressional antitrust subcommittee Wednesday, September 2, by the NAB.
NAB President and CEO Gordon H. Smith wrote a dire warning to the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on behalf of the 7,500 local television and radio stations that belong to the organization, writing, “Local journalism is now at risk due to the overwhelming competitive position of a handful of technology companies in today’s digital marketplace.” 
He stated, if left unchecked, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple will continue to syphon ad revenues and strain local broadcasters’ online connections with members of the public during a time when free access to information is vital.

251,"September 2, 2020",Australian Regulator Calls Facebook’s Threat To Block News Sharing “Ill-Timed”,"


Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), said on Tuesday, September 2, that the US tech giant Facebook’s threat to block news sharing on its platforms in Australia was “ill-timed.”
On Monday, September 1, Facebook announced that it would stop Australian users from sharing news on its platform if a draft code proposed by the ACCC becomes law that would require it to pay local media companies for their content. If the law comes into force, tech giants like Facebook and Google would have three months to negotiate with Australian media outlets.
“Facebook’s threat today to prevent any sharing of news on its services in Australia is ill-timed and misconceived. The draft media bargaining code aims to ensure Australian news businesses, including independent, community and regional media, can get a seat at the table for fair negotiations with Facebook and Google,” Sims said in a statement.
The ACCC chair added that Facebook was already paying some media organizations for their content.

By The Editorial Board, Financial Times
How should regulators tackle the concentration of power by Big Tech? It has become one of the most pressing issues in the wake of the pandemic as the dominance of America’s large technology groups has soared.
Australia’s government thinks it has part of the answer. Under a draft code of conduct proposed by Canberra, the digital platforms Google and Facebook will be forced to pay for content created by traditional media companies, or face the prospect of hefty fines. The proposal is a response to the deepening crisis in the country’s domestic newspaper industry, which has been forced to slash costs and, in some cases, close titles, in recent weeks.

253,"September 2, 2020",Germany Keeps Eye On Apple-Epic Row,"


Germany’s antitrust watchdog is following closely a legal row over Apple’s App Store payment terms, saying on Wednesday it could in principle open a national inquiry, reported Reuters. 
Apple dropped Epic Gamesafter a dispute in which the ‘Fortnite’ creator alleged that the iPhone maker’s in-app payment terms constitute a monopoly. 
“This has most certainly attracted our interest,” said Andreas Mundt, head of the Federal Cartel Office. “We are at the beginning, but we are looking at this very closely.” 
Apple ditched Epic after it implemented a feature to let iPhone users make in-app purchases directly, rather than with Apple’s system, which charges a 30% fee. 
Mundt told an online briefing that Apple’s App Store and the Play Store that serves smartphones running on Google’s Android operating system represented an “interesting habitat because they are the only two worldwide”.
Although the Bonn-based authority does have the power to impose fines, it typically undertakes administrative probes into big technology firms to establish whether they are abusing their market dominance and then seeks a change in the way they work.

Facebook users in Australia may soon be blocked from sharing news.
The social media giant is threatening to make it impossible for users in Australia to share local and international news content on both Facebook and Instagram if the government passes regulations to alter the financial arrangement between publishers and online platforms, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The new rules, strongly backed by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp Australia, would force Facebook and Google to give news outlets a bigger cut of digital advertising revenue. It is the most aggressive effort yet by any country to curb Silicon Valley’s power over the news business.
As Facebook sees it, the new regulations are untenable. They would force the social network to enter into revenue-sharing agreements with publishers in which the final terms would be decided by independent arbitrators — and Facebook would have no recourse to back out of the deals.
“We tried to make this work,” Campbell Brown, Facebook’s head of global news partnerships, said in an interview. “We proposed our version of something workable. … Unfortunately, there are so many things in this proposed legislation that just make it untenable.”
In a post Monday night, Facebook said Australia had left Facebook with two choices: “removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits.”
“Unfortunately, no business can operate that way,” it said.
“Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,” the post said.

257,"August 28, 2020",Big Day for Big Tech: CEOs Testify in House Antitrust Hearing,"
By: Ann O’Brien & Joshua Jowdy (Antitrust Advocate)
On Wednesday, July 29, 2020, the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust conducted its sixth hearing into online platforms and market power, welcoming as witnesses the chief executive officers of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. The hearing lasted more than five hours and was styled as “Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.” Due to COVID-19, the CEOs testified virtually, adding an ironic digital twist with the tech titans appearing together in video tiles on a screen with no big-tobacco moment standing side-by-side to take their oath.
The Subcommittee’s hearing culminated its year-long investigation into Big Tech, and the questioning was informed by requests for information posed to each tech company last September, which generated millions of pages of documents and hundreds of hours of interviews. Subcommittee Chair Cicilline opened the hearing by describing each of the tech companies as a “bottleneck for a key channel of distribution,” whether that be a channel of retail distribution, distribution of software applications, or distribution of information. Chair Cicilline began and ended the hearing by expressing concerns about the dominance of each firm and abuse of their purported monopoly power…

258,"August 28, 2020",The Epic Flaws of Epic’s Antitrust Gambit,"
By: Dirk Auer (Truth on the Market)
Much has already been said about the twin antitrust suits filed by Epic Games against Apple and Google. For those who are not familiar with the cases, the game developer – most famous for its hit title Fortnite and the “Unreal Engine” that underpins much of the game (and movie) industry – is complaining that Apple and Google are thwarting competition from rival app stores and in-app payment processors. 
Supporters have been quick to see in these suits a long-overdue challenge against the 30% commissions that Apple and Google charge. Some have even portrayed Epic as a modern-day Robin Hood, leading the fight against Big Tech to the benefit of small app developers and consumers alike. Epic itself has been keen to stoke this image, comparing its litigation to a fight for basic freedoms in the face of Big Brother:
However, upon closer inspection, cracks rapidly appear in this rosy picture. What is left is a company partaking in blatant rent-seeking that threatens to harm the sprawling ecosystems that have emerged around both Apple and Google’s app stores.
Two issues are particularly salient. First, Epic is trying to protect its own interests at the expense of the broader industry. If successful, its suit would merely lead to alternative revenue schemes that – although more beneficial to itself – would leave smaller developers to shoulder higher fees. Second, the fees that Epic portrays as extortionate were in fact key to the emergence of mobile gaming…

By MoginRubin, Competition Law News
They appeared at the hearing, appropriately enough, digitally. This allowed the witnesses, captains of the tech industry, to be in two places at once on July 27, 2020, when they testified before the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law. When it came to their conduct in their respective markets, the CEOs and the members of the Subcommittee also were in separate places.
Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.; Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google parent Alphabet, Inc.; Tim Cook, CEO, Apple, Inc.; and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Inc. testified live via web video before the Subcommittee chaired by David N. Cicilline of Rhode Island. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on the Judiciary, chaired by Jerrold Nadler of New York. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey declined an invitation from Subcommittee Republicans, much to their irritation. As President Trump’s favorite bullhorn, Twitter has drawn the attention of the commander in chief and his allies for flagging some of his tweets as violations of Twitter’s “abusive behavior” policy.
To hear the CEOs tell it, their companies are building a better world. And in many ways they certainly are. This article was drafted on an Apple computer using Microsoft Word with some research performed via Google. It will be noticed on Twitter, and it may even make its way to a Facebook page near you. The CEOs say their platforms give individuals and businesses access to tools and information they would never have had before, and much of it for free, they said. They are socially and environmentally responsible. They are creating jobs. They connect people with each other, with valuable products and services, and with information in volumes never imagined. They are doing all of this in the face of stiff competition from larger players in specific segments as well as smaller innovators and disruptors snapping at their heels.
To hear the Democratic members, the companies are ruthless, mercenary bullies who have little regard for fair competition or the privacy of individuals or companies. They use their dominance to act both as service providers and competitors against the retailers use their platforms. Their positions give them access to competitive information which makes them better able to compete with their own clients. Should any company start to give them a run for their money, these giants devour them. And, to hear some of the Republican members, the companies are biased against conservative points of view.

Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the House antitrust panel, is expected to deliver recommendations by next month in the investigation he’s leading into how Big Tech titans could be reined in when it comes to antitrust cases, Bloomberg reported.
Cicilline, in an interview on Wednesday (Aug. 26), said Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have been abusing their power on the market to beat out smaller competitors. As such, he said he thinks the impetus falls to Congress to do something about it.
“The kind of common theme is the abuse of their market power to maintain their market dominance, to crush competitors, to exclude folks from their platform and to earn monopoly rents,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
His next step will be finding a way to compromise with Republicans on exactly how to do this. He said he would be pursuing “the biggest, boldest ideas” he can muster. One such idea is what he described as a Glass-Steagallfor tech giants, referencing the Depression-era law which separated commercial and investment banking. It was repealed during the President Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s.
For tech giants, the law would likely involve some type of prohibition from running a platform and competing on it at the same time, Bloomberg reported. Cicilline didn’t specifically recommend that course of action but said it was worth consideration.
Cicilline said it is the intention of the House antitrust panel to issue a report as soon as September that will address four general areas: changes to existing antitrust laws passed over 100 years ago; reforms aimed at the tech sector specifically; strengthening private antitrust legislation; and making sure antitrust watchdogs have the resources to do their jobs as well as possible.
Antitrust complaints have been widely publicized as of late, with the Department of Justice moving forward on its probe into the same complaints as Cicilline had about the tech giants. Attorney General Jeff Rosen said the investigation is “going full-tilt” and called it “a major priority.”

261,"August 25, 2020",An Anticlimactic Ending in the “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook”: An Antitrust Enforcement Action Against Facebook’s Long-Consummated Acquisitions Would be Unwise,"

By Chris Renner (Davis Wright Tremaine)1
 
The “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook” (the “Roadmap”) purports to explain how publicly available materials, sourced primarily from an investigation conducted by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), “might support a finding of liability in a monopolization case [against Facebook] here in the US.”2 Although the Roadmap alleges a range of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook, one of its main allegations is that Facebook’s acquisitions of what the authors describe as nascent or potential rivals — including Instagram and WhatsApp — had a causal connection to the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power by Facebook. Similar charges were levied during a recent House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing.
Although these allegations could theoretically raise Section 2 concerns, there are a number of common-sense reasons to think that such a claim would be speculative and difficult to prove, especially as the main predicates for this theory — the acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 — are well in the past. Given the consumer benefits from those transactions, and the procompetitive rationale for acquisitions of complementary products generally, a challenge to Facebook’s long-consummated acquisitions would be unwise.
First, a plaintiff would struggle to make out a prima facie case on the basis of the conduct alleged in the Roadmap. A Section 2 plaintiff must show that the challenged conduct had some causal connection to the acquisition or maintenance of market power, that is, that the conduct resulted in a less-competitive future, with likely effects on price, output, or quality. Both Instagram and WhatsApp have grown since their acquisition by Facebook, which has itself seen strong growth over the relevant timeframes, and consumer surplus has been created in the process.3 There is no reason to think that Instagram and WhatsApp would have been more successful but-for their acquisition, and reconstructing after many years what these two firms would have achieved but-for their acquisition by Facebook would be nearly impossible.4 In fact, the CMA Final Report finds evidence “suggestive of Facebook’s wider resources having contributed to Instagram’s success.”5 Similarly, a retrospective study commissioned by the CMA found “reasons to believe that Instagram’s growth has significantly benefitted from the integration with Facebook: Snapchat’s case shows that transforming users’ attention into advertising revenue is no easy task, and Instagram’s success in this respect has likely benefitted from Facebook’s guidance and expertise.”6 Conversely, it is by no means clear that Instagram and WhatsApp would have even survived, let alone thrived, absent their acquisition by Facebook.7 And absent any reason to believe that Instagram and WhatsApp would have grown into even stronger platforms but-for the acquisitions, there is no reason to think that the real world is any worse off as a result of the acquisitions. This, on its own, would likely end a challenge to these acquisitions.
The pre-merger review that each of these transactions received illustrates the forensic and evidentiary differences that a retrospective challenge to these long-consummated transactions would face. The Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of the Instagram transaction in 2012, which included a second request, by taking no action.8 The UK Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”), which also closed its review of the Instagram transaction without taking action, issued a closing statement in 2012 that explained that “In the social networking space, the OFT has no reason to believe that Instagram would be uniquely placed to compete against Facebook, either as a potential social network or as a provider of advertising space.”9 Nor does the benefit of hindsight change the view. For example, in 2019, a retrospective study commissioned by the CMA found no clear way to determine whether Instagram would have struggled as a standalone competitor or, alternatively, developed into a close and capable competitor to Facebook, and that there were efficiencies from the transaction in either scenario.10
Similarly, the European Commission approved the WhatsApp transaction in 2014 without condition, finding that Facebook and WhatsApp were “if anything, distant competitors” in a social networking services market.11 The FTC similarly reviewed and did not challenge the WhatsApp acquisition. Moreover, given that there is no monetization strategy for WhatsApp, the acquisition’s causal connection to any form of consumer injury is especially attenuated.
Second, even if a prima facie case could be established, there are many procompetitive justifications for the acquisitions. In general, acquisitions of start-up companies can allow acquirers to effectively outsource early stage R&D, acquiring new technology only after competition between start-ups has revealed the best technology. Acquirers can also obtain access to top talent in acquisitions of promising start-ups. For start-ups, acquisitions can be an attractive exit strategy in lieu of a risky IPO, and the option to monetize investments in entrepreneurial activity and early-stage R&D may provide high-powered incentives to innovate. In digital markets with differentiated products and innovation-based competition, mergers can enhance incentives to invest in R&D as the merged entities share technological knowledge.12 In fact, the 2019 retrospective commissioned by the CMA found evidence-based and merger-specific efficiencies from Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in the form of more effective targeted advertisements, which can benefit both users of social networks and advertisers.13 The Roadmap authors acknowledge that more effective targeted advertisements benefit consumers.14
The purely speculative theory of harm in any challenge to Facebook’s long-consummated acquisitions, the demonstrable and substantial consumer surplus that accompanied those acquisitions in the real world, and the procompetitive justifications for these and similar transactions, together strongly suggest that an antitrust challenge to these acquisitions risks tampering with an engine of innovation that has developed market-leading companies in the United States. In particular, it would be perverse to focus enforcement efforts on the transactions that were successful in delivering benefits to consumers, chilling the incentive of acquirers to invest in output-enhancing post-merger integration lest they find themselves defending an antitrust action based on those very investments.
Proponents of an antitrust challenge to these acquisitions after all these years make a number of arguments to avoid this simple logic. Here are some of those points, drawn from the Roadmap and other contemporary materials, and presented in a conversational format.
Q. Regardless of the post-acquisition success of Instagram and WhatsApp as part of Facebook, can’t we assume that consumers would have benefitted from these firms staying independent and competing with Facebook, regardless of whether these firms thrived or failed?15
A. Not unless we are willing to assume that these firms would have developed from complements into uniquely close substitutes for Facebook’s social network. Note that if we make this assumption we should also be willing for the sake of intellectual consistency to regard highly differentiated competitors of Facebook today such as Pinterest or Snapchat as potentially strong competitors of Facebook tomorrow, calling into question the degree or durability of market power that Facebook enjoyed at the time of those transactions and today. Perhaps more importantly, and even if we make these assumptions, this argument simply assumes away of all of the demonstrated, measurable consumer welfare benefits that accompanied Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, benefits that are manifest from their impressive post-acquisition growth and could well have outweighed any short-run innovation and quality competition.16 The plaintiff in this scenario would be required to prove that two birds in the bush are worth more than one in the hand. Absent a presumption that the acquisition of a nascent competitor by a firm with market power harms competition regardless of the demonstrated track record of post-acquisition success realized by the acquired firm, a presumption that appears unwarranted, a plaintiff would struggle to establish a prima facie case of harm on these facts.
Q. But what about that plaintiff-friendly causation standard in United States v. Microsoft? Wouldn’t that standard relieve, in whole or in part, the plaintiff’s burden to show that the world would be better off if the acquisitions of Instagram and Facebook had not occurred?
A. Not at all. Microsoft stands for the proposition that causation can be inferred from exclusionary conduct when that conduct likely caused anticompetitive effects, “reasonably appear[s] capable of making a significant contribution to . . . maintaining monopoly power” and has no legitimate business justification.17 Microsoft would not authorize a presumption of causation in a challenge to acquisitions of (at most) nascent competitors that had merger-specific efficiencies.18
Q. Should we be concerned that Facebook’s acquisitions eliminated competition with Instagram and WhatsApp?
A. All horizontal mergers eliminate a rival, and some vertical mergers have the potential to do the same, and yet the vast majority of transactions raise no significant antitrust concerns. Whether analyzed under Section 7’s standard of a substantial reduction in competition or as monopolization under Section 2, the antitrust question turns on the closeness of competition between the parties before the merger, the competitive constraints that remain post-merger and on merger-specific efficiencies. Given the range of competitors Facebook faced at the time of the transactions and today, and the consumer surplus associated with the transactions, challenges to these transactions would likely fail and should probably not be brought in the first place.
In summary, while the acquisition of nascent competitive threats is potentially actionable conduct under Section 2, the case against Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp appears unwarranted in the context of the clear consumer benefits from those acquisitions, not to mention legitimate interests in repose from litigating the merits of transactions examined and cleared by relevant enforcement agencies long ago. Nor is there any obvious reason to believe that the federal antitrust enforcement agencies are less than diligent in addressing acquisitions of nascent competitors when they have reason to believe that those acquisitions are anticompetitive under existing law, as shown by the recent activity of the agencies in this area.19 The acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, however, do not fit that description.

15 See Roadmap, supra note 2, at 21 (“However, the uncertainty about the nascent competitor’s eventual success does not extend to uncertainty about consumer welfare: such competition is beneficial to consumers even if the entrant eventually fails. As noted above, vigorous competition for the market is often the main source of competition in markets with network effects. The entrant’s efforts to overthrow the incumbent produce valuable competition on quality and innovation during this phase, regardless of the identity of the final winner.”).
16 In a related context, involving allegedly exclusionary conduct by a platform seeking to replace a complementary product with its own complement (“Z”), Professor Scott Morton, one of the authors of the Roadmap, appears to agree. See Stigler Report at 68 (“If the platform’s new product Z is a wonderful innovation, there will be an efficiency (in the form of higher quality) to weigh against any harms from less innovation.”).

262,"August 25, 2020",Judge Delivers Temporary Victory To Each Side In Apple Vs. Epic Games,"


Both sides in Apple Inc. versus Epic Games Inc. could declare victory Monday night (Aug. 24) when a federal judge issued a temporary split decision.
U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers for the Northern District of California ruled the global consumer electronics and computer software company can’t block the game maker from accessing Unreal Engine tools, a popular game engine developed by Epic that is used to build 3-D games on Apple platforms.
At the same time, the court denied the North Carolina game maker’s motion to restore its Fortnite game to the App Store.
“Epic Games and Apple are at liberty to litigate against each other, but their dispute should not create havoc to bystanders,” Rogers wrote in a ruling late on Monday, Reuters reported. “Apple has chosen to act severely, and by doing so, has impacted non-parties and a third-party developer ecosystem.”
The judge added even if Epic Games violated App Store’s rules, as Apple has alleged, it did not breach any contracts related to Unreal Engine.
The David vs. Goliath battle commenced earlier this month when Epic filed suit, alleging the tech giant’s practices are anti-competitive. Epic unveiled a payment platform that was crafted to bypass the App Store’s payment system and its commission, which is as high as 30 percent. The idea was to win Apple’s approval for Epic to bypass in-app purchases and allow Fortnite game players to pay it directly.

263,"August 24, 2020",Zuckerberg Warned Of Facebook Rival TikTok In Speech Last Fall,"


Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played a role in stoking fears about video-sharing app TikTok, a report from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claims.
Zuckerberg, in a speech to Georgetown students in Washington, DC, about freedom of expression, also included one line in which he claimed TikTok doesn’t share America’s value of free expression.
The company, he claimed, represents a threat to American values and technological supremacy.
The message was also one he reportedly drove home repeatedly behind the scenes on that trip, and another one weeks prior, sources told WSJ. That included making the case to President Trump at a private dinner at the White House that Chinese media apps like TikTok represent a threat to American business. He said they should be a bigger concern than trying to rein in Facebook, the WSJ wrote.
He also discussed the matter with numerous senators, which led to a national security review of the company. And by the beginning of this year, Trump had begun his public crusade against the video-sharing app. It recently came out that some of TikTok’s advertising practices were considered too invasive by Google, although TikTok ceased to do those by last November.
A spokesperson for Zuckerberg said he had no recollection of mentioning TikTok at the White House dinner. And in a staff meeting this month, he reportedly said the executive order from Trump to ban TikTok was “unwelcome” due to the overall global effect it could have.
Zuckerberg’s comments come as Facebook has spent this year rolling out an advocacy group, American Edge, that pushes US tech innovation. The tech giant also spent more money lobbying this year than anyone else, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
Facebook stands to gain competitively from TikTok’s misfortunes. Once, the company might have bought TikTok out, but recent antitrust concerns have made that less of a savvy move now. Instead, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has begun offering monetary payments to content creators who exclusively post to its new video app Reels, in an attempt to poach from TikTok’s pool.
Apple has recently gotten scared that the fuss over TikTok could end in a retaliation from China against its App Store, which recent regulation tightenings by the Chinese government have not soothed.

264,"August 24, 2020",CPI Talks… with Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser,"


In this month’s edition of CPI Talks… we have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Phil Weiser, Attorney General for the State of Colorado, Hatfield Professor of Law and Telecommunications, former Executive Director and Founder of the Silicon Flatirons Center for Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship, and Dean Emeritus at the University of Colorado Law School.

Thank you, Mr. Weiser, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.

Colorado, along with 46 other States and territories has initiated an investigation of Facebook for potential antitrust violations, and has joined 50 States and territories in an investigation into Google. In parallel, the FTC has launched its own investigations into Facebook’s and Amazon’s practices, while the DOJ is stepping up its investigation into Google. As you recently noted in the merger context, “[t]he states are independent enforcers of the antitrust laws. It’s up [to] the courts, not a federal agency to decide the lawfulness of a merger.” Is there need for better coordination between individual States and the agencies in this regard?

A strength of the American model of governance is our Federalism. Under this model, States have independent authority and the responsibility to enforce the antitrust laws. This dynamic is also the situation in the international arena, where there is a need for coordination and harmonization. With respect to state-federal coordination, the general rule is that we work very well together, sharing information, documents, and analyses, enabling us to reach better results. Where we end up pursuing different paths, as happened last year in Colorado in a merger between United Health and DaVita Medical Group, that coordination can still hold. The real exception is where the federal government takes umbrage at the possibility that states would go in a different direction and makes the claim that it has the ability to occupy the field, excluding states from exercising their independent authority. In the Sprint/T-Mobile case, where the federal government made such a claim, it was appropriately rejected by the court, as I explained in the address you referenced.

More generally, is litigation the correct means to resolve potentially anticompetitive conduct in high tech sectors, such as social media? Or is a multi-pronged regulatory and litigation-based approach necessary, given that the margin of maneuver of the agencies (and the lower courts) is limited by the relatively restrictive federal case law with respect to certain key antitrust doctrines? Given the high velocity of tech markets, and the relatively slow pace of litigation, is there a risk that industry developments will outpace any evolution in the case law?

There are a couple of questions in this one, so let me take them in turn. First, with respect to the development of antitrust doctrines, I believe that they are supple and, in the face of compelling facts and well-reasoned economic theories of harm, thoughtful judges can adapt to meet new challenges. The Microsoft case stands as a powerful case in point. Second, on the point about antitrust remedies, there is indeed a challenge with respect to dynamic industries. This concern was captured well by Judge Posner after his stint as a special master in the Microsoft case: “The real problem [facing antitrust law] lies on the institutional side: the enforcement agencies and the courts do not have adequate technical resources, and do not move fast enough, to cope effectively with a very complex business sector that changes very rapidly.” There are, however, powerful responses to this concern and for addressing a pattern of conduct that achieves lasting anti-competitive harm. I have discussed strategies for developing remedies both in my scholarly work (see here and here) and as an antitrust enforcer (see here and here).

On a related note, certain players (notably Facebook) have called for government “regulation” of certain aspects of their businesses (notably the dissemination of harmful content). In theory, a similar initiative could apply to competition principles. In parallel, international reports into the digital sector, notably the UK’s 2019 Furman Report, have called for industry codes of conduct to forestall potential antitrust violations. Is there a risk in adopting industry-sponsored initiatives (either in the form of government regulation or “codes of conduct”)? Do such initiatives risk creating a mere smokescreen, or, worse, regulatory capture? How can any “knowledge gap” between industry and the private sector be breached?

This is an important challenge to keep in mind with respect to regulation generally, whether overseen by an administrative agency or through audited self-regulation (or co-regulation, as it called in Europe). I do believe that codes of conduct can play a constructive role where there are checks on the concern of capture and the development of a regulatory capacity to operate effectively. For a longer discussion of this promise, see this article.

The DOJ is currently reviewing its Vertical Merger Guidelines. There appears to be growing recognition among regulators that vertical mergers are not always as benign as had previously been presumed (notably in light of the recent experience of the Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger remedies, and the DOJ’s attempt to block AT&T/Time Warner). In your view, what are the key reforms that ought to be implemented, both in terms of substantive review of vertical mergers and potential remedies? Should agencies and courts adopt a more imaginative approach to the design of behavioral remedies for vertical mergers (despite the DOJ’s stated preference for structural remedies wherever possible)?

This past February, Colorado led a coalition of states that filed comments with the federal agencies on how to approach vertical mergers. (I discussed those comments here.) With respect to key lessons, a starting point is to recognize that, in a range of scenarios, vertical mergers can be anticompetitive and therefore merit close scrutiny. One such scenario is where a vertical merger may remove the most likely potential rival to an incumbent firm. Another scenario is where a dominant firm seeks to undermine an upstart rival by gaining control of a critical input. This was the circumstance in the United/DaVita merger I mentioned earlier, where we took action to protect competition in the Medicare Advantage market. As for behavioral remedies, we discussed the appropriate role for them in our comments, explaining that “[i]f employed to eliminate harm, conduct remedies must be adequate to address identified risks, subject to practicable monitoring by the Agencies, and capable of being effectively enforced in a timely manner.” In the case of the United/DaVita merger, we identified and implemented this very form of relief, ending an exclusive contracting arrangement that facilitated United’s dominant market position.

In the absence of legislative reform at the Federal level, to what extent should State legislatures fill the legislative gap? The Colorado legislature, in particular, has been active in enacting bipartisan legislation to combat anticompetitive practices. Please outline the major reforms introduced at the State level in Colorado. What further work needs to be done, and what can other States (and Congress) learn from Colorado’s experience?

One of the advantages of states is that they can be, as Justice Brandeis put it, laboratories of democracy. To that end, the Colorado General Assembly charged our office with investigating the rise of insulin prices. Between 2012-2016, notably, such prices doubled. In normal competitive markets, we don’t see such behavior. As such, we are now undertaking a study of what dynamics are taking place in this market, whether there are measures for addressing them, and how we can protect those who depend on insulin. After we publish our report this fall, we look forward to contributing to the national debate on this important issue. The Colorado General Assembly also recently addressed the Attorney General’s authority to challenge mergers, adopting the vision that I described earlier: Colorado has independent sovereign authority to review mergers in parallel with, but independent of, federal agencies and we are committed to using that authority appropriately

265,"August 23, 2020",Wall Street Journal & New York Times Join Fortnite Feud With Apple,"


While Apple is in the middle of a feud with Epic Games over Fortnite And App Store terms, it seems like top American news publishers are joining in on the fight, too. Newspapers like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal have asked Apple for their cut of in-app purchases to be reduced to 15%.
Currently, Apple charges a 30% commission on the first year of an in-app subscription. It then reduces its cut to 15% if the customer continues their subscription beyond that time, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
In a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Thursday, August 20, a trade body representing the New York Times, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and other publishers wrote the outlets want to know what it would take for them to get better deal terms.
“The terms of Apple’s unique marketplace greatly impact the ability to continue to invest in high-quality, trusted news and entertainment particularly in competition with other larger firms,” stated the letter, which is signed by Jason Kint, chief executive of the trade body, Digital Content Next.
The letter is the latest shot in a high-stakes public battle over how much money developers must pay Apple when they sell content through apps distributed on the company’s devices. Epic Games, the maker of popular video game “Fortnite,” sued Apple and Alphabet’s Google last week after the companies removed the game from their app marketplaces, accusing them of monopolistic behavior.

266,"August 23, 2020",UK Plans To Drop “Facebook Tax”: Report,"


British finance minister Rishi Sunak plans to drop a tax on technology companies such as Facebook and Google because it does not raise much money and could hurt a push for a US trade deal, the Mail on Sunday newspaper said. 
Britain introduced the digital services tax in April after slow progress in global negotiations over how to tax tech giants, many of which are US companies. 
The tax is expected to raise about 500 million pounds ($654 million) a year for Britain’s public finances. 
That represents only a fraction of the 200 billion pounds in extra debt the country has racked up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The tax is also a potential impediment to a post-Brexit bilateral trade deal between Britain and the United States.

267,"August 19, 2020",Is Blockchain the Real Antitrust Game Changer?,"

By Giovanna Massarotto (UCL Centre for Blockchain Technology)1
 
I. Introduction 
Governments must anticipate today’s cutting-edge technologies to be effective in fast-moving markets. Blockchain potentially is a great tool to assist antitrust in regulating data-driven markets and fully exploiting its core principles — competition and consumer welfare. Blockchain offers antitrust a remarkable opportunity. However, blockchain is not immune from the economic principle of trust2 and antitrust scrutiny. Total laissez-faire markets and uncontrolled centralization can all promote a lack of trust rather than an abundance of trust.3
 
II. Distributed Ledger Technologies
Blockchain is part of the so-called Distributed Ledger Technologies (“DLT”), which include cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Although blockchain emerged in 2008 with the introduction of bitcoin, today blockchain has been successfully implemented in a variety of industries and situations from supply chain to consumer goods. For example, Walmart implemented blockchain in its supply chain to track goods, which enabled Walmart to do what usually was performed in seven days in 2.2 seconds.4 Similarly, Nestle, with IBM Food Trust, is adopting blockchain to track the origin of food and reduce costs, in addition to gains in efficiency.5
Today, blockchain can be used to record and store “virtually everything of value.”6 The logic behind blockchain is similar to that of a buyer group. Blockchain enables people to bypass intermediaries by creating a network made up by the same blockchain users, which is governed by a computer protocol. Specifically, participants in the network agree on a set of rules enshrined into a computer protocol. Similar to a game, if everyone follows the rules, everyone wins and the network properly functions.7
In short, blockchain participants act together to get goods and services that are usually provided through intermediaries by benefiting from network effects that one could not experience as a single individual to pursue a shared social and economic goal.8 Each blockchain participant sees and verifies everything stored in this decentralized ledger/database by increasing transparency. Any transactions, assets or data is recorded in a decentralized database made up by a vast number of computers on the Internet, rather than a centralized database. This implies that blockchain is potentially safer than centralized database because hacking a blockchain implies striking simultaneously all computers that are part of the blockchain ledger/database;9the costs would be prohibitive.
Furthermore, computer programs that run on a blockchain called “smart contracts” can enable blockchain’s users to perform more sophisticated tasks than simply recording and storing data in a blockchain. Smart contracts, for example, can manage the ownership of any assets saved in a blockchain. Smart contracts are contracts built into a code and enforced by a program10 that can potentially automatize any order if the specified conditions are met.
Therefore, DLT have the potential to make any services and goods cheaper and more efficient.
 
III. Centralized vs. Decentralized Platforms
One of today’s main antitrust concerns is related to the Internet centralization and the monopoly power of the so-called Big Tech. Blockchain is decentralized by design and has the potential to decentralize today’s centralized platforms controlled by Big-Tech.11 Blockchain can also enable each Internet user to both own and control potentially all its personal data stored in a blockchain, better protecting privacy than existing regulation12 through the adoption of a public key cryptography.
A public key cryptography consists of a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. While the public key is openly shared in the blockchain network, only the owner of the private key can decrypt data encrypted with the public key.  Thus, blockchain increases both transparency and privacy.
In other words, anyone can adopt blockchain technologies potentially in any businesses and situations to record and store any assets more efficiently than present centralized platforms and databases. The same government agencies can employ blockchain and DLT in general to do their regular work more efficiently. Antitrust agencies can adopt DLT to effectively tackle today’s digital and data-driven markets.13
Everything is tracked in a blockchain; antitrust agencies can exploit blockchain to control and verify a company’s behavior and practices in specific markets that raise antitrust concerns.14 One of the primary antitrust challenges concerns the costs of monitoring companies’ compliance with antitrust remedies, which can be auto-enforced through smart  contracts that run in an antitrust blockchain.15 The antitrust agency’s smart contract would monitor companies’ activities to detect anticompetitive practices and auto-enforce remedies if the specified conditions are met.
Furthermore, antitrust enforcers might impose the adoption of a blockchain on Big-Tech to supervise constantly their exploitation of data in present data-driven markets in a more effective way than traditional compliance reports.16
However, blockchain is not perfect and should not be immune from the antitrust scrutiny.
 
IV. Is Blockchain Immune from the Antitrust Scrutiny?
Blockchain offers antitrust an enormous opportunity, but as any powerful tool it also has the capacity to harm as well as benefit if abused and left totally uncontrolled.
Although blockchain is decentralized by design, the risk of centralization is effective. Today, a few selected participants de facto control leading blockchain networks and the potential for collusion and forms of monopolization is high.17  Antitrust represents a fundamental gatekeeper of the economic democracy in present and future markets18 based on blockchain technology and DLT in general.
As in the past, antitrust agencies need to ensure a level playing field to compete in markets that exploit innovative platforms and technologies. The largest companies can continue in developing competitive technologies by creating alternative platforms or advancing the existing ones in open markets through the support of antitrust law.
In summary, blockchain could be the real game charger for antitrust enforcers to tackle Big tech and the Internet centralization. However, blockchain needs the antitrust scrutiny to make decentralized democratic platforms effective.
As in any field, also in blockchain technologies antitrust is necessary to ensure people’s trust in blockchain by enabling competitive technologies and innovation to succeed over monopolies’ supremacy.19

268,"August 18, 2020",Data-related Abuse of Dominance in Digital Economy: A Template for Future Regulation in India,"


By Kashish Makkar & Saarthak Jain (National Law School of India University)
It is now trite to say that data has become the new oil of the digital economy. Most corporations, across industries, seek to collect as much data as possible and seek to employ it in as varied applications as they can. Not surprisingly, the growing importance of data has resulted in several new challenges to competition, which necessarily require competition enforcement authorities to be on guard. The present paper is an examination of the legal landscape regulating data-related abusive behavior in digital markets. It maps the recognition of data-related competitive concerns in the European Union where this issue has received considerable attention, with Germany particularly leading the way through its investigation and proceedings against Facebook. Subsequently, the paper examines the position in India by focusing on the Competition Commission of India’s decision in Google v. Matrimony. It finds that the Indian approach to data-related abuses leaves much to be desired, with the CCI failing to effectively engage with such issues. The paper calls for a rationalization of the legal regime, so that increasing focus is laid on data protection and privacy related issues during substantive competition law assessments.

Rackspace sells customers access to its own cloud and also offers a service called RackConnect, which helps customers access clouds maintained by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, VMWare and Google Cloud.
Reuters reported that Amazon is considering buying a minority stake in Rackspace, but there is “no certainty” that a deal would be reached. Rackspace’s majority owner is Apollo Global Management Inc.
Rackspace and Apollo declined to comment, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

270,"August 16, 2020",Facebook Joins Fight Against Apple Over App Store Commission,"


Facebook on Friday, August 14, joined the attack on Apple’s operation of its App Store after the iPhone maker refused to forgo its commission on live online events hosted on the social network that allow people to make money during the pandemic, reported the New York Times. 
The comments from Facebook come in the wake of a blockbuster lawsuit from video game sensation Fortnite maker Epic Games on Thursday, which accused Apple of abusing its monopoly position in its online marketplace.
Facebook stated it would not collect any fees from paid online events that educators, entertainers, or others can host due to a fresh addition to the platform, but that Apple declined to back off from its standard share of transactions which are handled through the App Store.
“We asked Apple to reduce its 30 percent App Store tax or allow us to offer Facebook Pay so we could absorb all costs for businesses struggling during COVID-19,” Facebook vice president Fidji Simo wrote in a blog post.
“Unfortunately, they dismissed both our requests and (small- and medium-size businesses) will only be paid 70 percent of their hard-earned revenue.”
The new paid events feature was launched by Facebook in response to the global coronavirus pandemic which has forced the cancellation of many in-person gatherings.

The US Justice Department is moving “full-tilt” on its antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc’s Google and other Big Tech platforms, the department’s second-ranking official told Reuters.
Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told Reuters in an interview this week at the department’s headquarters that he could not commit to a specific date by which the department would decide whether to bring an antitrust suit against Google.
“We are going full-tilt. It’s a major priority,” Rosen said. “We have a great team working really hard to get on top of the documents, hearing from people in the industry and the like.”
Rosen said the probe is not being driven by political factors. He said the goal is to act “as soon as possible” based on a review of the merits.
“This is one of those issues that people from lots of different points of view are very concerned about,” he added. “I can’t tell you today what the date will be.”
Numerous media outlets have reported the Justice Department is likely to file an antitrust complaint against Google. Attorney General William Barr told The Wall Street Journal in March he wanted the Justice Department to make a final decision on the Google probe this summer.
Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister said “while we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is firmly on providing free services that help people every day, lower costs for small businesses, and enable increased choice and competition.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) and Rep. David Cicilline(Democrat – Rhode Island), two of the most outspoken Democrats on antitrust issues, are set to headline a fundraiser benefiting Joe Biden’s campaign billed as a “Virtual Conversation on the Future of Antitrust,” according to Politico.

A list of upcoming fundraisers sent out on Monday describes the event as “a chance to talk about technology and antitrust with Sen. Klobuchar.”
The event is notable because Klobuchar is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee and Cicilline is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee. Neither of them has made a secret of their views on antitrust. Klobuchar has urged scrutiny of proposed mergers this year involving Google, Uber, and Facebook. And Cicilline summoned Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to testify before his subcommittee last month in a widely watched hearing.

273,"August 11, 2020",The tech antitrust hearings are over: What’s next for enforcement?,"


By Bill Baer, Brookings
As the dust settles on the much-anticipated House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee hearing with the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, it’s time to consider what happens next. Those expecting swift new developments probably should curb their expectations. Wheels will turn—but slowly.
In the next few weeks, we likely will see a report from the Subcommittee on its deep dive into allegations of antitrust misconduct by each of the firms. At the hearing, legislators outlined different concerns about the companies: from the way Amazon treats third-party sellers on its platform and Apple handles its App Store developers to whether Facebook’s acquisitions stifle competition and Google’s search protocols advantage its own products. We can expect the report to detail the evidence for these allegations. That will include a review of company documents provided to the Subcommittee and a discussion of interviews with company officials and third parties about specific behaviors, policies, and acquisitions. We also will see an assessment of the adequacy of each CEO’s response to questions posed at the hearing, including areas where the executives dodged relevant questions or even acknowledged possible wrongdoing.
But the recommendations of the Subcommittee will merit close scrutiny too. Will the report urge specific actions for government enforcers at the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and at the Federal Trade Commission? Will it recommend legislation to change federal antitrust law to facilitate challenging dominant firms that allegedly limit competition in order to lock-in their market power? Will there be bipartisan support for any of the proposed recommendations?

274,"August 11, 2020",Regulating Multisided Platforms? The Case Against Treating Platforms As Utilities,"
The bloom is off the Big Tech rose. It seems nearly the entire political spectrum is angry with Amazon, Google, and Facebook for one reason or another. This has led to a great deal of discussion on whether and how to regulate (or even break up) these platforms, including whether they should be regulated as utilities. Our purpose with this article is simply to caution against some forms of regulatory treatment which emphasize the utility-like nature of large platforms. We choose the word “caution” because we are not necessarily arguing that such regulation is in all instances inappropriate or uncalled for. Instead, all we mean is that there are counterarguments which should be considered, and in this article, we give voice to some of those arguments. The basic economic argument for utility-like regulation of internet platforms is that these platforms can become “natural monopolies” which tend to forestall competition. While there is merit to this argument, internet platforms have also been a source of tremendous innovation which in turn has allowed entrants to unseat what were once thought to be entrenched incumbents. Regulation risks quashing such innovation and harming consumer welfare.

275,"August 10, 2020",UK Tells Facebook To Monitor Giphy Independence,"


Facebook was told by the United Kingdom’s antitrust regulator to take action to ensure the Giphy unit it bought earlier this year can still be run independently, reported Bloomberg. 
Facebook had to pause its integration with Giphy in June after the UK’s Competition and Market Authority (CMA) stated it wanted to investigate whether the deal would give the internet giant too much information on its rivals’ operations, according to a filing on the authority’s website on Monday, August 10.
The CMA is now asking the companies to appoint a “formal hold separate manager” to ensure Giphy can still operate as a standalone business.
The CMA is increasingly putting itself in the middle of all-American deals, after eventually approving Google’s takeover of Looker Data Sciences in February. It also cleared Amazon’s minority investment in Deliveroo last week after a lengthy investigation.
Facebook paid about US$400 million for the library of video clips and animated images known as GIFs that can be attached to messages to express emotion. While half of Giphy’s business involved Facebook and its apps, the company also provided the same search service to competitors such as Apple’s iMessage, Twitter, Signal, and TikTok.
The CMA stated there is “a general lack of independence of the Giphy business from Facebook” due to certain clauses in Facebook employment contracts that Giphy employees were transferred to. It also stated members of Giphy’s senior management team have left the business and Giphy employees have received restricted stock units in Facebook.

A plan by India to regulate what it terms “non-personal” data has roiled the executives of Big Tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google and advocates for freedom and competition in business, Reuters reported.
A panel was appointed by the Indian government last month to regulate data that doesn’t contain personal details and yet is crucial to letting companies do business, according to Reuters. The idea is for the companies to share data so as to spur research, national security and policymaking.
However, this was met with opposition from the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), which said this was “anathema” to promoting competition, and that it could potentially hurt trade and investment in developing countries, Reuters reported. The panel’s proposals also run contrary to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative to get more U.S. companies to invest in India.
A Washington, D.C.-headquartered law firm, Covington and Burling, said India’s proposals are “far-reaching concepts that would have a significant impact on the ability of both Indian and multinational firms to do business in India,” in a note prepared for the USIBC, Reuters reported.

277,"August 9, 2020",NY Bill Would Loosen Restrictions On Suing Big Tech,"


New York State Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris has introduced new legislation to help tamp corporate power and the stifling of competition, according to a press release.
The bill, according to the release, would allow the state to take legal action against large corporations that are using their tech to manipulate the market, including by tweaking search results to favor their own products and demote competitors’, and by undercutting competitors’ prices to drive their business down.
This would be an update from the current antitrust laws, which mandate that at least two parties must deliberately try to manipulate the economy before any action can be taken, the release stated.
The bill comes on the heels of a hearing last week featuring the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google all testifying before Congress regarding antitrust issues. The hearing, according to a PYMNTS report, did not go well for the CEOs, with subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline closing the hearing by concluding that the companies “have monopoly power.”
Gianaris said in the release that there is a great need for updated antitrust laws.
“Our antitrust laws were written a century ago for a radically different economy and they are in desperate need of serious updates,” he said, according to the release. “Corporate power has reached unprecedented and dangerous levels, and we need powerful new laws to protect the public and our economy.”
New York Attorney General Letitia James is quoted in the release as agreeing with Gianaris’s initiative.
“For more than 100 years, our antitrust laws have served as critical protection for consumers and small businesses from unchecked corporate power to choke off competition and limit consumer choice,” she said, according to the release. “While our state’s antitrust laws remain essential to these protections, we support legislation to strengthen them further to meet the challenges of today’s economy.”

278,"August 4, 2020",Big Tech And The Optical Illusion Of Monopoly,"


By Karen Webster, PYMNTS
The most interesting thing about Big Tech’s Fab Four tour of Capitol Hill last Wednesday (July 29) wasn’t the perfunctory lawmaker grandstanding, or even the number of times lawmakers used “dominant” and “crushing the competition” to describe their views on the companies’ behavior.
It was watching the stock prices of each of the companies whose CEOs were on the hot seat that day.
Throughout the six-plus-hour grilling, the stock prices of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google were all up — and stayed that way throughout the day.

New York Attorney General Letitia James is joining in on the investigations into Amazon‘s market power, according to CNet.
James’ office, according to CNet, is partnering with the Federal Trade Commission and California’s attorney general to look into the issue.
This isn’t coming out of nowhere — the New York AG has already been looking into the eCommerce giant for some time, with an April letter chastising the company for the firing of activist Christian Smalls. The letter posited that the company broke the state’s whistleblower laws by firing him, and also may have violated laws on workplace conditions in its warehouses.
The news comes at a time when Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, have faced scrutiny over their business practices. Bezos recently appeared alongside the chief executives of Facebook, Apple and Google at a Congressional hearing over the allegedly unfair business practices of those companies that disadvantaged competitors.
Congress, the FTC, the Department of Justice, the European Union and states attorneys general have all levied charges against Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google as of late.
On July 29, Bezos testified before Congress that Amazon was not dominating the competition as his detractors claimed; in fact, the company was just a small part of a large worldwide conglomerate of competition, according to him.
He said the global retail market was “strikingly large and extraordinarily competitive,” PYMNTS reported, and that Amazon accounted for less than 1 percent of the total $25 trillion global market. In the U.S., he said, that number came out to less than 4 percent of the market.
Bezos said large, established players like Costco, Target and Kroger, along with new digital alternatives like Instacart, posed plenty of competition.
Amazon has been doing well for itself during the pandemic, with a recent earnings report showing the vitality of online shopping and Prime viewership.

280,"August 3, 2020",EU May Follow Congress In Grilling Big Tech CEOs,"


Two European lawmakers told CNBC they are eager to step up discussions with major tech CEOs as the debate over their dominance rumbles on.
The chiefs of Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google (referred to as GAFA) were grilled by the United States Congress on Wednesday, July 29, amid investigations as to whether these firms have abused their market dominance. The overall concern among many American lawmakers is that current antitrust laws — which aim to create fair market competition — are not fit for the digital economy.
This is a concern also shared by many lawmakers in Europe. “The Congressional hearing proved that antitrust tools in Europe and the United States … have their limits,” Luis Garicano, a Spanish economist and member of the European Parliament for the liberal group Renew Europe, told CNBC.
He added that the Parliament, the only directly-elected EU institution, is likely to intensify discussions over the future of competition rules after the summer.
In a letter to US lawmakers ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, Vestager wrote that “many if not most parts of today’s economy are becoming increasingly digitized” and while “these platforms can bring significant benefits,” there is a concern “that the reach and role of some platforms is unprecedented.”
“And that they have a gatekeeper role which means that if they act unchecked, they can also cause significant harm to competition, innovation and ultimately to consumers,” Vestager also wrote.

281,"August 3, 2020",Seven & i Holdings To Buy Marathon’s Speedway Fuel Stations For $21B,"


As it wagers that a bigger presence in the United States will provide growth during the COVID-19 uncertainty, Seven & i Holdings agreed to purchase the Speedway fuel stations of Marathon Petroleum for US$21 billion, Bloomberg reported.
The debt and cash transaction will supplement the 9,800 locations run by the merchant’s 7-Eleven US-based business by approximately 3,900 shops, Bloomberg reported.
Seven & i Holdings CEO Ryuichi Isaka said in a recent conference call, “This is a historic first step as we seek to become a global retailer.” The arrangement is said to be the largest to date for Seven & i and the second-biggest buy of a target in the US in 2020.
Seven & i, which is said to be the biggest convenience store franchise in the world, previously used US$3.3 billion to purchase Sunoco LP fuel locations and convenience stores as it sought to grow its presence in the United States.
In the most recent fiscal year, North America comprised roughly 40% of Seven & i’s sales. And the Speedway store count has increased three times as of 2011 throughout 36 states.
Marathon is among the energy firms that are getting rid of their retail networks to be geared toward producing gas. In 2019, Marathon encountered pressure from investors such as D.E. Shaw & Co. and Elliott Management for significant alterations to bolster its performance.
Elliott, for its part, had sought Marathon to separate itself into retail, pipelines, and refining business lines.
In February, news surfaced that Seven & i Holdings was reportedly in talks to purchase Speedway from Marathon Petroleum for roughly US$22 billion. At the time, it was noted that the deal would be next in a run of arrangements that have seen companies in Japan spend nearly US$100 billion last year to bounce back from slow domestic growth.
Seven & i said in a previous statement that it was examining “various options, including partnerships and acquisitions” for its new plan for growth.

NPR’s Ari Shapiro talks with Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, about the testimony of four Big Tech CEOs.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
For more than a year, Congress has been investigating the giants of tech. The fear is that these companies have gotten too big. This antitrust investigation has gathered 1.3 million documents as evidence. And this week, it all came to a head as the leaders of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google testified before a House committee over video chat, of course. All four of those companies are NPR sponsors. The chair, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, said these companies have too much power.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DAVID CICILLINE: This investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies.
SHAPIRO: Congressman Cicilline has been leading the investigation and joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
CICILLINE: Thank you. It’s great to be with you.
SHAPIRO: So after a year-plus of this investigation, what did you learn from this hearing that you didn’t know before?
CICILLINE: I think what we mostly heard was the things that we have been very focused on in terms of the market dominance of these platforms. And using that market dominance to favor their own products and services, to bully competitors, to weaponize data, to harm consumer privacy and a variety of other anti-competitive behaviors were really acknowledged by these four witnesses. They really didn’t have any defense to many of the business practices that were the subject of the questions.
And so, you know, we will now complete the process of writing a report that will describe this digital marketplace broadly and then make some recommendations in terms of legislation and regulatory action to get competition back into the digital marketplace.

283,"July 30, 2020",A New Antitrust Paradigm In View Of The Digital Economy,"
By: Xavier Puig Soler (Medium)
I’ve had the opportunity to watch a debate held by the Competition Policy International on antitrust and the digital economy where knowledgeable people took part.
It provided me with a clear picture on the most relevant points that are currently under “hot” discussion:
1.- Paradigm change: The need for a quick intervention
There was no substantial disagreement on the need for a quicker intervention in the market by competition authorities. I believe all participants in the discussion are well aware of the possibility that digital markets may “tip” in favor of one specific undertaken and that it is understandable that antitrust bodies should intervene to make sure that such tipping only occurs because of its own merits.
The Catalan Competition Authority just submitted a feedback on the consultation regarding a “new complementary tool to strengthen competition enforcement” issued by the European Commission pointing out that in fact the discipline requires not just a new tool but a paradigm change in the sense that competition authorities should intervene to guarantee the markets well functioning (not to prove a theory of harm to consumers/users).
2.- When and how to intervene
While the need of a quick intervention is assumed, there is quite strong disagreement as to when and how to intervene.
2.1. When to intervene
The basis for the intervention is mainly associated with barriers to entry in terms of data (even though there could be others such as “ avoiding self-preferential behaviors” by gatekeepers).
However, both representatives from Facebook and Google considered that this basis should be revisited since (i) data accumulation is not a good prediction in terms of market success — and so its relevance is dubious — and (ii) data is “only” an ingredient but to have a good meal a good recipe is also key…

284,"July 30, 2020",Eyes Wide Open: There Are No Blinders In Merger Reviews,"
By: Tara Isa Koslov & Heather M. Johnson (FTC)
The FTC’s Bureau of Competition sometimes reviews proposed mergers against the backdrop of civil and criminal antitrust investigations or litigations leveled in the same industry. And at times, such investigations and litigations are leveled against the merger parties themselves. Those ongoing matters may affect our analysis of a merger, as well as the vetting of divestiture packages and proposed divestiture buyers. Even if details of such investigations are not public, Bureau staff are likely to discover their existence during our own investigation of a merger.
To be clear: an ongoing government or private antitrust probe involving the companies or the industry does not necessarily signal that a merger is anticompetitive. Still, such probes may be relevant to the Bureau’s analysis of the merger. Concurrent investigations or litigations regarding party conduct may undermine parties’ arguments about the adequacy of the number of players in the market, the possibility of tacit coordination, or a party’s market position or lack of monopoly power. While the Bureau does not take as proven an allegation that one of the parties has violated the antitrust laws, we cannot ignore such allegations, either.
In particular, companies and individuals facing criminal probes or civil antitrust claims alleging collusion or coordinated behavior are likely to face additional scrutiny during their merger review. Section 7.2 of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines makes it clear that “[t]he Agencies presume that market conditions are conducive to coordinated interaction if firms representing a substantial share in the relevant market appear to have previously engaged in express collusion.” This approach is consistent with caselaw finding unlawful, in the absence of special circumstances, an acquisition that reduces the number of significant sellers in a market already highly concentrated and prone to collusion based on history and circumstances…

285,"July 30, 2020",Apple App Store’s Commission Rates Study Misses the Mark,"
By: Damien Geradin (The Platform Law Blog)
On 22 July 2020, i.e. a few days away from the Congressional hearing (which may however be postponed) where the CEOs of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are expected to testify, the Analysis Group released an Apple-sponsored study entitled “Apple’s App Store and Other Digital Marketplaces: A Comparison of Commission Rates”.
The purpose of this study is to show that “Apple’s App Store commission rate is similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces.” With that objective in mind, the study looks at the rates charged by various marketplaces (app stores, video game digital marketplaces, marketplaces distributing digital content, e-commerce marketplaces). The study also refers to the distribution fees collected by various categories of brick-and-mortar shops.
Surprisingly, while the authors hold PhDs in economics, they do not carry out much economic analysis: the study is limited to observing the commissions charged by various marketplaces without providing any insight as to why these rates are what they are. Its simplistic conclusion is that, because other marketplaces charge commissions in line with those of the App Store (although we will see that this is not necessarily true), Apple is a good corporate citizen in taking a 30% commission on the in-app purchase revenue of apps that offer “digital goods or services” to iOS users. In other words, there is nothing to investigate here. Competition authorities and regulators should look elsewhere.

The EU and the US should formulate “common visions” on how best to regulate competition in the platform economy, the European Commission’s digital chief Margrethe Vestager said.
A statement from Vestager obtained by EURACTIV, which was submitted to the US subcommittee on antitrust ahead of a hearing with Big Tech giants on Wednesday (29 July), highlights how the European Commission would welcome greater alignment between the US and the EU in platform competition policy.
“If we can formulate appropriate policy responses around the world on the basis of shared experiences and knowledge and if possible, common visions, I consider that that can only be beneficial, both for citizens and businesses,” Vestager wrote, adding however that “every jurisdiction has its own specific market context, as well as its own legal and policy framework and traditions.”
On Wednesday, members of the US congress called into question the profit-making motives of global tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, as CEOs of the ‘Big Four’ firms fielded a swathe of questions on anti-competitive practices, content moderation, and the mass-harvesting of user data.
Vestager’s submission to the US subcommittee on antitrust draws attention to current concerns that the Commission has in terms of platform competition policy, including the dual role that platforms play in their markets.
This includes how “a company operates a platform upstream, and at the same time competes with others who operate on the platform downstream,” and how “the concentration of big data in the hands of a few digital platforms may act as a strong barrier to entry for newcomers.”

287,"July 30, 2020",Australian News Outlets To Negotiate Payment With Major Digital Platforms,"


Australian media will be able to bargain with Google and Facebook to quickly secure fair payment for news content if a draft mandatory code released by the ACCC is adopted.
The draft code is aimed at addressing acute bargaining power imbalances between Australian news businesses and Google and Facebook, including through a binding “final offer” arbitration process.
If the news businesses and the digital platforms cannot strike a deal through a formal three month negotiation and mediation process, then an independent arbitrator would choose which of the two parties’ final offer is the most reasonable within 45 business days.
This would ensure disagreements about payment for content are resolved quickly. Deals on payment could be reached within six months of the code coming into effect if arbitration is required.
The draft code would also allow groups of media businesses to collectively negotiate with the platforms. This could include, for example, regional and community mastheads.
“There is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms, partly because news businesses have no option but to deal with the platforms, and have had little ability to negotiate over payment for their content or other issues,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.

289,"July 29, 2020",Big Tech’s Dominance Comes Under Fire During Antitrust Hearing,"


Four of America’s big tech CEOs faced the US House of Representatives’ antitrust subcommittee Wednesday July 29,  taking questions about alleged predatory business practices, theft of digital content and aggressive copying and purchasing of competing businesses, reported the Wall Street Journal.  The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Apple andAlphabet were all virtually present at the hearing.
The hearing, held virtually amid the coronavirus outbreak, is the culmination of a 13-month investigation into Big Tech’s dominance. The participation of the four CEOs, who are among the most recognizable names in business and tech, marked the first time they had spoken to Congress as a group.
The subcommittee has been investigating the companies’ dominance of the online world for over a year, collecting 1.3 million documents and conducting hundreds of hours of interviews. Iin the opening minutes, the subcommittee chairman, David Cicilline  pointed out that the companies dominate their respective spheres and accused them of stifling competition. The complaints against the tech giants are varied but the overarching criticisms are that they have used their dominant position to quash rivals and overcharge the people and businesses reliant on their services.
“Our founders would not bow before a king,” the Rhode Island Democrat said. “Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.”
Republican lawmakers at different times in the hearing directed the conversation away from antitrust to allegations of anti-conservative bias on the platforms, accusing the companies of silencing conservative voices and working to undo Donald Trump’s 2016 election win, reported The Guardian. 
Watch the full hearing below 

Bipartisanship was also clearly evident as both Democrats and Republicans raised many concerns about anti-competitive practices, reported CNET. For example, both Cicilline and Republican Ken Buck of Colorado, accused Google of stealing digital content from smaller companies, such as Yelp and Genius. In the case of Yelp, Cicilline said Google threatened to delist it when Yelp raised concerns.
“The choice Google gave Yelp was let us steal your content or effectively disappear from the web site. Isn’t that anti-competitive?” Cicilline asked in a pointed and forceful line of questioning.
Pichai avoided a direct answer, saying “When I run the company, I’m really focused on giving users what they want. We conduct ourselves to the highest standard. Happy to engage, understand the specifics, and answer your questions further.”
President Trump also weighed in on the topic Wednesday, tweeting, “If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.”

The CEOs rejected the accusations, saying they strive to remain politically neutral and focus on serving consumers, not denying access to rivals, reported The WSJ. 
Mr. Bezos told lawmakers about his parents and his decision to leave a Wall Street job to start Amazon from a Seattle garage.  “The retail market we participate in is extraordinarily large and competitive,” he said, addressing broader concerns about Amazon’s power. “There is room in retail for multiple winners.”
Cook, the Apple CEO, faced effective questioning from representative Hank Johnson of Georgia, who said the investigation had surfaced concerns that rules governing the App Store review process are not available to the app developers. “The rules are made up as you go and subject to change – and Apple expects developers to go along with the changes or leave the App Store,” Johnson said. “That’s an enormous amount of power.”
Cook argued the App Store does not constitute a monopoly because it does not charge the vast majority of apps to list there. He said 84% of apps are not charged anything and Apple has not increased commissions on apps since 2008.
The hearing comes at a difficult moment for the tech giants with Republican and Democrats both highly critical of their dominance.

290,"July 28, 2020",Sustainability as a Quality Dimension of Competition: Protecting Our Future (Selves),"
It is considered by many that sustainability considerations should not be taken into account by competition authorities when analyzing the effects of a conduct or transaction. This short article maintains that the impact on sustainability of certain types of conduct or transactions can be considered in the analysis of their price or non-price effects on quality, choice and innovation. This approach has the advantage of bringing sustainability considerations within the traditional competitive assessment framework, as opposed to characterizing them as public policy considerations that are outside the realm of competition law. This can be done by means of a relatively light fine-tuning of the current analytical toolbox and of the design of competition investigations, and it can help ensure that competition on sustainability, when it affects demand and supply in a particular market, is preserved.

291,"July 28, 2020",Living Wage Initiatives: No Reason to Object,"
This paper addresses the misconception that agreements concerning the price to be paid to farmers, intended to ensure that their workers receive a living income, inevitably amount to object infringements. Such agreements will still need to be assessed for their effects, of course, and will need to be designed with appropriate care and attention. But recent EU case law reconfirms that agreements should not be mechanistically consigned to the “object” box, and guidance from antitrust agencies needs to actively embrace this message, so as to lend confidence to industry to engage constructively on living wage initiatives. Fear of falling straight into the object box is the elephant in the room, casting its shadow on the developing antitrust/sustainability debate. The elephant needs to be firmly shown the door.

Climate Change is an existential threat. Competition law must be part of the solution and not part of the problem. This paper draws on the constitutional provisions of the EU treaties and remarks by leaders such as Commissioner Vestager to show how competition law need not stand in the way of urgent action and co-operation by the private sector to fight climate change. It also shows how sustainability is relevant to both the analysis of mergers and dominance cases. It is a call to update our thinking, our guidelines and, if necessary, our law. Based on EU law it contains ideas that could inspire changes in other jurisdictions. Finally, it contains a plea for us to learn the lessons from the COVID crisis for the climate crisis.

According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg is prepared with what he sees as a compelling argument for lawmakers ready to grill him on antitrust issues: hindering American technological innovation only helps China.
Zuckerberg plans to portray his company as an American success story in a competitive and unpredictable market, now threatened by the rise of Chinese social media apps around the world, and increasingly, at home, with the popularity of TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the CEO’s remarks aren’t yet public.
The Facebook CEO is scheduled to testify at a hearing of the House antitrust subcommittee with CEOs from Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, and Apple. The hearing, postponed from Monday, has been rescheduled for July 29 at noon Washington time. Facebook’s second-quarter earnings, which were scheduled for that day, have been pushed to Thursday, July 30.
Congressional investigators have collected thousands of internal Facebook documents to figure out the reasoning behind the company’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and understand Zuckerberg’s thinking about competitors.
Zuckerberg plans to say the success of those properties under Facebook wasn’t inevitable. Instagram, in particular, had only 13 employees and no revenue when Facebook acquired the company in 2012 — though it was quickly becoming the most popular mobile photo-sharing app.
The broader argument the CEO plans to make is that any weakening of US companies will cede territory to Chinese companies abroad, particularly in high-growth markets like India. Zuckerberg made a similar argument at a 2019 hearing about Libra, the now-renamed cryptocurrency. “China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months,” he warned. “If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.” Later that year, he said that it was important not to let China set the rules for the internet in the rest of the world, arguing that the country’s values aren’t democratic.

294,"July 27, 2020",The Anti-Monopoly Fund Raises $1M To Promote Antitrust Enforcement,"


A group pushing for more competitive markets is funneling more than $1 million into initiatives that promote stronger antitrust enforcement as US regulators examine whether Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have too much power over commerce.
The Anti-Monopoly Fund, which was started last year by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and the nonprofit group he chairs, said Monday that it’s donating $1,625,000 to 14 research institutions, small business groups, public-interest campaigns and other organizations that examine market concentration in a variety of sectors. Since leaving Facebook in 2007, Hughes has emerged as a critic of the power of large technology companies and stunned observers when he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times last year calling for the breakup of the social media giant he helped create.
The donations are part of a larger effort announced last year by the Economic Security Project to spend $10 million on promoting more robust competition in the technology, pharmaceutical, financial services and agricultural industries.
The Fund is seeking reforms in the marketplace as antitrust scrutiny of the technology sector intensifies at federal, state and congressional levels. The chief executive officers of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. are poised to testify Wednesday in an extraordinary joint appearance before a congressional panel investigating competition in the technology industry.
“The upcoming Congressional hearing involving CEOs from America’s biggest tech companies is a much-needed step toward oversight of an industry with virtually none of the checks on power required of other major businesses,” Hughes said in a statement. “We should not rely on any corporation to self-regulate, and I’m grateful political leaders are transcending party lines to take action and curtail the undue power and influence of these corporations.”

295,"July 27, 2020",Report: Companies Say Amazon Accessed Proprietary Info To Make Its Own Products,"


Daniela Braga, founder and CEO of DefinedCrowd, a data platform for artificial intelligence (AI), has a beef with Amazon, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.
Four years ago, the eCommerce giant’s venture capital fund invested in the Seattle-based company and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information.
Earlier this year, Amazon launched A2I, an AI product that Braga told the newspaper mirrors the DefinedCrowd product. She said Amazon Web Services’ offering competes “with one of our bread-and-butter foundational products” that collects and labels data.
After seeing the announcement of A2I’s debut, Braga limited Amazon’s access to her company’s data and diluted its stake by 90% by raising more capital, The WSJ reported.
Braga is not the only executive who claims Amazon appeared to use the investment in their company to develop competing products.
In 2010, Amazon invested in LivingSocial, the daily deals website, gaining a 30% stake, the WSJ reported. Former LivingSocial executives said Amazon began requesting data.
Not long after, LivingSocial executives began hearing from clients that Amazon was offering them better terms.
“They are using market forces in a really Machiavellian way,” Jeremy Levine, a partner at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, told the newspaper. “It’s like they are not in any way, shape or form the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing. They are a wolf in wolf’s clothing.”
Amazon denied it uses confidential information companies share to construct competing products.
“Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build,” Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, told the WSJ. “Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”
In April, PYMNTS reported former Amazon employees said the company violated its own policies when workers took data from its independent sellers to launch competing products.
While Amazon has said it places restrictions on staff from accessing the data of its millions of sellers, more than 20 former employees said they accessed sellers’ information to determine which products they should make under its private labels.
Last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commenced an investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, and Microsoft over antitrust implications, and in February asked the companies to produce information regarding takeovers of smaller companies between the years of 2010 and 2019.

296,"July 27, 2020","Uber Eats, Carrefour Expand Partnership In France, Belgium","
Uber Eats and Carrefour, the French supermarket and department store under one roof, announced an agreement covering deliveries beyond Paris and in Belgium.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed in the Monday, July 27, announcement. Carrefour stated it operates 12,300 stores in more than 30 countries, serves 105 million customers worldwide and has a workforce of more than 380,000.
At the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in April, Uber Eats, the San Francisco-based online food ordering and delivery platform, and Carrefour teamed up to deliver groceries, hygiene, and household maintenance products within 30 minutes from 15 Carrefour stores.
Since the launch three months ago, the service has been expanded to 330 stores in 91 major urban areas, or 25% of France’s population. It is expected to increase to 500 by September, the company stated.
Following promising results, Uber Eats and Carrefour have signed an exclusive deal to launch a shopping home delivery service for all of France. The idea is for shopping orders to be delivered within 30 minutes using meal delivery apps.
The partnership with Uber Eats is not limited to France. An initial agreement was signed with Carrefour Taiwan last year covered eight cities and 38 stores.
Carrefour promised it will launch in Belgium in September, with the service being available in Brussels and Liège. Other Carrefour Group countries will follow over the next few months, the firm said.

297,"July 27, 2020","Big Tech Goes on Shopping Spree, Brushing Off Antitrust Scrutiny","


By David McLaughlin, Bloomberg 
The biggest U.S. technology companies have gone on a buying spree this year, waving off intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs and critics who say they’ve bolstered their power by snatching up nascent rivals.
The number of acquisitions by the five largest companies — Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Facebook Inc., and Microsoft Corp. — came at the fastest pace through June since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tech deals are accelerating even in the face of stepped-up antitrust scrutiny under the Trump administration. Federal officials are investigating Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for antitrust violations, and the Justice Department under Attorney General Willliam Barr is expected to file a monopolization case against Google in the coming weeks. Google and Facebook are also contending with investigations by state attorneys general.
A House panel is also conducting an inquiry into the state of competition in the technology sector and the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all slated to testify at a virtual hearing Wednesday.
Through June 30, the five companies announced 27 deals, according to Bloomberg data, up 29% from the same period last year, when they did 21 deals.
The speeding up of tech deals could give ammunition to economists, lawyers and lawmakers who warn that the tech companies have used their abundant cash to gain leverage over existing competitors and increase already high market shares.
“Until there’s some enforcement in this area, companies are likely to think they can get away with it, and if they can get away it, they’re likely to try,” said New York University law professor Scott Hemphill, who has written about deals that eliminate emerging competitors.
An even bigger worry is that the tech companies are potentially choking off competition by acquiring firms that, while small, could one day emerge as robust rivals. After all, the tech giants were all startups once.

298,"July 27, 2020",Facebook Claims EU Antitrust Questions Go Beyond Scope Of Probe,"


Facebook has taken the EU to court for invading the privacy of its employees, according to the Financial Times.
 The social media company claims EU regulators have asked broad questions beyond the scope of two ongoing antitrust probes, and it has requested that the General Court in Luxembourg intervene. 
The EU is investigating both how Facebook collects and makes money from data and whether its Marketplace business has an unfair advantage over rivals in classified advertising. 
Since March, Facebook has provided the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, with 1.7m pages of documents, including internal emails, in response to multiple requests for information.
The EU has made further requests for all documents containing key words and phrases such as “big question”, “for free”, “not good for us” and “shutdown”, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. But in its appeal to the court, the social media company argued that these terms were too broad and would capture private information from its employees.
Tim Lamb, director and associate general counsel for competition at Facebook, said “We are cooperating with the Commission and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents.  
“The exceptionally broad nature of the Commission’s requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the Commission’s investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees’ medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees. We think such requests should be reviewed by the EU courts.”

299,"July 26, 2020",US House Panel Hearing With Big Tech CEOs Rescheduled For Wednesday,"


Four Big Tech CEOs ⁠— Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Apple’s Tim Cook — will answer for their companies’ practices before Congress at a hearing Wednesday, July 29, by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.
The panel has conducted a bipartisan investigation over the past year of the tech giants’ market dominance and their effect on consumers.
It’s the first such congressional review of the tech industry. It has aimed to determine whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed. The four CEOs are expected to testify remotely.
The hearing originally was set for Monday. It was rescheduled to allow lawmakers who are committee members to participate in commemorations at the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday for Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon and longtime Georgia congressman who died July 17.

300,"July 26, 2020",Congress Could Issue Antitrust Report On Big Tech By Late Summer,"


The Congressional report expected to recommend fixes for alleged antitrust violations by the nation’s four largest technology companies could be issued soon, Reuters reported.
In a phone call with reporters on Thursday, July 23, senior aides from the House Judiciary Committee and the antitrust subcommittee said the panel has received 1.3 million documents from the companies, and that the final report could come later this summer or early fall.
On Monday, July 27, Committee members led by Chairman US David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island) were scheduled to quiz the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple as part of an investigation into whether the tech giant’s business practices are killing competition. But the hearing conflicts with a memorial service for the late Rep. John Lewis (Democrat – Georgia) that has been set for that same day at 2 pm in the US Capitol Rotunda, and so the hearing has been rescheduled. 
On Thursday, Reuters reported that the CEOs, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Jeff Bezos from Amazon, are expected to deflect criticism of their market power and say that they also face intense competition.
The executives, who plan to testify virtually, voluntarily agreed to appear and no subpoenas have been issued, the committee aides said. But tech lobbying groups have said the hearing is unlikely to address core antitrust issues or offer anything new. 
“There’s not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics,” Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at NetChoice, the Washington, DC-based trade group, told Reuters. “This hearing is not about finding truth, but creating news stories.”
The news service asked the Congressional aides on the call if the hearing would uncover new information. In response, a senior aide said that while there’s a risk that company executives will not always answer questions fully, it is important that their voices are heard. “This is not like a normal oversight hearing, where we hear from the CEOs and move on,” the aide said.

301,"July 23, 2020",House Antitrust Hearing Involving Big Tech CEOs Reportedly Postponed,"


A US House Judiciary Committee hearing at which big tech CEOs, including Apple chief Tim Cook, are scheduled to offer testimony on antitrust matters will likely be postponed, according to a report on Thursday July 23.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC reported the hearing will be delayed as the date conflicts with a service for late Rep. John Lewis. The hearing, which was set to feature Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, is meant to be the culmination of a more than year-long investigation into the four tech giants. 
Following the hearing, lawmakers plan to issue a report based on their findings throughout the investigation and propose legislation that would aim to bring antitrust laws up to date to be responsive to issues unique to digital marketplaces.
The session would be the sixth hearing in the Judiciary Committee’s ongoing investigation into competition in the digital marketplace and allegations of anti-competitive conduct by the tech giants. It comes as all four companies face increasing antitrust scrutiny in Washington and Brussels, including a potential antitrust lawsuit that the Justice Department could launch against Google in the coming months.
The project has been delayed already by the public health crisis that’s interrupted Congress’ normal course of business. Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in January, she expected the report to be completed by early April, but that timeline has since been shifted at least several months.
It’s not yet clear when the hearing will be rescheduled.

302,"July 22, 2020",Republicans Want Twitter CEO To Testify At House Antitrust Hearing,"


Republicans have called on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify at Monday’s antitrust hearing, which will feature the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.
In a letter to Democratic leadership on Wednesday, Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, wrote, “We believe there is bipartisan interest to hear from Twitter about its power in the marketplace, its role in moderating content on its platform, and the causes for its recent highly publicized security breaches,” a likely reference to last week’s hack that affected the accounts of major figures including former President Barack Obama. The letter was addressed to Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
The call follows ongoing tension between Jordan, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Democratic leaders over the format of the hearing. Jordan previously asked Nadler to hold the hearing in front of the full committee, rather than before the Antitrust Subcommittee, to allow participation from all members. In Wednesday’s letter, Jordan said that Nadler has so far declined that request.
Jordan described Twitter as “a market leader in social media” and said the hearing “represents a significant and unique opportunity to explore these issues with respect to Twitter as part of the Committee’s investigation.”
But Twitter is much smaller than the four other companies already set to testify, making an antitrust argument against the company more challenging. Though size is not necessarily an indication of anticompetitive behavior in the U.S., Twitter holds far less of the social media market than Facebook. Last quarter, Twitter reported 166 million monetizable daily active users (mDAUs). Though it says that metric is not comparable to those for other platforms, it’s far below the 1.73 billion daily active users (DAUs) Facebook reported last quarter.

303,"July 22, 2020",Apple Commissions Study On Its App Store Ahead Of Antitrust Hearing,"


Apple’s controversial policy of taking up to a 30% cut of purchases made through the App Store is actually similar to the commission rates charged by other digital marketplaces, claims a new study commissioned by Apple from economic consulting and strategy firm Analysis Group.
The report comes just days before Apple CEO Tim Cook, along with CEOs from Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook, is set to testify before Congress as part of an antitrust hearing.
It’s also a sign of Apple using all the tools it has at its disposal, including, in this case, funding research, to combat criticisms of anticompetitive practices. 
The data, published on Wednesday, July 22, comes after Apple has come under scrutiny for its App Store policies, particularly its requirement that developers must use Apple’s payment system of which it takes up to a 30% cut.
The Apple-supported study shows that other major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Samsung also charge 30% commission rates for their respective app stores. For subscriptions, Apple drops that rate to 15% after the first year, much like Google.
“Our study shows that Apple’s App Store commission rate is similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces,” wrote the authors of the study. “The commission rates charged by digital marketplaces most similar to the App Store, such as other app stores and video game digital marketplaces, are generally around 30%.”

Amazon spent a record $4.38 million on lobbying during the second quarter, according to a spokeswoman, as the e-commerce giant faced increasing antitrust scrutiny in Washington and the challenges of delivering goods to Americans stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic, reported Bloomberg. 
The spending for the three months ending June 30 was up more than 9% from the same period a year ago, and represented a slight increase from its previous record in the first quarter, according to lobbying disclosures filed with Congress.
Amazon, alongside Alphabet’s Google, Apple and Facebook, is facing investigations into whether it abuses its power to stifle competition. At the same time, people increasingly rely on the services that big tech companies provide, such as Amazon’s delivery of essentials, in the midst of lockdown orders.

Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith reportedly expressed concerns about the Apple App Store in a meeting with the US House antitrust committee investigating dominant tech companies.
The meeting came a few weeks before the House’s Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee is set to grill prominent tech executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet and Google CEO Sundai Pichai.
Amid the ongoing antitrust probe, the committee met with Smith via videoconference earlier in the summer, The Information reported. According to sources familiar with the meeting, the primary goal was to get Microsoft’s perspective as a major technology company that has faced past antitrust regulation. 
But The Information notes that Smith also discussed some of Microsoft’s “concerns” about how Apple operates its App Store — an issue at the forefront of the House committee’s investigation.
Specifically, the concerns centered on the “arbitrariness of Apple’s practices around approving apps, while also criticizing Apple’s requirement that developers use the company’s payment mechanism through their apps.” Smith did not levy any criticisms against other tech companies, sources claimed.
Spotify, Basecamp and other companies have complained about Apple’s 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchases made through its payment system. In June, the House antitrust chairperson called the fees “highway robbery.”
Apple, for its part, says that those fees are meant to ensure consistency across the App Store — not to generate excess profits.

The lack of disclosure on the Google and Facebook papers, she said, shouldn’t be an issue because Apple and Amazon didn’t pay her to write them. What’s more, she added, those papers didn’t focus on either Apple or Amazon.
“I work for companies that I’m comfortable are not breaking the law,” she said in an interview. “So you’re articulating what is making the market work well and how the company’s conduct is pro-competitive or efficient.”

In a surprise win for privacy advocates, the European Court of Justice has ruled companies will face restrictions on storing information about European Union (EU) residents on US servers, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The top court of the 28-nation bloc ruled the transfer of personal data to platforms in the US puts Europeans at risk to American government surveillance without a right to challenge it.
The decision on Thursday, July 16, ends a data transfer agreement between the EU and the U.S. The court’s action is seen as a victory for activists who have insisted that the US’s surveillance practices should put an end to storing personal information about Europeans, The Journal reported.
As a result of the court’s decision, thousands of global companies who do business in Europe and the US, including Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, and Apple will face a potential disruption of their operations.
For example, depending on how the decision is applied, the ruling could be an expensive one. Companies will have to choose between whether to move personal data to servers in Europe or stop doing business in the region.
Tech advocates have said the court’s ruling to prohibit data transfers to the US could cost these companies billions in trade from their cross-border data activities, including cloud services, marketing and advertising, and human resources, The Journal reported.
In the Digital Identity Tracker this week, PYMNTS reported that keeping patients’ medical information safe remains a priority for governments and regulators around the world — and that the pandemic is making the task even more complicated.

310,"July 16, 2020",The Political Misuse of Antitrust: Doing the Right Thing for the Wrong Reason,"

By Spencer Weber Waller & Jacob E. Morse (Loyola University)*
 
Introduction
The increased importance of antitrust as a campaign issue and a political conversation raises long-standing troubling issues of whether antitrust enforcement (or non-enforcement) can, and is, being used for partisan political purposes. First, there were long standing rumors of White House direction to challenge the AT&T-Time Warner merger. Second, the President and other key officials have alleged that social media and tech giants have exhibited a political bias against conservative messages and that antitrust was one way to deal with such alleged abuses. Third, there have been press reports that the head of the Antitrust Division lobbied members of Congress in connection with the settlement of the Sprint-T–Mobile merger investigation and personally sought to broker the divestiture that was accepted to allow the transaction to move forward.1
Most recently, Congress also has heard recent testimony from a whistleblower that the Attorney General directed burdensome second requests, over the objection of career staff, to mergers posing few competitive risks in the cannabis industry out of a personal dislike for the industry.2 These second requests represented 29 percent of the total second requests during the fiscal year in question.3 The whistleblower also raised concerns about the Division’s now-closed investigation — also over the objections of career staff — of car companies lobbying the state of California to maintain state emissions control at a level in excess of what the administration sought to impose at the federal level.4
This essay begins a long overdue conversation about how the legal system should deal with issues of personal animus or political favoritism in the enforcement of the antitrust laws.5 We take no position on the merits of any of the current controversies, but instead focus on the broader issue of how animus and bias in the broadest sense should be dealt with, both when cases with some potential merit are brought against perceived enemies and when cases with some potential merit are declined to protect perceived allies.
We begin with distinguishing these situations of bias and animus from those of outright corruption and when antitrust considerations are set aside in favor of broader foreign policy and national interests. We then look at the limited tools within antitrust law to deal with issues of bias and political favoritism and survey related areas of the law which have been dealing with these issues more directly throughout their history.
A. Distinguishing Outright Corruption and Legitimate National Interest
The types of political bias in the news appear to be different from issues of outright corruption. Issues of bribery and quid pro quo corruption surfaced in the 1970s as an issue in the Watergate scandal when illegal campaign contributions were being used in part to influence antitrust merger decisions of the Nixon Justice Departments.6 Congress reacted in the post-Watergate era by passing the Tunney Act requiring all consent decrees settling government antitrust litigation by reviewed by a federal district court judge to determine whether the settlement was in the public interest.7
Similar troubling issues also arose in the Johnson Administration. As documented from transcripts of recorded calls and discussions in the Oval Office, President Johnson threatened to block a merger involving a leading Houston bank unless the head of the bank helped secure the endorsement of the leading Houston newspaper for Johnson’s 1964 campaign.8 Neither example requires sophisticated analysis to condemn on moral or legal grounds.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, it may be political, but hardly immoral or illegal, to refrain from an instance of antitrust enforcement because it threatens the broader national interest. This is the premise of virtually every immunity doctrine in antitrust law where the overall societal value of labor unions, agricultural cooperatives, certain regulated industries, export trading companies, certain research and development joint ventures, cooperatives activities to ensure adequate annual supplies of flu vaccines, and other forms of joint activities are deemed more important by Congress than the promotion of competition otherwise mandated by the antitrust laws.9 Whether the balance was correctly struck by Congress or the judiciary is a very different question from whether the right thing was done for an improper political motive.
A similar calculus by the executive branch of the value of the overall national interest at the expense of antitrust enforcement in a specific matter is an exercise that may be political, but rarely immoral or unlawful. Few would be interested in the bringing of an antitrust case that risked starting an armed conflict with a trading partner. A decision not to prosecute the members of the OPEC cartel, or private firms carrying out its bidding, may be political and may be prudent or imprudent, but it is neither immoral nor unlawful on its own.10
For example, one can question the correctness of President Truman’s decision to limit an investigation of middle eastern oil companies to a civil proceeding because of the political needs of the Cold War, or President Reagan’s decision to not bring criminal antitrust charges against various foreign firms in connection with the demise of Laker Airlines because of foreign policy concerns and the diplomatic efforts of the British Prime Minister.11 All are political in any normal sense of the word, but none are corrupt, immoral, or unlawful without more.
B. Bias, Animus, and Prosecutorial Discretion in Antitrust
The harder question is what to do when a public competition agency brings a non-frivolous antitrust investigation or case to punish a perceive political opponent or refrains from bringing a non-frivolous, but risky, case against a perceived political supporter. As outlined above, these are not hypothetical questions or thought experiments. Press reports abound that then-Candidate Trump and President Trump expressed his opposition to the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger as well as his dislike for the coverage he received from Time Warner’s CNN news network.12 Subsequently, the Antitrust Division unsuccessfully challenged that merger in the courts using valid, but unusual, theories that the Division had rarely used to seek to block a merger outright.13
Similarly, both Candidate Trump and President Trump expressed concern over the power of Amazon (and other tech companies) and his dislike for Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, a frequent critic of Trump.14 As of June 2020, Amazon remains under antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.15 Separate reports indicated that the Attorney General and his deputy were personally directing and pushing an investigation into Google, which is reportedly entering its final phase.16
This is a particular concern for public rather than private enforcement. The public antitrust agencies in the United States have powers and resources far in excess of private litigants in civil litigation. Only the U.S. Department of Justice (through the Antitrust Division or its other Divisions) can empanel a grand jury or use the resources of the FBI, IRS, and other law enforcement agencies to investigate a potential criminal case. Only the government can compel testimony before the grand jury through the granting of immunity, or grant amnesty or leniency to a business entity and its employees. Only the government can issue a criminal information or seek an indictment from a grand jury. Only the government can arrest a defendant and compel them to stand trial which could result in lengthy imprisonment for individuals and substantial fines for business entities and individuals.
Even on the civil side, the powers and resources of the government normally dwarf those of most individuals and businesses. The FTC and the Antitrust Division each have hundreds of professionals dedicated to antitrust enforcement and broad pre-complaint investigative powers that far exceed the limited pre-complaint discovery available to a private litigant.17

Antitrust Division and DOJ Policy

There are two main internal policy manuals and guidelines that govern the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity by the Antitrust Division and the DOJ more generally. All condemn prosecutions motivated by political considerations. All are rather anodyne, and none are binding if action is taken and none would suffice to address if the Division or the DOJ as a whole refrained from action on political grounds.
The introduction to the Justice Department manual begins with a ringing condemnation of political influence. It states:
“The legal judgments of the Department of Justice must be impartial and insulated from political influence. It is imperative that the Department’s investigatory and prosecutorial powers be exercised free from partisan consideration.”18
The Principles of Federal Prosecution section of the Justice Department also states that:
“In determining whether to commence or recommend prosecution or take other action against a person, the attorney for the government should not be influenced by:
1. The person’s race, religion, gender, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, or political association, activities, or beliefs;….”19
The Antitrust Division Manual contains several references to past litigation where the question of political considerations was considered by the court. One section covers objections to CIDs because of government motives such as political motivation and states:
“[I]t has been held that a CID may be quashed if it is issued for the purpose of intimidating or harassing the recipient. In Chattanooga Pharm. Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 358 F.2d 864 (6th Cir. 1966), the Government declined to answer the recipient’s allegations that the purpose of the CID was to intimidate and harass the recipient into terminating a pending suit for enforcement of a state fair trade act. Since the Government did not respond, the court held that the allegations were admitted and set aside the CID.”20
The Manual further discusses grounds for discovery of improper motives behind a subpoena stating:
“Recipients have challenged CIDs and asked for discovery on the grounds that they were allegedly issued in response to outside political interference and pressure or to pay off a political debt and were not in a bona fide attempt to determine whether a violation occurred. In In re Cleveland Trust Co., 1972 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 73,991, at 92,122 (N.D. Ohio 1969), the court applied grand jury standards applicable to issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to hold that the recipient was entitled to certain discovery to establish that the investigation was not a bona fide attempt to ascertain an antitrust violation.”21

Motivation in Noerr-Pennington and Sham Litigation

Antitrust law has rarely engaged with the question of bias or animus in the bringing of a complaint. One area that touches on this question is the sham litigation exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine hold that petitioning any branch of the government, including filing litigation, is immune from the antitrust laws as beyond the scope of the Sherman Act.22
The Supreme Court has also established an exception for the filing of baseless litigation where no special antitrust immunity would apply.23 Unfortunately, the Court has spoken in two very different ways about the nature of the sham litigation doctrine. In City of Columbia, the Court stated: “The sham exception to Noerr encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process – as opposed to the outcome as an anticompetitive weapon.”24 This suggests an analogy to the common law of abuse of process. However, two years later the Court spoke in terms more akin to the notion of malicious prosecution stating:
“First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits. … Only if the challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant’s subjective motivation, which must be a subjective intent to abuse the governmental process in order to interfere with a competitor’s business.”25
The closest the question of political bias or animus has directly come in an antitrust decision action was the previously mentioned ATT-Time Warner litigation, where the defendants sought discovery on potential communications between the White House and the Justice Departments about political influence in the decision to challenge the merger. There, the court denied the requested discovery request holding that “defendants have not made a ‘credible showing’ that they have been ‘especially singled out’ [by the DOJ].”26 Even it turned out that there were no such communications,27 how would one ever know whether officials eager to please their bosses brought a plausible antitrust (or other kind of case) because they believed it would make the White House happy? And what should one do (or conclude) if such information became available?
C. Analogies from Other Areas of the Law
The law deals in many areas with these questions of purpose versus effect, objectively baseless claims versus claims with evidentiary and factual merit but improper purpose, and cases where these issues of mixed motives and bases are intertwined.28 These areas provide mixed signals how best to approach questions of political bias and personal animus in the antitrust realm.

Selective Prosecution

A defendant in a criminal case has a very narrow window to successfully establish a claim of selective prosecution. A selective prosecution claim is not a defense, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought a charge for reasons forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. U.S. v. Armstrong required that a defendant claiming selective prosecution must establish both that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted and that the government’s selection was motivated by the type of invidious intent prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.29 This normally involves a decision to prosecute based on prohibited factors such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification in the constitutional sense.30
The Armstrong Court held that to obtain discovery of information relevant to a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must produce “some evidence tending to show” the existence of discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent including that “similarly situated defendants of other races could have been prosecuted but were not.”31 This chicken and egg problem dooms most selective prosecution claims, including the attempt by the defendants in the ATT-Time Warner merger challenge to seek discovery about the potential political motivations of the government suing to block this particular transaction. 32
Despite its superficial appeal, selective prosecution, or selective enforcement in a civil or regulatory action, remains an unappealing road in most antitrust litigation. Courts are reluctant to interfere with the special province of the prosecutor or enforcement agency. Claims of political bias would then have to shoehorned into one or more of the protected categories under the Equal Protection Clause. The defendants would have to establish most of the facts necessary for the claim before obtaining disclosure or discovery on this topic from the government in litigation, a burden even well-heeled defendants like AT&T and Time Warner could not meet. Finally, even the most egregious of political favoritism would do nothing to attack a biased decision not to enforce the antitrust laws to benefit an ally.

Civil Procedure Analogies

Civil procedure provides another method of dealing with such questions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 11 requires attorneys to sign pleadings, motions, and most other writings, attesting that they have made an investigation reasonable under the circumstances and certify that the pleadings and other matters have a reasonable basis in both law and fact and are not being brought for an improper purpose.33 Similar provisions dealing with discovery requests go even further and require written certification that each request is consistent with the federal rules of civil procedure, warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for changing the law and are:
“(i) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and
(ii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.”34
The limitations of FRCP 11 are also well known. The provision includes a 21-day safe harbor that allows a party to avoid violating the rule by withdrawing or modifying the pleading or other written submission.35 The provision only states that the court “may” impose “appropriate” sanctions for violations of the rule.36 Moreover, sanctions are limited to what is sufficient to deter repeated violations by the party or those in similar circumstances.37 The court also has wide discretion as to the type of sanctions that can be imposed.38

Professional Responsibility

The model rules of professional responsibility also address these types of issues. MRPC 3.1 requires a meritorious basis for bringing or defending litigation.39 At the same time, MRPC 4.4a states:
“In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.”40
These model rules only apply to members of the bar and would not apply to sanction a non-lawyer professional at either of the antitrust agencies. While the content of these rules is helpful, they only allow for the subsequent initiation of disciplinary proceedings with the relevant state bar authorities and those courts where the attorney in question is admitted to practice and provide little comfort to the litigants in the moment of responding to improperly motivated proceedings.

Tort Law

In tort law, a similar distinction plays out in the differences between the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Malicious prosecution is usually defined as the bringing of a prior civil or criminal legal action without probable cause, and with malice, that resulted in harm to the defendant in the original action.41 No amount of malice is sufficient if the original claim has merit.
In contrast, the tort of abuse of process does not require proof of a lack of probable cause in the prior litigation. In general, an abuse of process requires proof that a person deliberately misused a prior court proceeding for an improper collateral purpose, regardless of whether the original civil or legal case had probable cause.42 One common example would be a perfectly appropriate case brought at least in substantial part to harass the defendant, run up his litigation costs, damage his reputation, or pursue improper lines of discovery to obtain information unrelated to the otherwise meritorious suit.

Administrative Law

Administrative law requires an agency to support its decision with substantial evidence and prohibits arbitrary or capricious decisions.43 Courts will grant agencies substantial discretion in deciding complex mixed questions of law and fact under this standard.44 However, both the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious tests normally turn on a matching of the evidence in the record of the agency decision with the outcome, rather than a parsing of the motive behind the decision.
The Supreme Court has allowed a narrow role for motive in holding that a proven pretext for an agency decision may be grounds for overturning final agency action.45 The Court rejected most attempts to inquire into the motive behind an agency decision, holding a court may not set aside under the APA an agency’s policymaking decision solely because the decision might have been influenced by political considerations or prompted by an Administration’s priorities.46 The Court noted that agency policymaking is not a rarified technocratic process, unaffected by political considerations or the presence of presidential power, and such decisions are routinely informed by unstated considerations of politics, the legislative process, public relations, interest group relations, foreign relations, national security concerns, and other considerations.47
Nonetheless, the Court found a narrow exception to the general rule against judicial inquiry into the mental processes of administrative decisionmakers, such an inquiry may be warranted and may justify extra-record discovery, on a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior.48 It therefore remanded the case regarding questions about citizenship on the 2020 Census back for further proceedings in the district court stating that the question concerning citizenship status could not be adequately explained in terms of the proffered reason.49

Employment Law

Employment law has its own unique approach to the question of whether an employee was fired for permissible reasons, such as job performance, or for an impermissible reason such as of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or some combination of both. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination “because of” an unlawful discriminatory factor.50 The so-called McDonnell-Douglas test adopted a burden shifting approach to deal with situations where an employee asserts she was treated less favorably for an unlawful reason and the employer contends that the treatment was based on a permissible factor.51
In McDonnell-Douglas, the plaintiff alleged that he was not hired because he was African American, while the company contended that the decision was a result of the plaintiff’s participation in a prior disruptive protest on company property. The Court held unanimously that the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. This can include direct and indirect evidence that which he can satisfy by showing that: (i) she belongs to a racial minority (or other protected group); (ii) she applied and was qualified for a job the employer was trying to fill; (iii) though qualified, she was rejected; and (iv) thereafter the employer continued to seek applicants with complainant’s qualifications.52
The defendant (employer) must then produce evidence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions.53 If this occurs, then there is no presumption of discrimination. The plaintiff must then be afforded a fair opportunity to present additional facts to show discrimination. The plaintiff may do so either by showing that the defendant’s explanation is insufficient, and therefore a pretext for discrimination, or by otherwise proving that the defendant’s relied on one or more of unlawful discriminatory parameters.54

Civil Rights

In civil rights and constitutional litigation, the Supreme Court has wandered from approach to approach. In Mt Healthy v. Doyle, the Supreme Court considered whether a public school teacher could be fired or otherwise disciplined for constitutionally protected speech, where the same action might have taken place for other unprotected activities.55 Here, the Court adopted a different type of burden shifting approach from that in McDonnell-Douglas. In order to prevail, the plaintiff must first prove that the activity they were allegedly disciplined for was indeed protected speech.56 Then the burden shifts to the defendant who can prevail if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse action would have occurred anyway, even if the protected activity had never happened.57
In cases relating to pretextual traffic stops of defendants, the Supreme Court simply rejected any such burden shifting. In Whren v. United States, the Court held in a unanimous decision that if there is probable cause for a traffic stop there is no further inquiry into whether the stop was a pretext for other unlawful purpose.58

International Antitrust Norms

One of the few attempts within the antitrust community to grapple with these issues has come from the Trump Administration itself. The Antitrust Division has devoted substantial resources toward the development of a Multilateral Framework on Procedures in Competition Law Investigation and Enforcement through the International Competition Network (“MFP”). The MFP identifies what the Justice Department terms universal due process principles that are widely accepted across the globe, including commitments regarding non-discrimination, transparency and predictability, proper notice, access to information, meaningful and timely engagement, the opportunity to defend, timely resolution of proceedings, confidentiality protections, avoidance of conflicts of interest, access to counsel and privilege, written enforcement decisions and public access to decisions, and availability of independent review of enforcement decisions.59
The closest these principles come to addressing the questions of political influence on independent competition agencies comes in its conflict of interest principles. This section states:
Officials, including decision makers, of the Participants will be objective and impartial and will not have material personal or financial conflicts of interest in the Investigations and Enforcement Proceedings in which they participate or oversee. Each Participant is encouraged to have rules, policies, or guidelines regarding the identification and prevention or handling of such conflicts.60
It would be both interesting and ironic if an exercise designed to reign in the discretion of enforcement agencies around the world would have a similar salutary effect in the United States.
D. Beginning to Grapple with Political Bias
These limited examples from inside the antitrust arena, and other areas of the law, provide a smorgasbord of options for beginning to think about how to deal with these issues in the antitrust context. The task is complicated by the presence of two separate but connected stages where these issues arise. The first is the general issue of prosecutorial discretion and how potential issues of bias should be handled by a district court once the Antitrust Division or FTC file a case. The second is the even more complicated issue of dealing with politically charged decisions not to proceed.
The first stage has the best existing framework for dealing with these sorts of issues. As discussed above, the combination of the vigorous application of FRCP 11 and the rules of professional responsibility provide two avenues for asserting that a politically motivated civil case was brought for an improper purpose. However, the existing mechanisms do not address the chicken and egg problem of how to document bad motives if denied discovery to the information that would verify the assertion of bias.
The decision to settle a matter has some procedural protections from this type of political influence. The Tunney Act requires a public interest showing before a settlement can be accepted by the court.61 However, the Microsoft litigation has made this requirement more of a formality by focusing on limiting the inquiry to matching the nature of the relief to the civil complaint actually filed, rather than the scope of the case that should have been filed or the reasons why the agency acted or refrained from acting.62
The issue of a decision not filed because of political considerations is one where US law is silent, but EU law provides a partial answer. There is no mechanism in current US law for judicial review of a decision not to proceed with a civil or criminal matter. In general, there is no ability to challenge an agency’s exercise of its discretion not to bring an action.63 This latitude is inherent in the tradition notion of agency discretion. Prosecutorial discretion remains the great unanswered question of administrative law.64
Civil antitrust cases are brought by two different entities: the FTC, bound by the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, which is not. In neither case is the agency obliged to disclose the reasons behind not bringing a case although from to time both do so on an occasional basis.65 Likewise, in neither case can affected parties challenge the decision not to proceed.
Asa far back as 1969, Professor Kenneth Culp Davis in his book Discretionary Justice challenged us to do better.
In prescient discussions of both the FTC and the Antitrust Division, he argued that:
“Apart from the guidelines program … the Antitrust Division can move toward greater clarification of its prosecution policies by announcing findings and reasons whenever it takes action of any kind that is based upon significant policy. When it prosecutes a case, when it decides not to prosecute, when it decides to dismiss or to nol pros, when it enters into a consent arrangement, and when it grants a clearance, it can and should state publicly the policy reasons for its actions, and the policy statements should be treated as precedents which normally will not be retroactively changed.”66
Not only did he include the FTC in proposing these important safeguards, he also highlighted the issue of inappropriate political influence as one of the main dangers requiring change.67
We can also strive for a system akin to that in place in the EU and similar administrative type systems in other jurisdictions. Any determination of the European Commission, whether to proceed or not to proceed with a matter, is an official decision requiring a statement of reasons and which can be challenged by an affected party.68 While the Commission’s decisions are granted substantial deference, they are not immune from judicial scrutiny.69 Adopting such an approach would institute such long needed reforms for both enforcement agencies and begin the process of dealing with this aspect of the potential political misuse of antitrust nonenforcement.
 
Conclusion
Antitrust has always been political in nature. How could it not be? It stems from broad legal commands dealing with how governments and private individuals can challenge different types of market behavior. Antitrust has reentered the political electoral arena, general mainstream media, and everyday discourse. Once mostly the domain of technocrats, antitrust issues have been proposed and debated by Presidential candidates, pundits, journalists, and voters alike. There are also a flurry of serious proposals and investigations that would make significant changes to the current system if adopted.
Part of that engagement has been the exploration of the potential political misuse of antitrust investigations and enforcement for political motivations and other types of animus and bias. The changing institutions and norms in the United States holding back authoritarian tendencies have begun to erode for antitrust enforcement and other aspects of law enforcement. There is real reason to be concerned that the enforcement agencies are consciously or unconsciously beginning to tailor aspects of their decision making to the stated, or perceived, political needs of the White House. Other areas of the law have been dealing with these issues far longer and provide potential solutions for consideration in the antitrust field. Regardless of which combination of tools we use to address these concerns, it is urgent that we start this discussion.

EU competition regulators are seeking information from 400 companies to establish if there are problems in the market for voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri and other internet-connected devices that could lead to antitrust cases. 
The European Commission has opened similar inquiries in the past into sectors such as e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, financial services and energy that led to cases against companies and eventually hefty fines.
Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Alphabet’s Google Assistant are among the most popular voice assistant devices. 
“It sends an important message to powerful operators in these market that we are watching them and that they need to do business in line with competition rules,” European Competition Commission Margrethe Vestager told a news conference.
The EU executive said its interest was prompted by the large amounts of user data involved in consumer “internet of things” devices and it wanted to make sure market players did not use their control of such data to hurt competition or thwart rivals. 
“Interoperability is of the essence if we want to make this market accessible,” Vestager said. 
Vestager, who can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules, has made the tech industry the centrepiece of her enforcement efforts, taking on Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook in recent years.

312,"July 14, 2020",Canadian Regulator Resolves Concerns With Elanco’s Bayer Deal,"


The Competition Bureau announced today that it has entered into a consent agreement with Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco) to address concerns related to the company’s proposed acquisition of Bayer Animal Health (BAH). Elanco has also committed to forego acquiring Bayer AG’s (Bayer) Canadian distribution rights to several poultry insecticides.
Following an extensive review, the Bureau concluded that Elanco and BAH are each other’s closest competitors in several Canadian markets, that there are few remaining effective competitors in these markets and that the proposed transaction would have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition. The relevant markets include those for low dose canine otitis treatments, feline dewormers with tapeworm coverage and poultry insecticides with darkling beetle coverage.
To remedy the Bureau’s concerns, the consent agreement requires Elanco to divest its canine otitis product, Osurnia, as well as BAH’s feline dewormer, Profender. The consent agreement also notes Elanco’s commitment to forego acquiring the Canadian distribution rights to Bayer’s Tempo, Credo, QuickBayt and Annihilator Polyzone poultry insecticides. Rather, Bayer’s CropScience division will retain these distribution rights. The consent agreement also prevents Elanco, without the Bureau’s approval, from acquiring Bayer’s retained poultry insecticides with darkling beetle coverage for a period of 10 years and from acquiring a significant interest in any poultry insecticides with darkling beetle coverage for a period of 2 years without providing advance notice to the Bureau and waiting a prescribed period of time to complete the acquisition.

EU antitrust regulators have again halted their investigation into world No. 1 shipbuilding group Hyundai Heavy Industries’ $1.8 billion merger with Daewoo, a European Commission filing showed, reported Reuters. 
This is the third time the EU competition enforcer has halted the probe, having done so previously while waiting for details and due to delays related to the coronavirus crisis. 
The Commission warned in December that the deal to create a company with a 21% market share could push up prices, saying that European shipping companies, among the two shipbuilders’ biggest customers, may be affected.

314,"July 13, 2020",Algorithms and Competition in a Digitalized World,"
Focusing in particular on the impact of algorithms, this essay demonstrates ways in which the peculiarities of the digital economy are reflected in the practice of the Bundeskartellamt (BKartA). In light of the increasing importance of algorithms, it elaborates on the BKartA’s practical experiences in this regard and points out conclusions drawn from past proceedings. These practical experiences are complemented by conceptual considerations on pricing algorithms and collusion as well as on potential interdependencies between algorithms and market power, which inform future enforcement. In view of the challenges posed by the implications of algorithms on competition, but also more broadly by the ongoing digital transformation, the essay finally points to the current discussions on adjusting the legal toolkit and highlights that digitalization, as a global phenomenon, calls for international collaboration and exchange.

I. TURNING DIGITAL
The global trend towards digitalization poses unique challenges for both competition policy and enforcement. Considering the digital economy in particular, many business models rely on positive network effects as customers often prefer services which many others use. The more a service is used – e.g. social networking websites – the more customers it attracts and the more attractive it becomes, potentially resulting in a winner-takes-all dynamic. A further important trait of many popular businesses in the d...

This article considers how algorithms affect competition and what their implications are for competition policy. With the economy going digital a huge number of great innovations have materialized. Consumers have greatly benefitted from these innovations. However, a number of antitrust issues have emerged. This article looks at both the consumer benefits as well as the antitrust issues. It examines whether algorithmic innovations raise any novel concerns competition law concerns.

I. INTRODUCTION
What do algorithms have to do with antitrust? Nothing intrinsically, but algorithms feed of data and data is an issue for antitrust enforcers. The ability of a firm to collect extremely large amounts of data and process them through sophisticated algorithms to reveal patterns, trends and associations (collectively known as “big data”) adds a new dimension to market power, which ought to be of interests to competition authorities. Having a data advantage can lead to great innovations, but it can also create huge concentrations in certain markets. Data can affect entry conditions by making it more or less difficult for a firm to enter or compete, in particular for firms needing data as an input in order to compete in a specific market.  There is a belief that simple algorithms with lots of data outperform sophisticated algorithms with little data partly because of the opportunity for algorithms to learn through trial and error.2 According ...

316,"July 13, 2020",Algorithmic Collusion: A Real Problem for Competition Policy?,"
By Emilio Calvano, Giacomo Calzolari, Vincenzo Denicolò & Sergio Pastorello
Recently, antitrust authorities started to worry about the possible consequences of algorithmic pricing. Indeed, we document that pricing algorithms are already widely used and argue that they are likely to become even more prevalent in the future. In particular, authorities worry about data-driven price discrimination and algorithmic collusion. We focus on the latter. It is the contention of this article that algorithmic collusion is a real risk, the seriousness of which is still difficult to assess, but that should not be dismissed lightly by antitrust agencies. First, we discuss various ways in which algorithms may facilitate collusion without creating any genuinely new antitrust issue. Second, we argue that pricing algorithms may learn to collude “autonomously” and without explicitly communicating with one another. In light of this evidence, we discuss the specific new policy challenges that this kind of algorithmic collusion poses.

317,"July 13, 2020",Algorithms in Contemporary EU Competition Enforcement: Evolution Before Revolution?,"
Algorithms perform a variety of functions within digital ecosystems, many of which have the potential to impact the effective operation of competition in these spaces. Although certain market problems that involve the use of algorithms may take us to the frontiers of contemporary competition law, competition enforcers have already had occasion to grapple with the practical implications of their widespread use in various contexts. This article considers what might be termed the more mundane side of competition enforcement in algorithm-heavy environments, considering areas where algorithm-driven concerns have been accommodated within the established EU competition rules, or at least, have required mere evolution rather than revolution in their application.

I. INTRODUCTION
That the use of algorithms is pervasive across the digital economy is something of a trite observation. Algorithms perform a broad variety of functions within digital ecosystems, many of which have the potential to impact upon — whether for good or bad — the effective operation of competition in these spaces. It is equally trite, if not untrue, to portray algorithms as presenting unique challenges for competition enforcement, in part due to the mystery that shrouds what is often complex proprietary technology, in part to fears that such technology may sooner or later develop an (anticompetitive) mind of its own. Yet, even if certain market problems that involve the use of algo...

319,"July 8, 2020",Break up Denny’s,"

By John D. Harkrider (Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP)*
       
Over the last six decades,1 millions of hungry Americans have pulled off the side of the highway, walked past a glowing yellow sign, slipped into a red leatherette booth — frequently after midnight — and stuck their forks into a Grand Slam breakfast.  Indeed, Denny’s serves more than 12 million Grand Slam breakfasts a year, including more than 2 million after a Super Bowl promotion that promised free breakfasts between 6am and 2pm the Tuesday after the game.2  The next year they did it again with similar success.  Likely fearing bankruptcy, they decided to stop the promotion.3
Denny’s has an interesting history.  The company was founded in 1953 in Lakewood California as Danny’s Donuts.  It quickly changed its name to Denny’s in order to avoid confusion with the Los Angeles restaurant Coffee Dan’s.4  Denny’s signature Grand Slam breakfast, which consists of eggs, sausage, bacon, and pancakes, was introduced in 1977 by its Atlanta restaurants in honor of Hammerin’ Hank Aaron, who had broken Babe Ruth’s home run record at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.5
Denny’s is profitable, with revenue of more than $500 million, operating income of $165 million, and a healthy EBITA of $97 million.6  But it is hardly a monopolist.  In fact, Denny’s has a market share of under 5 percent of franchise Table/Full Service Restaurant sales, competing with the likes of Applebee’s, Chili’s, Olive Garden, Cracker Barrel, Cheesecake Factory, and Waffle House.7
So why break up Denny’s? It is not because they bundle eggs, sausage, bacon, and pancakes together, it is not because they force franchisees to purchase goods from them as a condition of their franchise agreements, it is because they do these things and have a Return on Capital Employed (”ROCE”) of 55 percent,8 well above alleged Google’s 40 percent return that both the UK’s CMA, Fiona Scott Morton, and David Dinielli (Scott Morton & Dinielli) have argued demonstrates the existence of market power.9
If the CMA and Scott Morton & Dinielli are correct that a ROCE of over 40 percent demonstrates the exploitation of market power and justifies the breaking up of Google, so too it must justify the breakup of the feared monopolist Denny’s.
 
Using Profitability as Evidence of Market Power under American Law
In both its Interim and Final Report on Digital Advertising, the CMA argues that the fact that a firm has a ROCE above its cost of capital for a significant amount of time is evidence of market power.
In that context, the CMA argues that, “[w]e have found through our profitability analysis that the return on capital employed. . .[is] at least 40% for Google search.”10  Given that Google’s cost of capital was about 9 percent, the CMA concluded that “[t]his evidence is consistent with the exploitation of market power.”11  Scott Morton & Dinielli cite this conclusion as evidence that Google earns a “supra-competitive price for the services provided by the Google-controlled players in the ad tech stack,”12 ignoring, of course, that the CMA said nothing about Google’s ROCE in ad-tech or display advertising.
Most antitrust lawyers are unfamiliar with the term ROCE (return on capital employed).  It has never been used by a court in any reported decision as sufficient evidence of market power.
But plaintiffs have tried to introduce profitability as a metric of market power in American courts, only to be repeatedly turned down.  As the Seventh Circuit stated in Blue Shield United of Wis. v. Marshfield Clinic, “not only do measured rates of return reflect accounting conventions more than they do real profits (or losses). . .but there is not even a good economic theory that associates monopoly power with a high rate of return.”13  Another court noted: “The court is unaware of any reported federal antitrust case in which a defendant’s purported high rate of return, by itself, established market power.”14 And yet another court held that “citing accounting profits without more is unsatisfactory proof of monopoly profits, and in turn of monopoly power.”15
This is in accord with commentators like Areeda & Turner who note that “real economic returns on capital are difficult to measure and the proper methods of measuring economic profits are much disputed.”16
Indeed, Frank Fisher & John McGowan wrote a seminal article in 1983 On the Misuse of Accounting Rates of Return to Infer Monopoly Profits in the American Economic Review.17 As the authors explain, “accounting rates of return, even if properly and consistently measured, provide almost no information about economic rates of return,” which the authors define as “that discount rate that equates the present value of its expected net revenue stream to its initial outlay.”18  This is because “only by accident will accounting rates of return be in one-to-one correspondence with economic rates of return,” and “a ranking of firms by accounting rates of return can easily invert a ranking by economic rates of return.”19
Another useful peer-reviewed article is Profitability Tests in Competition Law and Ex Ante Regulation by Phillipa Marks & Brian Williamson.20  The authors conclude that ROCE is an improper metric for competition analysis, “for both conceptual and practical” reasons.
Further, Grout (2001) examined the history of cases reviewed by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission (“MMC”) (a predecessor to the UK Competition and Markets Authority) under the UK Fair Trading Act.  This analysis found that, “[a]verage rate of return on capital employed has been 44%, with an average of 45% for cases where there was an adverse finding and 41% for those where there was no adverse finding.  Looking at cases where the primary concern was potential monopoly pricing the figures are 61%, 67% and 48% respectively.  For cases where the primary concern was abuse of vertical integration the figures are 52%, 54% and 51%.”21
Significantly, Grout found that “across all cases there is no statistical relationship between profitability and the Commission’s finding.”22  This casts real doubt on ROCE’s usefulness as a metric for determining whether a firm has market power.  But even if ROCE were a reliable proxy of market power — which it isn’t — Google’s alleged 40 percent ROCE, as alleged by the CMA, is below the level historically found by UK Competition regulators in monopolization cases.
 
Regulating Google as a Utility
While ROCE has been questioned as a proxy for market power in antitrust analysis, it is a commonly used statistic in regulated industries, most specifically in utilities regulation. For example, under Texas regulation, when establishing a utility’s rate, the Public Utility Commission of Texas is required to set a rate that would allow “the utility a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on the utility’s invested capital used.”23   See also 49 U.S.C.A. § 10704 (the Surface Transportation Board should set a price that allows for “a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business”).
Imposing a cap on appropriate profitability creates perverse incentives for firms. Consider a firm that has a 39 percent ROCE who is considering two possible investments:  one has an uncertain return that if it succeeds would bring tremendous benefits to consumers, the second has a certain return that consumers regard with some level of indifference.  Imagine that if the first succeeds, it brings ROCE over 41 percent, thus exposing the firm to ex post regulation as a monopolist.  But if it doesn’t succeed, then it brings ROCE to well under 40 percent.  Imagine that if the second succeeds, it does not impact ROCE at all.  Under a regulatory regime that penalizes achieving a ROCE above 40 percent, the second is preferable because it has less execution risk, and does not create the risk of the firm being declared a monopolist.  But this result sacrifices the possibility of tremendous benefits to consumers and interferes with a company’s normal business calculus of whether to engage in welfare enhancing endeavors.  And if there is no disproportionate return for a successful investment that balances the cost of an unsuccessful one, then there is no incentive to make big bets on future innovation.
As Dennis Carlton noted, “Capping prices (and hence returns on investments) will, among other drawbacks, generally deter risky but economically desirable investments. This is hardly a prescription for innovation and economic growth. . .The more the law limits a firm’s anticipated profit from bringing a product successfully to market, the lower the incentive to do so in the first place.”24
This points to the real problem with using profitability as a rationale for antitrust enforcement, namely, that its true aim is to turn Google into a regulated utility.  That suggestion may sound farcical to the millions of people who detest the slow, plodding, and expensive public utilities that serve them gas, electricity, cable, and landline phones, and love the fast, innovative, free, and constantly improving services of Google.  But sad to say, it is the very objective of many of Google’s adversaries, who are themselves utilities.  In a House Judiciary hearing involving Google, Congressman Steve King stated: “And one of the discussions that I’m hearing is ‘what about converting the large behemoth organizations that we’re talking about here [e.g. Google] into public utilities.”25
Do we really think it’s a good idea to turn Google into a public utility?  Anybody who has waited days for the cable, telephone, or power company to respond to a service complaint knows firsthand that utilities are routinely slow to respond to consumer demand.  For example, Comcast has regularly showed up last in the “customer service hall of shame.”26  More than 1 in 4 surveyed customers rate Comcast service as “poor.”27 One survey ranked Comcast as America’s most hated company.28  The fiber-optic television business of AT&T is also one of the lowest ranked companies in customer service, with reports of “inadequate call centers” and “providing customers with a window of time for home visits” that “often forces them to take time off work” due to the long windows.29
Do we really believe that the best way to level the playing field is to have it take just as long for Google to answer a search query as it takes for Verizon to send a technician to fix your phone line?  Consider that according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Google is one of the most loved companies in the world.  They are innovative and responsive to consumer demand.  They invest billions of dollars to improve search and make ads increasingly relevant.
2019 American Customer Satisfaction Index30
As a public utility, Google would have had little incentive to innovate beyond the two or three seconds it took to return a search years ago.  But instead, as a private company with the ability and incentive to make free-market business decisions, it invested billions of dollars to return searches in milliseconds.
The reason utilities are disliked is because they have less incentive than non-utilities to improve service or transform their business models, indeed, their upside is limited.  They try to squelch disruptive business models rather than develop them.
But of course that is what critics of Google such as Comcast and AT&T actually want.  Because it is easier for them to bring Google’s level of investment, innovation, and service down to their level than for them to rise to Google’s.
This is the teaching of the economics literature on regulatory capture and public choice.  This literature also explains that, in general, the threat to competition posed by lobbying attempts to enact public restraints to raise rivals’ costs and harm competition are more pernicious than their private sector counterparts (i.e. private ordering) or reliance on existing and more flexible laws (like antitrust). This is because this form of rent-seeking does not have offsetting procompetitive virtues, and regulations that distort (or even destroy) competition are more insulated from market forces that would otherwise protect consumers.31
 
A Request for Analytical Rigor
If having a ROCE over a cost of capital of 9 percent is evidence of market power, then Google has a lot of company.  Indeed, according to YCharts, more than 3,500 equities have a ROCE over 9 percent.  These companies include Domino’s Pizza with a ROCE of 87 percent and Yum Brands with a ROCE of 57 percent.
One might quickly observe that Denny’s, Domino’s, and Yum Brands have something in common other than the quality of their food.  They are all franchises and as a result do not put up significant capital for their business.  Thus, it makes sense that these companies would have low costs of capital and high returns.  But that does not make them monopolists.
But if ROCE isn’t a one size fits all metric of market power, then why do we think that it indicates that Google has market power?  And if it doesn’t, why use it at all?
Indeed, one of the fundamental tenets of the scientific method is that tests be disprovable. If the hypothesis that ROCE is an indicia of market power, then one could look through all 3,500 equities with a ROCE over their cost of capital, and determine whether it is, in fact, a statistically significant relationship between ROCE and market power.  If there is, great.  If not, stop using it.
 
Funny Math
Taking a step back, it is striking that the case against Google completely lacks the rigor of a typical antitrust case.  How is Google expected to dominate the digital advertising market where it faces strong and growing rivals in Facebook and Amazon?

 32
Indeed, according to the CMA, “Facebook (including Instagram) is by far the largest supplier of display advertising, accounting for more than half of display advertising expenditure.”33  How can Google be a monopolist if there is another firm that has a larger market share?  There is no offense for shared monopoly, at least not in the United States.
The idea that YouTube has market power is also based upon funny math.  Scott Morton & Dinielli claim that YouTube’s market share in display is “up to 10%,” and that Facebook and Instagram have much higher shares of digital video than YouTube.34  But then they argue that YouTube does not compete with Facebook,35 which means that an advertiser such as Ford would not advertise on Facebook or Instagram instead of YouTube.  Maybe that’s true.  Maybe.
Scott Morton & Dinielli’s argument is that ads on user generated videos on YouTube are more similar to ads on feature movies and network television shows on Hulu than they are to ads on user generated videos on Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram.  If this statement were true, it would need to be supported by actual empirical evidence, estimated cross-elasticity of demand, not just a bald assertion of fact.
 
Why are We Ignoring these Statistics?
If we are to use obscure statistics such as ROCE as evidence of market power, should we not also consider the following statistics as well?
What about the fact that Google takes a lower share of publisher revenue than its rivals?  Contrary to the exaggerated claims of some alleging Google’s fees account for 70 percent of ad spend,36 Google in reality charges a combined 31 percent,37 which is lower than CMA’s industry wide estimates of 35 percent.38 According to the CMA, Google’s product specific fees are “comparable” or “similar” to its competitors’ fees.39  Further, the CMA Final Report found that the evidence that they reviewed “does not indicate that Google is currently extracting significant hidden fees.”40  If higher prices are consistent with the existence of market power, as Scott Morton & Dinielli argue, then lower (non predatory) prices are consistent with its absence.
Or consider Scott Morton & Dinielli’s allegation that Google has an “insurmountable data advantage.”41  But how is this consistent with the observation that Google’s share of online advertising spend is shrinking, while Facebook’s and Amazon’s are growing?  If Google has such a large data advantage, an advantage that nobody in the world will ever be able to match, then shouldn’t it follow that all advertisers would flock to Google and spurn data-poor Facebook and Amazon?  And yet, all have substantially higher growth rates than Google.42
Or take the fact that Scott Morton & Dinielli misleadingly claim that “Google pays no ‘traffic acquisition costs’ because it needn’t pay any publisher for access to the ‘eyeballs’ that will see or interact with the ads it helps place.”43  YouTube has disclosed that it pays over 50 percent of its revenue to creators.44  With revenue of over $15 billion, this would imply an estimated $8 billion paid to creators.45  In contrast, much of Instagram and Facebook’s inventory generates no payments to content creators; for example, Instagram recently offered partners, but only 200, the ability to monetize via IGTV.46  Seems odd for a firm with market power to distribute its rents for no good reason.
So let’s get the argument straight.  Google — a company that is beloved by consumers — charges less than rivals, returns billions to consumers, and is growing slower than Facebook and Amazon is a monopolist.  Or at least so say the utilities who are detested by their customers and haven’t had a game changing innovation in decades.
 
Conclusion
While the title of this article is intended in jest, a rumored antitrust case against Google is not, and neither is the damage to our faith in competition law caused by the use of funny math put forward by firms who would rather use the political process to regulate rivals rather than invest in innovations to beat them.
Antitrust is an incredibly important tool for modern economies — it is one of the most important differentiators between advanced growing economies and corrupt kleptocracies.  As Dr. Santiago Levy Algazi has noted, rigorous competition policy “can make the difference between ‘crony capitalism’ and healthy institutions and markets.”47
Indeed, experience has taught us that robust and undistorted competition produces substantial benefits for consumers and society as a whole by promoting growth, spurring innovation, and facilitating the efficient allocation of resources. It has also taught us that competition law and policy is most effective when it focuses exclusively upon competition and consumer welfare rather than attempting to achieve simultaneous goals, some of which may be in conflict with others.
The truth is that when the government is asked to balance competing interests, it must make choices as to the relative importance of various constituencies and interests.  This balance is discretionary and inherently a political calculation and therefore is ripe for political interference.  As a result, we are all better off when the singular objective is consumer welfare as measured by product quality and price, as evidenced by careful and rigorous econometric analysis, internal documents, and deposition testimony.
But that’s not what we see here.  We see an investigation in which guilt is assumed instead of proven.  We see an investigation used for fundraising purposes.48  We see dominant incumbents seek to restrain the investments and product innovations of disruptive companies.  And we see the use of statistics that would seem to direct the conclusion that we should break up Denny’s before they gobble up the world.

321,"July 7, 2020",The New Antitrust Revolution,"

By Kayvan Hazemi-Jebelli (Computer & Communications Industry Association)1
 
You may not have noticed, but there’s a new antitrust revolution brewing in Europe. In February, the European Commission formally announced its intention to update competition rules to ensure that markets where large technology companies are present remain “fair and contestable.” I must confess that I assumed this meant accelerating the Commission’s ongoing revision to decades old guidance on assessing market power, or the safe-harbor rules for vertical and horizontal agreements, or perhaps that the Commission would facilitate strict enforcement of the recent, but still yet to apply, Platform-to-Business Regulation.2 I was wrong. In June the Commission revealed what it meant, with three major antitrust “pillars” towards fairness and contestability:

Vigorous enforcement of existing competition laws;
Ex ante regulation of digital platforms; and
A new market investigation tool with the power to impose structural and behavioral remedies absent any finding of competition infringement.

One might call such far-reaching proposals ambitious reforms. But a critical look under the hood suggests a return to form-based antitrust presumptions; a counter-revolution to 50 years of jurisprudence focused on consumer welfare, economic effects, and causality.
  
Vigorous (Burden-Shifted) Enforcement
Vigorous, a-political, objective, and evidence-based antitrust enforcement is good, and should remain the standard that each jurisdiction expects from its global trade partners. It’s what we’ve worked decades to achieve and what we push for in international trade agreements. But the European Union has been criticized for sometimes putting the interests of its businesses ahead of consumers. At the ABA Spring Meeting this year, which had to be delivered virtually due to the COVID-19 crisis, many astute ears justifiably pricked up during the enforcer panel with European Commission Executive Vice President for “A Europe Fit for the Digital Age,” Margrethe Vestager. She stressed that investigators shouldn’t face excessive hurdles to proving their cases. Rather, they should be able to rely on presumptions that certain kinds of behavior were likely to harm competition. It’s not the first time the Commission has advocated for shifting the burden of proof. Presumptions and burden shifting can promote sound judicial and administrative efficiency, if supported by economic theory and a history of enforcement experience confirming the pernicious effects of the underlying conduct. But as some have pointed out, where the existing burden of proof is on the Commission to show only a capability of anticompetitive effect, is such burden shifting efficient?
More likely, it would be counter-productive, chilling competition by presuming consumer harm for a range of ostensibly procompetitive conduct. The Commission’s self-preferencing case against Google’s shopping comparison service is the most prominent example. In that case, the Commission condemned Google’s decision to improve product search results by drawing from its own quality-controlled product comparison database instead of from competitors’ unknown, inaccessible and unverifiable databases. For any product developer, Google’s decision would seem eminently more reliable, consistent and straightforward. Or, as the Commission itself once said “a company’s production of its own requirements is not in itself an abnormal act of competition.”3 When closing its related investigation, the FTC warned that “[p]roduct design is an important dimension of competition and condemning legitimate product improvements risks harming consumers.”4 The Commission nevertheless found Google’s conduct discriminatory, and imposed an eye-watering multi-billion euro fine. This has led to a series of follow-on damage claims, even though an appeal of the Commission decision is pending at the European Court of Justice,5 and despite courts in the UK and Germany having already rejected similar claims on similar facts. One might think it too early for a broad presumption of  consumer harm under the “self-preferencing” banner, particularly where it encroaches on legitimate product design choices. One might consider that opening up such conduct to antitrust liability would chill procompetitive conduct and reduce consumer welfare. But this chilling effect is just one aspect of this drift towards “fairness and contestability.”
  
Ex Ante Regulation (of Bigness)?
The second pillar of the new antitrust revolution is a new ex ante market regulation for “very large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.”  Unsurprisingly, the Inception Impact Assessment (“IIA”) launching the consultation states as one policy option an outright prohibition on self-preferencing, citing it as an example of conduct that is “potentially market-distorting or entrenching economic power of the large online platforms.” But confirming the Commission’s existing posture is not as revolutionary as what appears to be a new policy objective to limit bigness.
The IIA identifies particular obstacles facing its overarching policy objective to “increase the innovation potential and capacity across the online platform ecosystems in the EU’s single market.” In particular, it aims to tackle market dynamics that “reduce the social gain from innovation,” pointing to the variety of ecosystem services, platforms operators’ resources and scale, and their ability to enter adjacent markets as factors that are “keeping innovative market operators from expanding or entering the market in the first place.” The IIA notes that “Europe’s estimated 10 000 online platforms are potentially hampered in scaling broadly and thereby contributing to the EU’s technological sovereignty, as they are increasingly faced with incontestable online platform ecosystems.”
The IIA states that increasing the “contestability” of online platform ecosystems “would have a positive impact on innovation and research, technological development and growth of the digital economy.” It is based on an assumption that increasing “contestability” would mean better outcomes for consumers. But an overbroad interpretation of “contestability,” i.e. limitations on ecosystem growth, would more likely have a negative impact on the innovation, research, technological development, and digital economy growth that the Commission seeks to support. As discussed further below, this is because (a) large digital ecosystems drive aggregate demand upon which adjacent innovations can flourish; (b) their size contributes positively to the impact of innovation; and (c) their size is inherent to their innovation producing business models.
First, large digital ecosystems have driven the growth of the digital economy. Network effects happen because consumers and/or businesses prefer to be on platforms that other consumers or businesses are using. In the digital environment, where choices are abundant, consumers often prefer convenience, consistency, and a one-stop-shop experience. These efficiencies lower transaction costs, increase consumer welfare, and drive overall technological adoption. In the words of one well-known technologist, “it just works,” and it’s this intense focus on user experience and customer satisfaction that has dramatically increased adoption of new technology around the world. As the CMA’s recent market study acknowledged, “[i]Integration of a wide range of products and services can deliver efficiency savings and can also improve the consumer experience overall, by increasing the ease with which a range of different services are accessed.”6 A digital ecosystem that offers reliable solutions to a variety of user needs, that does a number of jobs conveniently and well, will often be more important to the marginal user considering a digital alternative than the “social gain” of having to navigate through a swamp of “innovative alternatives” as foreseen by the IIA. That’s why attempts to fragment these ecosystems are likely counterproductive, a result of overlooking the value that broad digital ecosystems provide to their users, and their contribution to the overall growth of the technology industry.
Second, larger platform ecosystems make it easier for innovators to reach massive scale, to the benefit of consumers. According to Apple, the App Store ecosystem supported $519 billion in billings and sales globally in 2019 alone. That’s a lot of opportunity for innovators. Network effects mean not only that users benefit from the size of a network, but also that innovations are more quickly disseminated throughout that ecosystem. New tools, features, and functionalities, new solutions to existing problems, spread more quickly through large ecosystems than fragmented ones.
Lastly, digital intermediaries often need size. Even if in specific cases increasing “contestability” were to increase investment incentives on the edges, it could also dramatically reduce the investment incentives of the platforms and their competitors. That’s because the business model of large digital intermediaries, particularly those based on software, is premised on significant up-front capital costs, very low marginal costs, and massive scale. Start-ups and SMEs in this sector often operate at a loss while attempting to achieve sufficient scale to become profitable. Sometimes that scale comes from expanding into adjacent markets. And allowing this has led to massive innovation in a very short period of time. According to the Commission’s own estimates, the five largest “gatekeeper platforms” (Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook), spent a combined €72.8 billion in R&D in 2018, nearly twice the amount spent by the entire EU ICT sector (approx. €42 billion).7 These companies are competing to create revolutionary new technologies and push the boundaries of innovation in computing devices, entertainment, mobility, productivity tools, the retail experience, and more. Efforts aimed at increasing ecosystem contestability that would result in reducing potential scale or scope (or increasing marginal costs) could make such ventures terminally unprofitable. This would ultimately result in less up-front investment, less technological development, and less growth for the digital economy.
The Commission’s apparent suspicion of bigness and market structure signals a departure from the existing antitrust framework. As Furman Inquiry Panel member, and antitrust rapper, Philip Marsden has said “the way forward is not by making non-evidence based decisions condemning market structures.” But it is this very suspicion of the efficiencies of scale and scope that lies at the heart of the Commission’s ex ante proposals. In this context, the Commission’s desire for “contestability” could risk much of what has gone right with the existing competition framework. One can legitimately wonder whether the proliferation of technological innovation that surrounds us would be as prevalent under a system that prioritized “social innovation” or “contestability.”
  
Ex Ante-Ante Intervention (or, the “New Competition Tool (‘NCT’)”)
The third pillar of the new antitrust revolution is a new market investigation tool to address “certain structural risks for competition” with a particular emphasis on markets with network, scale, and data effects (e.g. technology markets). However, the NCT consultation identifies several “structural competition problems” which do not, under the traditional framework, appear to be competition problems at all. In particular:

“Tipping markets” are not problematic. Many investments are made in start-ups on the basis that they can be recovered once sufficient scale is achieved. The characteristic of “tipping” is itself related to the increased value that users derive from the network effects. Where such characteristics are present, preventing tipping would mean worse outcomes for consumers.
“Leveraging” into adjacent markets is not inherently problematic. Where a firm has transferable skills and resources, leveraging those for market entry leads to increased efficient competition in those adjacent markets and hence better outcomes for users. The Commission offers no distinction between procompetitive and anticompetitive leveraging.
“High entry barriers” are a characteristic common to several industries and are not inherently problematic unless a competitor with a superior business model or product cannot contest an incumbent, or when the threat of such entry is insufficient pressure to ensure efficient market outcomes.

By raising these three as “structural” concerns, the Commission again appears to presume anticompetitive effects from conduct or market circumstances that would normally be part of a case-by-case assessment and require some showing of causality. Under the traditional competition assessment, unilateral conduct by non-dominant undertakings is unlikely to be problematic by definition. This is because a company that has the ability to harm competition is likely dominant, and a company that is not dominant is unlikely to have the market power sufficient to unilaterally cause an anticompetitive effect on the market. Also, the concept of dominance is flexible, and increasingly applied to narrow market segments such that most firms can be found dominant where their anticompetitive conduct is liable to harm competition. The on-going revision to the pre-Google Market Definition Notice will no doubt help in this respect. So why go after non-dominant companies specifically?
The basis for this new intervention power not only presumes that certain unilateral conduct can cause harm (as in the ex ante tool), but it makes a further presumption that such conduct would cause harm even absent market power. This form of treatment has usually been reserved only to the most “hardcore” categories of restraints. So, not only does the Commission make an ex ante assessment of the conduct and presume harm, but it would make a further ex ante assessment of future impact, presuming a future effect. Such broad discretionary power to impose structural and behavioral remedies on speculative future oriented presumptions signals a revolutionary return to form-based antitrust enforcement over economic assessment and causality. That is of course, if legal certainty is to be expected. The alternative would be the Commission picking winners and losers via speculative predictions of future harm.
  
Concluding Remarks
The Commission’s shift to a new “fair and contestable” paradigm is as yet undefined. The substance of the Commission’s proposals, and the nature of the presumptions incorporated therein, suggest a shift away from the existing international and multilateral framework focused on economic efficiency and an evidence-based assessment of causality, towards one more focused on market structure, on “fairness,” “choice,” and “contestability,” and the Commission’s predictions as to the future. This revolution certainly appears to be aligned with the push from certain Member States who advocate for a competition policy facilitating the creation of “European Champions.” After all, who will benefit when bigness is punished on the grounds of supporting “innovative alternatives”?
Of course, there’s no need to be overly alarmed by the possibility of this new antitrust revolution. We are still in the early stages of an open consultation and the Commission is meeting with industry representatives and considering their views alongside the enforcement experience of the Commission and national competition authorities, “findings and proposals from the worldwide reflection process on the need to amend the competition law framework” including “dozens of recent reports on platform power by regulators as well as by academic experts,” advice from DG COMP’s Economic Advisory Group on Competition Policy, consumer associations, the EU’s Platform Observatory and related work on platform regulation, and additional research papers commissioned by the EC “concerning the economic power of large online platforms.” The Commission will weigh all the available evidence and at the end of summer, once the consultation period closes, quickly have to finish its proposals to complete the intra-Commission review and approval, before formally proposing it in Q4 2020. Those who are concerned by the more revolutionary aspects of the Commission’s proposals will have their opportunity to speak, though there are clear political winds pushing the Commission to “do something” and only limited time for experts to engage in the debate before the main window of opportunity closes.. Ultimately, we will have to wait and see how much the Commission’s proposals will be able to preserve the more economic approach, and thereby competitive incentives and efficiencies of scale and scope.
To the extent that policy makers intend to preserve innovation and consumer welfare as policy objectives, they will need to hear the nuance, and reflect on their presumptions. Technology advocates will do our best to convey these points in the time allowed, because we all benefit from a system that rewards efficiency, investment, and vigorous competition.

Austrian sensor producer AMS on Monday, July 6, gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its €4.6 billion (US$5.2 billion) acquisition of German lighting group Osram in its biggest ever deal. 
The European Commission stated the deal would not significantly reduce head-to-head competition between the companies in the markets for optical semiconductors because of the companies’ low-to-moderate market share and other rivals in the industry.
The EU competition enforcer said fast product turnover and sophisticated buyers meant the companies do not exert significant market power, confirming a Reuters report on June 26.
It stated the combined entity would not control enough of the market to restrict rivals’ access to essential inputs. 
AMS supplies Apple with sensors for its iPhones and the Osram acquisition will also help it reduce its dependence on the US firm, its biggest customer.

By Ravi Agrawal, Foreign Policy
Antitrust regulators are rarely well known outside of trade lobbies and industry circles. Not so Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, who may be the world’s most famous corporate umpire. The European Union’s competition commissioner, who began an unprecedented second term last November, is something of a global celebrity: She’s a sought-after speaker, a female icon, and the person seen as most likely to rein in the unfettered dominance of the world’s biggest technology firms.
Vestager has made news with the huge fines for anti-competitive behavior she has leveled at companies such as Google and Apple. But those punitive measures were limited to Vestager’s jurisdiction—the common European market—and represent only minor stumbles for the world’s most powerful corporations. That’s why Vestager is redoubling her efforts and hoping other countries will follow her lead.
Foreign Policy’s Ravi Agrawal recently spoke with the Brussels-based Vestager about the future of regulation and competition in technology—and how the pandemic may have the strange effect of boosting her mission.

 Microsoft has expressed interest in buying Warner Bros’ gaming unit, The Information reported on Monday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Warner Bros parent AT&T was discussing a sale of its Interactive Entertainment gaming division that owns popular videogame “Mortal Kombat” for a deal that could be worth about $4 billion, CNBC reported last month. However, Warner Bros. parent company AT&T has yet to decide whether it will sell the business, but is weighing the possibility in order to pay down its $154 billion in debt, The Information said. Investment bank LionTree is reportedly helping AT&T field interested parties, but no deal is currently imminent.
An acquisition of the business, which consists of game development studios scattered around the US, Canada and the UK, would help Microsoft expand the game-making capabilities of its Xbox group. But Warner’s parent, AT&T, hasn’t yet decided whether to sell the business. It is weighing the possibility as it looks at ways of paying down its $154 billion in debt, which stems partly from its 2018 acquisition of Time Warner, now known as WarnerMedia.

Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s digital-policy and antitrust czar, detailed for the first time a comprehensive plan of how she aims to rein in U.S. tech giants, using a package of initiatives that the EU has begun to outline individually in recent weeks. The aim is to clearly delineate new legal boundaries for tech companies, rather than just apply existing laws covering fields such as antitrust regulation.
“It’s a full complex of things. It’s not done with just one piece of legislation,” Ms. Vestager said in an interview with a small group of reporters. Ms. Vestagerwho in her prior term as European competition commissioner leveled record fines on Google and orderedApple to pay Ireland $14.5 billion in allegedly unpaid taxes, last year was promoted to vice president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, in charge of competition and new legislation for the digital sector.
“After the first mandate and the first specific competition cases, what I have seen very clearly is that we need rigorous competition-law enforcement, but we also need regulation,” she said.
Tech companies have said that they want to work with the commission to craft the new laws, but several have raised concerns about elements of the proposals. Representatives for Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, asked about the commission’s new approach, either didn’t respond, declined to comment or referred to earlier replies on the individual EU proposals.

327,"July 5, 2020",Portugal Issues Statements Of Objections To Six Supermarkets & Two Drink Suppliers For Price Fixing,"
The AdC – Portuguese Competition Authority issued Statements of Objections to 6 large food retail chain groups and 2 suppliers, one of non-alcoholic beverages and juices and the other one of wine and alcoholic drinks, for price fixing, a serious infringement of Competition Law.
The investigation conducted by the AdC revealed that Modelo Continente, Pingo Doce and Auchan used their commercial relationship with Sumol+Compal and Sogrape to align  the retail prices of most of the latter’s products, to the detriment of consumers.
In the case of non-alcoholic beverages and juices, the Statement of Objections also targets the Lidl distribution chain, while in the case of alcoholic drinks, the Intermarché and E-Leclerc chains are also involved. All the retailers concerned represent a large percentage of the distribution market in Portugal.
The Statements of Objections also includes two board members and two directors, one from each of the suppliers, Sumol+Compal and Sogrape.
If confirmed, the conduct in question is very serious. This is a new case of “hub-and-spoke”, a practice in which the large retail chains do not communicate directly with each other, but use bilateral contacts with the supplier to promote or guarantee through the latter that they all practice the same retail price in the market.

328,"July 5, 2020",When Code is Law: Bargains Between News Publishers and Platforms,"
By Rob Nicholls*
 
I. Introduction
In July 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) published the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry.1 In that report, the ACCC made two findings of a substantial degree of power. It considers that Facebook has substantial market power in the supply of display advertising and that Google has substantial market power in the supply of both general search services and search advertising services as well as substantial bargaining power in its dealings with news media businesses in Australia.2 Under section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), a business with a substantial degree of power in a market is not allowed to engage in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.
The ACCC has not found that there has been misuse of market power. However, it expressed concern about market structure and bargaining power imbalances in some of the 23 recommendations made in the Digital Platforms Inquiry report. These included wide-ranging reforms to consumer protection and privacy laws. In December 2019, the government supported six of these recommendations in their entirety and ten “in principle” (with plans for further reviews). It “noted” five others and rejected two.3
One of the six supported recommendations was to:
The Government will address bargaining imbalances between digital platforms and news media businesses by asking the ACCC to work with the relevant parties to develop and implement a voluntary code to address these concerns. The ACCC will provide a progress report to Government on code negotiations in May 2020, with codes to be finalised no later than November 2020. Any code will be considered binding on the parties who elect to sign up to it. If an agreement is not forthcoming, the Government will develop alternative options to address the concerns raised in the report and this may include the creation of a mandatory code. 
After the ACCC had conducted initial meetings with Facebook and Google, it reported back to the Australian Government. As a result, on 20 April 2020, the ACCC was directed to develop a mandatory code of conduct.4 The direction included the requirement that the:
draft mandatory code will be released for consultation by the ACCC before the end of July, with a final code to be settled soon thereafter.5
On May 19, 2020, the ACCC released a Concepts Paper seeking views on each of the issues to be covered in a mandatory code to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media business and each of Google and Facebook. There was an unusually short time allowed for responses and they were due by June 5, 2020.6
This article considers the nature of the value relationship between news publishers and platforms. It provides a context for industry codes and analyses the platform position in respect of that value relationship. It also notes the likely next code on “fake news.”
 
II. The Value Arguments
One of the issues that is most difficult in dealing with this is defining “news.” Indeed, it is considered by the ACCC to be a threshold issue which is why it’s question number one in the Consultation Paper. One of the important concepts that drives this is a definition of “Public Interest Journalism:”7
journalism with the primary purpose of recording comma investigating and explaining issues of public significance in order to engage citizens in public debate and informed democratic decision making at all levels of government. 
The challenge for the ACCC is that although this is a useful definition it does not address where there is an imbalance of bargaining power between, on the one side Google and Facebook and on the other side news media businesses. This leads to an issue as to how content of news can be readily identified for the purpose of any code. It brings up the usual challenges of issues such as whether a blog is news or whether material produced for example by WikiLeaks would also fall into the news category.
At the heart of the issue that the ACCC needs to deal with is the two-way exchange of value between the platform and the news publisher. If news is identified on the platform, a “click through” to the new publisher’s website means that the news provider can gain revenue for advertising on its site. The fact that news is available within the platform’s ecosystem adds value by keeping the customer in that ecosystem and able to be targeted with advertising.
The issue of two-way value exchange is not new to competition regulators. As an example, in telecommunications the interconnection of networks creates value to consumers by allowing them to communicate with others on different networks. In most jurisdictions, this is based on “calling party network pays.” That is, the receiving party network receives a terminating payment from the calling party network. The calling party pays a retail price to its network operator. In practice, there is likely to be symmetry between the networks so the terminating charge acts as a price signal, but the net value tends to zero. As a result, if the price signal is not required, then symmetry can be assumed and there is no wholesale charge. This is called “bill and keep.”8
In telecommunications networks, there is symmetry, which is absent from the interaction between news publishers and platforms. This means that any payments made under the code will need to reflect the net exchange of value. This value exchange is highly contested. Google argues that the driver for search results to include news is “societal and not economic.” Facebook also takes the view that there should be no net payment. On the other hand, the chair of a major Australian media company (Nine), Peter Costello suggested that the fee payable should be 10 percent of annual Australian revenue and estimated this amount to be $A600 million (about $420 million). Costello is a former Commonwealth treasurer9 for the party currently in government.
However, the likely net value exchange will be significantly lower than the amount proposed by the chair of Nine. The referral by the Treasurer does not stop Google and Facebook from proposing prices to the ACCC as the ACCC is drafting the mandatory code. Indeed, this is to be expected from both the news publishers and the platforms. In the debate about value flow, the effect of Google’s exit from providing news search in Spain in 2014 will likely be discussed. There is some evidence, albeit from news publishers, that the effect of the Google news exit was to drive news seeking web users directly to publisher’s websites.10
 
III. Codes in Australia
A. Legislative Background
The ability to make and enforce codes by the ACCC is provided in Part IVB of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“CCA”). Unless otherwise directed or as determined by the ACCC, section 51AE of the CCA provides that the ACCC can make regulations that “declare the industry code to be a mandatory industry code or a voluntary industry code.” The Government direction in this case means that the code will be mandatory.
In order to understand the implication of a mandatory code of conduct it is worthwhile reviewing the legislative and regulatory arrangements which allow a code of conduct to be enforced. There are two types of code which can be administered by the ACCC. The first is a voluntary code which is typically one made by an industry association and which provides a level of harmonization of the activities of members of that association. Such voluntary codes have also been associated with authorizations provided by the ACCC. These authorizations permit conduct which might be otherwise anticompetitive provided that it is in the public interest. Industry codes contain an internal dispute resolution scheme as well as provisions for monitoring conduct and enforcing industry compliance.
One of the issues that flows from the code process is that the ACCC has a right of audit of businesses which are part of a code. Essentially the ACCC gives notice and the business has 21 days to comply with that notice. The ACCC can use that documentation to ensure that compliance with the code is enforced.
B. Other Sectors Other Regulators
The ACCC enforces mandatory codes in the franchising sector, the energy sector and ports for bulk wheat. It also enforces voluntary codes in sectors from horticulture to groceries. In the mandatory code space, there is a part considered to be weaker and in a negotiating power imbalance. For franchising, the weaker parties are the franchisees. In energy, the weaker party is the consumer and in ports, the weaker parties are the farmers.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (“ACMA”) also deals with sector specific industry codes. Industry bodies develop codes and submit them to the ACMA. Once they are approved and registered, the ACMA enforces the codes. One of the critical codes managed by the ACMA is the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (“TCP”) Code. Enforcement under this code is by way of an infringement notice and the ACMA considers that each affected consumer is a separate infringement.
The ACMA has also introduced its views on fake news. This has been done by publishing an “expectations” note on what would form part of a voluntary code on disinformation.11 It outlines the ACMA’s expectations for a voluntary code of practice on misinformation and news quality to be developed by digital platforms. The ACMA paper, “Misinformation and news quality on digital platforms in Australia: A position paper to guide code development,” includes a model code framework. It sets out the ACMA’s views on objectives and outcomes to be achieved from a code that it considers would benefit Australian users of digital platforms. The ACMA has the power to enforce industry codes and an example is the TCP.
C. Enforcement
The chair of the ACCC, Rod Sims has pledged that Australia’s mandatory code of conduct will feature “heavy penalties” for Facebook and Google if they fail to comply, involving fines that are “large enough to matter.”12
Breach of a code is a civil offense and an industry code may prescribe maxim pecuniary penalties of about $45,000 for civil penalty provisions of the industry code. This does not sound like the “heavy penalties” mentioned by the ACCC chair. In practice, when a code is breached the ACCC chooses to enforce using more than the code provisions. The ACCC will typically take an action under each of
section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (“ACL”), which is Schedule 2 to the CCA for misleading or deceptive conduct for which damages is a remedy; and section 29 of the ACL for misrepresentation.
In the latter case, the penalty is up to the greater of $A10 million or 10 percent of annual revenue.13 The ACCC can also ask the court for directions including corrective advertising and a requirement that the business give an undertaking not to repeat the conduct. These undertakings are enforceable by the Federal Court.
This approach has been used by the ACCC in each of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. Geowash Pty Ltd (Subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) (No 4) [2020] FCA 23. The absence of major pecuniary penalties in the code is unlikely to reduce the effectiveness of ACCC enforcement. The cases cited above are in the car wash and mobile mechanic sectors. These have a far smaller interaction with consumers than Facebook or Google.
The audit power may well be used in respect of changes to algorithmic processes. The ACCC was particularly concerned that news publishers may be disadvantaged by changes in algorithm by either Facebook or Google:14
The ACCC understands that digital platforms make very frequent changes to their ranking and display algorithms, which vary from minor alterations to significant changes. A bargaining code mechanism requiring advance notice would need to include a threshold of significance that would trigger the obligation to provide advance notice. 
Additionally, such a mechanism would need to specify the length of time required for advance notice of significant changes. This period should be set to provide news media businesses with sufficient time to amend their business strategies to address the effects of the algorithm change. 
The audit provision may well be used to determine whether there had been a change, whether notified or otherwise.
 
IV. Reaction
A. Facebook’s Response
Facebook provided its response in the form of a blog and a copy of its submission.15 It makes the argument that the symbiotic relationship between news publisher and platform creates value for the news publisher:
Between January and May this year, Facebook’s News Feed sent 2.3 billion clicks back to Australian news organisations – for free. These referrals were worth approximately AU$195.8 million for publishers, based on what the average costs would be for similar activity through our paid advertising tools. In all, we delivered billions of opportunities for publishers to monetise their stories, gain new paying subscribers, serve ads, and keep Australians on their websites.
We’ve also invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through COVID-19 relief funds, paying publishers directly for content, coaching and grant programs and industry sponsorships. With an effective Code, we’d like to continue to collaborate and increase our partnerships and investments in Australia.
That is, Facebook is positioning the two-way value exchange as one which benefits news publishers to the same extent that it benefits Facebook. A precursor to a “bill and keep” argument.
B. Google’s Response
One of the areas which has had most interest from the ACCC is Accelerated Mobile Pages (“AMP”). These enable near instant loading of content and content as the pages are cached. The AMP are preloaded so when a user clicks on a hyperlink to the AMP it loads quickly on the user’s device. One of the issues is that although there are three potential providers of an AMP (Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare), the fact that Google has control of both the AMP cache and its own servers provides some concern to the ACCC. This concern has been expressed in both the Consultation Paper and the Digital Platforms Inquiry report. Google has not made recent comments on AMP. The ACCC regards AMP as a platform in its own right and the Concepts Paper sought stakeholder on whether the bargaining code should apply to AMP (among others) in addition to Google Search and Facebook News Feed (original emphasis).16 These additional services are also supplied by Google and Facebook and include WhatsApp and YouTube. The ACCC has indicated that the bargaining power imbalance should also be considered for these services.
Google has not published its submission and the ACCC has not published any of the submissions. However, Google has entered into licensing arrangements to license some forms of news in Australia and other countries.17 This has included licensing news from local and national publishers in Germany Australia and Brazil. However, it is also important to note that Google’s licensing does not extend to snippets. The blog emphasizes the potential for monetization by news publishers:
This program will help participating publishers monetize their content through an enhanced storytelling experience that lets people go deeper into more complex stories, stay informed and be exposed to a world of different issues and interests. 
Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read paywalled articles on a publisher’s site. This will let paywalled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.
This blog was written in the context of another Google position, also published as a blog.18 This sets out a similar argument to that of Facebook. Namely, that the flow is two-way and in favor of news publishers:
Sending people to publishers’ news sites—not keeping them “walled” up on Google products, as some claim—is a key way we provide value to the news industry. Every month we send Google users to news sites 24 billion times, providing an opportunity for publishers to grow their audiences and show Google’s users ads or offers for subscriptions. Deloitte puts a value of each click for large publishers at roughly between 4-7 U.S. cents. 
We also invest in ad technologies that thousands of news publishers around the world choose to use to grow their digital advertising businesses. We analyzed the revenue data of 100 news publishers globally with the highest programmatic revenue generated in Google Ad Manager. On average, we found news publishers keep over 95 percent of the digital advertising revenue they generate when they use Ad Manager to show ads on their websites.
  
V. Conclusions
Industry codes are designed to provide protection to the weaker party its bargaining with a stronger one. The ACCC has found that Facebook and Google have substantial market power in relevant markets associated with news publication but has not found that there has been misuse of market power. A voluntary code would have addressed this imbalance, but a failure to negotiate a voluntary code led to an Australian Government direction to the ACCC to impose a mandatory one.
There is a two-way value interaction between platforms and news publishers. Publishers have argued that this should lead to payments by Facebook and Google to news publishers. The ambit claim was $420 million. The response from the platforms is that the value received by the news publishers is high already. The ACCC must draft a mandatory code which addresses these issues. The code will be in force before the end of 2020. It is likely that the ACMA code on misinformation and news quality will be implemented in a similar timeframe.

329,"July 2, 2020",Singapore To Investigate LSE-Refinitiv Deal,"


The London Stock Exchange Group’s (LSE) US$27 billion acquisition of data provider Refinitiv faces a new hurdle after Singapore regulators said they would examine whether the deal threatens competition in the currency market, reported The Financial Times. 
The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) stated on Thursday, July 2, that the blockbuster deal might curb access to fair and reasonable pricing for foreign exchange rates, as the regulator embarked on a review that could take 120 working days.
Singapore’s intervention is a blow to the LSE, which plans to close the deal by the end of the year. The investigation comes as EU antitrust authorities last month kicked off an in-depth review of the transaction, which will turn the LSE into a global markets and information powerhouse.
The concern over the currency market stems from the fact that the acquisition combines WM/R, one of the benchmarks most widely used to set foreign exchange rates and owned by Refinitiv, with an LSE business that is a big player in clearing currency derivative trades.
Referring to WM/R, the CCCS stated that it was “considered the industry benchmark for foreign exchange reference rates and there is no reasonable substitute that rival index providers and derivatives clearing service providers are able to switch to without incurring significant disruption and costs to their businesses.”

330,"July 1, 2020",EU Is Lining Up New Rules To Level The Playing Field For Tech Giants,"


The European Union is lining up new rules to level the playing field for rivals, reported Reuters.
And just as its landmark privacy law became a global model, the EU’s new regulations could become a template for governments around the world looking to rein in Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. 
Driven in large part by a conclusion that multiple antitrust actions against Google have been ineffectual, the EU’s new strategy aims to lay down ground rules for data-sharing and how digital marketplaces operate. “It is indeed to prevent a situation like the ones we have had with the Google cases so that we still would have competition,” the EU’s digital chief as well as its top antitrust enforcer Margrethe Vestager told Reuters last month. Google did not respond to a request for comment. A person close to the firm said the EU legislative push was clearly driven in part by the cases against it. 
Despite action for anti-competitive conduct related to Google’s search engine operations, its Android mobile operating system, and its advertising business, antitrust enforcers and rivals say they have yet to see more competition. 
So as US antitrust enforcers prepare yet another possible case against Google, the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) could instead force big tech firms to offer smaller rivals access to data on reasonable, standardized, and non-discriminatory terms. 
“This is another sign (of) the EU strengthening its leadership in enforcement in these markets and a number of other national competition agencies are following its lead,” said law professor Ioannis Kokkoris at Queen Mary University of London. Some critics worry that the wide-ranging new powers may enable regulators to bypass standards set by EU courts and mix up competition law with politics.
The UK says it will create its own regime of subsidy control, based on the concepts of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, with both sides agreeing to notify each other “every two years” on subsidies.

331,"July 1, 2020",UK’s CMA Wants New Regulatory Regime To Govern Big Tech,"


The CMA is calling on the government to introduce a new pro-competition regulatory regime to tackle Google and Facebook’s market power.
The Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that it had proposed the creation of a “Digital Markets Unit” designed to rein in platforms with “a position of market power” in digital ads.
The new unit would enforce a code of conduct on Google, Facebook and other major players in the industry to make sure they don’t “engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices.” It would have the power to impose fines on the companies if necessary.
It would also be able to order Google to share click and query data with rival search engines and force Facebook to give consumers a choice over whether to receive targeted advertising, the CMA said.
The CMA said it wants to “lift the lid on how advertising revenue drives the business model of major platforms.” According to the regulator, around 80% of the £14 billion (dollar conversion) of U.K. spending on digital ads in 2019 went to Google and Facebook. Google has a more than 90% share of the search advertising market in the UK, the CMA said, while Facebook controls more than 50% of the display advertising sector.
“Advertisers today choose from a wide range of platforms that compete with each to deliver the most effective and innovative ad formats and products,” Ronan Harris, Google’s vice president for the U.K. and Ireland, said in a statement Wednesday. “We support regulation that benefits people, businesses and society and we’ll continue to work constructively with regulatory authorities and Government on these important areas so that everyone can make the most of the web.”
Facebook said the company would engage with U.K. government bodies “on rules that protect consumers and help small businesses rebuild as the British economy recovers” from the coronavirus pandemic.
“We face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. “Giving people meaningful controls over how their data is collected and used is important, which is why we have introduced industry leading tools for people to control how their data is used to inform the ads they see.”

iPhone maker Apple, the target of EU antitrust investigations into key segments of its business, on Tuesday, June 29, rejected accusations of market dominance, claiming it competes with Google, Samsung, and other rivals.
Earlier this month, the European Commission opened investigations into Apple’s App Store and mobile payment system Apple Pay, concerned about its role as a gatekeeper to its lucrative platform, reported Reuters. 
“We compete with a wide variety of companies, Google, Samsung, Huawei, Vivo, LG, Lenovo and many more,” Daniel Matray, head of Apple’s App Store and Apple Media Services, told a Forum Europe online event.

Van Bael & Bellis announced that it will open a London office on 1 September 1, 2020, subject to SRA approval. Located at 5 Chancery Lane, the office will be led by senior partner David Hull, managing partner Philippe De Baere, and partner Alex Stratakis, who will join from Baker McKenzie’s London office.
The focus of the London office will be international trade and customs law, UK and EU competition law, and public international law, key areas of noted strength for the firm.  
The firm’s unique market competence in these areas will serve clients well once companies and government entities involved in trade disputes and/or competition cases are required to deal with various UK regulatory authorities and courts, alongside representation in the EU.
The new office will work in conjunction with the firm’s head office in Brussels, which is renowned for its expertise in EU and national competition law, EU trade and customs law, EU regulatory law, and corporate and commercial law. With many experienced practitioners qualified in a number of jurisdictions and several UK qualified solicitors already working in Brussels, the firm is looking to grow its London-based team and strengthen relationships in the City.

334,"June 28, 2020",Vestager Says Breaking Up Big Tech Is “Last Resort”,"


US tech giants run the risk of being broken up if they don’t play fair, under tough new rules being weighed as a “last resort” by European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, a regular tormentor of Silicon Valley, reported Bloomberg. 
Digital markets “can tip very fast so we as competition enforcers need to be able to move quickly,” the EU commissioner told a competition law conference on Friday, June 26.
The new regulatory firepower she’s seeking would allow officials to probe entire industries and “by imposing obligations that would protect competition that could involve duties to behave in a certain way to make data available to others.”
“As a last resort, it could even mean breaking up companies to protect competition,” she said.
The rules would address frustrations the EU has faced in chasing down online giants without extracting much meaningful change, despite hefty penalties. Google has largely shrugged off some US$9 billion in fines and antitrust orders that tried to stoke more competition for search services. Fresher investigations into Amazon and Apple could take years to resolve.
Vestager has spearheaded a crack down on online firms, which have expanded with few regulatory curbs since the dot-com boom. Officials have targeted online content and digital tax revenues as well as how some tech companies essentially become a gatekeeper to entire industries by setting the rules for online marketplaces or app stores.

335,"June 25, 2020",The Week Big Tech Lost Power,"
By: Matt Stoller (Big)
Something changed this week. I’m not sure what, but it feels more and more like significant policy action against big tech is inevitable, probably break-ups but certainly restructurings of their business models. Though it’s impossible to pinpoint a shift in the political consensus, the signs are unmistakeable. It’s not just the constant drumbeat of announced investigations and leaks of potential antitrust suits. It’s the change in opinion leaders.
Two days ago, Joe Scarborough on MSNBC went on a seven minute rant straight to camera on Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, accusing them of destroying American democracy in return for money, and screaming into the camera that Congress needed to stand up to billionaires in Silicon Valley. Scarborough is as close as you can get to representing Washington, D.C. conventional wisdom, his morning show often sets the terms for legislative action and political chit-chat.
 Scarborough’s rant is part of a broader upsurge of rage at Google, Facebook, and interestingly for the first time, Apple. There are other signals of political anger; yesterday 60 groups, mostly progressives and unions but also the conservative Internet Accountability Project, sending letters to the House Antitrust Subcommittee asking for subpoena’s of critical documents to compete the big tech investigation. (My organization signed onto both letters.)

Following Google Shopping, competition authorities in Europe – supported by a flurry of reports on digital competition – have wasted little time establishing self-preferencing in competition law’s lexicon. But while self-preferencing looks here to stay, there is little clarity over the legal test which applies and how self-preferencing fits within the established canon of “leveraging” abuses. This article considers where self-preferencing should fit in light of “prior beliefs” as to its likely efficiencies and potential for competitive harm. It further considers how arbitrage of different legal standards by regulators (reverse regulatory arbitrage) can be avoided. These are critical questions as regulators and courts weigh up how to address the alleged harm from self-preferencing without undermining the dynamic efficiency of digital markets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since the first Statement of Objections on Google Shopping was announced, competition practitioners, commentators and academics have grappled with the concept of “self-preferencing.”2 What harm is it intended to address? What is the correct legal test? And how does it fit into the established canon of abuses under Article 102 TFEU?
Much ink has been split on whether “self-preferencing” is even an abuse or, as some have suggested, merely an inventive way of circumventing the (high) legal standard for “refusal to supply.”3 Others h...

337,"June 24, 2020",Hybrid Differentiation and Competition Beyond Markets,"
Hybrid differentiation occurs when a platform discriminates among businesses in a related market in which it is not active itself with the aim to increase or maintain its competitive advantage elsewhere. An example is a platform blocking an app that interferes with its ability to gain revenues through advertising. Hybrid differentiation is particularly relevant where a platform builds an ecosystem or conglomerate around its main activity. As a competitive strategy beyond vertical integration that serves to protect the platform’s overall activities and business model, hybrid differentiation is different from the self-preferencing at stake in Google Shopping. This paper submits that the assessment of hybrid differentiation requires attention for the broader competitive strategies of dominant platforms going beyond traditional forms of leveraging and the relevant markets in which they operate.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Google Shopping saga has led to a fierce discussion about the theory of harm condemning self-preferencing by vertically integrated dominant firms as anticompetitive. This paper reflects on another type of discrimination, namely hybrid differentiation, whose effects are maybe even more complex and problematic than those of self-preferencing. Hybrid differentiation occurs when a platform discriminates among businesses in a related market in which it is not active itself in an effort to increase or maintain its competitive advantage within on...

338,"June 24, 2020",Self-Preferencing – Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty for the Digital Economy (and Beyond?),"
The growth of digital platforms has focused the minds of policymakers and competition authorities across the world on whether stricter enforcement is required against “self-preferencing.” Competition authorities are taking an increasingly expansive approach. While the abuse of dominance regime provides competition authorities with a great deal of flexibility, their treatment of self-preferencing as a standalone abuse raises fundamental questions and leaves them unanswered: over and above the gating question of “dominance,” where is the dividing line between “competition on the merits” and unlawful commercial practices, and how does the “special responsibility” of dominant firms play into the steps that dominant platforms need to take to ensure they are not crossing that line? There has been increasing pressure to use ex ante regulation to tackle self-preferencing. However, here too many unanswered questions remain: is regulation necessary in light of the flexible approach being taken with antitrust enforcement? Which markets (and which companies within those markets) should be subject to such regulation?

In recent times, self-preferencing by digital platforms has come to the fore. While it is normal for companies to promote their own products over those of their competitors, and, in many cases, this can lead to efficiencies, a dominant company giving preferential treatment to its own products or services in downstream or related markets (self-preferencing) can raise concerns. Given its potential for pro-competitive effects, it remains challenging to identify the exact circumstances in which self-preferencing is anticompetitive. In addition, a number of the concerns raised by self-preferencing may not relate solely to their potential anticompetitive effects. This means that different tools – including, but going beyond competition law – may be used to address problematic self-preferencing practices.

However, a dominant company giving preferential treatment to its own products or services in downstream or related markets (self-preferencing) can raise concerns. Despite its ingrained flexibility, competition law is limited to addressing behavior that proves anticompetitive in specific circumstances, and is unable to address many other concerns that self-preferencing may give rise to. Even when self-preferencing is anticompetitive, it is important to evaluate whether a regulatory react...

340,"June 24, 2020",Self-Preferencing – Some Observations on the Push for Legislation at the National Level in Germany,"
While the debate on self-preferencing as a possible abuse of dominance under EU law is ongoing, various expert reports on antitrust enforcement in the digital economy identified self-preferencing as a competition issue to be tackled and provided several suggestions, including legislation. Germany has proposed draft national legislation, including a special provision prohibiting self-preferencing for companies with a paramount cross-market significance for competition. The proposal follows a hybrid approach, introducing aspects of ex ante regulation into competition law. The design raises some issues, notably that it is not limited to digital platforms and does not require any dominance. Due to its two-step approach, it may only render enforcement more effective in the mid-term. It does not resolve the issues of lack of resources at the competition authority or the difficulties to impose effective remedies to terminate infringements. From an EU perspective, a patchwork of different national rules on enforcement against abusive conduct in the digital economy.

Due to their global economic significance and their attitude to concentrating economic power, digital platforms have triggered an unprecedented competition policy debate, fragmented and multi-faceted in terms of both actual problems and potential solutions. Doubts concern whether “self-preferencing” behaviors constitute a new self-standing theory of antitrust liability; and, whether this being the case, what “legal standard” should be used to pursue self-preferencing theories. This paper turns the spotlight on these crucial issues. Additionally, the paper considers the digital platforms’ regulatory interventions recently announced, evaluates their relationship alongside competition rules and argues that the new regulatory framework, including the introduction of new competition tools, may significantly affect the assessment of conduct by digital platforms, even abuse of dominance cases.

Digital platforms have taken the spotlight in the competition policy debate due to their significance to the global economy and their attitude to concentrating economic power.
Due to the roles of big data, network effects, economies of scope and scale, etc., digital platforms tend to be self-reinforcing, and to lead to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most scenarios.

Prohibiting self-preferencing should remain the exception. Under current law, the non-discrimination rule in Article 102(c) TFEU is arguably only applicable to self-preferencing in cases where the undertaking is under a regulatory duty not to discriminate. It is possible to find that the prohibition of exclusionary abuses can result a de facto prohibition of self-preferencing. However, finding such an abuse must take into account the reasons why the non-discrimination rule does not generally prohibit self-preferencing. Whether this was sufficiently considered in the Google Search (Shopping) decision is debatable. The article also reports on the Draft Bill in German antitrust law that seeks to introduce a prohibition of self-preferencing that depends on the prior finding of the Bundeskartellamt that the undertaking has a “pre-eminent, market-transcending significance for competition” in a multisided market.

Whether a dominant undertaking’s self-preferencing constitutes an abuse was central to the Google Search (Shopping) case:2 is the preferential ranking of Google’s (or Alphabet’s) own comparison shopping service on the Search Engine Result Page (“SERP”) an abuse?

John Kwoka:
The second panel is concerned with several factors that
play important roles in merger review. These include the use and perhaps
overuse of entry and the efficiencies as defenses, the use of remedies as
challenges to mergers, issues of potential competition and innovation, and the
benefits of merger retrospectives. And to speak about these issues, we have

on their recent work. Bill Baer of course was the Assistant Attorney General
for Antitrust from 2013 to 2016. He’s also been a director of the Bureau of
Competition at the FTC, and is now a visiting fellow in governance studies at
Brookings. His list of well deserved honors will take more than half of our

344,"June 21, 2020",AG Barr Comments On Tech Companies Censoring,"




“There’s something very disturbing about what’s going on,” Attorney General William Barrtold Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview responding to recent incidents where technology companies, including Google and Twitter, tried to censor content.
Barr made the statement during the interview, which aired on “Sunday Morning Futures,” reacting to NBC’s apparent influence over Google in punishing two conservative news sites over what was deemed offensive coverage of the protests following the death of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died in police custody on May 25.
In a report published Tuesday afternoon, NBC News claimed Google “banned” The Federalist and ZeroHedge from Google Ads for “pushing unsubstantiated claims” about the Black Lives Matter movement. Google later pushed back, claiming that The Federalist “was never demonetized,” and adding, “We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comments section.”
Barr explained that that is a “fundamental problem” because “our republic was founded on the idea, and the whole rationale was that there’d be a lot of diversity of voices and it would be hard for someone to be able to galvanize, big faction in the United States that could dominate politically and oppress a minority, and yet now we have with the Internet and with these big concentrations of power, the ability to do just that, to quickly galvanize people’s views because they’re only presenting one viewpoint and they can push the public in a particular direction very quickly.”
Barr went on to explain that “our whole Constitution insists the system was based on not having that and having a wide diversity of voices.”
He then said that “one way this can be addressed is through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices.”
The Department of Justice is pushing Congress to pass new legislation that would hold Facebook, Twitter and other tech behemoths accountable for what is posted on their platforms – a move that if passed would roll back protections Silicon Valley has had for decades.

345,"June 17, 2020",DOJ To Propose Limiting Internet Companies’ Protections,"


The Justice Department is set to propose a rollback of legal protections that online platforms have enjoyed for more than two decades, in an effort to make tech companies more responsible in how they police their content, according to a Trump administration official, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
The Department’s proposed changes, to be unveiled as soon as Wednesday, June 17, are designed to spur online platforms to be more aggressive in addressing illicit and harmful conduct on their sites, and to be fairer and more consistent in their decisions to take down content they find objectionable, the official said.
The Justice Department proposal is a legislative plan that would have to be adopted by Congress.
The move represents an escalation in the continuing clash between the Trump administration and big tech firms such as Twitter, Alphabet’s Google unit, and Facebook.
Last month, President Trump signed an executive order that sought to target the legal protections of social-media companies, responding to concerns among some conservatives about alleged online censorship by the platforms. The executive order sought to impose limits on legal immunity for social-media companies when they are deemed to unfairly curb users’ speech, for instance by deleting their posts or suspending their accounts. The administration, however, can’t impose many of these changes unilaterally.
Internet companies would lose immunity if they have knowledge that unlawful conduct is taking place on their platforms or show reckless disregard for how users are behaving on their sites. Without those legal protections, tech companies could be exposed to claims for monetary damages from people allegedly harmed by online fraud and other illegal activity.
The Department also wouldn’t confer immunity to platforms in instances involving online child exploitation and sexual abuse, terrorism, or cyberstalking. Those carve-outs are needed to curtail immunity for internet companies to allow victims to seek redress, the official said.

“If there were no news content available on Facebook in Australia, we are confident the impact on Facebook’s community metrics and revenues in Australia would not be significant,” it said in a thinly veiled threat to boycott local news companies.

As part of an ongoing probe of competition in digital markets that involves Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, the US House Judiciary Committee last week sent a letter to each company demanding to know whether their CEOs will testify in hearings set to take place in July, reported Axios.
The antitrust investigators want to know by Sunday, June 14, whether Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook will have their CEOs attend the hearings voluntarily. They’re also seeking a number of materials related to other competition probes and internal communications, with the letters asking questions “on issues related to possible competitive harms.”
According to Axios, the letters suggest the Judiciary Committee could send out subpoenas to force testimony and document production if the companies do not comply.
“These are documents that are essential to complete our ongoing, bipartisan investigation of the digital marketplace,” antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline said in a statement. “This is the appropriate process to secure their production.”
The US Department of Justice last July launched a broad antitrust review into whether major technology companies are unlawfully stifling competition.
In September 2019, the US House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook requesting details on documents and communications related to the App Store, product repairs, and seller agreements with Amazon.

Even as Facebook grappled this month with an internal revolt and a cascade of criticism over its refusal to take action on President Trump’s inflammatory posts, the social network was actively making other bets behind the scenes.
Late one Tuesday, as attention was focused on how Facebook might handle Mr. Trump, the Silicon Valley company said in a brief blog post that it had invested in Gojek, a “super app” in Southeast Asia. The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed a $5.7 billion investment it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.
The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile undersea fiber-optic cable encircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebook confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.

No-poaching agreements are agreements among rival employers to not recruit or hire another firm’s employees. These agreements affect the price of an input and harm the employee in the form of lower compensation. A number of high profile no poaching cases have been brought by the government and private parties, alleging hiring practices that include information exchange and agreements not to hire. In 2016, the antitrust agencies released guidelines targeted to human resource professionals, outlining impermissible agreements that harm employees and their compensation in the labor market. The agencies stated that they will seek criminal litigation and penalties for those involved in naked agreements that harm employees. No poaching agreements are anticompetitive and cause harm to employees in the form of decreased job mobility, reduced bargaining power, and reduced compensation. Such agreements restrict the information available to employees and exacerbate information asymmetries. Agreements to not compete on this dimension of hiring employees should be considered per se illegal and employees should be eligible to recoup damages from undercompensation.

Amazon could be facing antitrust charges by the European Union (EU) as early as next week over its treatment of third-party sellers, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday (June 11).
The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s antitrust regulator, has been building its case against the eCommerce giant and circulating a draft of the charges for several months, sources told the newspaper.
It’s the latest action in a nearly two-year probe into Amazon’s alleged mistreatment of sellers on its eCommerce platform.
The EU charges Amazon with gathering data from third party sellers and using it to compete against them by launching similar products, known as private label brands.
In the past, Amazon has denied the allegations that it abuses its power and said its retailers routinely sell Amazon brands.
In April, US lawmakers raised concerns over accusations that Amazon abuses its position to produce similar products that its sellers offer and then compete against the sellers who offer their own products on the website.
Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a letter on April 28 asking the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to open a criminal probe. In the House, U.S. Rep David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, said Amazon may have lied to Congress in testimony about its business practices regarding the third-party sellers.
Former Amazon workers have revealed the company asked an Amazon business analyst to craft reports using what is supposed to be restricted information or using taken from one seller.
The EU is investigating similar claims, the WSJ reported. An amazon executive told Congress the company does not use individual seller data to compete with other businesses on the platform.
Amazon has said it launched an internal investigation. Any employees who use data to help create private label products is in violation of the company’s policies, it said.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s vice president in charge of competition and digital policy, has fined Google more than $9 billion for anticompetitive behavior in three separate probes, the Journal reported.

HP will keep all the cash, factories, and patents Quanta Storage was ordered to turn over to satisfy a US$439 million antitrust judgment from 2019, a federal appeals court ruled.
The Taiwanese disk drive maker was ordered to surrender almost all its assets before its appellate challenge had played out because it failed to post an US$85 million bond to prevent early collection of the crippling award. The appellate court did agree to give it more time to comply, reported Bloomberg. 
“Quanta risked bet-the-company litigation and lost, so the district court ordered it to hand over the company,” a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals in New Orleans stated Friday, June 5, in a 21-page ruling.
Quanta tried repeatedly in April to delay HP’s push to collect on the judgment. It claimed that coronavirus travel and business restrictions in Taiwan and China, where most of its executives and factories are, prevented it from posting the bond while complying with Taiwanese regulations on asset transfers by publicly traded companies. HP claimed Quanta was using the pandemic as a ploy to dissipate assets that could be used to satisfy the judgment.
“It is not apparent from the record that the district court considered the amount of time it would take for Quanta to complete the asset transfer process required by Taiwanese law,” the panel said Friday, June 4. 
“Quanta violated US antitrust laws by conspiring to fix prices,” Alex Roberts, one of HP’s lawyers, wrote in an email. “That conduct cannot go unpunished. HP took them to task for those violations, and now we look forward to ensuring they comply promptly” with the turnover orders.
Quanta stated in an exchange filing in Taiwan on Sunday that the company will file a petition for the case to be reheard en banc. It will also discuss with its lawyers the procedure of the US Supreme Court appeal in the case.

By Jeff Bone (Saint Joseph’s University)
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet (Google) are four of the world’s most expansive business empires, both in terms of public visibility and market value. This paper examines a hypothetical scenario. If Congress introduced a bill to enact new antitrust regulations over digital platforms, what would happen if these companies responded by threatening an expatriation of some or all of their U.S. business assets? It is argued in this paper that if these companies threatened a costly and unpopular expatriation of business, that the U.S. Congress will capitulate to their demands. If true, these companies have reached a critical threshold of market concentration that poses a threat to democracy because domestic governance and control cannot rein them in. Further, it suggests that the global span and prodigious growth of these companies has dwarfed the ability of political institutions to hold them to account. The paper ends with a proposed solution using Google as a case study example. The proposal calls for the implementation of a corporate monitor program pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement between the Department of Justice and Google.

Amazon’s roll out of Slack to all of its employees is a big part of the deal, thanks to an enterprise-wide agreement. It’s not immediately clear how many of Amazon’s 840,000 employees will be using Slack, though. Up until today, Slack’s biggest customer has been IBM, which is rolling out Slack to its 350,000 employees.
While Slack has long used AWS to power parts of its chat app, it’s now committing to using Amazon’s cloud services as its preferred partner for storage, compute, database, security, analytics, machine learning, and future collaboration features.

Japan’s parliament enacted a law Wednesday, May 27, requiring major technology companies to be more transparent, falling in line with other countries in toughening regulations on industry giants such as Google and Amazon.
Companies that operate e-commerce websites and apps will be required to submit reports on their business practices every year to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry after the law takes effect, likely by next spring.
After receiving the reports, the Ministry will solicit comments from merchants, conduct reviews, and publish the results.
The law addresses concerns that such companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to mistreat merchants who offer wares on their platforms, in some cases changing terms and conditions without warning.
Such worries have heightened during the novel coronavirus pandemic, as government requests for people to stay at home have boosted online sales while devastating brick-and-mortar stores.
While the list of companies subject to the law will be finalized this summer, it is expected to include Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple along with Japanese firms such as Rakuten and Yahoo Japan.

358,"May 26, 2020","“Killer Acquisitions,” Big Tech, and Section 2: A Solution in Search of a Problem","
Since the term “killer acquisition” was coined last year, many have moved quickly to declaring a killer-acquisition problem in tech and proposing Section 2 of the Sherman Act as a solution.  In this article, we urge caution before extending conclusions about killer acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry to an entirely different industry where product development is less regimented and innovation is more opaque.  And we argue that the benefits of Section 2 as a merger enforcement tool are overstated and the added complications, significant.

I. INTRODUCTION
“Killer Acquisition.” It’s an evocative term, particularly for such a technocratic field as antitrust law. Perhaps because it is so evocative, the term sometimes has been stretched well beyond its original meaning to refer to “acquisitions I think are anticompetitive.” But the term “killer acquisition” was originally coined by Colleen Cunningham, Florian Ederer, and Song Ma to describe something quite specific: an acquisition – in the pharmaceutical industry in the Cunningham study – in which an incumbent acquires an innovative company that is developing a competing product and shuts down that product development.2
Cunningham and her colleagues estimate that 6 percent of all acquisitions in the U.S. pharmaceutical sector (or 45 of acquisitions each year) are “killer acquisitions.”3 Their study gives rise to the obvious question wheth...

359,"May 26, 2020",“How Tech Rolls”: Potential Competition and “Reverse” Killer Acquisitions,"
Competition agencies are pivoting towards “loss of potential competition” theories of harm, especially in acquisitions by highly dominant companies of smaller/nascent players offering a product or functionality in related spaces. The concern is broader than implied by the recent debate on “killer acquisitions.” Many say “What’s not to like?” We argue that it’s time to be more cautious. Large platforms have exceptional abilities to enter new spaces but also to “roll up” (willing) startups, buying instead of putting their own effort into rival innovation. Foregoing such effort is rarely good for society. We call these “buy vs. build” cases a form of “reverse” killer acquisitions that allow the incumbent to do away with its own innovation effort. Can we trade off the benefits of integration against this potential loss of organic expansion or should we adopt simplified policy rules to minimize the type of error we think matters most, requiring economists to pursue productive analyses of integration efficiencies, rather than the normal advocacy?

360,"May 26, 2020",Beyond Killer Acquisitions: Are There More Common Potential Competition Issues in Tech Deals and How Can These Be Assessed?,"
How common are killer acquisitions in tech and are there alternative theories of harm that are likely to arise more frequently? We apply a set of filters to 409 acquisitions by the “GAFA” between 2009 and 2020 to identify transactions where the target firm could have plausibly threatened the acquirer’s “core” business and the valuation was large enough to plausibly mask a market power premium. We find that at most 14 percent of reviewed transactions pass these filters and conclude that killer acquisitions, while important when they arise, are likely rare. Further analysis suggests that the theory of harm with broader application is that the purchaser would, but for the transaction, enter the same space as the target organically, flipping the traditional “killer” acquisition narrative on its head. We discuss key questions and trade-offs which arise in such transactions and the extent to which they require a change in the standard of proof applied in merger investigations.

361,"May 26, 2020",Remember Stacker? Another Look at “Killer” Acquisitions in the Digital Economy,"
Many acquisitions of startups by incumbents in the digital economy have resulted in a significant boost to marketplace recognition and interest in innovative, but frequently unknown and resource-constrained companies. However, some have argued that these acquisitions, far from accelerating the pace of innovation and the quality of products available to consumers, are instead “killer acquisitions” made to eliminate potential competitors. Whether these acquisitions enhance or prevent competitive innovation is a question often raised, despite the fact that they rarely result in the disappearance of the innovative products. The difficulty of this question is heightened in the digital space. In this article, we use an economic framework and two illustrative examples of acquisitions in the digital space to examine these issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1990, a small software corporation, Stac Electronics, released a drive compression software called Stacker that doubled PC hard drives’ volume. At that time, hard drives had limited capacity and were expensive. Unsurprisingly, the drive compression software was hugely successful. In 1993, Microsoft released version 6.0 of its flagship operating system, MS-DOS, which included its own compression software. This led to a long legal battle between Microsoft and Stac Electronics, at the end of which Microsoft had to remove its drive compression feature from MS-DOS ...

362,"May 26, 2020",The Jury Is Out: An Assessment of Proposed Reforms to Australia’s Merger Control Regime for Addressing Competitive Harm in the (Digital) Economy,"
Recently, competition authorities globally have been advocating for law reform to enhance their enforcement powers in relation to so called “killer acquisitions.” In July 2019, the ACCC released its Final Digital Platform Inquiry Report. As part of this inquiry, the ACCC looked at whether Australia’s merger control regime was fit-for-purpose to address “killer acquisitions” through examining acquisitions by Google and Facebook, and economies of scope created via control of data sets. The Report concluded that these were two factors that had contributed to the dominant market positions of Google and Facebook in Australia and that law reform was needed. This paper examines the substantive and procedural proposals put forward by the ACCC in the Report. This paper will also review the extent to which such proposals would materially change Australia’s current merger control framework, and whether they would be likely to facilitate more effective regulation of “killer acquisitions.”

I. INTRODUCTION
Killer acquisitions have come under the eye of the entire antitrust community. The topic has been very much in vogue at conferences2 and in the wide range of expert panel reports on competition law and digitization produced by antitrust authorities and academic institutions around the world.3 However, the issue has not always been approached in a systematic way, and there is still no emerging consensus.4 Therefore, this paper sets out a general framework to evaluate killer acquisitions by tying together the various strands in the existing literature. Section II makes some conceptual clarifications. Section III outlines possible ex ante and ex post mechanisms for capturing killer acquisitions.

Europe’s landmark privacy rules must be overhauled to ensure proper enforcement and protection of people’s rights, Johannes Caspar, a leading German regulator, said ahead of the law’s two-year anniversary.
Failure to enforce the rules against big companies and a lack of cooperation between regulators have fundamentally undermined the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the head of Hamburg’s data protection authority told Politico. 
“I’m completely critical of the enforcement structure of the GDPR,” said Caspar, whose office is in charge of overseeing the German activities of several Silicon Valley firms. “The whole system doesn’t work.”
His comments come as the bloc’s privacy enforcers have yet to agree on almost any penalties against large firms for potential abuse. The law passed in May of 2018 allows for penalties amounting to as much as 4% of a firm’s annual revenues in the event of a breach and has become a template for countries around the world, yet so far no blockbuster fines have been announced.
On Friday, May 22, Ireland’s privacy watchdog, in charge of overseeing firms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple, announced it had finished an investigation into Twitter, its first major move against a Big Tech company under Europe’s new privacy standards.

365,"May 25, 2020",Challenging Consummated Mergers Under Section 2,"

By Douglas H. Ginsburg & Koren W. Wong-Ervin*
 
In the last year, officials at the U.S. Antitrust Agencies have taken a number of troubling positions with respect to what is required to challenge consummated mergers under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. These include: (1) the contention that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 of the Clayton Act in that Section 2 requires mere proof that the merger was “reasonably capable of” contributing significantly to the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power;1 (2) suggestions that evidence of intent may be used as a proxy for probable harm;2 and (3) the idea that Section 2 can be used to challenge a series of acquisitions no one of which by itself was problematic but which together form an anticompetitive course of conduct.3 In this Article we explain why these contentions are unfounded.
  
Section 2 as a “Lower Bar” Than Section 7
In the Fall of 2019, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the first time took the position that Section 2 imposes a “somewhat relaxed causation requirement (as compared to the causation requirements imposed under Section 1 of the Sherman Act or Section 7 of the Clayton Act).”4 Earlier that year, Bruce Hoffman, then Director of the Bureau of Competition, had claimed that, under the D.C. Circuit’s Microsoft decision, Section 2
doesn’t turn on the actual effects in the specific case at issue. It’s a matter of general tendency: the kind of effects that can broadly be expected from conduct of this kind across the great run of cases. Second, even through this lens of generalization, a plaintiff need not show but-for causation of the monopoly. What matters is that conduct is reasonably capable (in general) of making a significant contribution to monopoly: that is, that it would tend to make the acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power more likely, or more durable, or more substantial, by some meaningful amount. That is enough.5
These contentions are flawed for four reasons.
First, the assertion that Section 2 does not require proof of anticompetitive effects is based upon a misreading of the D.C. Circuit’s decision in United States v. Microsoft.6 The assertion conflates the Microsoft court’s standard for proving competitive effects with its standard for establishing causation. The claim ignores the court’s explicit statement that “the plaintiff, on whom the burden of proof of course rests . . . must demonstrate that the monopolist’s conduct indeed has the requisite anticompetitive effect.”7 The court went on to devote fully 20 pages to a careful analysis of the actual effects of each type of Microsoft’s allegedly anticompetitive conduct.8 Only after finding that each type of conduct indeed had an anticompetitive effect did the court turn to the separate and distinct question of causation: Was there a causal link between Microsoft’s anticompetitive conduct and the alleged maintenance of its operating system monopoly? It was in addressing this question that the court said it was appropriate, in a government enforcement action, to “infer causation when exclusionary conduct is aimed at producers of nascent competitive technologies as well as when it is aimed at producers of established substitutes.”9 Of critical importance is that the court’s causation standard was conditioned on its having found anticompetitive effects.
There is some debate over what the court meant by anticompetitive effects. In his 2019 speech, Hoffman acknowledged that, in addition to monopoly power, “Section 2 also requires anticompetitive conduct—often referred to as ‘exclusionary,’ ‘anticompetitive’ or ‘predatory’ conduct, or, as it’s sometimes known, conduct that isn’t ‘competition on the merits.’”10
Hoffman’s contention that Microsoft does not require actual effects appears to be based upon his conclusion that what the court described as the “requisite anticompetitive effects” analysis really amounted to a determination of whether the conduct was exclusionary in that it was likely to harm competition. But this ignores the court’s findings that, as a matter of fact, most of the alleged conduct resulted in substantial foreclosure, thereby “keeping rival browsers from gaining the critical mass of users necessary to attract developer attention away from Windows as the platform for software development.”11 The court found that Microsoft’s conduct “help[ed] keep usage of Navigator below the critical level necessary for Navigator or any other rival to pose a real threat to Microsoft’s monopoly.”12 The court inferred harm to the competitive process from these findings, in essence recognizing that minimum-efficient scale is the mechanism by which exclusionary conduct harms competition.13 For other conduct, Microsoft “acknowledged” the anticompetitive effects, arguing only that there were offsetting procompetitive justifications, an argument rejected by the court.14 No quantification or other assessment of the magnitude of that harm was necessary given Microsoft’s lack of cognizable business justifications. Therefore, there was no need to balance anticompetitive effects against procompetitive effects to determine the net effect of the conduct.
Second, even as a pure causation standard (which we have shown is not a substitute for Microsoft’s anticompetitive effects standard), it is important to understand the limited applicability of the “reasonably capable of” standard. The court fully explicated its reasoning on causation in the course of rejecting Microsoft’s argument that, “as to § 2 liability in an equitable enforcement action, plaintiffs must present direct proof that a defendant’s continued monopoly power is precisely attributable to its anticompetitive conduct”15 The court pointed out that “neither plaintiffs nor the court can confidently reconstruct a product’s hypothetical technological development in a world absent the defendant’s exclusionary conduct.”16 Given this “underlying proof problem,”17 the Court may infer causation. “To some degree, ‘the defendant is made to suffer the uncertain consequences of its own undesirable conduct,’”18 i.e., the practices that had been shown to have had anticompetitive effects. In these carefully limited circumstances, the questions were “(1) whether as a general matter the exclusion of nascent threats is the type of conduct that is reasonably capable of contributing significantly to a defendant’s continued monopoly power and (2) whether Java and Navigator reasonably constituted nascent threats at the time Microsoft engaged in the anticompetitive conduct at issue.”19
In Rambus v. FTC—a Section 2 case the D.C. Circuit decided after Microsoft—the court held that the agency failed to prove that “but-for” the defendant’s conduct, there would have been harm to the competitive process.20 As in Microsoft, the “but-for” world in Rambus was highly uncertain. In both cases, one could reasonably find the defendant’s conduct may have caused the defendant to acquire or maintain its monopoly power. At the same time, it was also possible that the defendants in those cases would have acquired or maintained their monopoly power even absent their anticompetitive behavior. The court in Rambus held the government must bear the burden of that uncertainty. This burden applies in all Section 2 cases, whether the allegations involve conduct or acquisitions.
As former FTC Chairman Tim Muris and former FTC General Counsel John Nuechterlein explain, the Microsoft court’s more lenient “reasonably capable” standard applies by its terms only to exclusionary conduct lacking any procompetitive justification—and, therefore, not to the typical merger, particularly if it was reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice (“DoJ”) or the FTC itself before consummation.21 Recall that Microsoft was a case of attempted monopoly maintenance involving allegations that the company had engaged in several types of exclusionary conduct with no efficiency justifications solely in order to suppress nascent technological threats to its Windows operating system monopoly.22 Reading Microsoft and Rambus together, the key takeaway is that only when anticompetitive effects are shown (as required by Microsoft and Rambus) does the “reasonably capable of” causation standard apply to allegations that exclusionary conduct killed a nascent threat. Only when these conditions are met may the government avoid having to show that the threat would have become a real competitor but for the alleged exclusionary conduct. 2
Without requiring proof of but-for causation, there is great risk of erroneously condemning acquisitions that may be procompetitive. Consider, for example, Herbert Hovenkamp’s proposal presumptively to condemn acquisitions by a monopolist of “any firm that has the economic capabilities for entry and is a more-than-fanciful possible entrant, unless the acquired firm is no different from many other firms in these respects.”24 “More-than-fanciful” is an invitation to speculate, not a standard of proof.
Third, the contention that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 ignores the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown Shoe v. United States, in which the court held that “the tests for measuring the legality of any particular economic arrangement under the Clayton Act are to be less stringent than those used in applying the Sherman Act.”25 The Court explained that the Clayton Act was enacted to lower the burdens in merger cases, quoting the Senate Report on the original Act: “The intent here . . . is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency, and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act proceeding.”26
Fourth, in a consummated merger setting, the focus naturally should be on the real-world evidence of what happened in the market following the acquisition (e.g., effects on price, output, and innovation). Such real-world evidence was relied upon by the DoJ in its 2008 complaint against Microsemi Corporation, a case in which the government alleged that, post-acquisition, Microsemi significantly raised prices.27 In contrast, evidence that post-merger prices decreased or output expanded would suggest a procompetitive outcome. As former FTC economist John Yun stated in his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony: “To treat the success and associated exponential output expansion of an acquired product as evidence of an anticompetitive acquisition severely twists the meaning of ‘anticompetitive.’ When properly formulated, the central forces driving anticompetitive conduct are reductions in output, quality, innovation, and transfers away from consumers to producers.”28 While one could argue that the but-for world without the acquisition would have exhibited even lower prices or greater output, the burden would be on the challenger to make that showing. In other words, the plaintiff would need to prove that the but-for world absent the merger would likely be more competitive than the actual world with the merger.
In addition, it seems the DoJ and the FTC want to combine the causation standard of Microsoft and the efficiency standard of Section 7. In contrast to Section 2 cases, in which procompetitive or legitimate business justifications, as in Microsoft itself,29 may defeat liability,30 efficiencies have rarely been credited in Section 7 cases.31
  
Intent Evidence as a Proxy for Probable Harm
In a 2019 speech, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Wilder proposed Section 2 as a “solution” to the difficulties of bringing nascent and potential competition cases under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.32 Wilder suggested the presence of network effects, along with substantial barriers to entry, “could be useful in proving such a case.”33 Wilder went on to say that when evaluating a firm’s acquisition or series of acquisitions, strategic documents “may well suffice to show a specific intent to monopolize and block future entry.”34
The FTC has arguably gone further, suggesting in its 2017 complaint against Mallinckrodt that intent can serve as a substitute for probable harm.35 In that case, the FTC’s only allegation of an anticompetitive effect was that, but for Mallinckrodt’s acquisition of a drug, another bidder would have acquired the license and developed a competing drug. The remainder of the complaint involved allegations of anticompetitive intent, including that the company viewed its target as a “possible future competitor” and “feared that if another company were to acquire [the target] . . . it could decimate its business.”36 The claim is, in other words, that unlike Section 7, Section 2 makes it unnecessary for the plaintiff to show that a consummated merger actually created monopoly power—i.e., enabled the company to raise prices or reduce quantity—and instead permits a court to rely upon evidence of anticompetitive intent.
Relying solely upon evidence of intent is inconsistent with Section 2, which requires proof that the merger had anticompetitive effects. Indeed, more than 30 years of case law makes clear that “[a]nticompetitive intent alone, no matter how virulent, is insufficient to give rise to an antitrust violation,”37 and that “[a]nimosity, even if rephrased as ‘anticompetitive intent[,]’ is not illegal without anticompetitive effects.”38
This is not to say evidence that the acquirer viewed its target as a viable threat is wholly irrelevant. Evidence to that effect could be combined with other evidence to show the only plausible explanation for an acquisition was the suppression of potential competition. “Such an acquisition might well fall within the scope of the Microsoft standard for purely ‘undesirable’ conduct. But such cases would be very rare and are unlikely to involve mergers that were subject to and survived HSR scrutiny.”39 Of course, the government would still have to prove the merger had actual anticompetitive effects for, as the Supreme Court has held, plaintiffs “must allege and prove harm . . . to the competitive process, i.e., to competition itself.”40
In backward-looking cases there will be post-merger facts and data from which to determine what actually happened in the marketplace. For example, “post-merger market statistics may indicate what the actual situation was at the time of merger, and post-acquisition evidence might show that anticompetitive threats that seemed probable at merger time were not, in fact, probable.”41 Indeed, it may well be that nascent or potential competitors engage in strategic behavior to make themselves look like actual or potential competitors in order to make themselves attractive as acquisition targets. But when their intentions and incentives are tested, it may become clear that they lacked the ability to mature into truly viable competitors.
 
Course of Conduct Theories
DoJ and FTC officials have also taken the position that Section 2 may be used to overcome the difficulties of challenging serial acquisitions involving targets with market shares of as little as 5-10% and acquisitions by platform companies of start-ups operating outside their core market.42 Wilder explained that the DoJ “is concerned about acquisitions of nascent competitors in platform industries because these markets are prone to tipping, and with tipping comes the potential for durable market power and substantial barriers to entry.”43 He went on to say that using Section 2 to challenge acquisitions in platform markets is a possible “solution” because it would allow the government to “put greater emphasis on a pattern of conduct.”44
A focus on a course of conduct essentially amounts to a “monopoly broth” theory, which, as Professor Daniel Crane has explained, “is susceptible to misuse, particularly if applied to species of conduct whose legality depends on a developed conduct-specific test.”45 More specifically, “[i]n such cases, the prima facie legality of the conduct should be determined on a practice-by-practice basis. Any conduct that does not meet the relevant conduct-specific test should not be allowed to count toward liability or any other issue. In particular, plaintiffs should not be allowed to invoke ‘monopoly broth’ rhetoric in order to defeat established legal tests applicable to different kinds of conduct.”46 In other words, while the aggregation principle may correctly be applied to a series of exclusive-dealing arrangements that in combination resulted in foreclosure, it should not be used when the allegations involve disparate types of conduct. Disparate allegations, such as refusals to deal and predatory pricing or separate and distinct acquisitions, will each have its own conduct-specific test.
A number of circuits have rejected the argument that disparate types of conduct, none of which is anticompetitive by itself, can be combined to create antitrust liability. For example, the Fifth Circuit in Retractable Technologies. v. Dickinson held that “[e]ach of the[] theories must be separately analyzed in light of settled principles of antitrust law.”47 Similarly, the Second Circuit in City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power held that, “[e]ven though many of the issues the [plaintiffs] raise are interrelated and interdependent, however, we must . . . analyze the various issues individually.”48 The Federal Circuit in Intergraph v. Intel adopted the Second Circuit’s approach, stating: “we reject the notion that if there is a fraction of validity to each of the basic claims and the sum of the fractions is one or more, the plaintiffs have proved a violation of section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act.”49
And, it is not as if the Agencies are wholly without recourse for dealing with a series of acquisitions; they can challenge the last deal in the series that “tipped” the market to monopoly.
  
Conclusion
To rely upon the causation standard in Microsoft for the proposition that the government in Section 2 cases is absolved of its obligation to prove that a merger resulted in actual anticompetitive effects is to ignore both the explicit wording and the factual context of that decision. Similarly, to claim that Section 2 presents a “lower bar” than Section 7 ignores both the historical relationship between the Clayton and Sherman Acts and the more defense-friendly efficiency standard of Section 2.
Going even further to suggest that evidence of intent is a substitute for evidence of effect, i.e., of actual harm to competition, ignores over 30 years of case law making clear that antitrust is concerned about the actual effects of a merger (or other conduct) in the relevant market. Relying upon intent evidence is particularly problematic in a challenge to a consummated merger because the government should be able to produce actual evidence of what happened in the market; there is no reason to speculate about what could have been possible.
Lastly, relying upon a course of conduct theory to say that two innocuous mergers add to one problematic merger is, at best, a misuse of the theory in that it would apply it to disparate conduct as opposed to conduct such a series of exclusive dealing arrangements. A proper enforcement action would seek to block—or, if consummated, to undo—the last merger in the series that tipped the market into undue monopoly power.

12 Id. at 71 (“By ensuring that the ‘majority’ of all IAP subscribers are offered IE either as the default browser or as the only browser, Microsoft’s deals with the IAPs clearly have a significant effect in preserving its monopoly; they help keep usage of Navigator below the critical level necessary for Navigator or any other rival to pose a real threat to Microsoft’s monopoly.”). The court explained that “[b]rowser usage share is important because, . . . a browser (or any middleware product, for that matter) must have a critical mass of users in order to attract software developers to write applications relying upon the APIs it exposes, and away from the APIs exposed by Windows.” Id. at 60.
13 The unifying theme of foreclosure models is “that the potential entrant (or current rival) could, absent the exclusionary contracts, attract a sufficient mass of retailers to cover its fixed costs of entry, but that the monopolist’s contracts with retailers prevent the potential entrant from doing so. A consensus has emerged that the necessary condition for anticompetitive harm arising from allegedly exclusionary agreements is that the contracts foreclose rivals from a share of distribution sufficient to achieve minimum efficient scale.” Joshua D.

23 During a May 19, 2020 panel discussion, Ian Conner, the Director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, relied upon two cases—Realcomp v. FTC and McWayne v.

Realcomp, however, is a Section 1, not a Section 2, case. In McWayne, the court concluded that substantial evidence supported the government’s allegations of actual anticompetitive effects and the defendant failed to put forth any legitimate business justifications. As such, McWayne falls within the narrow exception created in Microsoft for the application of the “reasonably capable” standard. Realcomp II, Ltd. v.

EU regulators are seeking feedback from users and digital service providers before drafting rules that could rein in Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and other tech companies, an EU document seen by Reuters showed. A 43-page questionnaire to be sent to members of the public, digital services providers and EU governments in coming weeks covers topics such as the power of “gatekeepers”, online platforms’ liability for illegal or harmful content, gig economy workers and transparency around online advertising.
The feedback will guide the European Commission’s digital unit in drafting the Digital Services Act to replace the two-decade old e-commerce directive which governs online services in the 27-country bloc.
Respondents will be asked what they consider makes a company a gatekeeper, with options including a having large user base or holding a trove of data, market share in terms of turnover or how hard it is for users to switch to a rival.
The new act also seeks to define online platforms’ responsibility and whether they should be more proactive in removing illegal or harmful content and products.
The document shows EU regulators are considering whether all online platforms, or only larger ones or those at particular risk of exposure to illegal activities by their users, should be subjected to take-down notices, and how prescriptive these should be.

368,"May 20, 2020",Convergence in the Time of Cholera: What Lies Ahead for the International Antitrust Agenda,"

By Vinicius Marques de Carvalho (VMCA Advogados)1
 
Introduction
The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many reflections regarding public policies on several different levels. As with any exercise on understanding the present to predict future outcomes, these reflections are multiple and influenced by a specific view about how institutions and individuals respond to the current scenario.
On the one side, there are those who, believing in the predominantly exogenous source of the crisis, identify economic measures needed to overcome or at least minimize its impacts, but that should be put aside as soon as the situation is normalized. On the other side, there are those who, glimpsing a still uncertain future, bet on the continuity of these measures, or even on the more radical transformation of policies and institutions.
My goal with this article is to try to explore how the current economic landscape, the transformations it has put into motion, and the measures adopted by countries to deal with the crisis, can impact a specific aspect of competition policies: its cooperation and convergence agenda. In order to do so, I intend to, first, briefly summarize the central aspects of the international agenda as it currently stands, which was structured notably since the 1990s. Second, to discuss how this agenda had already been facing challenges in the past few years. And finally, to address how the COVID-19 crisis affects this dynamic.
Although I am not able to predict the future, my sense is that some changes are here to stay, not because they represent an abrupt break with the previous context, but precisely for the opposite reason. The changes identified in the international antitrust scenario because of the crisis reveal an acceleration of a trend towards the “nationalization” of competition policies that certainly will impact convergence, at least on a substantial level.
 
The International Antitrust Landscape: From the 1990s to Today
The 1990s saw the explosion of the number of competition agencies throughout the world, owing to structural reforms in many countries that were undergoing trade opening, privatization, and deregulation.2 In other words, it was influenced by an agenda of economic openness aligned with the structuring of global markets, propelled by the nascent global value chain. This movement was influenced not only by commerce, but also by production, which led the development of food, sanitary, technological, and monetary security to also be included in the new global order, built with reference to this interdependent network of contractual relations, owing to the long-term stability conferred by a competitively healthy environment.
In pursuit of this goal, several legal institutions had to be created to guarantee a somewhat universal rule of law. From the point of view of competition between companies, this movement required the building of converging competition policies. That movement did not lead to the creation of an international competition authority, but to the consolidation of continuous institutional learning led by the OECD and the International Competition Network, that stimulated this agenda by means of a consistent advocacy strategy, carried out on three fronts: (i) institutional, (ii) procedural, and (iii) substantial.
Therefore, for the past 30 years, the world has come to understand that an effective antitrust policy entails its implementation by an independent agency – from the political and budgetary point of view – carried out by a stable and well-trained bureaucracy, commanded by authorities with fixed terms. Procedurally speaking, the observation of due process, transparency and motivated decision-making, in order to ensure a level playing field for companies regardless of their nationality, came to be expected. And lastly, this required decision-making to be carried out with reference to the most advanced theories of harm, supported by the neoclassical market efficiency model. The idea of a universal economic science, whose laws could be applied in any context, is an essential condition for this convergent agenda. In short, it states that the evaluation of competitive effects running from an economic agent’s strategy can be calculated, and that its results are the direct expression of a normative reference.
 
Consolidating the International Agenda: Substantive Developments
This convergence on substance was gradually consolidated in the three main enforcement antitrust fronts: cartels, mergers, and unilateral conduct. In cartel enforcement, the world experienced the building of an agenda for the fight against international cartels, by means of the strengthening of leniency programs in many jurisdictions, following the U.S. model. These efforts, which created stronger ties between agencies and threw companies into a rush to set down markers, was instrumental to the structuring of reasonably equitable global chains and to the discouragement of export cartels as a tool of industrial policy.
As for mergers and unilateral conduct, regardless of the differences in tools and fundamentals between European and American policies, with time, these jurisdictions built up cooperation and came to share a minimum common vocabulary in their efforts. Even though there have been divergences in the evaluation of the competitive impacts of certain practices and on the drafting of remedies, it remains true that cooperation developed in these areas as well, and that dialogue on certain premises was structured.
Despite the efforts of international think tanks to remain active and of authorities’ good will to maintain a cooperative environment, the fact is that the substantial foundations of this agenda have been shaken by several forces in the past years, and lately by the coronavirus pandemic.
 
The Shaken International Agenda: Recent Setbacks
Perhaps a victim of its own success, the fight against international cartels has recently lost its momentum. The number of leniency applications has dropped, and some time has passed since the last big ex-officio operation against an international cartel took place – which is not to say cartels are not still out there, operating in more sophisticated ways, perhaps even making use of algorithms and artificial intelligence. Two factors from the current crisis contribute to potentially aggravate this scenario. First, there is evidence that we are undergoing a questioning of the global chain value, owing to its instability in guaranteeing safety in the supply of essential products. That may lead to its restructuring to a degree still hard to foresee. And if that does happen, the very object of international cartels may no longer exist, at least as a priority for competition authorities.
Second, some authorities have been allowing national companies to fight for their survival by way of cooperative practices. Though not all cooperation is a synonym of collusion, the fact remains that this strategy can be summarized by the idea that it is better to open the way for differentiated, and even attenuated, forms of competition in the present – which in turn preserves both jobs and companies – so that companies can come to compete more vigorously in the future, than pressure for a pattern of competitiveness that, by generating instability, leads to bankruptcy and, in the end, to less competition overall.
This debate was already present in merger analysis before the crisis. It became clear with the criticism by France and Germany of DG Comp’s decision in Siemens/Alstom. The ministers of the economy from both countries signed a manifesto defending a European industrial policy for the 21st century, claiming that new investments were needed for Europe to remain competitive at a global level, and that the success of long-term strategies, such as a carbon-neutral economy, could only be attained by joint financial and technical efforts from Member States.3
The document discusses the need for the rebranding of European antitrust law, in a way that takes industrial organization into account in its decision-making, owing to the supposed inexistence of effectively equal competition at an international scale. It proposes that (i) state intervention/control and subsidies are taken into account in merger analysis; (ii) guidelines for merger analysis be updated so that they encompass international competition and future competition, rather than giving more discretionary power to the European Commission in analyzing relevant markets; (iii) the creation of new appeal mechanisms to the European Commission in specific scenarios; and (iv) the promotion of a more transparent landscape for state aid analysis.
In a nutshell, they believe that European antitrust policy should look more carefully to competition from other countries, especially China – that clearly supports its own industry – and the U.S. – that is said to be lenient towards concentrations, notably in digital markets.4 The document also claims that competition policy should protect the market not only from the demand perspective, aiming to protect consumers against price surges, but also from the supply side, aiming to guarantee that competitors are on a level playing field from an international standpoint. In the midst of this debate came the pandemic, which has apparently accelerated these tendencies, leading to greater concern with the sustainability of markets in the long-term and a defense of internal value chains. Whether these tendencies are here to stay, only time will tell.
Lastly, there is enforcement against vertical or unilateral conduct. Here the gap between authorities in terms of substantial convergence was already wide ever since Europe adopted a more energic fight against digital platforms, especially regarding Big Tech, and reactivating views about antitrust enforcement that depart from the neoclassical parameters sedimented by the consumer welfare standard. Although not explicitly, the theories of harm set forth in the European cases against Google, for example, clearly reveal a perspective based on values such as the competitive process and the European market, one that differs from what was sedimented as the international consensus. To a certain degree, that was to be expected, because it is in unilateral conduct analysis that the greatest divergence in terms of anticompetitive effects emerges. Inasmuch as digital platforms’ strategies are in essence global, there is nothing more natural than the emergence of international cooperation to counter it, but, in this case, the level of complexity of the analysis is far greater, as it is based on the rule of reason and demands theories of harm that have yet to be adapted to a context of intensive innovation, competition “for” the market, network effects, market tipping, and enormous difficulties in designing remedies.
 
The Pandemic and its Consequences for Antitrust
As Frédéric Jenny has recently pointed out, with this crisis emerges a discussion of whether the competitive process can adequately allocate resources for society. That has been debated in many countries, that are coming to realize that competition works well when there is economic stability, in other words, when the means of production can, at least potentially, be fully utilized. At the very least, this movement leads to a debate on whether competition authorities should have a more dynamic and long-term understanding of the competitive process.
The tectonic plates of antitrust were already moving due to the aforementioned reasons, having as background the resurfacing of an agenda that searches for competitiveness at a national or regional scale. When a movement such as this emerges – and it is not the first time it has – it sheds light upon a dimension of competition that has never gone away: the competition between States. Depending on the way it takes place, such a movement can become the protagonist of the discussion, with its all-encompassing power.
It is important to emphasize that the origins of these setbacks to the consolidation of international convergence in antitrust are extremely diverse, but they all lead to the adoption of standards adapted to national contexts, in the attenuated version of my hypothesis, and to the revision of the role of antitrust itself in the “regulation” or markets, in the more extreme version of the same hypothesis. This would have a series of institutional repercussions.
In this context, and given their path-dependence, national authorities tend to reinforce their role and try to move on with the management of their institutional obligations, perhaps having to adapt their structures of incentives for deterrence strategies in order to be self-sufficient regarding policies in other countries. However, the crisis severely impacts productive structures and may lead to the revamping of ruinous competition theories, that at first sight can help justify the agenda for market survival, but at a second glance may serve as a pretext for instrumentalizing a movement towards concentration to face the challenges of a new world order. But that is the topic of a different discussion.

369,"May 18, 2020",India Questions WhatsApp Over Digital Payments Services,"


Facebook’s WhatsApp could be abusing its position of power in India by stealthily offering payment options, according to Reuters.
There was a complaint filed in mid-March that the messenger app was being used to offer Indian consumers a new digital payment service that circumvents Indian authoritative channels.
WhatsApp is at a crucial moment in India as it tries to get its payment service off the ground. The messenger app has been beta-testing that service with 1 million users in the country. The service, which allows inter-bank fund transfers within the app, has not been authorized to go out to the entire country yet.
The bundling of the messenger and payment service, though, could end up violating antitrust laws with too much consolidation of services in the same app, Reuters reported, citing a source.
The antitrust complaint has been leveled at both Facebook and WhatsApp, but India’s watchdog, Competition Commission of India (CCI), stated only WhatsApp needs to be investigated. The complainant has not been investigated, although some reports said a lawyer made the complaint.
The payment service will face India’s other payments giants like Paytm, which is backed by Softbank, and Google’s payment service. Both of them have tens of millions of Indian users.
WhatsApp’s payment service is unlike others in that it is based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) standard, so users don’t have to enter a net banking password or ID to send or receive money.
Amid all of this, ICICI Bank recently began offering banking services via WhatsApp, finding the messaging service an easy way to do business during the coronavirus pandemic. Executive Director Anup Bagchi said it would likely be helpful for customers to be able to multitask by doing banking while on social media at the same time.
The move into the digital payments space comes as WhatsApp also considers getting into the loan business for its user base in India.

370,"May 17, 2020",House Judiciary Inquiry into Competition in Digital Markets: Statement of Herbert Hovenkamp,"
By Herbert Hovenkamp (University of Pennsylvania)
This is a response to a query from the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, requesting my views about the adequacy of existing antitrust policy in digital markets.The statutory text of the United States antitrust laws is very broad, condemning all anticompetitive restraints on trade, monopolization, and mergers and interbrand contractual exclusion whose effect “may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.” Federal judicial interpretation is much narrower, however, for several reasons. One is the residue of a reaction against excessive antitrust enforcement in the 1970s and earlier. However, since that time antitrust has shifted very far in the other direction. Today the marginal antitrust decision is much more likely to reflect under- rather than overenforcement. A second reason is the fact that many judges obtained any antitrust training they received a quarter century or more ago. Since then, notable progress in theoretical and empirical economics has both improved our techniques of analysis and shown the need for greater enforcement, particularly in markets with a significant technological or digital component. A third is a naivete about efficiencies, which assumes that they explain many more anticompetitive practices than they do in fact. Finally, a fourth is residue of a belief, once widespread, that markets tend naturally to self-correct, resulting in a bias against enforcement. These same developments in economics indicate that this proposition is false, and that we have paid a heavy price for it in the form of lower output, unnecessarily high price-cost margins, and reduced innovation.The federal judiciary exhibits a damaging anti-enforcement bias in some areas of antitrust. For example, the Supreme Court has been unreasonably harsh in defining the burden that plaintiffs must meet in rule of reason cases. A plaintiff’s obligation should be to provide evidence of power and a sufficiently suspicious restraint that it requires an explanation. At that point the burden of proof should shift to the defendant. Important Supreme Court decisions require plaintiffs to prove far too much at the beginning. The result is that the rule of reason has lost much of its usefulness as an enforcement tool. The Court has also been unnecessarily harsh on class actions, and more particularly on enforcement of arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act was intended to provide a different, less cumbersome forum, not to take away rights that the law grants.When applying antitrust in digital markets direct measurement of market power, rather than by indirect inference from market share, is often superior. For example, to state that “Google and Facebook control 70% of digital advertising” tells us little unless we know the extent to which digital advertising competes with more traditional advertising media. By contrast, if we include traditional advertising in the market, we treat the two forms as perfect competitors, which understates market power. Market definition is necessarily binary: something is either inside or outside the market. In general, market definitions that include differentiated products will understate power. One unfortunate roadblock to direct measurement is the Supreme Court’s conclusion in its American Express decision that a relevant market must be defined in cases involving vertical relationships. Any statutory reform for dealing with digital commerce should make clear that market power for antitrust purposes should be measured by the best available technique for the situation, and it should avoid the error of continuously expressing market power in terms of a market share of a relevant market.The large digital platforms do not likely have enough market power in product markets to be deemed “monopolists.” One exception may be Amazon’s large share of the eBook market. There is ample market power, however, to support many allegations of anticompetitive contract practices, including exclusive dealing, MFN clauses, and tying.Various proposals to break up large digital platforms appear to see size itself as the wrong to be proscribed and offer little assurance that price or output will improve. The opposite is more likely. Setting aside recent mergers, breaking up highly integrated digital platforms will do serious harm to both consumers and investors. While exclusionary contract practices might be unlawful, they are not justifications for structural relief. Rather the remedy should be a prohibitory injunction plus, where appropriate, disgorgement of unlawfully obtained gains. To that end, the Seventh Circuit’s 2020 Credit Bureau decision limiting the equitable power of the FTC to obtain disgorgement is both bad policy and, in any event, inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.Antitrust policy should also avoid overly categorical conclusions about the impact of large platform practices on certain groups. For example, while some small businesses who compete with Amazon are undoubtedly harmed, many others are benefitted because Amazon has effectively become their internet broker. They receive access to internet distribution tools including billing and collection that they could not match on their own.One issue in the digital economy that may require new legislation is firms who renege anticompetitively on FRAND patent licensing commitments. Many substantial networks, including telecommunications, video technologies, and autonomous vehicles, are the product of collaborative innovation. These networks require both technological compatibility and interconnection, which is facilitated by firm commitments to license their patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. If one firm is able to renege on these commitments with impunity, others will certainly follow. The result will be the unraveling of a system of cooperative innovation that has made significant contributions in an area where economic growth is high. Here, much depends on the outcome of the Qualcomm litigation currently in the Ninth Circuit.One pressing merger threat is widespread digital platform acquisitions of much smaller firms. Many of these acquisitions do not fit into the framework that the antitrust Agencies apply. First, the acquisitions of competitors typically involve firms that are too small to trigger scrutiny under existing law. Many troublesome acquisitions involve complementary products, such as when a platform acquires a technology that improves its messaging abilities or augments its product line. The principal threat is potential competition: these acquisitions foreclose the possibility that these firms will grow into significant players themselves. Analyzing platform acquisitions will require more categorical treatment of a class of practices, as antitrust currently does with its per se rule. One promising solution would be to prohibit such acquisitions broadly, but permit dominant firms to obtain nonexclusive rights in acquired technology.Finally, I offer some thoughts about the wisdom of two-agency antitrust enforcement, as well as current policy conflicts between the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission on digital competition issues.

A bipartisan group of senators are sounding the antitrust enforcement alarm Friday over Facebook’s newly announced acquisition of Giphy, a GIF-making and sharing website, reported The Verge. 
On Friday, Facebook announced that it would acquire Giphy for the reported price of $400 million. Giphy is one of the largest GIF sites on the internet and social media and messaging services like Twitter, Tinder, Slack and iMessage already have Giphy integrated into their apps. 
In a Friday blog post, Facebook said that half of Giphy’s traffic comes from Facebook apps and that the gif website would be rolled into Instagram, a Facebook-owned product. In that same post, Facebook suggested that Giphy’s core function as a GIF-sharing app across social media would not change and that developers would “continue to have the same access” to its services.
Still, that pledge hasn’t quieted the growing chorus of congresspeople concerned over potential anti-competitive behavior from Facebook. In statements Friday, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Democrats Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) were skeptical of the deal. 
“Facebook keeps looking for even more ways to take our data,” Hawley said in a statement to The Verge. “Just like Google purchased DoubleClick because of its widespread presence on the internet and ability to collect data, Facebook wants Giphy so it can collect even more data on us. Facebook shouldn’t be acquiring any companies while it is under antitrust investigation for its past purchases.”

372,"May 14, 2020",AmEx: Beyond Transaction Platforms and Section 1,"

By Douglas H. Ginsburg & Koren W. Wong-Ervin*
The Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in Ohio v. American Express (AmEx) sparked a number of debates over its meaning and scope. Those debates have been rekindled by recent decisions in FTC v. Surescripts and U.S. v. Sabre. The debates focus on (1) whether AmEx is limited to two-sided transaction platforms, (2) the proper way to measure competitive effects, and (3) whether AmEx is limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. This Article provides legal and economic analysis of these issues.
 
The AmEx Decision
The Court in AmEx applied the rule of reason under Section 1 of the Sherman Act to analyze the competitive effects of vertical restraints that AmEx imposed upon merchants, which prevented them from steering customers toward other payment media that were less costly to the merchant. The Court held that the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) failed to satisfy the “first step” of the three-step, burden-shifting framework because it focused on only one side of the two-sided market at issue. Specifically, the Court held that, while the DOJ showed AmEx’s allegedly anticompetitive conduct increased the fees AmEx charged to merchants, because it did not take account of offsetting benefits to cardholders, that did not suffice to prove the conduct had a net anticompetitive effect in the market for credit card transactions. The Court instructed that “[t]o demonstrate anticompetitive effects on the two-sided credit-card market as a whole, the plaintiffs must prove that AmEx’s anti-steering provisions increased the cost of credit-card transactions above a competitive level, reduced the number of credit-card transactions, or otherwise stifled competition in the credit-card market.”1 In other words, the Court required an integrated competitive-effects analysis, i.e. one that takes account of all sides of a platform, and it rejected the separate-effects assumption that harm to consumers on one side of the platform means there has been harm to competition.
The Court also held that, “[i]n two-sided transaction markets, only one market should be defined.”2 The Court defined “transaction platforms” as two-sided platforms that “facilitate a single, simultaneous transaction between participants.”3 The Court went on to say that “[t]he key feature of transaction platforms is that they cannot make a sale to one side of the platform without simultaneously making a sale to the other.”4
 
AmEx Beyond “Transaction Platforms”
There has been much debate about whether AmEx is limited to transaction platforms, with some economists criticizing the Court’s distinction between transaction and non-transaction platforms.5 As the Global Antitrust Institute has explained, even with non-transaction platforms, it may be necessary to consider both sides of the platform in order to assess accurately the competitive effects of particular conduct.6 We believe the decision provides legal support for this economic conclusion. Indeed, AmEx is best understood to imply that an integrated competitive-effects analysis should be conducted for any platform that exhibits pronounced indirect network effects or interdependent demand. Indirect network effects occur when the value obtained by a customer on one side of the platform increases with the number of customers on the another side of the platform; e.g. video game developers value video game consoles more when there are more game users, whilst game users value consoles that have more games.7 Interdependent demand refers to a situation in which profit maximization requires taking all sides of the platform into account.
The Court deemed “transaction platforms” a “special type” (or subcategory) of two-sided platforms.8 The Court defined a “two-sided platform” as one that “offers different products or services to two different groups who both depend on the platform to intermediate between them.”9 According to the Court, all two-sided platforms (the umbrella term), not just the subset of transaction-platforms, differ from “traditional markets” in that, among other things, they exhibit indirect network effects. The Court went on to explain that “[t]wo-sided platforms, therefore, must take these indirect network effects into account before making a change in price on either side.” As such, “[p]rice increases on one side of the platform . . . do not suggest anticompetitive effects without some evidence that they have increased the overall cost of the platform services.”10
The Court then said “it is not always necessary to consider both sides of a two-sided platform. A market should be treated as one sided when the impacts of indirect network effects and relative pricing in that market are minor.” “Not always necessary” obviously implies it is sometimes necessary, even for non-transaction markets, to consider effects on both (all) sides of a platform. As the Court explained, whether it is necessary turns upon the strength of the network effects. The Court’s further statement that two-sided transaction markets are a special type of two-sided platform because they “exhibit more pronounced indirect network effects and interconnected pricing demand” does not imply that AmEx applies only to this transactional subset of two-sided markets. Simply put, an integrated competitive-effects analysis is in order whenever a two-sided platform has pronounced indirect network effects, and the Court identified the subset of “transactional platforms” as one example in this subset that can be assumed to have meaningful indirect network effects. The Sabre decision, in which the court held that, under AmEx, “it is always necessary to consider both sides of the subset group of two-sided transaction platforms,” is consistent with this insight. Given that the Sabre court concluded the platform at issue constituted a transaction platform, it did not reach the issue whether, or when, the analysis may be necessary for non-transaction platforms.11
The crucial question then becomes how significant must the indirect network effects be to trigger the requirement of an integrated competitive-effects analysis. The Court was imprecise on this issue: “Indirect network effects exist where the value of the two-sided platform to one group of participants depends on how many members of a different group participate.”12 It also suggested that unidirectional effects are less important than are bidirectional effects, distinguishing newspapers from the credit-card market on the ground that “in the newspaper-advertisement market, the indirect network effects operate in only one direction; newspaper readers are largely indifferent to the amount of advertising that a newspaper contains. Because of these weak indirect network effects, the market for newspaper advertising behaves much like a one-sided market and should be analyzed as such.”13 Ultimately, the Court’s rationale for its holding on competitive effects is that, with transaction platforms, “[t]o optimize sales, the network must find the balance of pricing that encourages the greatest number of matches between cardholders and merchants.” In other words, the Court recognized the importance of interdependencies of demand, which imply a profit-maximizing firm will take into account effects on both sides of the platform.
Antitrust analysis, of course, requires an understanding of firm behavior. Here, there is no reason for the AmEx platform to exist if not to facilitate transactions between two sides. As David Evans says of platforms generally, “The platform reduces transaction costs by acting as an intermediary between the two sides and thereby organizing and facilitating trade between different types of customers. This trade increases economic efficiency and surplus for the participants, since, by its nature, trade makes both parties better off.”14
In a recent article, former Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Commissioner Joshua Wright and former FTC economist John Yun explain why, as a matter of economics, the question whether an integrated competitive-effects analysis should be conducted turns on whether there are meaningful interdependencies of demand.15 As the Global Antitrust Institute has explained, “[w]hile payment card platforms are distinct for having a fixed proportion of consumption on the two sides, the importance of this distinction can be overstated.”16 Even with respect to non-transaction platforms, to assess the relative participation level on one side of the platform it is necessary to consider the participation level of the other side. “Profit maximization still depends on a joint assessment of the pricing and volume on multiple sides. Whether the volume on each side is a precise 1-to-1 matching or something highly correlated does not change this fundamental fact.”17
Take operating systems for example. An operating system provides an interface between hardware devices, such as a computer or a smartphone, and software applications, such as a word processor. A successful operating system requires attracting both users and application developers. Users value an operating system more when more applications are written for it, and software developers value it more when more consumers are offered their product. While there is no single, simultaneous transaction or shared output between the two sides, the attractiveness of the platform to users will affect revenues to applications developers, and revenues to applications developers will affect the supply of applications to users. As Rochet and Tirole have explained, this is “why prices on various sides are economically related and do not amount to a comparison of the ‘apples’ on one side of the market with the ‘oranges’ of the other. The ‘link’ between the prices are the externalities—i.e., the cross-group effects between the various groups.”18
In his AmEx dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer suggests that this interrelationship is no different than that of complements in setting prices in a single-sided market.19 Rochet and Tirole address how the different sides of a platform differ from complements: “The interaction between the two sides gives rise to strong complementarities, but the corresponding externalities are not internalized by end users, unlike in the multiproduct literature (the same consumer buys the razor and the razor blade).”20 While there can be interrelated demand for complements, the issue is one of degree.
All this is to say that two-sided platforms form a continuum, with the degree of interdependent demand being the key determinant of whether an integrated competitive-effects analysis should be conducted. An integrated analysis is particularly appropriate when the alleged practice is inherently two-sided, such as the anti-steering rule in AmEx, which was designed to balance the interests on both sides of the platform.
  
Market-Wide Output as the Proper Measure of Competitive Effects
AmEx supports the (economically sound) position that, at least for markets involving transaction platforms, changes in market wide output, rather than in price, should be the indicator of changes in consumer welfare. In analyzing competitive effects, the Court quoted its earlier decision in Brooke Group to say: “Where . . . output is expanding at the same time prices are increasing, rising prices are equally consistent with growing product demand.”21 The Court also repeated its understanding that “[m]arket power is the ability to raise price profitably by restricting output.”22 The dissent took issue with this point, saying “the majority retreats to saying that even net price increases do not matter after all, absent a showing of lower output.”23 As the Global Antitrust Institute has explained, the Court’s point is particularly important in a platform market because “price is a significantly noisier signal of consumer welfare [there] than it is in a single-sided market. Prices might appear simultaneously as predatory on one side . . . and supra-competitive on the other side . . . . In contrast, the output levels on both sides are either identical or at least highly correlated.”24
 
AmEx Beyond Section 1
There is also a debate over whether AmEx is limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. In Sabre, the court held that “for purposes of understanding AmEx, there is no meaningful distinction between Section 1 Sherman Act claims and a Section 7 Clayton Act merger challenge.”25 The court then applied AmEx’s two-sided-markets framework to the DOJ’s Section 7 challenge of Sabre’s proposed acquisition of Farelogix, rejecting the DOJ’s suggestion that AmEx applies only to the credit-card industry.26 In possible contrast, some interpret FTC v. Surescripts as limiting AmEx to Section 1. A close reading, however, reveals that the court in Surescripts distinguished AmEx not on the ground that it does not apply outside Section 1, but rather on the ground that AmEx involved a non-monopolist, whereas it was undisputed that Surescripts had monopoly power.27 Indeed, the court applied AmEx in the respect relevant here, as had the FTC in its complaint, which alleged the defendant’s exclusionary practices had raised “the net price [of its services] (taking into account both sides of the network).”28 In any event, limiting the two-sided market framework of AmEx to Section 1 cases would make no sense given that the economic underpinnings of the case apply to all two-sided transaction platforms (as well as non-transaction platforms that exhibit meaningful indirect network effects), particularly when the conduct at issue is itself two sided. For example, in a predatory pricing case, a platform’s decision to price in a way that subsidizes the more elastic side is two-sided conduct given the interdependent demand.
 
Conclusion
The answers to the questions we have addressed about the meaning and applicability of AmEx are of critical importance to getting the analysis right in future cases. Our examination of both the reasoning in AmEx and the relevant economic principles supports the conclusions that: (1) AmEx is not limited to transaction platforms, but instead applies to all two-sided platforms that exhibit meaningful indirect network effects; (2) changes in market-wide output are the best indicator of competitive effects in two-sided markets; and (3) the economic principles underlying AmEx hold for two-sided platforms, especially when the conduct at issue is two-sided, regardless of the antitrust cause of action in suit, whether Section 1 or another.

373,"May 11, 2020",Potential and Nascent Competition in FTC Merger Enforcement in Health Care Markets,"
Continuing calls for more vigorous enforcement against mergers and acquisitions by digital technology platforms increasingly focus on deals involving potential and nascent competitors.  The FTC has been applying future competition theories in the healthcare sector for years, including litigating the government’s first merger challenge on actual potential competition grounds since the mid-80s. It also challenged mergers under Section 2 “nascent competition” theories, a close cousin of an actual potential competition, in two recent matters. This paper examines Agency’s experience in these cases, highlights some of the differences between the two approaches, and suggests how the FTC may apply this thinking in other contexts, including acquisitions by technology platforms.

I. INTRODUCTION
Popular interest in antitrust has been growing significantly in recent years, fueled in large part by a concern about what (if anything) can or should be done about “big tech.” Critics argue that these companies owe their dominance, at least in part, to “hundreds of mergers,” most of which involve what they term “nascent competitors.”2 While acquisitions of future competitors are gaining attention in the technology sector, the FTC has been scrutinizing these types of deals in the healthcare sector for years. Experience with the FTC’s approach to these transactions may provide a roadmap to how the agency may evaluate transactions in othe...

374,"May 11, 2020",Non-Compete Agreements: Might They be Procompetitive in Healthcare?,"
There have been recent calls for nationwide bans on non-compete agreements. Such sentiment is no surprise in healthcare, particularly in physician labor markets. And yet there are many procompetitive justifications for non-compete agreements where they are an important tool to encourage investment. It is well-recognized that these agreements protect investments that would otherwise be expropriated due to hold-up, including trade secrets, customer relationships, recruitment of unique employees, specific training, and specialized capital investment. Healthcare settings often necessitate many of these investments simultaneously, and as a result, investment hold-up is often a significant issue. Empirical literature supports the view that non-compete agreements help promote investment in healthcare. Further, bans to non-compete agreements risk discouraging investment and furthering problems in many healthcare settings that are already facing shortages. We urge a more comprehensive view of non-compete agreements that includes consideration of the investments they help facilitate.

375,"May 11, 2020","First of All, Do No Harm: New Directions in EU Antitrust Enforcement Regarding Pharmaceuticals","
The recent Paroxetine and CMA v. Pfizer/Flynn cases confirm the EU approach to pay-for-delay, respectively establish a workable approach to excessive pharmaceutical pricing at least regarding non-innovative drugs. This enables antitrust consolidation regarding further such cases. New directions in the application of EU antitrust law to the pharmaceutical sector can now be identified as a next step. These include an increased focus on biosimilars, the pursuit of excessive pricing cases where patents and regulatory exclusivity are involved, and scrutinizing the confluence of pharmaceuticals with digital services. This reflects the need to balance competition and innovation, and more broadly, the need for speed in order to effectively preserve fair and competitive markets.

The European and U.S. Approaches to Antitrust and Tech: Setting the Record Straight – A Reply to Gregory J. Werden and Luke M. Froeb’s Antitrust and Tech: Europe and the United States Differ, and It Matters1
By Maria Coppola & Renato Nazzini2
 
In the October 2019 CPI Chronicle, Greg Werden & Luke Froeb identify ten differences between the European and American approaches to single firm conduct enforcement. These differences, they claim, explain how Europe systemically differs from the United States in ways that affect enforcement against the tech giants. Werden & Froeb “lift the hoods on the antitrust enforcement machines in US and EC” in order to identify “hard-wired differences” in each jurisdiction’s approach to single firm conduct. While acknowledging that their article may be seen as overly simplistic, they identify ten meaningful differences as “essential truths.”
There is no doubt that competition agencies in Europe have brought many single firm conduct enforcement cases against the tech giants, and some of the cases would be unlikely to be brought under U.S. law.3 While Werden & Froeb make some key points with which we agree, in unpacking the “meaningful differences” to identify their asserted “essential truths,” Werden & Froeb’s selective viewfinder results in a mischaracterization of important areas of European law and court decisions. This reply addresses, in order, all ten differences identified by Werden & Froeb.4 This reply is not a line by line rebuttal, nor a refutation of every point that Werden & Froeb have identified. Instead, it offers a more fulsome discussion of the issues they raise, with the goal of providing a more accurate and complete view of European competition law and policy as it compares with U.S. law and enforcement practice.
 
Difference 1. The European system is driven by competitor complaints 
Werden & Froeb posit that complaining to the European Commission pays off, and that the European Commission is driven by competitor complaints, whereas the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies often leave it to the complainants to bring cases on their own. The differences between the U.S. and the European private enforcement systems, which remain significant even after the implementation of the Damages Directive in the European Union,5 and material cultural divergences in understanding the role of government in policing the economy, undeniably influence the allocation of resources between public and private enforcement.6 Some observers argue that the U.S.’s particular system of private rights that are afforded in litigation, including the availability of treble damages, fee shifting, contingency fees, liberal discovery, and class actions, has increased the bar for bringing monopolization cases precisely because the judiciary seeks to limit the availability of these powerful rewards by modifying doctrine governing liability standards to evaluate the worthiness of private claims.7
However, it is not clear what Werden & Froeb really mean by “driven” by competitors. If it means that enforcement action often starts with one or more complaints against an allegedly dominant firm, this is arguably a feature showing that the European system is working well. Particularly in an environment without an active culture of private actions, it is necessary for complainants to “police” the business environment and bring potential infringements to the attention of the competition authorities. This is why formal complainants have been given important rights in the European Union (“EU”), including access to evidence and a non-confidential version of the European Commission’s charge sheet (statement of objections), appearance at oral hearings, and, most notably, standing to challenge the European Commission’s final decision (or the European Commission’s rejection of the complaint). Incentives to become a formal complainant are influenced by these rights. This, however, works in the public interest. Complainants report alleged infringements that may be impossible or excessively difficult for the competition authorities to detect without any input from competitors or customers.
If, however, “driven” by competitors purports to suggest that the European Commission is “captured” by complainants or that the European Commission cannot run cases unless there are well resourced complainants, we believe this is incorrect. Suggesting complainants are the driving force for the cases against the tech giants ignores much of the European Commission’s experience with these cases. In the AdSense case, for example, Microsoft withdrew its complaint more than two years before the European Commission issued an infringement decision. Cases such as Qualcomm had no formal complainants, nor, to our knowledge, are there formal complainants in many of the current tech investigations. It is also worth noting that in some of the tech enforcement actions, the European Commission’s decision bore little resemblance to the original complaints.
Many of the European Commission’s tech cases are ex officio, driven by the Commission’s enforcement agenda; or they began, as many U.S. investigations do, with grievances by competitors, and then are developed by the enforcers who are informed by engagement with the target and third parties, including competitors.
Anecdotally, it appears that informal complaints involving conduct that affects the U.S. and the EU are frequently lodged with agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. However, complainants may choose to focus their efforts in Brussels because Article 102, the EU’s single firm conduct provision, makes a broader swath of conduct illegal.
 
Difference 2. The European system is run by politicians 
Werden & Froeb claim that the European decision-making structure seems “calculated to elevate politics above technical merit.” The European Commission ultimately takes enforcement actions, acting upon the recommendation of its Competition Commissioner, who has sworn an oath of impartiality, and other Commissioners almost never interfere with the recommendation of the Competition Commissioner. The Competition Commissioner’s recommendation is based upon the work of and submissions by the Competition Directorate, DG Competition, as well as review by a cabinet partially staffed by very senior career competition officials from DG Competition. However, we do not deny that the Competition Commissioner, who could be compared to the head of an antitrust agency, may well be, effectively, a politician, which is the case of the current Commissioner, and that, formally, enforcement decisions are taken by a college of politically appointed Commissioners with different portfolios and different agendas. The position is different in the Member States, where most competition agencies are, and all will soon be required to be, independent of the government, though the heads of authority and commissioners are sometimes political appointees without any technical competition expertise. This position, which we agree may not be entirely satisfactory, is not, however, specific to single firm conduct or tech markets. It applies across the board, including to merger control. Furthermore, in practice, historically Competition Commissioners have shown repeatedly a willingness to stand up to parochial interests. Most recently, in 2019, the European Commission, at the recommendation of Commissioner Vestager, blocked the Siemens/Alstom merger against the wishes of the two national EU heavyweights, France and Germany.8
Looking at the history of the federal enforcement agencies in the U.S., most, but not all, agency decision-makers had strong antitrust backgrounds, but many also came from the political world (more frequently from the legislative branch but also the executive), and others without antitrust expertise were nonetheless excellent at their jobs.9
While there is a degree of “politicization” in EU institutional arrangements, on a closer analysis this is not unique to the EU, nor have Werden & Froeb provided evidence that this has had a systematic, or indeed any, impact on past cases.
 
Difference 3. The European system was conceived of as regulation, not as law enforcement
Werden & Froeb state that the European system was conceived of as regulation, not as law enforcement. It is unclear whether the debate as to whether competition enforcement is law enforcement or regulation sheds insight on understanding the differences between the U.S. and the EU approaches to tech. The debate appears to us to be academic, at least to a large extent, but we nevertheless believe that it would be inaccurate to describe the EU system of competition enforcement as “regulation.”10 Like U.S. legal prohibitions, the EU antitrust prohibitions are general in terms of their fundamental structure. Article 102 TFEU, for example, prohibits “any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it.” It is true that Article 102 goes on to set out four examples of abuse, but the EU case law unequivocally states that this list is illustrative, and what matters is whether conduct is, or is not, an abuse of a dominant position, not whether it fits one of the four categories of abuse.11 Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits any “monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize.” If one compares the prohibition of “any abuse of a dominant position” with the prohibition of any “monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize,” the prohibitions are similar in terms of their generality. Under EU law, the key concepts are “abuse” and “dominant position,” whereas in the U.S. the test is what “monopolize” means. 12 The way the case law has construed and applied the prohibition is also, on both sides of the Atlantic, broadly similar in method: the U.S. and the EU Courts have interpreted broad, open-textured prohibitions in light of the policy and economic thinking prevailing at the time, while being responsive to counsel’s arguments on the facts of each individual case. Of course, U.S. and EU case law differ in their approaches to given problems. We provide two examples to illustrate this point: predatory pricing and margin squeeze. In the U.S., for a predation claim to succeed, the plaintiff must show a dangerous probability of recoupment,13 whereas in the EU recoupment is a relevant factor in the assessment of a predatory strategy, but not an element of the infringement.14 Also, in the U.S., margin squeeze is not a standalone infringement,15 where in the EU it may be, under certain circumstances.16 What one could draw from these differences, however, is not any support for the claim that U.S. antitrust law was conceived of as “law enforcement” and EU competition law was conceived of as “regulation.” These differences show, rather, different perceptions and underlying beliefs about the relative importance of type 1 versus type 2 errors and, more generally, different doctrinal approaches by different courts in different jurisdictions.
It is also instructive to recall, from a historical perspective, that in one of the drafts of the Treaty of Rome, the section on competition opened with a general prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality. That prohibition was then removed from the draft on the request of the German delegation, with the agreement of the other delegations, because the view was taken that discrimination on grounds of nationality had nothing to do with competition law.17
It would also be inaccurate to say that EU competition law is “regulation” because it is enforced by the European Commission and national competition authorities (“NCAs”), which are, by and large, administrative authorities rather than courts. The European Commission and the NCAs are required to enforce the competition laws through individual enforcement mechanisms, not to regulate markets. Furthermore, courts have jurisdiction to apply the very same prohibitions regardless of any prior decision by an administrative authority. A firm aggrieved by an alleged abuse of dominance may complain to the European Commission or go straight to court. The European Commission or the court will apply the law, and the decision-maker should not affect the result. Also, when the European Commission or an NCA adopts an infringement decision, that decision is reviewable by a court of full jurisdiction, that is, by a court having the power to review all aspects of the decision, in fact and law.
Finally, to extrapolate – as Werden & Froeb do – that EU competition law is regulation because it prohibits exploitative abuses, including excessive prices, and excessive pricing cases turn the enforcer into a price regulator, is methodologically incorrect. Exploitative abuses are uncommon, as Werden & Froeb rightly recognize, and very much the exception rather than the rule.18 One cannot draw a general conclusion from an “exception.” Furthermore, while we recognise that the very idea of an exploitative abuse is controversial,19 as a matter of principle the test remains a legal test. It is not the case that the European Commission or NCAs can intervene in markets when they believe there is a market failure and regulate the price. What the agencies can do is to determine whether a given price falls afoul of the prohibition or not. This may be complex and certainly debatable as a matter of policy and economics – but does not necessarily turn EU competition law into price regulation as a general proposition, although it is theoretically possible to argue that the exploitative abuse branch of EU competition law has elements of regulation. It is noteworthy, however, that none of the enforcement cases against tech companies is an exploitative abuse case. Werden & Froeb’s argument on this point is, therefore, in any event moot.
 
Difference 4. The European system is grounded in skepticism of markets 
Werden & Froeb argue that the European system is grounded in skepticism of markets. In fact, the European system is grounded in the creation of a single market, a concept firmly grounded in the belief that free trade and an open and competitive economy maximize overall welfare, against the background of a social and economic history that reflects a wariness of conduct by former state monopolies within their traditional areas of dominance. In the EU, from the outset, state monopolies, state-granted benefits and privileges, and state power coopted by private interests posed serious challenges to free and competitive markets. This history of state-run or directed economies impacts the European Commission’s enforcement priorities: more than half of the European Commission’s single firm conduct cases of the past two decades involve telecom, financial services, rail, and electricity, reflecting this economic past. This difference identified by Werden & Froeb is generalized, explaining that the U.S. protects competition, leaving unsaid the decades-old refrain that inevitably follows this statement: that Europe protects competitors at the expense of consumers. Scholars have noted that EU competition law protects the competitive process, stressing market access and the right to contest markets on the merits.20 Guided by Post-Chicago school economics,21 as Professor Eleanor Fox notes, EU competition enforcement reflects the belief that lowering barriers to entry and keeping a clear path for challengers is likely to make the market more dynamic and thus serve consumers better.22 We believe that enforcement in Europe is not guided by a skepticism of markets, but by a marginally different set of beliefs about what rules and forms of intervention make markets work better and tend to optimize overall welfare.
It is also noteworthy that while U.S. law exempts certain forms of state action from the reach of antitrust law, by contrast, the activities of public entities in the EU are fully subject to competition law. EU competition law, through Articles 106 and 107, does not exempt state-owned enterprises or state granted privileges from the application of competition law. In the Greek Lignite case, for example, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) repeated its well established case law, according to which a Member State may be found to have infringed Article 106(1) if its measures create a situation in which a public undertaking or an undertaking on which it has conferred special or exclusive rights, merely by exercising the preferential rights conferred upon it, is led to abuse its dominant position, or when those rights are liable to create a situation in which that undertaking is led to commit such abuses.23 For state action to be compatible with EU law, the exclusive or special rights must be proportionate and not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the public interest objective.
In general, in the area of single firm conduct, the European Commission and Member States have been more inclined to intervene against single firm conduct, whereas in the U.S., single firm conduct enforcement has been more influenced by concerns about the effects of erroneous government enforcement. This does not mean, however, that Europeans are driven by a skepticism of markets or that, in the U.S., government enforcement against single firm conduct is absent. 24
 
Difference 5. The European system lacks the process of U.S. court proceedings
The institutional structure and enforcement process in the EU and the U.S. differ significantly, but both systems allow for a full review by independent courts. In the EU, the European Commission investigates a case, issues a statement of objections, and gives the targets the right to access to evidence the European Commission has relied upon (access to file), the opportunity to submit a written defence, and to request a hearing. The hearing before the European Commission is, of course, nothing like a trial before an impartial court. There is no cross-examination of fact and expert witnesses and no adversarial arguments. The hearing is before the same body that started the investigation, issued the statement of objections, and will ultimately decide the case. However, under EU law, this system requires that any aggrieved party must have a right of appeal before a court of “full jurisdiction,” with the power to review the correctness, not just the lawfulness, of the decision on the facts and on the law. This is not the same as a common law trial, but it is a de novo review.25
At the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), when the Commission finds “reason to believe” that a party has engaged in an “unfair method of competition” and that a proceeding would be in “the interest of the public,” staff can litigate cases either through administrative adjudication before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) and the Commission (“Part III”),26 or through federal court litigation before district courts. In the case of Part III adjudication, the first appeal, available to either complaint counsel (FTC staff) or respondents or both, is an appeal from the ALJ’s initial decision to the Commission. The Commission reviews the ALJ’s decision de novo, meaning that the Commission is not bound by the ALJ’s evidentiary rulings, findings of fact or conclusions of law. The next appeal is only available to the respondent, who can appeal the Commission’s decision to the federal courts. The Commission’s findings of law are reviewed de novo, but they may be given some deference to the extent they involve interpretation and application of the FTC Act. The Court of Appeals is bound by the Commission’s findings of facts, so long as the facts are supported by evidence. The courts have interpreted this language to mean that a “substantial evidence” test applies. This test asks whether the Commission’s findings are supported by “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate,” not whether the reviewing court “making its own appraisal of the testimony, picking and choosing for itself among uncertain and conflicting inferences” would reach the same conclusion. The test is deferential to the FTC.
At the Antitrust Division, the Division acts only as a prosecutor, going to federal court to seek enforcement action. Unless the parties choose to settle the case before trial, enforcement actions will require trial in a federal court. Under the Tunney Act, federal courts review proposed consent decrees in civil antitrust cases filed by the DOJ to ensure that the remedy proposed in the consent is in the public interest, but this does not usually involve a full trial on the merits.
Thus, the U.S. and the EU procedures differ, although it is notable that these differences are not specific to antitrust. They reflect the different legal systems of continental Europe and the United States. They share in common, however, that competition decisions are subject to a full review by independent courts.
One aspect not addressed by Werden & Froeb in this section, but referred to only in passing near the conclusion, is the length of the European Court proceedings. The authors reference the European Commission’s Intel case, with the original decision in 2009, and, as of this writing, is still waiting for a final decision by the General Court after being remanded in 2017 by the ECJ. We note that it is possible for U.S. cases to be lengthy. In the FTC’s Actavis matter, the FTC filed its original complaint in January 2009, which was dismissed by a district court, a decision then reversed by the Supreme Court in 2013, and remanded. The case concluded with a consent decree in February 2019, on the eve of trial, which was scheduled to begin in March. However, while we have not done an empirical examination to compare the timing between the original enforcement action and the final appeal in all cases, we agree that it appears in general to be considerably longer in the EU, which can impact a defendant’s decision on whether or not to pursue an appeal, and thus may impact how defendants view, as a practical matter, their rights of defense.
 
Difference 6. The European system lacks the burden of proof of an adversarial system
As Werden & Froeb accept, the EU system does have a doctrine of the burden of proof,27 even if, as they correctly state, in the administrative proceedings it is the European Commission itself that needs to conclude whether its own burden of proof has been discharged or not. From the perspective of a common law trial, this appears puzzling. In an administrative system, however, it is not unusual for the administrative authority to decide whether, following its own investigation, there is sufficient evidence that allows a determination whether the law has been infringed. The enforcer still must be satisfied to the required legal standard that an infringement has occurred, mindful that the evidence must be persuasive to the courts since the decisions can be appealed to the General Court, and then, on points of law, the ECJ.28 If a decision is appealed, while it is for the applicant to raise specific grounds of appeal, it is for the European Commission to satisfy the court that it has discharged its burden of proof. If the court, at the end of the appeal, believes that there is a doubt as to whether the applicant has infringed EU competition law, the appeal is allowed and the European Commission’s decision annulled.29 One may, of course, prefer a common law trial as the best method to test the evidence and arrive at the truth – as we do –  but it is necessary to recognize that more than half the world, including, but not limited to, the EU and most of its Member States, has administrative authorities that are empowered to find law infringements, not only of antitrust law but of many other sorts of laws, subject to review by the courts. Introducing a common law-style trial at the EU level only to address competition infringements would be out of kilter with the legal system overall. As the U.S. adversarial system is not specific to antitrust, neither is the EU administrative system. Both are well embedded in their respective legal frameworks and traditions and both have advantages and disadvantages. The EU system may have disadvantages, but one of them is not that it lacks the burden of proof of an adversarial system. It lacks a common law trial, but this is not the same thing.
  
Difference 7. The European system does not impeach unsound theories
In Werden & Froeb’s article, this criticism of the European system boils down to the proposition that in the EU there is no mechanism to exclude unreliable economic evidence as there is in the United States under the Daubert rule.30 It may be that all the world should adopt the Daubert rule, and we are open to a debate about its pros and cons. But the jump from being enthusiasts of the Daubert rule to saying that the European system does not impeach unsound theories is itself unsound. Many common law systems do not have a rule similar or equivalent to Daubert. For example, England, the country of origin of the common law, does not have it. Under English law, the reliability of the evidence, including expert evidence, is a matter for the jury or the judge if the trial is by a judge alone. Whether evidence is reliable or not is an issue of fact, not an exclusionary rule. It is not surprising, therefore, that an administrative system such as the European one does not have a Daubert-type of rule. But unsound theories can be and are impeached.
There are several stages in the administrative procedure that provide an opportunity for parties to challenge the European Commission’s economic theories. There are internal checks and balances, such as advice by the Legal Service of the European Commission (completely separate from DG Competition), or by the Chief Economist’s office (which provides an independent view). But, more importantly, whatever economic theory the European Commission relies upon, it must be able to withstand judicial review. While judicial review of matters of complex economic assessment has, historically, been deferential, it is now accepted that the General Court has unfettered jurisdiction to review economic evidence and assessments and set aside the decision under appeal if it disagrees with the assessment of the European Commission. This has happened, recently, in the Servier pay-for-delay case, in which the General Court disagreed with the European Commission’s market definition and set aside the decision in part.31 And it happened, famously, in three mergers cases in the early noughts, when the EU Courts set aside three merger decisions in short sequence in Airtours, Schneider, and Tetra Laval.32
There is also the important role of the Advocate General (“AG”) in criticizing what might be considered to be “unsound” ideas. In many cases, for example in the AG opinions in Coty and Intel, the AG provided trenchant analyses of the state of the literature in order to attack specific ideas, and to guide the ECJ toward a better line of reasoning. While the Court is ultimately free to disregard the opinion, the AG is nonetheless an influential voice about arguments that should be retained and those that should be discarded.
Finally, in some Member States, economic experts retained by the parties have a special duty to the court to present their views in a way that improves the court’s understanding of the matter and not to engage in simple advocacy. Put another way, the expert has a responsibility to the court and not simply to the client. European judges and economic consultants explain that this tempers advocacy, and discourages the presentation of arguments and interpretations that might in some sense be considered “unsound.”33
While cross examination in court may be a more effective mechanism for impeaching unsound theories (as Werden & Froeb argue), it is not the only way to ensure that enforcement action is economically sound. There are a number of ways in which agencies and courts in Europe can weed out unsound theories.
  
Difference 8. The European system maintains a low bar for anticompetitive effects
We accept that the effects threshold required to prove an infringement is a difference between the U.S. and the EU systems.34 The EU generally requires a lower bar for foreclosure, but there is a diversity among the types of conduct that Werden & Froeb ignore. For example, in Generics (UK) Ltd v CMA, the ECJ found that a branded pharmaceutical company’s overall contractual strategy could be capable of restricting competition and of producing exclusionary effects going beyond the specific anticompetitive effects of the individual agreements. The Court in essence said that the cumulative effect may be greater than the individual parts: the Court accepted that an abuse of a dominant position could occur even if the dominant firm’s agreements did not, individually, breach Article 101.35 In the Intel case, the 2017 ECJ decision clarified the role of effects in an analysis of rebate schemes, holding that the dominant firm can overcome the presumption of illegality with substantiated arguments and evidence that the conduct was not capable of restricting competition.36
The effects required depend on the type of conduct at issue. In Google Shopping, the European Commission applied a test of conduct “capable of having, or likely to have, anticompetitive effects,” finding liability based on a demonstration of anticompetitive effects focusing on traffic diversion away from third-party comparison shopping websites, and discussed in less detail the potential anticompetitive effects in the national markets for general search services.37 In Google Android, the European Commission’s decision explains that it is sufficient that the conduct tends to restrict competition or is capable of having that effect, regardless of its success.38 The European Commission’s recent approach in tech cases is, however, not the final word on the matter. There is case law from the Grand Chamber of the ECJ that establishes that, at least in certain circumstances, the anti-competitive effects test should be likely foreclosure of as efficient competitors causing consumer harm. In Post Danmark I, the Court ruled on the standard of foreclosure in predation and held that when the price applied by the dominant undertaking is lower than its average total costs but above its average incremental costs, “it is necessary to consider whether that pricing policy, without objective justification, produces an actual or likely exclusionary effect, to the detriment of competition and, thereby, of consumers’ interests.”39 The European Commission presumably interprets this case as applying only to pricing practices. This is not, however, the only possible interpretation, and it remains to be seen what the EU Courts will say in the Google appeals, for example.
The test for anticompetitive effects under Article 102 is still unclear, and while arguably problematic for some types of abuses, the case law is moving in the direction of an effects-based approach. We agree with Werden & Froeb that the standard in the EU, at least insofar as it is only “capability” to foreclose in certain cases, is low. But we disagree in that the EU case law is much more complex and other tests are applied as well, such as a test of actual or likely foreclosure of “as efficient competitors,” to the detriment of consumers.
 
Difference 9. The European system is receptive to leveraging theories 
Werden & Froeb discuss leveraging in the European tech cases, arguing that leveraging theories in the U.S. are legally cognizable only when monopoly is threatened in the second market, whereas in Europe it is sufficient that competition is distorted in the second market. Most European Commission tech cases involving leveraging theories involve refusals to deal or tying. For the former, the standards for finding liability are demanding.40 For tying cases, the description of the EU standard as only requiring a distortion of competition without any threat of monopolization of the tied market creates the wrong impression that the European Commission intervenes on the basis of a low threshold. In tying cases, the rationale for intervention is concern about potential monopolization in the tied market. While under case law the European Commission needs only to show foreclosure in the tied market, if one examines the cases actually brought, they are consistent with a likelihood of monopolization of the tied market. While a Section 2 tying case in the U.S. may be more demanding with respect to requirements for the secondary market, in the Microsoft cases (2004, tying of media player; 2009, tying of Internet Explorer) and the 2018 Android case, the European Commission considered market power in the tying market (i.e. where the conduct takes place) and the effects in the tied market (i.e. where the effects occur and the likelihood of foreclosure needs to be established).
 
Difference 10. The European system does not recognize competition on the merits 
The European Courts have not defined in a conclusive way what competition on the merits means, and instead use it as a benchmark to define what is not competition on the merits. While there is no hard-edged definition of competition on the merits, the ECJ’s 2017 Intel decision explains that competition by dominant firms has to be efficiency related, which means, for example, lower costs or better quality. The Court relies on the “as efficient competitor” test, concluding that a dominant company can engage in conduct that is more efficient than its competitors and EU competition law does not protect less efficient competitors.
In describing the U.S. approach, the authors claim that in the U.S., courts hold that product improvement is “lawful competition on the merits.” For this claim authors likely rely on cases such as the Ninth Circuit’s Allied Orthopedic v. Tyco. However, while, in the United States, the Microsoft Court noted that U.S. courts “are properly very skeptical about claims that competition has been harmed by a dominant firm’s product design changes,”41 the court also refuted the idea that product design is a safe harbor from antitrust rules.42
In Europe, product improvement arises in Article 102 cases as an objective justification. While this justification has failed generally before the EU Courts, it has proved successful in Article 102 cases in Member States, for example, in Streetmap.com v. Google.43
 
Concluding Remarks
In addition to these ten differences, Werden & Froeb also note other aspects that could influence Europe’s ability to bring tech cases: the transparency of decision-making when the agencies decide not to take action and the possibility of a challenge to that decision;44 the length of time for court decisions; and the inability for the court’s decisions on remedies to reflect new facts. These elements certainly can influence the cases against the tech giants. They conclude their article, however, noting that in the U.S., the judicial acceptance of a singular focus on consumer welfare guards against the calls for action against tech companies that invoke myriad social issues. We applaud the focus on consumer welfare in the U.S., but question the implication that the European Commission’s actions against the tech companies – the focus of the article – has succumbed to anything other than its two enforcement goals: consumer welfare and market integration.45 On the contrary, so far the European Commission has been a staunch advocate for keeping other goals separate – cautioning against the use of antitrust enforcement for other purposes, such as environmental protection, labor considerations, consumer protection, or data protection violations.46
This reply does not seek to suggest that Europe and the U.S. apply the same law or have the same procedures, particularly as regards to single firm conduct. At the margin, in the United States, there is a greater faith in market forces, and U.S. antitrust doctrine recognizes narrower circumstances in which dominant firms can be held liable for competitive abuses. At the same time, we acknowledge that the past two decades have seen greater transatlantic convergence, including the movement away from a form-based approach to a greater focus on effects in European law.47

5 Directive 2014/104/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Member States and of the European Union [2014] OJ L349/1 (“Damages Directive”), now implemented in all Member States.
6 Standalone private enforcement actions under Article 102 have been rare. One reason is that national jurisdictions, except for the UK and to a lesser extent Germany and the Netherlands, did not provide for discovery. However, in 2014, the European Commission adopted the Damages Directive, which seeks to create an effective European private enforcement regime through the pursuit of damages actions before EU Member State courts. The Directive requires all EU member states to provide for the recovery of damages in competition cases, and several provisions in the Directive, such as those concerning the binding effect or evidentiary value of NCA’s decisions and other provisions related to discovery, may facilitate the bringing of single firm conduct private actions. The Directive required Member States to transpose the Directive into national law before the end of 2017 and has now been implemented in all Member States. As noted in the American Bar Association’s Antitrust Law Section Final Report of the Task Force on International Divergence of Dominance Standards (September 1, 2019) (hereafter “ABA Report”), “Given the dearth of Article 102 private enforcement cases litigated before national courts, it is too early to tell whether the European Union’s push for more private enforcement might in the future also impact the development of substantive competition law doctrine, similar to what some have observed in connection with Section 2.” The lack of a culture of private rights in most EU countries suggests this is unlikely to happen in the near future.
7 Kovacic has explained “U.S. antitrust doctrine would have assumed a more intervention-oriented character if the power to enforce the American competition statutes were vested exclusively in public enforcement authorities, or if the private right of action had been circumscribed…”: William E. Kovacic, Private Participation in the Enforcement of Public Competition Laws, speech at British Institution of International & Comparative Law’s Third Annual Conference on International and Comparative Competition Law: The Transatlantic Antitrust Dialogue, May 15, 2003. He has specifically addressed how private rights have shaped the standards for single firm conduct cases in the U.S. in William E. Kovacic, The Intellectual DNA of Modern U.S. Competition Law for Dominant Firm Conduct: The Chicago/Harvard Double Helix, 1 COLUM. BUS. L. REV. 1-80 (2007). In that article, Kovacic argues that judicial fears that the U.S. style of private rights of action – with mandatory treble damages, asymmetric shifting of costs, broad rights of discovery, class actions, and jury trials – excessively deter legitimate conduct and have spurred a dramatic retrenchment of antitrust liability standards, most evident in the progression toward more lenient treatment of dominant firm conduct.

10 Regulation may be defined as “imposition of rules by government, backed by the use of penalties that are intended specifically to modify the economic behaviour of individuals and firms in the private sector”: Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law, compiled by R. S. Khemani and D. M. Shapiro, commissioned by the Directorate for Financial, Fiscal and Enterprise Affairs, OECD, 1993. At a very general level, all law may be “regulation” but, generally, regulation refers to sets of rules that are either sector specific (e.g. telecoms or energy markets) or aimed at addressing a particular, well-defined problem (e.g. money-laundering). Law is a more general concept, which encompasses and authorizes regulation, but includes all norms that purport to have a given form of authority over their addressees.

EU case law arguably infers the possibility of recoupment from the fact of dominance. ABA Report at 59-60.

Professor Fox commented that the European Union “never adopted the Chicago School premises. It does not assume markets work well. It does not admonish: Trust the market—especially not when the market is concentrated and dominated by a single firm.

It is sympathetic to access to networks. It is hostile to dominant firms’ using leverage to take advantages for themselves at the expense of competitors, thereby “unleveling the playing field.” It does not aim to protect inefficient competitors. Rather, EU precedents safeguard a clearer path of the outsider to access markets on the merits, free from obstructions by dominant firms. Nonetheless, from the point of view of detractors who worry about excessive enforcement against dominant firms, the EU approach does protect competitors.” Id at 8.

44 Many scholars and members of the antitrust community have suggested the U.S. agencies should consider adopting additional transparency measures to explain why the enforcer declined to take action. See, for example, former FTC Chairman William Kovacic’s recent article on the FTC’s Google decision: “By too often saying nothing, or very little, the US agencies have missed important opportunities to improve public understanding of, and confidence in, how they formulate antitrust policy.” William Kovacic, Roads Not Taken: The Federal Trade Commission and Google, in The Concurrentialiste, March 9, 2020, available here. The U.S. agencies do occasionally issue statements about the decision to close an investigation or not to challenge a merger, but these are few in number and not as detailed as the European decisions.
45 Following an e-commerce sector study, the European Commission has brought a series of cases against conduct involving restrictions on online businesses, invoking the single market imperative, an essential element of its mandate. We do note that some of the recent tech enforcement actions by the Member States involve novel application of national antitrust laws (which can be more restrictive of single firm conduct than Article 102) that is arguably a move away from traditional antitrust, including the Bundeskartellamt’s case against Facebook, and the Autorité de la Concurrence’s recent cases against Google and Apple.
46 We note that in the Von der Leyen Commission there have been increasing calls to expand the boundaries of competition law enforcement, as there has been in the U.S. Whether and how Executive Vice President and Competition Commissioner Vestager and DG Competition respond to these calls remains to be seen.
47 As the ABA Report (supra) notes, “The Task Force finds far more similarity than difference between the current U.S. and EU approaches to competition enforcement against dominant firm behavior. To a large extent, convergence is reflected not only in agency and court enforcement actions but also frequent consensus among competition agencies not to act against conduct over which many have jurisdiction. It is now reasonable to treat recent U.S. and EU enforcement against dominant firm behavior as somewhat of a singular “modern mainstream” approach, although with some important divergent currents.” ABA Report at 18.

377,"April 30, 2020",Facebook To Address Some US Antitrust Concerns With Photo Transfer Tool,"
Facebook will allow users in the United States and Canada to transfer photos and videos to a rival tech platform for the first time – a step that could assuage antitrust concerns by giving users an option to easily leave the company’s services, the social media network announced on Thursday, April 30. 
According to Reuters, the tool lets Facebook users transfer data stored on its servers directly to another photo storage service, in this case Google Photos – a feature known as data portability.
US and Canadian users will be able to access the tool through their Facebook accounts starting Thursday. The function has already been launched in several countries including in Europe and Latin America. 
It allows the social media company to give users more control over their data and respond to US regulators and lawmakers who are investigating its competitive practices and allegations it has stifled competition. 
The US launch also comes ahead of a hearing set up by the Federal Trade Commission on September 22 to examine the potential benefits and challenges of data portability. Control of data that hurts competition has become a critical topic in the antitrust debate in the United States and Europe. 
Facebook’s Director of Privacy and Public Policy Steve Satterfield said over the past couple of years, the company heard calls from policymakers and regulators asking it to facilitate choice, make it easier for people to choose new providers and move their data to new services. 
“So it really is an important part of the response to the kinds of concerns that drive antitrust regulation or competition regulation,” Satterfield told Reuters in an interview.

378,"April 30, 2020",The Coronavirus and the Future of Big Tech,"
By Isaac Chotiner, The New Yorker
“She hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I’ve ever met.” This was President Trump’s assessment of Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who, as the Commissioner for Competition, leads the European Union’s antitrust division. Over the past five years, Vestager has become known for her attempts to regulate the tech industry. Her office’s investigations of Apple, Facebook, and Google have resulted in billions of dollars in fines for anti-competitive behavior and tax avoidance, garnering praise from those concerned about big tech’s power, as well as complaints from business leaders and some American politicians.
When Vestager’s second term began, in November, 2019, her job expanded to include digital policymaking for the European Union. In addition to enforcing antitrust laws, Vestager now oversees policy related to cybersecurity, big data, and artificial intelligence. In recent months, the spread of covid-19 has presented a number of challenges for Vestager’s office, including widespread unemployment, pharmaceutical price-gouging, and the use of digital technology to track the virus.
The New Yorker’s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers.
Vestager has also warned of potential Chinese takeovers of European businesses in response to the economic conditions brought about by the coronavirus.
I recently spoke by phone with Vestager. During our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed how the coronavirus may force a trade-off between privacy and health, her disagreements with Elizabeth Warren about how to regulate the tech industry, and whether politicians make the best technocrats.

379,"April 30, 2020",Interim measures by the Autorité de la Concurrence: history repeats itself after IMS Health,"
Pablo Ibañez Colomo (Chilling Competition)
Last week’s decision by the Autorité de la Concurrence is remarkable for several reasons, in particular because it provides for interim measures and it is about exploitative conduct. In that sense, it is an excellent example of what the new competition law will bring.
Traditional competition law was reluctant to engage with practices involving the administration of complex, prescriptive remedies (such as the redesign of a product or the determination of the terms and conditions under which firms are to deal with rivals and/or customers).
The decision reveals how much things are changing. As summarised in the picture above, the Autorité does not hesitate to mandate that Google set up a framework for its negotiations with press publishers and their remuneration.
At the same time, the decision feels like a déjà vu. When reading it, I could not avoid being reminded of the interim measures adopted by the Commission in IMS Health back in 2001 (and the subsequent developments before the then Court of First Instance)…

380,"April 29, 2020",EU Reignites Efforts To Force Big Tech Transparency,"
EU leaders are getting ready to initiate a consultation on its Digital Services Act after pausing it in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Monday, April 27, citing a source with knowledge of the discussions.
Brussels is asking for expanded power to investigate how tech companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook police illegal content online and how they collect and use data.
“We need to be able to look under the hood,” the source said. “Currently, we have no systematic way of finding out what’s going on. In the areas of disinformation or illegal content, we always have to take the company’s word for it.”
“People are tired of that,” the person added. “It’s not like we want their secrets, but we need to make sure that areas of public interest are checked.”
The EU commissioners tasked with digital policy – Thierry Breton, Vera Jourova, and Margrethe Vestager – are in favor of the move, multiple sources told FT.
Tech platforms were praised by Brussels for quickly removing erroneous information about the coronavirus. Officials are now asking if the companies can do the same in removing other misleading content.
Labor MEP Alex Agius Saliba, who is in charge of his committee’s report on the Digital Services Act, said Big Tech’s response to the coronavirus has demonstrated that companies can improve their efforts.
“I am totally in favor of a system where the European Commission will work toward a system where consumers and regulators will have more information on how tech giants work. We must have a clearer picture,” he said.
It’s been 20 years since the EU revised the rules that govern the internet, which is now dominated by US platforms. It could take two years following the consultation to formulate new rules, and it will probably take even longer to enforce the new policies.
The EU announced in February that it is planning to revamp the region’s digital market policy, including measures to limit data control by Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other Big Tech firms.

381,"April 28, 2020",India should enforce media regulation on big tech,"
By Dipayan Ghosh, Hindustan Times
Are leading Internet firms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, as operators of social media platforms, publishers of editorialised content (much like the Hindustan Times is), or are they indiscriminate platforms that offer open access to anything that you might wish to see?
The debate sounds nerdy at first — a sort of philosophical enquiry that should only concern professors and legal scholars as a matter of business regulation. But this seemingly narrow intellectual question is increasingly becoming a central matter of urgent concern in the context of Indian democracy — and, indeed, democracy and the free flow of information around the world. Foreign governments are moving to impose new responsibilities on dominant tech firms. Australia, for instance, is forcing Facebook and Google to pay news companies for displaying their stories; French antitrust officials have ordered Google to negotiate with local media firms to pay for displaying their content; and in the United States, a fierce political war rages on between liberals and conservatives on this very issue.
Let’s go back to that philosophical question for a moment, though. Publishers have always held a vaunted position in society. Traditional media formats — daily newspapers, broadcast television networks and radio stations — once consumed the public’s attention. My grandfather would comb through newspapers and news magazines every day, while my grandmother listened to the radio all day, every day — not uncommon for those of their generation. The result was that we came to know not only the voices and faces that graced these outlets, but the publishing houses and media personalities behind the businesses. This intense aura about the media ecosystem — a world that could make someone famous — gave news organisations great power. They had the power to convey the news — and with that power, came great responsibility.
As with any line of business, news organisations cannot be expected to necessarily and voluntarily demonstrate that responsibility — by, for instance, not spreading political falsehoods, hateful messaging, and other vitriol. To put it differently: Absent meaningful regulation, businesses operating in a free market economy, including media outlets, will do whatever they wish to maximise shareholder returns. Profit displaces social considerations.

382,"April 28, 2020",The Antitrust Perils of Sports Data For U.S. Sports Leagues,"
Sports data account for only a small percentage of the revenue generated by U.S. sports leagues. However, as states legalize sports betting, the demand for such data is expected to grow. How leagues choose to meet this demand may raise antitrust issues under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Two data-related theories of harm concern the collective sale of data at the league level and the leveraging of monopoly power over the market for league games to the market for data generated by or about those games. An empirical analysis of the market(s) for sports data would prove valuable to a rule of reason analysis of challenged practices.

I. INTRODUCTION
The collection and monetization of sports data raises important antitrust issues for U.S. sports leagues.2 One concerns the centralization of data ownership at the league, rather than the club, level in possible violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Another concerns the possible leveraging of a league’s monopoly over the market for its games to the market for data related to those games in possible violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
In the next section, I provide some background on the sports data industry, such as the types of data collected, who collects it, and how the data are used. I then discuss data-related theories of competitive harm as applied to U.S. sports leagues.

383,"April 28, 2020",Antitrust in Times of National and Global Emergencies,"

By Reiko Aoki (Japan Fair Trade Commission)1
 
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is being compared to the Spanish flu and other pandemics of the past. Past experiences predict that society and the economy after the pandemic, when it subsides, will look very different from how it did at the start of 2020. We should anticipate structural change in the economy and society, and antitrust (and other policies) should keep this in mind. In this paper, I draw on the experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 and past pandemics to suggest how antitrust during and after pandemic should be.
The road to the post-pandemic world will be long and winding. Antitrust during the pandemic will be different from before and after. During the pandemic, the threshold for antitrust enforcement should be different to account for changes in both demand and supply capacity (i.e. production and distribution). However we should not forget that the crisis will be resolved by innovation such as new technologies, new goods and services provided by new entities, as well as simply new ways of doing things. Antitrust should promote this process and not get in the way. Once we overcome the pandemic, the economy will have changed, but the application of antitrust will be surprisingly unchanged.  The new technology developed as we face the pandemic, and the digital economy and digital platforms, will contribute to the recovery. There will also be new players providing novel solutions that we need to make sure will not be excluded.
 
Experience from the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011
The Great East Japan Earthquake refers to the sequence of disasters that started in 2011 with the earthquake off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku at 2:46 pm on March 11th. This was followed by tsunamis overcoming cities and villages along the coast. One of the tsunamis destroyed nuclear power plants belonging to Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings) in Fukushima prefecture. The earthquake and tsunami affected a large area in northeastern Japan, but the electricity blackout affected Tokyo and the surrounding six prefectures served by the power plants. The disaster resulted in losses of human life and of physical capital including roads, railroads, factories, storage facilities and retailers in a very large area.  Factories destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami included subcontractors in the electronics and automobile parts industries. The physical damage to factories and the transportation system was limited to three prefectures near the epicenter, but the production shutdown had national and global consequences. This was in addition to effects on producers of food and other final goods that sold nationally and globally. The electricity shutdown affected factories in a very wide area around Tokyo area for months.
The Japan Fair Trade Commission (“JFTC”) published “Examples of Antimonopoly Act Applications during the Earthquake Disaster and other Emergencies”2 to clarify situations where coordination among competitors would be tolerated during emergencies.  The examples focus on how firms may coordinate production of critical inputs when factories or supply routes have been disrupted. Such coordination could be organized either by central or local governments or by industry and trade associations. The JFTC stressed the need to adjust the trade-off between public benefit and efficiency losses in the short run.
During the months after the earthquake and the other disasters that followed, the distribution networks of convenience stores, which are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, became very important. Convenience chains, with their extensive 24 hour national networks that distribute goods to all their stores, became indispensable to consumers. This is because the shortage from factories closing down not just from earthquakes but from scheduled electricity blackouts in some areas required redistribution of goods at the national level. At the same time, national calls to reduce electricity consumption allowed convenience stores to reduce their lighting. Keeping a store well-lit throughout the night is critical when your rivals are also brightly-lit. The convenience stores’ profits increased, and came out stronger after the crisis. I note that the three major convenience franchises (Seven-Eleven, Family Mart and Lawson) continued to compete during the emergency.3 I also note that some of them have been under investigation for violation of subcontracting law since.
Japan has been engaged in “fukko” reconstruction since March 2011. The word “fukko” has two characters, “fuk” meaning to revive and “ko” meaning to promote. Some people have stressed the “ko” aspect, that the goal is not to rebuild everything as it was before, but to go further. In fact, taking years to rebuild former production capacity has sometimes been misplaced effort, because the relevant demand or workers are no longer there. Buyers and workers had adjusted to the changed environment. While we grieve for the hardship workers, consumers and managers went through, we can also be comforted by the fact that they have moved on, and are now prospering in the new environment.
I believe this is what will happen with COVID-19. Consumers, firms, and workers are adjusting. This will be very painful for some. Public policy should focus on assisting them. At the same time, part of the pain will be relieved by new services and goods. Indeed, for some, the situation will be an opportunity to develop new services or goods markets, or enter existing ones. And society will be better off. It will never be better than if the pandemic never occurred, but will be better off than if it had not adapted.
The role of the antitrust authority will be to adjust to the COVID-19 situation. It may be necessary to change the level of coordination allowed for the good of society in extraordinary circumstances. It is important to make clear the limits of any such adjustments, including the relevant time horizon. This can be done by publishing examples, as the JFTC did following the 2011 disaster. Publication of such examples at an early stage will save time and effort by making individual inquiries unnecessary. We should always remember that society will also benefit from new entrants. The solution to a temporary problem may not be to save suppliers of current goods and services but to have them replaced by better goods and services.  Thus, exemptions from antitrust rules should not be automatic.
 
Past Pandemics
Unfortunately, there is no denying that losses from pandemics are never recovered. The economy would have been better off if no pandemic had occurred. However, the losses of human and physical capital were not uniform across regions, which meant pandemics changed their distribution. Past pandemics also led to the adoption of new technologies. Shortages of labor after the Black Death in the 14th century led to higher wages, resulting in higher demand for manufactured goods, and urbanization. Evidence from the Spanish flu pandemic shows that the demographic shock led to fundamental changes in economic structures.4
During the pandemic, production and distribution should focus on curing or correcting the damage. If there is a shortage of medical products or food, we should concentrate on adjusting the system to address this shortage. If there is a break in the supply chain, competitors that produce substitutes could step in. This may require coordination that in normal times could be anticompetitive. But we also should remember that a new alternative could step in. We need to avoid coordination among incumbents that would keep entrants or new technologies out.
This is particularly important because evidence from previous pandemics is that economic and social structures do change. Policy should take this into account, as the Japanese experience shows. We should not concentrate on reconstructing the pre-pandemic world. We should strive to build a better economy and society, including by adopting new technologies.
 
The Pandemic and the Digital Economy
Digital platforms are in a constant state of flux, and the pandemic has introduced new forces that will influence their direction. E-commerce provides a valuable service when physical contact must be avoided. They serve a function similar to how convenience stores provided valuable services after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Their market position was strengthened in the process.  Matching services for workers should help shift workers from unemployment to where they are needed.
Apple and Google have exchanged information in order to build a pandemic fighting tool. This coordination will provide a valuable weapon to fight COVID-19. Concerns have been raised about personal information and privacy. This may be the moment when existing digital platforms find solutions to overcoming such privacy concerns.  At the same time, I would also be concerned about coordination among incumbents leading to new OS being shut out in the future. There is no OS in the horizon that I am aware of, but there is no reason to believe there will never be a better one in the future. This could be an ideal time for a new OS that better addresses personal information concerns to enter the mobile OS market.  We need to be careful this is not hindered in the name of the emergency.
We have already seen the rise of a new communication platform, Zoom. It captured user share by being a service that had attractive new attributes at an attractive price. It has improved quality of life for those locked down at home. I cannot help but wonder if Skype changed its course after it was acquired by Microsoft, allowing it to be overtaken by Zoom.

384,"April 26, 2020","“Infotainment Systems” In Cars Portend Safety, Privacy, And Competition Issues","
By Adam Candeub, Washington Bytes
Almost all new cars include so-called “infotainment systems,” which provide navigation and various sources for music and news. Most companies have begun to outsource these systems to the Silicon Valley mainstays such as Apple, Amazon, and Google. The electric car manufacturer Tesla, however, has developed its own infotainment system that is far more integrated with the car itself.
Tesla recently announced an “upgrade,” which would allow users to watch Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube (when the car is parked). This innovation has a flip side: it removes AM / FM radio capabilities. Tesla and other electric car manufacturers claim they have removed AM radio in many of their models due to concerns over interference. But Tesla’s announcement is peculiar because electric engines do not interfere with FM radio reception. 
Former FEMA director Brock Long worries that Tesla’s decision could prevent the government from transmitting crucial information in emergencies. Long’s concerns are valid, particularly in a crisis like the ongoing pandemic, when broad communication with the public is necessary to protect national security. AM/FM radio reach places that television and broadband do not, and that is why the government has invested tens of millions of dollars to ensure radio stations can remain on the air during periods of widespread threat to the public – including the current one. As the coronavirus reminds us, our nation still has public safety needs that no amount of technical wizardry can obviate.

The Highlights note that FTC actions have led to more than US$232 million in refunds to consumers across the country, with US$136 million sent directly from the FTC. Over the last four years, consumers have cashed more than US$1 billion in FTC refund checks. 
The Highlights also note that the Commission continued its efforts to challenge harmful mergers and stop anticompetitive business conduct. For example, the Commission took enforcement actions to preserve competition in health care and consumer products markets and established a new Technology Enforcement Division to investigate potential anticompetitive conduct in digital platform markets.
“We continued to advance our aggressive enforcement agenda in 2019,” Chairman Simons said. “In addition to the record-breaking privacy settlements with Facebook, and Google/YouTube, the FTC challenged a host of anticompetitive mergers and conduct, and took action to stop consumer fraud and deception in the marketplace.”

386,"April 22, 2020",Big Tech State Antitrust Probes Continue During COVID-19,"
Multistate antitrust investigations into Facebook and Alphabet’’s Google are continuing during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, reported Bloomberg. 
“These investigations will not lose steam,” Gwendolyn Cooley, assistant attorney general with the Office of the Wisconsin Attorney General, said Tuesday, April 21, during an American Bar Association conference. 
“Whether we have COVID related elements in them, these tech investigations are going to be going full steam,” Cooley said during a webcast. 
Dozens of state attorneys general have banded together to probe whether the two tech giants have used anti-competitive tactics to stifle competition.

The FTC and Department of Justice have reportedly divvied up the investigative responsibility for America’s biggest tech companies. Over the summer, Facebook confirmed it is being investigated by the FTC, which Simons reiterated Tuesday.
“We’ve already confirmed what Facebook disclosed, that we are in fact investigating them for potential antitrust violations,” he said. “We have other investigations going on, as well.”
Bloomberg reports the FTC is also interviewing third-party sellers on Amazon to determine whether the company is abusing its dominance.
Last summer, the Justice Department announced a review of the technology industry to find out whether there are violations of antitrust laws. No company was named in the announcement but DOJ said it would review “market-leading online platforms” with a focus on “search, social media, and some retail services online.” It’s safe to assume that the most powerful players in those industries, namely Google, Facebook, and Amazon, are under the microscope.

388,"April 20, 2020",Experts Say Big Tech’s COVID-19 Response Won’t Carry Weight In Antitrust Probes,"
New work from home set-ups and a goodwill tour by the Big Tech companies are unlikely to soften the nation’s top antitrust agencies in the industry, reported CNBC. 
Up until recently, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple had been met with unyielding scrutiny in Washington and most state attorneys general offices, barraged by questions of dominance and privacy violations. Facebook and Google have been most visibly pursued by federal authorities and state attorneys. 
But as the coronavirus pandemic shut down business as usual, tech companies gained a chance to win back some goodwill. The companies have donated millions of dollars toward efforts to fight the virus, helped health officials spread their messages to encourage a flattening of the curve and donated their stockpiles of personal protective equipment. Amazon, in particular, has become even more important to Americans who want all their needs delivered to their doors.
According to CNBC, it doesn’t seem like the best time to propose a break-up or some other antitrust remedy. But experts say the investigations that have already been set in motion are unlikely to change much during the ensuing crisis. 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have both signaled they are continuing to seriously investigate companies in their purview. The most prominent tech investigations on the federal level involve the FTC’s probe into Facebook and the DOJ’s probe into Google.
A spokesperson for the FTC said in a statement that as most of its employees work remotely, “Our two main priorities will continue to be: first, the health and well-being of our personnel, their families and parties and organizations who appear before us; and, second, the continuity of our mission to protect consumers and promote competition. While we cannot speculate on what the future holds, we remain on duty and committed to continuing to our important work.”
“The manner in which we conduct our investigations has adapted to the constraints of physical distancing, but make no mistake about it: the substance of our work remains the same,” FTC Bureau of Competition Director Ian Conner wrote in an April 6 blog post.

389,"April 20, 2020",Facebook “Disappointed” In Australia’s Pay For News Edict,"
Facebook has stated it is “disappointed” in the Australian government’s attempt to extract millions of dollars from tech giants to pay for media content shared through search and social media.
But on Monday, April 20, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, vowed the Australian government “won’t bow to … threats” from big tech companies not to show local content, describing the coming fight with Google and Facebook as a “battle worth fighting”, reported the Guardian. 
The Australian government has opted for a mandatory code of conduct to distribute revenue to media companies because the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) had concluded “no meaningful progress” had been made on payment for content in negotiations for a voluntary code.
The ACCC chair, Rod Sims, told ABC TV that, when the government asked for a view about a week ago, the competition regulator advised progress on value-sharing or paying for content “seemed unlikely.”
He cited “the experience overseas,” particularly Spain and France, which “passed various laws to get Google and Facebook to pay for content and [they] have basically said ‘the amount we’re willing to pay is zero’.”
Frydenberg and Sims, explained the compulsory code, to be finalised by July, could see Facebook and Google pay for content either as a proportion of the revenue user attention earns for the tech companies, or a proportion of the cost of the content, such as news.
Facebook Australia and New Zealand managing director, Will Easton, said the social media giant was “disappointed by the government’s announcement, especially as we’ve worked hard to meet their agreed deadline” for a voluntary code by November 2020.

In this month’s edition of CPI Talks… we have the pleasure of speaking with Isabelle de Silva, President of the French Competition Authority (the Autorité de la concurrence, or “AdC”).
Thank you, Ms. de Silva, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.

1. In January of this year, the AdC published a report (the “AdC Report”) reflecting on the AdC’s use of behavioral remedies in competition enforcement. What, in your view, are the key conclusions to be drawn from this report?
The AdC Report sets out how the AdC has used behavioral remedies in merger and antitrust cases so far. Its purpose is twofold: to provide technical guidance for companies, competition law practitioners and academics, and to drive thinking forward on the use of behavioral remedies by the AdC in the future.
The report acknowledges that behavioral remedies have several important advantages. They can take many forms and adapt to many situations. The decision-making practice in antitrust cases has also shown that, when proposed remedies are discussed with third parties, they can, sometimes, bring to light difficulties with existing regulations, so the process is helpful in that it makes it possible to also address these problems.
However, behavioral remedies also raise some specific challenges. First, they may be insufficient for certain types of anti-competitive effects, such as creating a reduction in horizontal competition. In that case, behavioral remedies might need to remain in place for a very long time, without guarantee that, in the end, the market will function well by itself. Another aspect is that monitoring the implementation of behavioral remedies often creates a heavy burden for enforcers and companies alike.
As the challenges of behavioral remedies may often outweigh their benefits, a key conclusion of the report is that the AdC will likely make more limited use of such remedies and favor, instead, quasi-structural remedies in antitrust cases, as well as structural remedies in merger cases.

2. The classic objection to behavioral (as opposed to structural) remedies lies in difficulties relating to their monitoring and enforcement. This concern is perhaps most clearly reflected in practice under the EU Merger Regulation, where the EU Commission displays a clear preference for structural remedies, on this basis. While it is difficult to draw bright-line rules in this regard, would it be worthwhile to issue more detailed guidance documents to identify those situations where behavioral remedies may be more appropriate and proportionate (despite their drawbacks in terms of monitoring and enforcement)?
The AdC Report is designed as a form of guidance for companies, as well as legal and economic advisors. They will be able to find in the report a global synthesis of the different cases in which the AdC accepted behavioral remedies. We don’t want to be too prescriptive because remedies must always be tailor-made for a specific problem, market and competitive situation. But companies will find a wealth of information in our report, for example regarding cases in which behavioral remedies can be a viable avenue and those in which they will be difficult to consider.
The approach taken by the report is to present general principles governing the choice of remedies, as well as the objectives related to each category of remedies (behavioral and structural), to conduct a case-by-case analysis of the AdC’s decision-making practice and to share the lessons learned from this experience. The report will hopefully provide valuable information on the subject since it is fairly comprehensive.

3. As far as judicial review of remedies is concerned, the AdC Report notes that the role of the competent French courts is limited, for the most part, to assessing the proportionality and legality of any remedy imposed, and that courts do not enjoy broad discretion to reformulate detailed aspects of a given remedy imposed by the regulator. Similar rules apply in most jurisdictions. In your view, is this the correct approach? Alternatively, should courts enjoy broader flexibility to reformulate or otherwise correct remedy design, or is this role best left to specialized regulators such as the AdC?
The applicable judicial review is well balanced and works well. Depending on the decision at stake, two different judges intervene: the Paris Court of Appeals for antitrust decisions and the administrative Supreme Court (Conseil d’État) for merger decisions. They both review the legality of remedy decisions: while the Conseil d’État assesses a potential abuse of power and can annul the contested decision in whole or in part, the Paris Court of Appeals can annul or amend the contested decision (noting that the Court does not have the power to discuss new remedies with companies to make them binding, nor can it order them to comply with other specific conditions not provided for in the contested decision). Regarding the assessment of the proportionality of remedies, the Paris Court of Appeals’ review is limited to a so-called “manifest error control,” while the Conseil d’État exercises a so-called “normal control,” which is quite thorough. In at least one case, for example, the Conseil d’État decided that a remedy was not sufficient to compensate for the lessening of competition, and then went on to annul the AdC’s decision in that respect. The AdC had to come up with a new, more stringent remedy.
I find it very wise that the judges refuse to define themselves what a particular remedy should be. First, each remedy is based on a detailed analysis of the different parameters of competition, and it is, first and foremost, the AdC’s job to conduct such an analysis. Second, a remedy should be proposed by the parties and must, in many cases, be fine-tuned after discussions with the AdC and feedback received from third parties. A court is not well-equipped to monitor such a process, and should then be only asked to review its final outcome.

4. The AdC Report notably concludes that, like other competition authorities, the AdC will consider having more limited recourse to behavioral remedies in future, and will favor so-called “quasi-structural” commitments for anticompetitive practices, and “true” structural commitments in merger law, whenever they provide a better resolution to the competition issues identified. What criteria should be used to determine which type of remedy is most appropriate? Does the AdC propose to issue guidance in this regard? Should other bodies also update their guidance (notably, should the EU Commission consider revising its Remedies Notice in line with your conclusions)?
The AdC Report provides ample information to allow stakeholders to make informed decisions. The report underlines that the nature of remedies depends on the specific competition concerns at stake. For merger cases, behavioral remedies have been accepted in 36 percent of clearance decisions in which anti-competitive effects were identified (55 percent if mixed remedies – behavioral and structural – are included) since 2009. The proportion of behavioral remedies out of the total remedies accepted by the AdC is among the highest in Europe. In antitrust matters, because concerns are not related to market structure but to market behavior, remedies were mostly behavioral so far or quasi-structural in some instances. The report details the circumstances of each case in order to explain in which situations a particular remedy may be warranted. The report also notes the difficulties raised by behavioral remedies and the clarification, in the ECN+ Directive, that structural injunctions can indeed be issued in antitrust cases.
We currently feel no need to take the guidance exercise a step further by imposing allocation criteria. First, as illustrated by the report, remedies must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Second, as the report also recalls, the effectiveness of remedies lies in the fact that they are proposed by companies and developed jointly with relevant market players, which reinforces companies’ accountability vis-à-vis the remedies they have proposed and will need to implement.

5. Remedies must be tailored to the facts of the individual case and the industry at hand, the nature of the specific infringement identified, and the theory of harm relied upon by the regulator. New business models in the so-called “digital economy” raise novel issues for enforcers, whether engaged in antitrust enforcement, or merger control. Notably, questions such as access remedies to “big data,” or other complex conduct raised by the practices of big tech companies raise issues that are not necessarily analogous to issues raised in classic antitrust cases. Might complex behavioral remedies necessarily be a feature of enforcement with regard to such practices? What is to be learned from recent high-profile remedy negotiations at both the national and international levels in this industry?
It is true that digital technologies involve increasingly complex remedies and therefore require additional resources and expertise for competition agencies. It is one of the reasons why the AdC created a Digital Economy Unit. One specific task of this specialized unit is to assist our Investigation services in assessing remedies in digital markets and monitoring their implementation.
An emblematic case featuring behavioral remedies in the digital economy sector is the Google Shopping case in which the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion for abusing its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service. The Commission decision required Google to stop its illegal conduct and to apply the same processes and methods to rival comparison shopping services in Google’s search results pages as it gave to its own comparison shopping service. Google has sole responsibility to ensure compliance and is under an obligation to keep the Commission informed of its actions. This case is an example of behavioral remedy applicable to an antitrust infringement decision.
More generally, the current debate about platforms illustrates, according to some, the need to apply, very early on, behavioral remedies to maintain a level-playing field, before anticompetitive behavior has wiped out competition.
This is something we take into account in our enforcement. In that respect, interim measures can also incorporate, quite early on, some injunctions to address specific behavior in order to prevent the consequences of a possible abuse of dominance for instance. The recent decision taken by the AdC on the matter of press content ancillary rights is a good example, and illustrates that it is possible to act quickly by issuing interim measures. Following a complaint, the AdC found that Google may have abused its dominant position on the market for general search services by imposing unfair transaction conditions on publishers and news agencies. Google was ordered to negotiate with publishers and news agencies that request it for the remuneration due to them for any use of protected content based on transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria. The injunction required that the negotiations actually result in a remuneration proposal from Google. The company will have to provide the AdC with monthly reports on its compliance with the decision.

391,"April 20, 2020","Conduct Remedies, With 2020 Hindsight: Have We Learned Anything in the Last Decade?","
Ten years ago the U.S. antitrust agencies began using conduct remedies more frequently and more expansively than ever before.  Research and experience, however, highlighted the limitations of such remedies, and so more recently the agencies have restated their determination to avoid the use of conduct remedies wherever possible and to strengthen remedies policy generally.  Despite those statements, the agencies have in fact continued to rely on conduct remedies and indeed further expanded their use in ever more problematic ways.  Three examples discussed in this article are the recent amendment to the original Ticketmaster-Live Nation settlement, the merger of Staples and Essendant, and the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. The conclusion of this review is that little appears to have been learned about the weaknesses of conduct remedies over the past decade.

I. INTRODUCTION
A decade ago, U.S. antitrust policy embarked on an experiment in expansive use of conduct remedies for mergers. Several major cases were settled with agreements that the merged firms—as a condition for approval of their mergers—would not engage in specific anticompetitive actions. In 2011 the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department issued a revised Remedies Guide that indicated greater receptivity to conduct remedies than in an earlier version of the Guide.
But a growing body of experience and research was finding that conduct remedies were hard to w...

392,"April 20, 2020","Behavioral Remedies in U.S. Merger Settlements: Past, Present and Future","
While in the past, the FTC and DOJ have been receptive to considering behavioral remedies to resolve discrete competition concerns arising from the vertical components of a merger, policy pronouncements by senior officials at the FTC and DOJ under the current administration have led many to conclude that behavioral remedies are off the table when it comes to negotiating merger remedies with the agencies. An examination of recent merger settlements indicates that the DOJ has, in fact, substantially limited the use of the behavioral remedies, whereas the FTC remains receptive to considering behavioral relief to resolve discrete vertical competition concerns while preserving the benefits of vertical integration. Although it is unclear if the agencies’ divergent track records indicate an actual conflict in their approaches to vertical remedies, practitioners should be aware that the fate of a vertical merger that presents discrete competitive issues, and the relief available to resolve such issues, may depend on which agency reviews it.

This note reviews the rationale behind both structural and behavioral remedies, not only in merger but also in antitrust cases. The cost-benefit analysis for the enforcement of remedies depends on the case examined, and general presumptions on the relevance of one or another type of remedies and even on their very opportunity might easily be misguided. This calls for a consistent theory of competitive relief, in order to properly frame the enforcement of remedies.

I. INTRODUCTION
Remedies, broadly defined as measures used to restore competition by removing a competitive concern or putting an end to an infringement, are yet again topical.
2019 was a busy year from this point of view: there were calls in the U.S. to break up the Big Tech companies and fix competition by imposing spin off remedies,2 while in Europe the ECN+ Directive granted Member State competition authorities the same power that the European Commission has held since Council Regulation 1/2003 to impose commitments, i.e. structural or behavioral remedies as an alternative to penalties, in order to quickly restore effective competition and ensure the proper functioning of the European internal market.3
On the enforcement side, the U.S. Department of Justice gave up its more favorable view of conduct remedies for mergers as promoted by the 2011 Remedies Guide, and decided to switch to its previous version focusing on divestitures,4 whil...

394,"April 20, 2020",An Economist’s Thoughts on Behavioral Remedies in Merger Enforcement,"
There is a substantial literature examining the experience in both the United States and the European Union with the imposition by enforcement agencies of remedies as a condition for a merger to proceed without challenge. The broad goals of the agencies have arguably remained consistent over the years, and a number of more specific “lessons” of the past seem to have become broadly accepted, including both a general preference for structural over behavioral remedies but also a willingness to impose behavioral remedies in certain, limited situations, either in support of structural remedies or on their own. This paper examines some arguably underappreciated complications arising from the imposition of behavioral remedies, including the difficulty of enforcing non-discrimination provisions, the danger of perverse incentives provided by such provisions, and the counter-argument – common in the debates regarding infrastructure access pricing – that in some circumstances discrimination itself may be pro- rather than anti-competitive.

In this short article, we evaluate the role of structural and behavioral remedies in big tech sectors. First, we highlight the prominence of structural solutions in recent policy debates, discussing both their limitations and their potential role in light of the economic and technological features of digital markets. Then, we emphasize the importance of more behavioral solutions and the role that they may play out in future policy developments. In particular, we highlight the importance of instruments such as portability measures that can reduce entry barriers created by network externalities, as well as the role of other behavioral remedies that can exploit the reduced scarcity constraints of digital bottlenecks such as ranked-display of results on a platform.

As the preoccupation about the state of digital industries intensifies across various areas of public policy – ranging from privacy, data protection, labor regulation, electoral integrity, and market power – the “break up big tech” slogan has gained growing centrality in competition policy and related debates concerned with the excessive levels of concentration and dominance of large digital platforms. In the U.S., for example, Elizabeth Warren has argued that tech firms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have accumulated too much power over the economy and democracy, and should be broken up.2 Chris Hughes, ...

396,"April 14, 2020",The New Abuse Rules in the German Competition Act – What’s in it for the EU?,"

By Dr. Thomas Weck (German Monopolies Commission)1
[Abstract:] Digital platform markets pose novel issues when it comes to enforcing the competition rules. A draft bill to amend the German Competition Act addresses two major issues – tipping and ecosystems. A third issue is being discussed at the EU level: information advantages that large platform operators may enjoy vis-à-vis other market participants and vis-à-vis enforcers. The German Monopolies Commission made a proposal to deal with this latter issue.
I. Introduction
Both in the EU and in Germany, there is a growing consensus that the rules to counter the abusive conduct of large digital platforms need to be revised. In Germany, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy recently proposed a bill for a 10th amendment to the Competition Act to that end.2 Taking into account the discussion at EU level, the question arises: what’s in this amendment for the EU? Well, the short answer is that it could be more!
In order to understand which legal reforms are promising, one has to understand why digital platforms raise novel questions regarding competition enforcement (Section II). On this basis, one has to consider what can be done with the existing abuse prohibition (Article 102 TFEU) to address the questions of substance, and where there may be a need to supplement the existing rules (Section III). The same exercise is necessary regarding any procedural obstacles to enforcement (Section IV). To conclude, the German draft identifies the right issues, but the proposed solutions fall short of what’s actually needed (Section V).
 
II. What are the Issues?
Digital platforms pursue a business model that can be ambivalent from a competition policy perspective. Platform markets are quite often highly concentrated. These markets may, on the one hand, be highly efficient. On the other hand, however, competition problems may arise, as large platforms may enjoy structural advantages that their competitors are not able to match, and that also give the platforms a head start towards the authorities in competition proceedings.
Digital platforms target several groups of different users that interact with each other via the platform. Some platforms, for example social networks, mediate between users of the same type (“one-sided”). They can also bring together different user groups who either offer online content or search for it, as is the case with search or trading platforms (“multi-sided”). Digital platforms with a data-driven business model derive their market power not just from (direct and indirect) network effects, but also from the competitive relevance of the data aggregated on the platform. This is at least true where the platform uses the data exclusively.3
The larger a platform is, the more difficult it is for others to compete with it. The size of a platform therefore has both positive effects for its users, but also negative effects due to reduced competition. Platform markets are not exclusively found in digital services. However, competition issues can arise here due to the often hardly geographically limited markets and rapid and sustainable growth of platforms due to the exploitation of network effects.
The competition issues provoked by large platforms can be of a structural nature and be twofold:

One potential issue is that the market may permanently “tip” in favor of a platform, meaning that the market position of the platform is not contestable anymore.
Another potential issue is that digital platforms leverage their market power into other markets to create more-or-less unassailable “ecosystems.”

To be sure, ecosystems may be welcome in many cases. Take the ecosystem created by Google around Android, for example. There, consumers and mobile device manufacturers benefit from a large number of apps compatible with the operating system and, conversely, app developers benefit from high consumer demand. A critical view of ecosystems is justified, however, where such an ecosystem squashes competition from outside the ecosystem. This concerns both (i) the ecosystem itself, i.e. competitors find it harder to establish an ecosystem once consumers are locked in to the ecosystem of a dominant provider, and (ii) markets that are part of the ecosystem, as a dominant provider can foreclose competitors by leveraging its market power to these markets.4
A potential third issue is related to the exclusive access to data that large platforms with a data-driven business model possess. In practice, this is less an issue of abusive behavior (in substance), but more an issue of finding out about any abusive behavior (in competition proceedings). Especially dominant platforms following a data-based business model may have information advantages, both vis-à-vis its competitors and its users, and vis-à-vis the authorities. The competition authorities certainly have comprehensive powers to gather information in administrative proceedings. However, it may still be difficult for them, as outsiders, to understand for which purposes a dominant platform uses the data available to it. In addition, market conditions in the digital sector are changing rapidly, and market players are constantly adapting their behavior to the changing circumstances. This increases the difficulties for the authorities to keep pace with the behavior of the platform companies and other market participants when investigating the facts of the case (i.e. it is a moving target).
 
III. Tipping and Ecosystems – The German Ministry’s Answer
In its existing form, the German legislative project focuses on the substantive issues flagged above. The draft bill of the Ministry takes up scientific impulses and findings from both EU and German case practice. On this basis, the Ministry proposes two new rules to address the issues of “tipping” and of “ecosystems.”5
Regarding the “tipping” issue, the Ministry proposes a new Section 20(3a) that will come into play where competitors of companies with superior market power are prevented from achieving economies of scale themselves. The new provision will prohibit creating any “unfair impediment” for competitors. Section 20(3a) is meant to apply before dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU has developed.6 It is intended to keep markets open and prevent dominant positions.7 The new provision corresponds in principle to a recommendation of the expert opinion on “modernizing the law on abuse of market power.”8
An open question, however, is what the authorities can do if they miss the right moment to intervene and the market permanently tips in favor of the relevant platform. Imposing a fine may not be a convincing remedy in that case. Unfortunately, the draft bill does not address this issue.
Regarding digital “ecosystems,” with a new Section 19a, the draft bill aims to prevent platforms from using their market position and the economic power in certain markets strategically to restrict competition in other markets.9 The proposed rule is meant to address problems that may arise when the behavior of platform operators fosters the establishment of anti-competitive structures, for example in new markets, without the platform operators necessarily being already dominant in all these markets.10
The proposed Section 19a combines many individual recommendations of expert reports and the outcomes of various (traditional) abuses of platform companies investigated by the competition authorities, but in some cases also goes beyond this.11 In order to establish a possible infringement under Section 19a, the Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”) will have to conduct a two-stage procedure. It will first have to determine the “overriding importance of the relevant company for the overall market,” and then any abuse that may be prohibited. The concept of “paramount cross-market significance” (para. 1) is so far unknown to German abuse law.12 The prerequisites for such a cross-market significance are, however, only outlined in Section 19a(1) with reference to criteria that are also relevant for establishing a dominant position. In addition, it is left to the FCO to develop criteria for a differentiation from traditional market power. The abuse groups listed in Section 19a(2) are broadly defined and address very different types of behavior.
The most notable addition to existing abuse law is certainly Section 19a(2) No. 1, which prohibits self-preferencing behavior without requiring a finding of exclusionary effects. This prohibition goes beyond the Google Shopping case after which it has been modeled.13 Indeed, in a market that is permanently tipped in favor of one dominant platform operator, it may be impossible to reverse the foreclosure effects operating to the detriment of other companies. Thus, it can be presumed that self-preferencing in such a market can bar competition on the merits.14 The dominant platform operators are here in a similarly strong position as a network operator in the position of a natural monopolist. Many of the other abuse groups (Section 19a(2) Nos 2-4) overlap more or less with the existing abuse prohibition in Article 102 TFEU. The only exception is the last prohibition (Section 19a(2) No. 5), which relates to information asymmetries and, like Section 19(1) No. 1, does not require any showing of an impact on competition whatsoever.15 In this case, however, it remains obscure why the provision is included in a statute protecting competition.
The large variety of abuse groups means that it will largely be left to the FCO to determine what the common characteristics of abuses under Section 19a(2) are. It must be expected that, in the absence of a clear and uniform approach and due to the resulting legal uncertainty, the new provision will keep the courts busy for years until clarification may be eventually reached.
With regard to the legal consequences where an abuse has been established under the proposed Section 19a, the draft bill explicitly refers to the already existing enforcement powers of the FCO. However, it is unclear whether these powers are sufficient to be able to take effective countermeasures where abusive behavior by platform companies has had a negative impact on the market structure. It is also conceivable that it might be necessary to foresee ongoing monitoring and regulation of the companies’ behavior with instruments that go beyond the existing competition act rules.
After all, while the proposed Section 20(3a) is rather straightforward, the proposed Section 19a raises a number of fundamental questions. It is doubtful whether the provision can be operationalized at all in a way that will contribute to effective abuse control.
 
IV. Platform Information Advantages – The Monopolies Commission’s Answer
An expert report prepared for Commissioner Vestager notes that platforms, due to their mediating function, can act as rule-setters for the platform users. If users interact with platforms in a dominant position, it is difficult for them to switch to alternative offers. Dominant platforms can therefore exploit their rule-setting function to the detriment of their users.16 At the same time, transparency can likewise pose a competition policy issue.17 As highlighted before, dominant platforms with a data-based business model may have information advantages, both vis-à-vis their users and vis-à-vis the authorities.
In the view of German Monopolies Commission, an expert body advising the German government and legislature, it could be justified to extend the obligations of the relevant companies to provide information in the case of requests for information by the competition authorities. The Monopolies Commission made a proposal according to which the relevant companies not only would have to provide the data explicitly requested by the authorities, but they would also be obliged to a reasonable extent to provide information from their sphere of influence which the competition authority cannot determine on its own initiative. If these obligations were not fulfilled, the law could empower the competition authority to draw conclusions from the free assessment of evidence and to decide on the merits of the case without taking into account the information not provided.18
 
V. Conclusion
To conclude, the draft bill of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is a notable contribution to the discussion, but it does not address all issues that could have been tackled concerning large digital platforms. The proposed provision of Section 20(3a) is welcome as it may help to prevent “tipping,” and to keep markets contestable. Open questions at this stage include how a similar provision could be implemented at EU level, and what the right remedies would be if competition authorities miss the right moment to intervene. The new Section 19a, in contrast, represents a crude mixture of concepts relating to the development of platform “ecosystems.” If anything, then, the proposed prohibition of self-preferencing appears to be the most interesting addition to existing abuse law. Regarding the information advantages of platforms with a data-based business model, it may be justified to limit the investigative obligations of the authorities by shifting the burden of providing information. The German Monopolies Commission has made a proposal to that end, which could serve as a model also for the EU.

Facebook Inc. sued the founder of a software company for running deceptive advertisements on its social-media platforms, including links to investment scams and bogus information about the coronavirus pandemic.
Basant Gajjar’s “LeadCloak” software, designed to circumvent automated review systems in Facebook and Instagram, baits users into clicking on links that are unrelated to the ad, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in California. Facebook said the software pushed deceptive ads for diet pills and drugs and cryptocurrency investment scams.
Gajjar, who was named as a defendant in the Facebook suit, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. He’s an Indian citizen residing in Thailand, according to the lawsuit.
LeadCloak has also targeted other technology companies including Google, Oath, WordPress and Shopify, Facebook said in its lawsuit.
Facebook has faced a surge in malicious actors seeking to take advantage of users’ desperation during the outbreak. In mid-March, the company banned deceptive ads touting protective masks. In many cases, the masks were faulty, overpriced or counterfeit versions of what physicians recommended.
Still, it’s been difficult for Facebook to remove such ads from its social platforms. The company is relying more on automated systems to solve the problem, because many of its contractors can’t work on the problem from home, for privacy and legal reasons.

398,"April 9, 2020",The Risks of Radicalism: Exacerbating Harms from Type I Errors,"

By Koren W. Wong-Ervin, Anne Layne-Farrar & James Moore1
 
Calls to radically change U.S. antitrust law continue to be a focus of law and policy makers. According to proponents of the proposed changes, drastic legislative amendments are necessary to remedy the (perceived) failures of current antitrust standards to prohibit anticompetitive conduct, in particular in high-technology markets. While efforts to address market failures are certainly worthy of discussion, the various legislative proposals risk serious adverse consequences, including higher prices for consumers and reduced innovation and consumer choice.
This article begins with a brief discussion of the economic basis for regulation, followed by a summary of recently proposed legislation from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The main part of this article is an exploration of the risks posed by these draft bills through a retrospective examination of market developments following past interventions by antitrust agencies.
I. The Economic Basis for Regulation 
As an initial matter, it is worth noting that antitrust law is not regulation. Rather, it is proscriptive and not prescriptive in nature, with a default of legality. This is important because, among other things, creating ex ante regulation to prevent certain conduct risks sacrificing the efficiencies and other benefits of that conduct by imposing potentially rigid rules that lack the flexibility of existing antitrust rule of reason assessments. One of the main benefits of relying on existing antitrust laws is that they proceed primarily through fact-specific case-by-case analyses, which are more likely to maximize consumer welfare than are ex ante regulations.
That said, the theoretical basis for economic regulation rests on the idea that regulation may serve to improve the allocation of resources in a particular industry compared to the outcome in the absence of regulation. Successful identification of a market failure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to justify regulation on economic grounds. Once a potential market failure has been identified, the proposed regulatory solution must itself survive a rigorous economic cost-benefit analysis, one that factors in the potential for imperfect regulation and unintended consequences as well as the effect of alternative solutions based on private ordering.2
When considered in this light, there are several problems with the contentions that we have a market concentration problem. For example, because economy-wide statistics inevitably aggregate economic phenomena across product and geographic lines, they can grossly overstate concentration in well-defined antitrust markets. Indeed, as then Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Chief Economist Luke Froeb and Senior Economic Counsel Greg Werden explained, the “key evidence” underlying the increasing industry concentration contention and the subsequent calls for antitrust reform is data from the U.S. Census Bureau.3 “But these data do not demonstrate increasing concentration of markets, i.e. ranges of economic activity in which competitive processes determine price and quality, and in which the impact of mergers and trade restraints are evaluated in antitrust law.”4 Instead, “Census data relate to aggregations of economic activity much broader than markets.”5
In analyzing the “issue brief” put out by the Obama Administration’s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) (the principal study relied upon by those claiming we have a concentration problem), the DOJ economists concluded that:
[E]ven the least aggregated Census data can be over a hundred times too aggregated, yet the CEA used the most aggregated Census data. It principally cited the change in the 50-firm concentration ratio for 13 broad sectors of the U.S. economy, such as retail trade. We agree with Carl Shapiro, a member of the CEA during the Obama Administration (2011– 12), that these data are “not informative regarding the state of competition.”6
The economists also found that “[r]eliable data on trends in market concentration are available for only a few sectors of the economy, and for several, market concentration has not increased despite substantial merger activity.”7
More importantly, even if we had a concentration or competition problem, aggregate statistics are ultimately tangential, or even irrelevant, to the question of whether alleged conduct is actually anticompetitive. Indeed, there is great risk in equating concentration with harm. Fears about concentration ignore its benefits, including economies of scale, self-financing, ability to take and survive risks, and multilevel integration. As Professor Steve Berry has explained: “[P]roduct quality is going up. That’s pushing price up. That pushes margins up. The marginal cost is going down as firms get better logistics and locate closer to their customers. Marginal cost is falling. That’s efficiency. But markups go up.”8
II. Current Proposed Legislation and Risked Unintended Consequences
Recent draft legislation from 2020 includes a comprehensive bill by Senator Elizabeth Warren9 and a narrower bill focused on exclusionary conduct by Senator Amy Klobuchar.10 The Warren bill would dispense entirely with the existing case-by-case fact-specific analysis of competitive effects in favor of outright bans on so-called “mega mergers,”11 and includes presumptions of illegality for “large mergers.”12
The Warren bill would also reintroduce long-ago abandoned presumptions of illegality for commonplace13 vertical restraints such as tying and bundling, even when practiced by firms without substantial market power, i.e. the ability to raise market prices above or reduce output below competitive levels for a significant period of time. The Warren bill would abandon the well-accepted definition of substantial market power and would instead interject vague notions of “fairness” to allow for a finding of “market power” based upon factors such as “directly or indirectly impos[ing] an unfair purchase or selling terms or any other unfair trading condition.”14 The Klobuchar bill would create similar presumptions of illegality based upon a market share threshold of 50 percent. In order to overcome these presumptions, both bills would require firms to accomplish the near impossible task of proving a negative in terms of harm to competition. Specifically, the Warren proposal would require firms to prove “through clear and convincing evidence that the conduct does not materially harm competition or the competitive process.” It would also prohibit courts from balancing “procompetitive efficiencies with anticompetitive impacts.”15 Similarly, the Klobuchar bill would require firms to prove that their exclusionary conduct does not present an “appreciable risk of harming competition.”16
Among other things, these bills would overturn decades of Supreme Court precedent in which the Court has held that vertical restraints must be evaluated under a full-blown, effects-based (or rule of reason) analysis.17 The burden shifting in favor of presumptions of illegality would also eliminate competition on the merits as a viable defense. In addition, the bills would require decades of judicial decisions to decide what the new language means. For example, what is “appreciable risk”? Is it negligible risk, or is the bar higher? Finally, the bills would also be contrary to the robust body of empirical evidence, including leading meta-studies from economists at the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), indicating that vertical restraints and mergers are generally procompetitive or benign.18
Most importantly, the proposed legislation risks serious harm to consumers, including an increased danger of higher prices from the greater risk of type I errors (false positives). As the Supreme Court has recognized, courts face limitations in distinguishing between pro- and anticompetitive conduct in antitrust cases and has emphasized the need to avoid type I errors, particularly in monopolization cases.19 The Court has also expressed concerns, originally explained in Judge Frank Easterbrook’s seminal analysis, that the cost to consumers arising from type I errors might be greater than those attributable to type II errors (false negatives) because “the economic system corrects monopoly more readily than it corrects judicial errors.20 Such imbalances are likely to be exacerbated under the two Senator-proposed bills that would abandon the rule of reason analysis required by the Supreme Court in favor of outright bans and presumptions of illegality. In other words, even under the existing case-specific analysis, there are bound to be errors (in both directions), particularly when the analysis involves predicting future market dynamics. Such errors would likely only increase under rigid prohibitions or presumptions that dispense with the fact-specific analysis required to understand whether a particular merger or type of conduct actually harms (or, in the case of mergers, is likely to harm) competition and consumers.
III. Evidence from Historical Experience
Evidence of the possible consequences of antitrust intervention — whether through merger control or conduct investigations — can be traced from the “old economy” era following passage of the Sherman Act in 1890 through to the modern digital economy. In several cases, the U.S. Antitrust Agencies brought enforcement actions to block transactions based upon predictions that the deals would entrench a market leader. Yet, evidence of what actually happened in the real world illustrates the difficulties of accurately predicting future market realities. While it is difficult to predict and model the possible consequences of a government intervention since the but-for world is unknowable, these examples do highlight the need for great caution before adopting legislation that is likely to exacerbate the possible detrimental consequences arising from false positives.
One example is the FTC’s 2000 decision to block the merger of Milnot Holding and H.J. Heinz on the grounds that it would have resulted in a reduction of the number of competing firms from three to two. A retrospective analysis conducted by an FTC economist revealed that, in the eight years following the FTC’s decision to block the merger, market concentration and the prices offered by the market leader significantly increased even though the merger had been blocked.21 One possible explanation (predicted by the parties) is that the merger would have created a more effective second competitor to take on the industry leader. In other words, the FTC’s intervention deprived the market of a strong #2 competitor, which could have disciplined prices to the benefit of consumers. For example, the merging parties had argued that the greater market penetration enabled by the combination of the parties’ brands was necessary to recoup investments in advertising that are essential to launching new products.22 Without this market penetration, Heinz predicted that it would be unable to chip away at Gerber’s significant market share.
An example discussed in a theoretical paper written by former FTC Chairman Tim Muris and former FTC General Counsel Jonathan Neuchterlein is the DOJ’s 1944 case against the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (more commonly known as A&P), whose executives faced charges for criminal violations of the Sherman Act.23 The district court convicted A&P on two core theories of liability: (1) that A&P engaged in predatory low-cost pricing to drive out its rivals24; and (2) that the company obtained an unlawful efficiency advantage through vertical integration.25 According to the district court, these practices resulted in “unreasonable advantages” over competing grocery stores and higher costs to those stores.26 As Muris & Neuchterlein explain, the ultimate result of this prosecution may have been to discourage low-cost distribution practices and low pricing due to the risk of criminal exposure — to the detriment of consumers.27 These concerns regarding enforcement actions remain today. For example, in the modern economy, grocers like Wal-Mart, Costco, and Sam’s Club have pursued vertical low-cost, vertical integration — in other words, much of the same conduct that A&P was accused of many decades ago. Yet the Klobuchar bill would eliminate the Supreme Court’s Brooke Group test for predatory pricing — the very test that makes prosecutions like that against A&P more difficult and that otherwise limits overenforcement against low-cost pricing.
There is also the FTC’s 2004 decision to challenge Blockbuster Video’s proposed acquisition of Hollywood Video, which the parties sought at least in part to address new competition, including from Netflix.28 Contrary to the FTC’s prediction that the merger would have entrenched Blockbuster as the market leader, Blockbuster went bankrupt within five years of the parties’ decision to abandon the deal in response to the FTC suit to block it.29 Retrospective analyses of Blockbuster’s fall reveal that Blockbuster was unable to adapt to the advantages of the new Netflix business model, which included lower operational costs without brick-and-mortar retail stores, lower distribution costs associated with direct-to-customer DVD shipping, a greater variety of movie selections, and the rise of online streaming following the growth of broadband access.30 The FTC’s analysis failed to give sufficient weight to these market developments.
Again, while it difficult to predict and model the possible consequences of government intervention, according to the merging parties “[a]n acquisition of Hollywood would [have] allow[ed] Blockbuster to immediately accelerate its plans to bring its expanded array of offerings to more consumers through an accretive acquisition of stores.”31 In other words, the merger could have enabled Blockbuster to continue expanding consumer choices by enabling it to immediately expand retail locations without additional capital expenditures. Another possible result of allowing the merger is that it would have given Blockbuster the tools to keep up with Netflix. This would have given consumers one more online option and kept mail-order video services — which Blockbuster was in the process of launching32 — and potentially streaming services, more competitive.
As another example of the difficulties of predicting future market realities, particularly in fast-moving technology markets, consider the FTC’s 2000 decision to impose remedies as a condition of allowing AOL’s merger with Time Warner. Contrary to the FTC’s prediction that the merger would enable AOL to become the leading provider of broadband Internet access,33 AOL quickly faded with the rise of other broadband providers.34 The FTC presumed, based on historical experience, that AOL would carry its dominance in dial-up forward to broadband. The cable companies, however, surpassed AOL by building powerful broadband networks while AOL continued to rely on outdated dial-up technologies. By the time AOL introduced its own broadband service at a premium, it was too late.35
Yet another example can be seen in the DOJ’s 2000 decision to condition AT&T’s (which owned Excite@Home, one of the largest providers of broadband Internet access) acquisition of MediaOne on its divestiture of MediaOne’s interests in Road Runner, a web-portal provider that competed with Excite@Home.36 Following the DOJ’s remedy, Excite@Home declare bankruptcy despite the DOJ’s predictions.37 In other words, the DOJ’s prediction that the combined company’s interests in the two Internet portals would give the company “undue leverage in its dealings with broadband content providers”38 failed to appreciate the nature of dynamic markets in which new entrants can, and often do, overtake incumbents by rendering once-dominant business models (in this case, the walled-in environment model of AOL, Road Runner, and Excite@Home) antiquated.39
IV. Conclusion
The examples discussed in this article illustrate that, even under existing fact-specific effects-based analyses, errors occur. Adopting legislation that would prevent antitrust enforcers from conducting careful analysis would deprive the agencies of the ability to minimize the false positives that risk harm to consumers and competition.

In addition, there is very little empirical basis to presume any systematic relationship between market structure, competition, and innovation. While there is credible causal evidence that market incentives matter, the empirical literature attempting to link market structure — typically measured by the number of firms or market shares in broadly defined markets — and product market competition to innovation are based on cross-section analyses that do not produce casual inference and as a whole yield inconclusive results.
9 Anti-Monopoly and Competition Restoration Act, 116th Cong. (2020). Draft Bill on file with authors. The draft bill addresses a wide variety of issues related to merger control, conduct issues, and agency enforcement authority, including: banning all “mega mergers”; imposing stringent additional procedural requirements on “large mergers”; shifting the (heightened) burden of proof as to all other mergers on the merging parties; narrowing consideration of merger efficiencies; requiring notifications to state attorneys general; mandating review, and potentially unwinding, of all “mega mergers” from the last twenty years; expanding individual liability, particularly for CEOs; severely increasing the categories of conduct constituting restraints of trade or monopoly practices; expanding the FTC’s remedial authorities; and overturning Supreme Court precedents that heightened standards for pleadings and class certification.
10 Klobuchar Introduces Legislation to Deter Anticompetitive Abuses, Klobuchar.Senate.Gov (March 10, 2020), https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=E59886E1-12EE-48A5-94F5-044658A75513. Anticompetitive Exclusionary Conduct Prevention Act of 2020, S. 3426, 116th Cong. § 4 (2020). Senator Klobuchar has also previously introduced a bill that would make unlawful any merger that results in more than de minimis competitive effects and would shift the burden to the merging parties to show that the merger would be procompetitive. See Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act of 2019, S. 307, 116th Cong. § 3 (2019).
11 “Mega mergers” are defined as mergers in which either the acquiring entity or acquired entity has annual revenue of more than $40 billion; both entities have annual revenue of more than $15 billion; the post-merger entity would have market shares of greater than 45 percent as a seller or 25 percent as a buyer; and the transaction would result in fewer than four significant competitors in the marketplace. The bill carves out an exception for certain transactions that meet the “failing firm” standard.
12 “Large mergers” are defined as mergers in which either the acquiring entity or acquired entity has annual revenue of $5 billion to $40 billion; both entities have annual revenue of $1 billion to $15 billion; the post-merger entity would have market shares of 10 percent to 45 percent as a seller or 10 percent to 25 percent as a buyer; the transaction would result in fewer than five significant competitors in the marketplace; and during the preceding seven-year period, either party has been found to have violated the antitrust laws.
13 Vertical restraints are ubiquitous and widely used by a variety of firms, including those without substantial market power. Given that the potential to harm competition and generate anticompetitive effects arises only when vertical restraints are practiced by a firm with substantial market power, the fact that such conduct is commonplace even for firms without the ability to exclude is a strong indication that there are legitimate business justifications for the conduct that have nothing to do with seeking to exclude competitors.

Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 18 (1997) (holding that maximum resale price maintenance agreements are subject to the rule of reason, not per se rule, because “the per se rule [as applied to maximum RPM agreements] could in fact exacerbate problems related to the unrestrained exercise of market power by monopolist dealers” and thus “may actually harm consumers and manufacturers”); Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 890 (2007) (holding that minimum RPM agreements are also subject to the rule of reason due to promotion of interbrand competition by “encourag[ing] retailers to invest in tangible or intangible services or promotional efforts that aid the manufacturer’s position as against rival manufacturers” and by potentially “giv[ing] consumers more options so that they can choose among low-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-service brands; and brands that fall in between”); Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15–16 (1984) (limiting per se treatment in tying cases to those in which there is an element of “forcing” and a substantial volume of commerce is foreclosed).

399,"April 7, 2020",Europe’s Tech Czar Says Strict Rules Will Build Public Trust in AI,"
By Natalia Drozdiak, Bloomberg 
Margrethe Vestager, once Silicon Valley’s top foe, may turn into its best ally by pushing for the tighter oversight that Big Tech says it needs to be saved from itself, reported Bloomberg.
As European Union competition chief since 2014, Vestager has targeted Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com, Apple, and Facebook, among others, for allegedly abusing their market positions or dodging taxes. Her heavy fines and penalties earned the EU antitrust watchdog a reputation around the world as one of the only regulators unafraid to stand up to U.S. tech giants.
Now, in a beefed-up role as the bloc’s tech czar—her formal title is executive vice president of the European Commission for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age—she’s responsible not only for enforcing rules as antitrust cop but also for designing broader tech policies. Vestager, who took on the job at the end of 2019, is clear about her mission: to lay down the law so European citizens feel safe in the digital world amid ballooning corporate power, rapid technological developments, and growing disillusionment among users about how the largest tech platforms handle their personal data. Her plan to use regulation to restore trust in technology—starting with artificial intelligence—is something even Google and Facebook Inc. are conceding is necessary for the sake of their businesses.
When Vestager unveiled her proposal in February to regulate AI, she said the EU wants to embrace the benefits the technology brings while also tackling its risks. Her approach is to focus regulation on the applications that affect people’s lives or legal status, such as self-driving cars and remote facial recognition. The goal is to ensure that citizens have confidence in how AI is used and developed so people embrace it fully, she says. And she’s sticking to that tune even as companies urgently rush out various AI solutions—from diagnostics to surveillance—in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“The reason why we all stay at home, that we keep a distance, is, of course, that we trust our authorities,” Vestager said in in a recent online chat hosted by Brussels-based think tank Friends of Europe, referring to the confinement measures imposed around the world by governments seeking to curb the outbreak. “Trust is our most important tool in fighting the pandemic, and that of course should also be present when we use technology.”
Vestager is an avid Twitter user, but she shuns Facebook and promotes DuckDuckGo as an alternative to Google’s search engine. In a different web chat earlier this year, she was careful to answer citizens’ questions from three services: Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. She frequently speaks of the harm caused by social media and devices that seal people off from those around them. “If people want a society where no one looks each other in the eyes, where no one shares a comment about the weather waiting for the bus because they’re all playing Candy Crush, that’s the society we get,” she told Bloomberg News in October.
Vestager’s mantra as antitrust chief in recent years focused on fairness, a concept that drew criticism from companies and lawyers about its subjective nature, particularly with regards to investigations. In her broadened role, she emphasizes trust—and so far, she’s getting less pushback. After years of lobbying to thwart legislation, the Silicon Valley companies that arguably face some of the biggest trust issues amid privacy and antitrust probes—namely Google and Facebook—are calling for regulation on AI and illegal content, respectively.
On a recent visit to Brussels, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said before a meeting with Vestager: “There is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeated his calls for more regulatory oversight a few weeks later on a trip to Munich and Brussels. “Even if I’m not going to agree with every regulation in the near term, I do think it’s going to be the thing that helps create trust and better governance of the internet and will benefit everyone, including us in the long term,” he said in February at the Munich Security Conference. The tech chiefs’ moves are strategic. Given the widespread impact of the EU’s landmark General Data Protection Regulation, they want to be seen as cooperative as the bloc crafts new legislation.
The regulatory guardrails that Vestager sets on AI, illegal content, and more won’t be designed to absorb companies’ trust problems but rather to hold them to account. In her view, it’s a joint responsibility belonging to regulators and platforms, she said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year. “I don’t think that one can go without the other.”

400,"April 7, 2020",CPI Talks… with Representative Ro Khanna,"

In this edition of CPI Talks we have the pleasure of speaking with U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, of California’s 17th Congressional District.
Thank you, Representative Khanna, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
1. The “tech giants” have come under enhanced scrutiny at a regulatory and political level in recent years and months. What do you see as the main antitrust challenges posed by these companies? Do you think new legislation or regulation is required, or do you believe more rigorous enforcement of the existing antitrust toolkit would be appropriate?
Technology companies, no matter what their power, cannot be left to regulate themselves. Even they would admit that at this point. Thus far, there has been a reluctance in Congress to step in and regulate an industry that, frankly, many members themselves don’t have a complete understanding of even today. That needs to change.
The most urgent issue to address is the lack of transparency between technology giants, legislators and regulators, and the American public. Some level of transparency is absolutely essential to ensure bad actors aren’t abusing the platforms we’ve come to rely on, and that companies are upfront about the challenges they’re encountering in combating those attacks. We should not reflexively break-up our big tech companies. Instead, we should regulate anti-competitive behavior and ensure there are basic privacy protections for all Americans.
2. In late 2019, fifty States’ Attorneys General announced an antitrust investigation into Google, focusing on Google’s advertising business, but potentially extending into other aspects of its activities. In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google on similar issues. In parallel, the FTC is looking at similar issues relating to Facebook and Amazon. What are your views on the functioning of the U.S. enforcement system in this sector? Are the various agencies properly coordinating, or is there need for more joined-up thinking?
I’ve said that, broadly, we should regulate anti-competitive behavior. As a founding member of the House Antitrust Caucus, I co-led a letter to the FTC requesting information on how mergers and acquisitions impact jobs and small businesses. I’ve called for more funding for the FTC and DOJ so they can do their jobs studying and enforcing the antitrust laws we already have on the books.
3. Prominent politicians and commentators have vocally called for the “tech giants” to be “broken up” to remedy perceived antitrust concerns associated with their conduct. Such “structural” remedies have in latter years typically only been used by the DOJ for under the Clayton Act, though historically they have also been used under the Sherman Act. In your view, is there a broader role for structural remedies in antitrust cases, or would regulators be better advised to limit themselves to targeted “behavioral” remedies?
Any future antitrust investigation should be executed with surgical precision, not a sledgehammer. Technology companies are not a monolith. While there’s inevitable overlap, they are each pursuing fundamentally different goals across the broad spectrum of technology innovation. We need thoughtful regulation that ensures these platforms stay neutral, and don’t privilege their own products.
4. In your view, is there a “knowledge gap” between the tech industry and those (legislators, regulators, and other senior political figures) entrusted by the public with its regulation? If the authorities are over-reliant on industry for knowledge of the sector, does this create the risk of regulatory capture? What initiatives would be appropriate to close any such knowledge gap? Were the 2019 Congressional hearings into the tech sector a useful exercise? Do you think such dialogue ought to be institutionalized, and how would you seek to ensure that a diversity of voices is heard?
Absolutely. The 2019 hearings were an embarrassing display of how little lawmakers understand about the technology industry. Many are technologically illiterate. We had some members asking Zuckerberg how Facebook made money, and others asking the CEO of Google questions about Apple’s iPhone, not knowing Google didn’t make the iPhone. It was an astonishing lapse of Congressional oversight capability.
Worse still, the 115th Congress took no action after massive breaches of people’s data. How could we fail to act even after the Cambridge Analytics scandal? The American public wants some assurances that our privacy and our data are going to be protected. This stuff really isn’t rocket science. We know what we need: basic protection for people having access to their data and knowing where their data is being used. That’s why I proposed an Internet Bill of Rights, a commonsense list of rights that should be afforded to all Americans in the digital age.
In the short term, Congress should require any technology company to notify users of a data breach of any scale, immediately. In the longer term, users should be able to own their data, and have the freedom to move it if they are unhappy with the way a particular company is using it.
To combat the gaps in knowledge among both legislators and potential regulators, we should require members to undergo some level of basic technology training. I’ve supported Rep. Takano’s call to bring back Congress’ Office of Technology Assessment. To combat the lack of diversity within the technology industry, companies need to reconsider their recruiting strategies to incorporate more historically black colleges and colleges in economically less-prosperous areas. Earlier this year, I held a recruiting event with some of Silicon Valley’s top technology companies, including Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, at San Jose State University with Black students. Wealth creation and job opportunity shouldn’t be exclusive to members of a certain race, gender, or income level.
 
5. M&A activity by large tech companies has been singled out as a particular area of concern. Beyond acquiring smaller innovative tech companies, they also seek to spread their influence into the bricks-and-mortar world. Do such so-called “killer acquisitions” merit particular scrutiny, even though, under the prevailing standards, they would typically avoid detailed review? Is there need for a re-evaluation of the application of the merger rules? Moreover, to the extent that potentially problematic transactions have thus far evaded review, should there be scope for the agencies to review post-merger conduct ex post facto?
It is very difficult to go back and breakup mergers ex post facto given the integration that companies undertake. But we should do a better job of scrutinizing new ones before companies undertake them. We can also regulate anti-competitive behavior even if we are not able to unwind past mergers.
6. The prevailing antitrust school of thought since the 1970s has focused on the so-called “consumer welfare” standard. This standard is typically taken to refer to effects on prices paid by end consumers. Is the time right, as some have suggested, for a reconsideration of this standard, so that the rules can be applied in a manner to take into account structural features of the economy, and other social goods, such as effects on small businesses, entrepreneurship, and income distribution? What type of standard would you envisage, and how could it be implemented while ensuring legal certainty and growth and innovation incentives?
You’re exactly right. For too long, we’ve relied on the Bork doctrine of antitrust that only looks at prices and consumer welfare. Instead, we should go back to the Brandeisian perspective when considering mergers and acquisitions. Why all of a sudden did we not care about the impact that mergers will have on innovation, inequality, jobs, wages, and the health of local businesses? A decades-long obsession with the Bork doctrine has made us forget about these other aspects of our economy. I hope the FTC and DOJ take this more holistic approach when considering future mergers.

401,"April 6, 2020",Competition in “Lockdown” After the Attack of COVID-19 in Australia,"
By Jessica Apel & Barbora Jedlickova1
On February 25, 2020, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) set its enforcement priorities for the year, as per usual, without any suspicion that the world was about to change with the COVID-19 outbreak and that, with this change, competition and the enforcement of its law would take a reverse path. Rather than “just” protecting competition, the current policy seeks to preserve businesses in order to introduce healthy competition once the outbreak is over. This is reflected in the unprecedented number of interim authorizations2 the ACCC has granted in the last few weeks, allowing coordination between competitors for the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift in policy and enforcement was confirmed directly by the ACCC’s media release on March 27, which also stressed that it “wants to ensure any changes to the competitive landscape now are temporary and that the ACCC is ready to play its role in supporting competition as the economy recovers.”3 What does this mean for its enforcement priorities and what else can we expect in the next few months and beyond?
While we can expect that some of the ACCC’s compliance and enforcement priorities will remain unchanged, the ACCC has indicated it will “re-focus … [its] efforts to those priorities of most relevance to competition and consumer issues arising from the impact of COVID 19.”4  In this context, Rod Sims has made it clear that the ACCC will need to balance the objectives of: (a) implementing temporary measures to address short-term issues associated with COVID-19 and (b) ensuring that the long-term competitive structure of the economy is maintained. This mantra will call for Australia’s competition regulator to make careful decisions regarding its approach to enforcement in the coming months. The rhetoric of the ACCC to date is not, necessarily, as profound as the general statements made by other international regulators, such as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), which has issued guidance providing reassurance that, with regards to coordination between competitors:
provided that any such coordination is undertaken solely to address concerns arising from the current crisis and does not go further or last longer than what is necessary, the CMA will not take action against it.5
It is unsurprising that the ACCC has stayed clear of similar statements of general forbearance, which arguably create further uncertainty for businesses as to the limits of the regulator’s blessing. Instead, recent practice shows that the ACCC has opted for granting individually tailored exceptions, where businesses apply for authorizations and notifications.6 While this method is more time- and resource-consuming than a general assurance may be, it provides better certainty to the concerned entities. Therefore, it is clear that the ACCC’s new focus on evaluating and granting individual exceptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic takes away resources which would otherwise be used for matters arising from its newly set competition law enforcement priorities. Indeed, there appears to be an acknowledgement by the ACCC that a heavy regulatory burden is not in line with the current policy stream of preserving businesses and would not be borne well by businesses who are already feeling the pressure of this global crisis; this is likely to guide their enforcement priorities in the coming months.7
Cartels and Anti-competitive Agreements
Cartels and anti-competitive agreements have been enduring priorities of the ACCC, with five criminal cartel cases currently before the courts8 and an expectation that at least a further two cartel cases would be brought in 2020. Although the most serious forms of cartels, which criminal cartels are, will most likely remain on the ACCC’s current enforcement radar due to the ACCC’s pre-pandemic commitment to eradicating coordination from the economy, some less serious coordination will not be as urgently addressed. Some will even be allowed, with the ACCC’s current focus on authorizing coordination between competitors to respond to COVID-19, including the sharing of resources and information which would otherwise be prohibited by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“CCA”).
Section 88 of the CCA provides the ACCC power to grant authorization for a person to engage in conduct which would or might otherwise contravene provisions in Part IV of the CCA. The test for authorization requires the ACCC to consider whether the public benefits of the proposed conduct outweigh any detriment to the public.9 This is not a low threshold. Parties seeking authorization must demonstrate that the public benefit is not “ephemeral or illusory,”10 but will be carried into effect in a tangible and commercially practical way. With public benefits being related to a pandemic for the first time, the ACCC is navigating its decisions in new waters. The urgency and importance of these authorizations mean that the ACCC is prioritizing this work and approving urgent interim authorizations within 1-2 days,11 ahead of the public consultation process and further consideration of the substantive application.
In the past fortnight we have seen the ACCC authorize supermarkets to collaborate to ensure supply,12 banks to coordinate the provision of a small business relief package and loan relief,13 airlines to synchronize flight schedules on regional routes,14 medical technology manufacturers and suppliers to manage the supply of medical equipment15 and wholesalers to work together to ensure continual access to pharmaceutical products,16 to name a few. Each of these authorizations is viewed as a temporary measure in the public interest. Further applications for interim authorizations are under consideration, including a considerable application by the Australian Energy Market Operator, on behalf of itself and 426 participants in Australia’s National Energy Market to discuss, agree to or engage in conduct to ensure the ongoing safe, secure and reliable supply of energy during the pandemic. Authorization determinations cannot apply retrospectively to conduct which has already been engaged in by the applicants,17 so it is unsurprising that we have seen a flurry of authorization applications and determinations as businesses rush to obtain statutory immunity18 for their proposed coordination in response to the pandemic.
While recent activity in this space represents a significant uptick in permitted coordination between competitors, collaboration remains a high risk activity, even where the purpose is to ease the impact of the pandemic or manage supply shortages, as cartel provisions are per se illegal in Australia. Further, the current interim authorizations are limited in their application. For instance, the ACCC’s determinations have been carefully drafted to exclude sharing of price information or agreements with respect to pricing,19 the ACCC can only authorize applicants to “engage in conduct”20 rather than authorize codes of conduct more broadly,21 and the ACCC has the power to revoke the interim authorization at any time.22 It would not be surprising to see the ACCC take action against businesses who overstep the conduct specified in their authorization (in which case they will not be afforded the statutory immunity provided in respect of the authorized conduct)23 or, alternatively, decide to bypass the statutory process altogether, to reinforce the exceptional nature of the current circumstances. And, most likely, we will still see the ACCC bringing the prophesied pair of cartel proceedings in 2020.
Essential Services
The ACCC signposted competition and consumer issues arising from the pricing and selling of essential services as a priority for 2020, with a focus on energy and telecommunications. There are a number of activities already underway in this area, including the ACCC’s ongoing Electricity Market Monitoring and Gas Inquiry,24 as well as consultation on the ACCC’s Draft Guidelines on Part XICA – Prohibited conduct in the energy market.25 The Draft Guidelines outline the ACCC’s approach to investigating alleged contraventions of the new “big stick” prohibitions inserted into the CCA in relation to retail pricing, electricity financial contracting liquidity and conduct in the electricity spot market.26 The new laws will take effect on June 10, 2020 and have the purpose of reducing energy prices for consumers and businesses. The energy sector in Australia is already highly regulated, and these new prohibitions, which allow for significant government intervention (including forced divestments) and impose strict yet vague conduct requirements, will add a further layer of regulatory burden for energy companies,
With the onset of COVID-19, the ACCC has re-emphasized the importance of affordability issues in the energy, telecommunications and petrol sectors, particularly during a time of growing unemployment. While we may see some additional flexibility regarding time frames and means of complying with statutory notices issued to energy companies pursuant to inquiries,27 it is unlikely the ACCC will show much leniency with respect to the provision of essential services and, in particular, its enforcement of the big stick legislation. In fact, Australia’s energy companies are likely to be under heightened scrutiny during the pandemic. On March 27, the Australian Energy Regulator (“AER”) released a Statement of Expectations for energy businesses which set out ten principles aimed at ensuring the continued reliable supply of energy to homes and businesses. These principles reflect the AER’s expectation that energy businesses must go “above and beyond” to assist vulnerable consumers and small businesses during the crisis.28
The ACCC has also explicitly raised concerns with respect to potential price gouging in the supply of petrol, with petrol prices across Australia remaining high despite world oil prices diving. There is no express prohibition against charging excessive prices, but this conduct may be captured by other provisions of the CCA. Besides the general competition law provisions, in the context of the supply of essential services, excessive prices and/or targeting vulnerable customers may amount to unconscionable conduct, and misrepresenting the reasons for higher prices (such as falsely suggesting they are due to particular features of the product) may breach sections 18 or 29 of the Australian Consumer Law.29 It will be important for the ACCC to carefully distinguish between price increases driven by increased demand or production costs as a result of the pandemic, and those driven by profiteering.
Digital Economy and Platforms
Since the pandemic outbreak, many businesses have gone into lockdown and people are forced to, or have decided to, stay at and work from home without face-to-face social interactions. What this means is that while the general economy is suffering from the pandemic, the digital one is booming. Unlike in non-digital markets, where businesses are being negatively impacted, the digital space provides better and new opportunities for entities. The ACCC’s job will be to ensure that competition is flourishing in digital markets and not being illegally restricted in order to ensure that this boom is to the benefit of consumers and the Australian economy.
Therefore, it is essential that the ACCC’s commitment to its work with respect to the digital economy is unwavering, in particular that the new inquiries it announced in February 2020, namely the Digital Advertising Services Inquiry30 and Digital Platform Services Inquiry,31 will continue. The COVID-19 outbreak could impact the findings in these inquiries, as Australians spend an increasing amount of time online.
The Digital Advertising Services Inquiry is focused on the supply of digital advertising technology and agency services, but the Digital Platforms Services Inquiry is more consumer-focused, analyzing services that we are all using on a daily basis – such as internet search engine services, social media services and electronic marketplace services. Any pre-existing competition issues in respect to these services are likely to be amplified between now and the interim report in September as demand for these services increases exponentially, both for personal entertainment and for communication between colleagues working remotely.
These inquiries will build on concerns raised by the final report of the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019, among other things in relation to consumers being misled over the collection and use of their personal data, and competition issues surrounding platforms. We have already seen enforcement activity in this space, with proceedings being brought against Google for allegedly misleading consumers about the collection, retention and use of personal location data. These concerns are only likely to become further exacerbated as the population is confined to their homes and legally required to practice social distancing.
Competition Lessened Temporarily 
The strongest message is that the change in the ACCC’s enforcement priorities is partial and temporary. While some of the pre-pandemic ACCC’s activities remain its priorities (such as the most serious infringements of competition law, most notably, already existing proceedings, its work in the digital space, and protecting consumers and small businesses), other activities will go against protecting competition in order for competition to take place after the pandemic resolves. In the current situation, we can expect less competition and more coordination among businesses in Australian non-digital markets, while people, some businesses and the economy fight for their survival.

402,"April 2, 2020",DOJ Probes Taboola’s Deal To Buy Outbrain,"
Justice Department antitrust officials are looking to find out if a deal to combine the internet’s two largest content-recommendation firms would suppress competition in a market that has provided a steady stream of revenue to online publishers.
The department has been interviewing clients and rivals of Taboola Ltd. and Outbrain Inc., asking detailed questions about whether their combination could be harmful for publishers and online ad networks, according to people familiar with the matter.
Taboola Ltd. in October agreed to buy Outbrain Inc. in a cash-and-stock deal that would have Outbrain shareholders receive $250 million in cash and Taboola stock equivalent to 30% of the combined firm.
Both companies generate “promoted stories” and “around the web” sections that appear next to articles and videos online, unusually at the bottom of a webpage. In essence, the rival firms each rent the basement space on webpages, while some other ad networks, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, deliver ads in more prominent positions.
Those bottom sections contain a mix of material, including sponsored content and advertisements styled to resemble news stories, usually with tantalizing headlines like “The Best Way to Stop a Barking Dog (It’s Genius)” and “She Had No Clue Why the Crowd Started Cheering.”
The companies have become a mainstay for many digital publishing executives, some of whom rely on regular payments from Taboola and Outbrain.
Outbrain’s clients include CNN, the Guardian and the Washington Post, while Taboola’s clients include Fox News and NBC News. It isn’t known which clients the Justice Department has spoken to.

403,"April 1, 2020",Apple Buys Popular Weather App Dark Sky,"
Apple has acquired the popular weather app Dark Sky in a move that could turn the iPhone and smartwatch maker into the exclusive provider of an app known for its minute-by-minute weather updates.
The acquisition, which Apple confirmed to CNN Business on Tuesday, March 31, will mean the end of Dark Sky’s apps for Google’s Android and Wear OS, according to a Dark Sky blog post. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
From its beginning as a Kickstarter campaign in 2011, Dark Sky wowed users by promising predictive forecasts that were accurate down to the minute and based on users’ exact locations. By applying artificial intelligence to radar data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Dark Sky could tell users exactly when it was going to rain within the next hour, allowing them to time their walk to the coffee shop or their commute home. By 2015, the company stated it was serving 8 million forecasts a day.
But the news that Apple will shut down those apps on July 1 suggests the company intends to make Dark Sky exclusive to its walled garden ecosystem.
Google’s platform won’t be the only one losing access to Dark Sky. As part of the acquisition, Dark Sky announced it will discontinue its application programming interface late next year. That feature allows third-party app developers to access and use Dark Sky’s weather data in their own apps. On Tuesday, Dark Sky stated it has already stopped taking new signups from developers looking to access Dark Sky’s data.

404,"March 30, 2020","Access to In-Vehicle Data by Third-Party Service Providers: Is there a Market Failure and, if so, How Should it be Addressed?","
By Damien Geradin (Geradin Partners)
Data generated by modern vehicles – both private and commercial – (in-vehicle data) can be used to develop new services to be offered to automotive vehicle drivers and passengers. This has generated an interest from third parties who wish to access these data to develop such services. While vehicle manufacturers are willing to provide access to in-vehicle data through the Extended Vehicle Model, third-party service providers consider that this form of access is inadequate. Instead, what they want is to access the vehicle “resources”, including the ability to install their own software in the vehicle via an “open-access platform”, as well the ability to directly communicate with the driver through the Human Machine Interface.Assuming that third-party service providers do not have access to the in-vehicle data or resources they need to provide their services, I examine whether they could rely on EU competition rules and, in particular, on Article 102 TFEU to obtain such access. The application of the refusal to deal case-law to data requests by third-party service providers may prove challenging for several reasons, as they would have to show that (1) access to such data is indispensable to provide their services, and (2) the refusal by a vehicle manufacturer to provide such access would allow it to monopolize a downstream market. Moreover, Article 102 TFEU cannot force vehicle manufacturers to create an open-access platform (where no such platform currently exists) that would allow service providers to install their own software in the vehicle.If competition law is not the right tool to mandate access to in-vehicle data or resources, I examine whether such access should be ensured through regulatory intervention. The EU should only pursue that path in case of proven market failure and should opt for a cautious approach considering that regulation can create serious compliance costs and produce unintended consequences. In addition, the EU should make sure that granting access to in-vehicle data or resources should not be at the expense of vehicle safety/security. To draw analogy, although millions of apps relying on the data generated by the use of smartphones can be found on the App Store or the Play Store, both Apple and Google impose extremely strict review processes to ensure that these apps are safe for the device and its users. Vehicle manufacturers should thus at the very least have the right to ensure through appropriate measures that access to in-vehicle data/resources does not endanger the safety and security of their vehicles, especially since the risks associated with the use of a vehicle are much greater than those to which smartphone users are exposed. Finally, the EU legislator should promote innovation and avoid locking the industry in a particular technological solution.

By Pablo Ibañez Colomo, Chilling Competition
As you know, the hearing in the Google Shopping case took place last month – speaking of which: huge thanks to Lewis Crofts for his quasi-live tweeting of what was going on (all that follows is what I gathered from his reporting).
The question of the applicable legal test was always going to be central in Google Shopping. Lewis’s tweets confirm this view. A lot of time was spent, it seems, on whether the Commission should have established that non-discriminatory display on the Google platform was indispensable within the meaning of Bronner (and, I would presume, IMS Health, which provides the most precise definition of the concept in the case law).

We demonstrate how privacy law interacts with competition and trade policy in the context of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We follow more than 110,000 websites for 18 months to show that websites reduced their connections to web technology providers after GDPR became effective, especially regarding requests involving personal data. This also holds for websites catering to non-EU audiences and therefore not bound by GDPR. We further document an increase in market concentration in web technology services after the introduction of GDPR. While most firms lose market share, the leading firm, Google, significantly increases market share.

The current contentions over SEP licensing in mobile telecommunications is primarily a result of the success of standardization to build a multi-trillion-dollar market. This success has generated a large economic surplus, whose distribution among different actors in the value chain is the focus of these contentions. This article illustrates the battle among market actors to define the meaning of FRAND through policy interventions that seek to change the rules of the game in alignment with their strategic interests. This article takes a first step towards building an operative model to describe the political processes behind the construction of the meaning of FRAND by defining the self-assertive interests, key normative concepts and claims, and legitimizing arenas where the concept of FRAND is actively socially constructed.

This article illustrates the battle among market actors to define the meaning of FRAND through policy interventions that seek to change the rules of the game in alignment with their strategic interests. While many scholars have discussed the concept of FRAND, there has not yet been a holistic study of the political processes behind the construction of its meaning.2 This article takes a first step towards building an operative model by defining the self-assertive interests, key normative concepts and claims, and legitimizing arenas where the meaning of FRAND is actively being socially ...

408,"March 24, 2020",SSOs v. Silos and the “Quality of Innovation”,"
The paper sketches a comparison between two main models for the “organization of innovation” in digital markets: the standard setting organization (“SSO”) and the silo/platform (“SILO”). The analysis focuses on four dimensions – price, speed, transparency/social accountability, and competition – of the innovation processes of these models, and aims at shedding some light on their relative value and efficiency in terms of the elusive concept of the “quality of innovation.” We argue that, whereas for two of the categories chosen for the comparison – speed and transparency/accountability – the superiority of one model over the other is relatively straightforward, as regards pricing and competition the related evaluation is more complex and the conclusions that can be drawn are more nuanced.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we propose an analysis of how the “organization of innovation” may affect its ultimate “quality” in certain important dimensions. In general, we start by recognizing the existence of at least four institutionally stylized models for the organization of innovation along an industrial value chain. These models can be led back to (1) a traditional firm, (2) a standard setting organization (SSOs), (3) a silo/platform system, (4) an open source community. All these “models” organize the exchange of information relating to products ...

409,"March 22, 2020",Amazon Accused In Massive Price-Fixing Scheme,"
Amazon was hit with antitrust claims in Seattle federal court over an alleged “pricing scheme that broadly and anti-competitively impacts virtually all products offered for sale in the US retail e-commerce market,” reported Bloomberg. 
“Amazon’s horizontal price-fixing agreement with its two million sellers is a per se violation of antitrust law,” the lawsuit claims.
The proposed consumer class action targeting the e-commerce giant, which is responsible for 49% of US online retail sales, was filed late Thursday, March 19, in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington.
The suit accuses Amazon of continuing to enforce de facto “most favored nation” pricing terms against 2 million third-party sellers offering 600 million products, despite promising the Federal Trade Commission last year that it would stop.
When the mega-retailer abandoned that policy, it was supposed to begin permitting merchants to offer lower prices through cheaper competing platforms, like eBay or their own websites, according to the complaint.
The companies should be able to turn the same profit at a lower price on those other platforms, which should in turn reduce Amazon’s prices through competition, the suit states.
But Amazon allegedly reframed the same rule as a requirement of its “fair pricing” agreements with third-party sellers, which account for 68% of its total sales. The provision explicitly requires any product sold on Amazon to “have a price that is equal to or lower than the price of the same item being sold by the seller on other sites,” according to the complaint.
“Sellers are contractually barred or severely penalized from passing on these savings to their customers,” the suit states.
Thanks to Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce market, its policies have jacked up prices across the board, the consumer plaintiffs claim.
The company also allegedly “exercises a significant level of control over the flow of available information to consumers on the internet.” Other large retailers like Walmart and Target recently complained to the FTC that they can’t break through the “information bottleneck” caused by the “collective control” Amazon and Google have over online product searches, the suit says.

410,"March 16, 2020",French Antitrust Watchdog Fines Apple $1.2B,"


France’s competition watchdog on Monday fined iPhone maker Apple 1.1 billion euros ($ 1.23 billion), saying it was guilty of anti-competitive behavior towards its distribution and retail network.
The fine, the biggest ever levied by the French antitrust body, comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on US tech giants by European regulators, who have been delving into the firms’ powerful market position, the tax they pay, and how they protect consumers’ privacy. 
Apple said it would appeal the watchdog’s ruling, which it said was at odds with legal precedent in France. 
In its decision, the French regulator said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the Internet. 
The watchdog said Apple’s two wholesalers in France fully followed the US company’s instructions on how to allocate its products to customers, instead of freely determining their commercial policy. 
“Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete with each other and to prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products,” the watchdog said in a statement. 
The two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, were fined 76 million and 63 million euros respectively, the authority said. Tech Data had no immediate comment to make and Ingram Micro could not immediately be reached. 
“The French competition authority’s decision is disheartening,” Apple said in a statement announcing it planned to appeal.
“It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discards 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.”
Since her nomination as the head of the French competition authority in 2016, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on US tech companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, which was fined 150 million euros ($167 million) for opaque advertising rules.

From her appointment as the head of the French antitrust watchdog, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on US tech giants, including Alphabet’s  Google, fined €150 million (US$167 million) for opaque advertising rules.
Apple mentioned in its latest annual report that France’s competition authority was alleging that aspects of  its sales and distribution practices were violating French competition law, which it denies.

412,"March 11, 2020",Klobuchar Presents New Antitrust Bill,"


Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota), ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has introduced a bill that could give antitrust authorities more tools to pursue potentially anticompetitive edge giants, including by fining them up to 15% of revenues for violations. 
The bill, The Anticompetitive Exclusionary Conduct Prevention Act, would “deter anticompetitive abuses that distort the competitive process and harm consumers, innovation, and new business formation.” 
Currently, the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are investigating situations where large online companies like Google or Facebook buy up smaller potential competitors and whether current antitrust law captures that as potential exclusionary conduct given that the companies being bought are too small to raise anticompetitive red flags at the time of purchase.
“We have a major monopoly problem in this country, which harms consumers and threatens free and fair competition across our economy,” said Klobuchar of the bill. “Companies need to be put on notice that exclusionary behavior that threatens competition cannot continue. Our legislation will deter anticompetitive abuses, helping to protect the competitive markets that are critical to ensuring fair prices for products and services, spurring innovation, and preserving opportunity for American entrepreneurs.”
She cited online commerce as well as pharmaceuticals and agriculture when talking about “harmful exclusionary practices by powerful companies [that] threaten free and fair competition, as decades of federal court decisions have chilled enforcement under existing laws.”

Internet technology has become increasingly widespread. Over more than 20 years, Internet-based platforms and their associated â€śbig dataâ€ť have gradually grown in economic importance. The use of big data, moreover, has enhanced cross-border Internet trading, which has aroused worldwide concern about data security. Apart from data protection concerns, an important issue is competition enforcement with respect to bigtech companies. As a country with an enormous amount of Internet users, and thus a huge Internet economy, China is also facing problems related to the supervision of digital markets.

414,"March 10, 2020",Intel Says EU Antitrust Decision Is Flawed,"


Intel on Tuesday said EU antitrust regulators got it wrong when they fined the chipmaker €1.06 billion euros more than a decade ago for thwarting a British rival in a case that could affect Google and Qualcomm. 
The US company set out its arguments at the General Court in a re-hearing of a case seen as testing the European Commission’s power to go after US tech giants which offer incentives such as rebates to lure customers from competitors. 
EU antitrust enforcers in 2009 said Intel tried to block Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to computer makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard, NECand Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel. 
The General Court is hearing the case for the second time after the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe’s highest, in 2017 disagreed with its 2014 ruling backing the commission’s decision, in a major setback to the EU competition watchdog. 
It told the lower tribunal to re-examine the case and whether exclusivity rebates actually harmed competition. The commission’s decision was fundamentally flawed, Intel’s lawyer Daniel Beard told the panel of five judges. 
“The Commission either took a wrong approach in its decision or it carried out an as efficient competitor (AEC) test and it got it wrong,” he said. An AEC test is an economic analysis that determines if a dominant company knocks out competitors that are as efficient or more efficient through anti-competitive practices while pushing out a less efficient rival may not be problematic for regulators. 
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan criticised Intel for seeking to re-open the entire case. “That was assessed very exhaustively in 2014. Intel’s request is a second bite at the cherry,” he told judges. 
The Association for Competitive Technology is supporting Intel while French consumer body UFC is backing the Commission. A judgment is likely to come next year while the losing party can appeal to the CJEU. Qualcomm has challenged a €997 million EU fine for paying iPhone maker Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.

Powerful shareholders are lobbying SoftBank to help bring about an alliance between ride-hailing groups Grab and Gojek, south-east Asia’s biggest internet unicorns, which are bleeding cash in a bruising battle for market share, according to multiple people with knowledge of the discussions.
The talks centre on a tie-up in Indonesia. The world’s fourth-most populous country is the most lucrative market for Jakarta-headquartered Gojek, whose backers include Tencent and Google, and Singapore-based Grab, which counts SoftBank and Microsoft as investors. Both have intensified efforts to win customers there in the past 18 months. 
“The forces at play here are higher than simply what Grab or Gojek want — or indeed don’t want. This is about a number of long-term influential shareholders in both companies who want to either stem the losses or find a way to exit their investments,” said one Grab investor.  
There have been on and off talks between the two bitter rivals for at least two years, but in recent months there has been a new urgency, these people added.

The Walt Disney Company has struck its second European distribution deal for Disney+ in a week – this time with Italy’s Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM).
The two companies have struck a multi-year that makes TIM the exclusive wholesale distributor of Disney in Italy, via its TIMVision platform. The deal will see the streaming service offered to TIM’s new and existing customers via an internet bundle. It will start March 24.
This comes after Disney struck an agreement with Sky in the UK.
The slate of Disney+ Originals from launch includes The Mandalorian, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Diary of a Future President, The World According To Jeff Goldblum, and Marvel’s Hero Project.
TIM’s CEO Luigi Gubitosi said, “We are proud that Disney has chosen TIM as its strategic partner in Italy. This agreement comes within the strategy adopted by TIM to pursue alliances with major international players in various segments, to offer cutting-edge products and services. Adding Disney+ gives a major boost to the strategy of TIMVision as Italy’s leading aggregator of premium content in the Italian TV industry, in a context where convergence between telecommunications and content will play an increasingly key role in the group’s future, thanks to the development of ultrabroadband and 5G.”

418,"March 3, 2020",FTC Taking a 10-Year Antitrust Look-Back at Big Tech,"
Are These the First Steps Toward a New Approach to Merger Control?
Big Tech mergers make big headlines, but there is much more to a deal than how much money changes hands. More important questions need to be answered, such as how much future innovation might be lost, how much healthy competition will be eliminated, and what volumes of consumer data will suddenly be controlled by one or only a handful of companies.
Some lower-cost acquisitions fly under the radar of antitrust law enforcement agencies. But should they?
Criticized for ignoring “killer acquisitions” and going too easy on Big Tech – approving more and more mergers but not taking more enforcement action – the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has decided to revisit all Big Tech deals consummated during the last 10 years.
Specifically, the Commission has demanded information about acquisitions not reported to antitrust agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. The FTC’s recent orders require Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft to provide information and documents on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of transactions that each company consummated between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019.
The FTC issued the orders under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which authorizes it to study matters even if they do not have a specific law enforcement purpose. The FTC said the information it seeks will deepen its understanding of Big Tech’s acquisition activity, including how the companies report their transactions to federal antitrust agencies, and whether they are making anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors that fall below HSR filing and reporting thresholds. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said this effort will help evaluate whether federal agencies are getting adequate notice of anticompetitive transactions.
According to the orders, each company must identify acquisitions that were not reported to the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice under the HSR Act and provide information similar to that requested on the HSR form. The FTC demands the companies provide information on their acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment agreements, agreements to hire key personnel from other companies, and post-employment covenants not to compete. The FTC has also demanded more information about post-acquisition product development and pricing, including “whether and how acquired assets were integrated and how acquired data has been treated.”
“The Commission plans to use the information obtained in this study to examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals, including whether acquisitions not subject to HSR notification might have raised competitive concerns, and the nature and extent of other agreements that may restrict competition. The Commission also seeks to learn more about how small firms perform after they are acquired by large technology firms,” the FTC press release said.
Supporters of this action say Big Tech has been able to gobble up innovative competitors at the expense of consumers. Critics call it a fishing expedition, question the Commission’s motives, and fear it could lead to the unwinding of deals as old as 10 years.
Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra issued a statement praising the study of the Big Tech competitive landscape and urged the Commission to next turn its sights on the healthcare sector.
“During the last three decades, the share of independent dialysis facilities has shrunk drastically and two national chains now own the majority of dialysis facilities and earn nearly all of the industry’s revenue, with most acquisitions occurring below the HSR thresholds. Similar patterns of ‘stealth consolidation’ have been observed in pharmaceutical and hospital markets,” Wilson and Chopra said.

419,"March 3, 2020",UK’s CMA Tackled Highest Share Of Deals Worldwide,"
The UK has emerged as the most aggressive antitrust enforcer worldwide after it frustrated the highest proportion of deals in the past five years and ramped up the fines it imposed, new figures reveal.
The Competition and Markets Authority, which is seeking tougher powers after Brexit, thwarted 6 per cent of the deals it assessed over the past five years, according to a new report by law firm Allen & Overy. That compares with less than 1 per cent of deals scrutinised by the US and Germany.
Last year the CMA thwarted eight deals in the UK — three of which were prohibited and five abandoned. It only blocked one merger in 2018. The authority has also increased the fines it levied relating to procedural infringements from one fine of £20,000 in 2017 to a total of £778,000 of fines last year.
The findings come weeks after Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the British watchdog was seeking a more active role in scrutinising large mergers and tackling anti-competitive behaviour.
Industry insiders expect this trend to continue; the CMA has decided to provisionally prohibit three deals, including the proposed merger of travel services company Sabre and Farelogix and JD Sports’ proposed £90m takeover of Footasylum.
Antonio Bavasso, partner at Allen & Overy, said the push by the UK competition authority to frustrate mergers follows accusations from academic circles that enforcers have been too lenient in recent years.
He added that Brexit was likely to propel the CMA to take more action. He said: “After the transition period the UK is expected to continue this trajectory of tough enforcement. Internationally they will also hope to have a seat at the table in which their voice on international mergers is more distinctly heard.
“The CMA will not be shy of making tough decisions even if there is a political price,” he added.

420,"March 2, 2020",UK Puts Digital Tax On The Table In US Trade Talks,"


The United Kingdom said on Monday that it would put its proposed digital services tax on the table for discussion in upcoming trade talks with the United States, a move that will cool tensions following tariff threats from the White House, reported Reuters. 
“We note comments regarding digital taxation and will consider this as part of our policy development,” the UK government said in a white paper detailing its mandate for the U.S. talks.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has proposed a 2% sales tax on internet-based tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google, among others, based on revenue generated from his country’s residents. The French government passed such a tax late last year, and other European Union countries such as Italy have seriously looked at the idea. 
The digital tax is meant to make it difficult for tech companies to shift profits to the EU’s low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland. French President Emmanuel Macron has called it necessary to defend the interests of his country and the EU. 
The Trump administration is adamantly opposed to such taxes, seeing them as unfairly designed to target U.S. companies specifically. It has sought to scuttle idea before the idea before it becomes the standard in the EU.

421,"March 2, 2020",Bill Barr Takes-over DOJ’s Tech Probe,"


Attorney General William Barr has set his sights on big tech companies like Google and Facebook, and has personally taken over the Department of Justice’s antitrust probes.
Barr has sidelined the Antitrust Division’s current leadership and placed himself and deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen in charge of those matters, and some antitrust experts believe that could put new pressure on tech giants, reported Politico.
Delrahim and his No. 2, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Barry Nigro, were both recused from the Google probe earlier this month, for reasons that include Delrahim’s prior legal work for the search giant. That has left the antitrust investigation in the hands of Ryan Shores, a lawyer in Rosen’s office, and Alex Okuliar, an appointee who joined the department less than a month ago.
Delrahim’s chief of staff, William Rinner, is in the process of leaving the agency, according to two people with knowledge of his plans. And Delrahim himself has faced persistent questions about whether he will continue serving under Barr, who had previously clashed with him during a major antitrust fight involving AT&T’s 2018 takeover of Time Warner.
Barr, a former attorney for Time Warner and Verizon, dealt with antitrust issues in that capacity, a fact that critics of Silicon Valley have said gives them more faith in him despite the increased pressure on the companies, reported Politico. Barr’s proficiency with antitrust has led some to compare him to former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who headed the Antitrust Division before becoming attorney general in 1940, and whose portrait now adorns Barr’s office.
Barr is serving his second stint as US attorney general, and has few deterrents to waging an aggressive attack, said Hal Singer, an antitrust economist and adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s business school. “Barr doesn’t need future gigs so he can pursue the tech platforms without worry about his future income,” Singer said.

Each of these three papers attempts to address the same basic problem. Ever since the rise of the Chicago-School, it is widely accepted that a monopolist cannot automatically raise its profits by entering an adjacent market (i.e. leveraging its monopoly position), for instance through tying. This has sometimes been called the single-monopoly-profit theory. In more recent years, various scholars have refined this Chicago-School intuition, and identified instances where the theory fails. While the single monopoly profit theory has been criticized in academic circles, it is important to note that the three papers cited by the Commission accept its basic premise. They thus attempt to show why the theory fails in the context of the Google Android case…

France, Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic, frustrated by failure to reach consensus on an EU-wide digital services tax, are pushing ahead with their own measures. 
“I strongly applaud that member states are picking it up where we failed as a community together to do something,” Vestager said in an interview with Bloomberg Tax on Tuesday, February 25.
“I think it is very important in order to be able to answer the many businesses who pay their taxes, that you’re willing to do something to make sure that your competitors, they pay as well,” she added.
The US contends that the proposals unfairly target U.S. tech companies such as Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com, and Facebook. A French decision last year to levy a 3% digital tax prompted threats from the Trump administration to hit US$2.4 billion of French products with tariffs.
An EU tax proposal—shelved last March after failing to get unanimous support from member countries—included a short-term tax on the revenue of digital companies and a longer-term approach that changed how countries determine whether a digital company has taxable presence in their jurisdictions.
Vestager said that the countries’ digital services taxes aren’t State aid—subsidies provided to a company that give it an unfair advantage over others—if they are are similar to the EU-wide proposal. 
“Obviously we would not suggest something that would be not state aid compliant,” she said.
The fight to tax the digital economy isn’t going away, and companies should prepare for the EU to adopt its own rules if OECD talks fail, said Vestager.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is trying to get nearly 140 countries to agree on a plan to overhaul how the digital economy is taxed. The effort seeks to address concerns that multinationals, particularly tech giants, aren’t paying enough tax in the countries where they have users or consumers. 
The OECD plan, divided into two “pillars,” would give more taxing rights to the countries where multinationals have customers, replace some current tax rules with simpler formulas, and create a global minimum tax rate and anti-abuse rules.
“I think the important takeaway is sort of the willingness to say, first, we engage fully with the OECD because a global agreement is much better than a regional agreement. But if that is not possible, we will do our best to find a European approach,” Vestager said.
“We have not really sort of put pen to paper as to what would be a renewed European approach because we don’t know as we speak,” she added.
The European Commission’s five-year battle with Member States over tax rulings that provide preferential treatment—or state aid—to some companies has borne fruit, Vestager said. Countries are beginning to improve their approach to issuing the rulings, she said.
“We have seen a number of changes on ground. We’ve seen that in Luxembourg. They have changed the way they do tax rulings. Same in the Netherlands,” she said.
Despite the success in battling systemic issues with tax rules, the Commission has no plans to halt its efforts chasing individual tax rulings, Vestager said.

426,"February 26, 2020",Oracle Is Funding Dark Money Group To Fight Big Tech,"


The Internet Accountability Project (IAP) started last year and quickly joined the growing crusade against big tech. At the time the non-profit group refused to say who was financing it. Now according to a new report from Bloomberg, one of its benefactors is Oracle.
Oracle donated between US$25,000 and US$99,999 last year to the internet project, according to a new political-giving report Oracle posted on its website. The group calls itself a conservative non-profit advocating for tougher privacy rules and stronger antitrust enforcement against the internet giants.
The IAP financing is just one part of an aggressive, and sometimes secretive, battle Oracle has been waging against its biggest rivals, including Amazon and Alphabet’s Google.
Oracle spent years fighting to unseat Amazon as the front-runner for a lucrative Pentagon cloud contract, which was awarded to Microsoft in October.
The Redwood City, California, company has also been locked in a decade-long legal dispute with Google, claiming the search-engine giant violated Oracle copyrights by including some Java programming code in the Android phone. Oracle acquired Java’s developer, Sun Microsystems, in 2010.
Earlier this month, IAP filed an amicus brief supporting Oracle’s position in the case. IAP stated it wants to “ensure that Google respects the copyrights of Oracle and other innovators.” The US Supreme Court on March 24 will hear oral arguments in the Google v Oracle America case.

427,"February 26, 2020",Diagnosing “Killer” Acquisitions: FTC Market Study to Review Past M&A Deals in Big Tech,"
John Eichlin, Marie-Marie de Fays; Linklaters
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a rare market study to investigate whether non-reportable past acquisitions by the major tech companies included “killer” acquisitions of nascent competitors. The study is intended to determine if changes to merger control rules are appropriate to cast a broader net and ensure that potentially problematic deals are reviewed proactively. The initial focus of the review is on the tech sector, but it potentially has much broader implications for the merger rules across industries. And the FTC may turn next to healthcare and other innovative sectors.
Merger
reportability rules in the spotlight
The FTC has sent information requests to five large tech companies (Alphabet / Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft). These requests reportedly ask the recipients to document their acquisition strategies and outline the details of the transactions they completed over the past decade. In addition to focusing on potential “killer acquisitions” that fell short of the notification thresholds, the requests also target other arrangements, including voting and board appointment agreements and agreements to hire key personnel. Consistent with the FTC’s parallel focus on employment-related issues, the requests also call for information on related post-employment non-competes for key employees.
The FTC has special authority to conduct studies separate from its law enforcement authority. Under this process, the FTC can issue legally-binding orders to companies to obtain information and documents. Typically, the outcome of such studies results in a report summarizing findings, and sometimes including recommendations for further actions. Based on this study, the FTC could explore possible measures to expand reportability requirements or introduce notification rules, without needing congressional involvement, and with implications beyond the tech sector…

In this month’s edition of CPI Talks we have the pleasure of speaking with Paul Gilbert and Maurits Dolmans, of the London office of Cleary Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton LLP. Maurits recently wrote articles entitled “Should We Disrupt Antitrust Law?” and “Pandora’s Box of Online Ills.” Paul has given presentations on “Competition Law and Big Data.” Both have extensive experience in the IT sector. They have advised various clients in this area, but speak here on their own behalf.
Thank you, Paul and Maurits, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
1. Recent months and years have seen intense discussion on “big data” and its role in competition in the digital economy. Much of this discussion relates to the question of whether, in the language of the competition rules, “big data” are a mere asset, a “barrier to entry,” an “essential facility,” or all of the above. Is the classic terminology misleading when applied to this new phenomenon? Rather, does this debate merely underline the need for a careful case-by-case approach to competition issues involving complex technological questions?
We don’t think the terms need changing. They are part of a framework that is used to differentiate those situations where competition intervention is needed from those where it is not. Intervening in the wrong cases will only undermine incentives to invest in collecting and analyzing data.
In most cases, data are an input for a product or service. It is not the service itself. So, is it right to ask whether data are an essential facility? Put another way, do competitors need access to that particular set of data for competition to exist in a downstream market?  If not, intervention is unwarranted, and could do more harm than good. There may, in theory, be cases where data are an essential facility, because the data are indispensable and the source is no longer available. But they will be the exception rather than the rule.
Holding data is not like owning a harbor or controlling the electricity network. In those cases, anyone trying to operate a shipping service or supply electricity may have to have access to the infrastructure. Data are not “owned” or controlled in that way. I could record the color preference of every car buyer if I thought the information was going to be useful, and I may be only person to “own” that data. But that doesn’t make that database an essential facility, and it doesn’t stop anyone else doing exactly the same thing. Many types of data are “non-rivalrous goods,” in the sense that they can be duplicated and recreated without limit.
It is also tempting to treat all types of data as the same, when they are not. Personal data are different from observed data, for instance. Observed data often has a short lifespan. For my car-color database to remain useful, I would probably have to repeat the exercise regularly. Otherwise the data will become stale and worthless. And I may not collect it at all if I had to give it away to all my competitors.
Personal data are different. If a consumer uploads their photographs and contacts to a social media platform, they could become locked in. If many users are locked in, that may create a barrier to entry for new social media platforms – in the sense that gathering an equivalent set of data is going to be more difficult or more expensive for the new entrant than it was for the first mover. In such a situation, ensuring that consumers can transfer their information freely and easily between different platforms can be pro-competitive. This, in turn, may require standard setting to ensure that data can be easily ported to new service providers.
So, the terminology is right. It just needs to be applied carefully, and seen in context.
2. Information scientists famously refer to the so-called “DIKW pyramid.” In short, mere raw “data” provide “information” that experts can use to produce “knowledge” and (hopefully) “wisdom” that can yield valuable results. This leads some commentators to suggest that, at least in certain circumstances, data should not be considered to be a true “barrier to entry”: the real barrier would be the technology and expertise needed to extract “wisdom.” To what extent should competition practitioners, enforcers, and courts rely on expertise from the sciences to assess these and other questions in individual cases?
We agree. In this information pyramid, data are merely raw measurements, whereas information is an understanding of the relations between the data, knowledge is an understanding of the patterns that emerge, and intelligence or wisdom is an understanding of the principles that allow judgment, better decision making, and prediction.
Data are useless without the ability to analyze them intelligently and creatively. Take away the data from any online service provider (but leave the engineers) and they will quickly be back in business. Take away the engineers (but leave the data) and they will soon be in trouble.
There are lots of examples. Start-up companies such as WhatsApp, Hailo, BlaBlaCar, Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest have all been able to build successful and innovative products with access to little or no data at the start. If data are a barrier, it can certainly be overcome.
Studies have shown that data quickly loses its incremental value after a certain point. According to the law of diminishing returns, once a critical volume is reached, the marginal value of additional data for statistical analysis is limited. There is no value in simply collecting more and more data.
Competition authorities and courts should take this into account. They need to ask what data is really needed, how much is needed, and how easily it can be collected. Data is everywhere, it is cheap to collect, can be bought and sold, and is non-rivalrous – it is not used up like oil.
So, it is right to think of intelligence and creativity as the real drivers of competition. As to whether they could become barriers to entry, it seems unlikely. There seems to be no shortage of either.
3. Recent reports (including the UK Furman Report, the EU Commission’s Crémer Report, and the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Report) discuss the treatment of data under the competition rules in some detail. Specifically, the Crémer Report underlines the need to adopt a careful approach to the “essential facilities” concept if applied to data. In your view, are there grounds for a modified approach to the “indispensability” and “new product” criteria under the classic essential facilities rules should they be applied to data?
Many competition authorities and regulators are grappling with the question whether we should be quicker to intervene in digital, data-driven markets. Should companies that collect data be required to give access to that data as a way of helping their competitors, even if they have not done anything that would otherwise be considered anticompetitive?
This is market engineering rather than antitrust, and is a risky path to follow. It means forcing Firm A to support Firm B even if Firm B does not need that support to compete. Forcing data-sharing in this way would pervert the normal competitive incentives of both. Firm A will be less inclined to invest in collecting data and designing innovative ways of doing so if it has to share the results with its competitors. Firm B will not have incentives to invest either, because it can free-ride on the efforts of Firm A.
The Crémer Report recognizes precisely this concern. It recognizes the risks that a lower threshold for intervention would have on commercial incentives. It says that “a thorough analysis will be required” to determine whether access to data is “truly indispensable” in order to compete in neighboring markets. It also recommends that competition law principles should be central to any sector-specific regulation that is designed to mandate data access. 
We agree. It is easy to lose sight of the benefits that come from companies investing in collecting and analyzing data in ever more inventive ways. Undermining these incentives could be hugely damaging. As we said before, with respect to personal data, the better option is to give individuals the right to port their data between different services providers, so as to encourage the latter to keep improving their offering to persuade the users to stay with them.
4. One of the most controversial forms of “big data” relates to personal information used to provide services such as online social media, search, and advertising. Individuals’ rights concerning such data are regulated separately under rules such as the EU GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Certain competition remedies (notably mandated access) would raise obvious potential conflicts with these specific regulations. How should this circle be squared? Is this an argument for non-intervention by competition enforcers in cases of such potential conflict, or at least careful remedy design (e.g. anonymization of user data if disclosure is mandated)? Is enough being done by data protection regulators and competition enforcers to coordinate in this regard?
It would be perverse for competition law remedies to override data protection. Central to GDPR and other data protection rules is the principle that individuals should be able to control what happens to their personal data – information about them.
I may be happy to share my personal information, health records and banks details with one company that I trust, but not with others. That is undermined if the company is then forced to share my details with someone else that I don’t trust, or have perhaps never heard of. When a consumer shares their personal data, they have to be confident that it will be protected and won’t be shared without their consent.
A good example of how the system can work is in Open Banking. If I want to use a new service – perhaps a FinTech start-up company – that company will be able to access my bank account details securely, but only if I give my consent.
Many of the largest technology companies (including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter) are currently working on a similar initiative, called the Data Transfer Project. The purpose is to allow consumers to transfer their information freely between providers using open source coding. It will mean that users do not have to download their data from one service before uploading to another. This is procompetitive. It helps users to switch even more quickly between providers and try out new services, as well as backing up their data on multiple services. And the user always remains in control. This approach to “portable data” creates new opportunities for intermediary services or portals that help users transfer data, or manage multiple platform settings.
This type of initiative facilitates competition and new entry, while still respecting consumers’ rights and data protection rules.
5. A common complaint levied against companies possessing large datasets is that their existing “scale” renders it impossible for new entrants to compete. Are there alternative means that regulators, policymakers, and industry could use to make large-scale data available to new entrants (e.g. databases of photo, video, or anonymized personal data that could be used to train machine learning algorithms)? Would such an approach be feasible as a remedy in a hypothetical competition case? Or is such an approach best left to bespoke industry or government-mandated initiatives?
It is wrong to assume that scale is necessarily critical or a barrier to entry. This idea ignores the law of diminishing returns. Experience in many areas where data are used as an input, like machine translation, image processing, speech recognition, or teaching artificial intelligence systems, the first million data are much more important than the second and so forth. Huge amounts of open source datasets are increasingly available for AI training (from sources as various as kaggle.com, FiveThirtyEight, Google Public Data Explorer, or from EU Open Data Portal, Data.gov. WHO Open Data repository, and World Bank Open Data, etc.). Open source software and cloud computing makes it easier for start-ups than ever before to run complex computations on these open data.
We have already mentioned several examples of companies that have been able to grow quickly without having access to large datasets when they started. In each of these cases, “scale” was not a barrier. If anything, they show that innovation is critical and that data are easy to gather.
The European Commission has also considered this question many times in merger cases. Whenever it has looked at markets in detail, it has found that rivals are able collect the data they need.  In Facebook/WhatsApp, for example, it found that “there will continue to be a large amount of Internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes.”
In Microsoft/Skype, it found that barriers to entry were low, pointing to the “immediate success” of new entrants Viber, Fring, and Tango. Viber was downloaded more than a million times within three days of its launch, 10 million times within two months, and 15 million times within six months.
There may be cases where access to an existing database is critical for competition to exist. It will depend on the type of data and whether the database is replicable. In the UK, for example, the National Health Service provides access to huge amount of anonymized healthcare data for analysis. That data wouldn’t be available otherwise and cannot be replicated. But this is an exception. Online user data are very unlikely to fall into this category.
In the EU, we have a tendency to blame U.S.-based online firms (ignoring China for the time being) for the lack of EU online powerhouses, and for the difficulties of digital disruption. They are conveniently big targets. But a focus on data sharing is not the solution. The societal problems resulting from digital disruption should be solved by targeted and proportional regulation, rather than forcing firms to share data across the board. If we want to grow EU-based innovative powerhouses, the answer is a policy of creating an environment where innovation can flourish: innovation hubs combining academic centers of excellence and existing technology businesses with carefully targeted Government-sponsored open projects, which together can fertilize start-up businesses by providing talent and risk capital, a culture of entrepreneurship, critical thinking, and creativity, nurtured in an environment of fair and balanced tax laws, IPRs strong enough to encourage innovation but not so strict as to block new entry, and competition rules that preserve opportunities for new entrants without punishing them once they become successful. There is plenty of big data; what is scarcer is technical talent and business creativity, and wise regulators. ",Google

This paper examines the question of data as an essential facility. It argues that rather than size being the biggest driver of data meeting the deﬁnition of being an essential facility, it is instead whether the data are protected by copyright or privacy regulation.

I. ARE DATA AN ESSENTIAL FACILITY?
The notion of an “Essential facility” is key to antitrust law, because denial of access to key facilities can mean that a potential monopolist will be immune, at least for some time, to most forms of competition. As an economist, I observe that legal scholars debate whether anything can really be an essential facility, given that one can always raise exceptions or caveats to any even potentially watertight case.
Given this scholarly debate, it is useful to introduce terminology used for a parallel notion in strategic management. Here the focus is on a “resource” that gives “sustainable competitive advantage,” or that can act as a barrier to entry. The idea of such a “resource” was first articulated by my colleague Birger Wirnerfelt at MIT,2 and then further refined by Barney (1991).3 To be a “resource,” the asset in question needs to be valuable, non-imitable (or at least difficult to substitute), and rare. More recent the-ory has introduced the additional nuance that the firm must be able to “control” this rare, valuable, imperfectly imitable and non-substitutable resource.4
When we teach this framework, our aim is to give managers a means to consider what resources a firm has, which may allow them to build sustainable competitive advantage in such a way that would allow them to profit. However, a parallel use of this framework can also be to allow an examination of potential barriers to entry, and, at the extreme, whether or not a firm’s “resource” or “core competency” has morphed to the extent that it could be considered to be an essential facility.
In earlier work I went through the first four pillars of this strategy framework (i.e. the conditions relating to a given facility of asset being rare, valuable, non-imitable and non-substitutable) in considering whether data could confer such an enduring competitive advantage.5 In this essay, I will consider the more recent additional pillar that has been added to this strategic framework – that is, the question of whether firms really control data in a way that makes it a source of competitive advantage.

II. INTERNAL MEANS OF CONTROL OVER DATA
The type of data that firms can directly control access to differs according to its purposes and between firms. Typically, the key distinction is whether the presentation of data is internal or external. For example, YouTube cannot easily prevent access to data about who has liked a video on YouTube, or the content of comments. However, Uber can choose not to make public data on the geographic granularity of rider pickups. Of course, even in that case it is somewhat possible to recreate the data, and indeed a French PhD student has managed to access partial data through the Uber API for her work on gender discrimination in ride pickups.6 In general, though data is non-rivalrous, it is possible to exclude access to particular data if the data are not public. Sometimes, the legal treatment of data has focused on the idea of non-rivalry – which is indeed a key component of the definition of a public good – without also acknowledging that much of the time the same digital tools that allow the collection of vast datasets also permit control over who accesses it.
The key point is that firms are often able to control access to a particular dataset. What they are far less able to do is to control the ability of rival firms to create a similar dataset. In particular, they are unable to control the ability of a rival firm to create a dataset which offers similar insights. This latter point is important because ultimately the value of data is not the raw manifestation of the data itself, but the ability of a firm to use this data as an input to insight.
In general, I argue that the ability of a firm to control whether a rival also creates a similar dataset very much depends on the extensiveness of the digital footprint that a consumer has when generating data that gives that particular insight.
Let us contrast a few scenarios which are all taken from the context of digital advertising. I recognize that the power of digital data may well be greatest outside the world of digital advertising (for example in optimizing logistics). I focus on digital advertising simply because that is the focus of much of the current antitrust debate involving data in this context:

A firm owns data allowing them to identify both the income and zip code of a particular set of “eyeballs” arriving at a website, and thereby to know what hotel ad to show to that set of eyeballs.7
A firm owns data that allows them to predict what smartphone a set of “eyeballs” is most likely to buy, and to feature this smartphone in personalized recommendations.
A firm owns data that identifies that a set of “eyeballs” is shopping for last-minute flowers to be delivered on Mother’s Day.

As you read this essay, it might be useful for you to rank these examples in terms of likelihood of the firm being able to “control” this data as a source of sustained competitive advantage. I would argue that in each instance, there is a feature of the data which limits control.
A. When Data Reproducibility Limits Control
In the Stigler report, a motivating example for why data might have increasing returns is the idea that one potential source of data about hotel bookings is locational data.8 The second useful source of information might be presumed income of the individual. The Stigler report argues that the combination of data about zip code and income may be more powerful than the information about each data point individually. However, what is striking about this example is that the two sources of data (zip code and income) are publicly available, and are therefore not hard for any firm to gain access to.
The fact that data is non-rival and virtually costless to produce has led to a large industry of data brokers such as Acxiom and Experian, who collect and parse data about people’s internet activity. This is usually the focus of discussion about data aggregation and reuse. However, this example of location and income information is a useful example of the types of data which are freely available through public datasets. It is reasonably easy to geo-locate any set of eyeballs using a digital device.9 It is also reasonably easy to use census data to obtain the average income of a zip code.10
Given how relatively easy it is to reproduce zip code and income information from public sources and then link them to the geographical location of a user, then this will inherently limit a firm’s ability to control such data as a source of sustained competitive advantage.
B. When the Ability to Recreate the Insights of the Data Limits Control
In the second example, it is notable that the potential source of competitive advantage is not data per se. Instead, it is the prediction based on data about what smartphone someone is likely to purchase. Indeed, no company knows for certain what smartphone someone will buy.11 There are many potential ways to predict smartphone purchase likelihood.
One potential course is to use paid search data on the type of phones someone has searched for. Another way might be to use browsing data on a review site to see what kind of reviews the user is browsing. Another way may be to use “look-a-like” data to study what smartphones other similar people have bought in the past.
One issue is that this kind of prediction task is not easy. I have studied this in my own research – (Neumann et al., 2019) – where we show that often predictions of people’s age and gender based on browsing data are not much better than random chance.12 However, that research seems to suggest that it is the skill of the humans in charge of the predictions that seems to matter, in that prediction improves when a human guides the choice of the algorithms.
Therefore, the key questions are, whether there is only one set of data that is appropriate for a prediction task; and also to give appropriate credit for the difficulty of creating insights from the data, rather than ascribing the rarity of the insight to the data itself.
C. When the Short-lived Nature of the Data Limits Control
I chose the example of the Mother’s Day flowers, because this is an instance where the consumer is likely to have a small digital footprint. Someone running late for Mother’s Day is likely to perhaps only engage with one search engine or one website when searching for flowers. As a result, it is possible that only one firm has access to the insight that someone is wishing to buy flowers for Mother’s Day. This enhances a firm’s potential control of the data.
However, there is a caveat, which is that in this particular example the value of the data is very short-lived. Once Mother’s Day is over, the data loses its value, rendering it not a good source of sustained competitive advantage. Next Mother’s Day, the firm will have to compete again to be the digital platform or website which gains the insight. The only chance of the data retaining its value is that the same person may be tardy at buying flowers on Mother’s Day the next year, such that the data become useful as an annual prompt.
This example shows that it is hard to generalize about how easy it is to `control’ the value of any one bit of data. However, it also shows that it is important when thinking about control of data, to also think about how long-lived any insight from the data might be.

III. EXTERNAL SOURCES OF CONTROL: PRIVACY REGULATION AND COPYRIGHT AS SOURCE OF CONTROL OVER DATA
The previous section discussed limitations in terms of imposing internal control over data. However, I would argue that there are still concerns regarding external sources of control. I would argue that this is most likely to be an issue when the data in question is also potentially governed by privacy or copyright protections.
A useful example where data segmentation services are treated as though it was an essential facility is that of IMS Health and NSC Health corporations. These are two competitors in pharmaceutical data services in Germany which provided sales reports from individual pharmacies.
Due to German privacy laws, data has to be appropriately anonymized in a way which is privacy-compliant. The most practical way of do-ing this (without losing all marketing insight from the data) is to aggregate it to the postcode level. This was done by something referred to as the “brick structure,” which grouped together pharmacies into commercially useful geographical clusters which would not permit the identification of any one pharmacy and complied with the German privacy rule that at least 3 pharmacies had to be aggregated. However, IMS asserted copyright over the brick structure. Any other means of aggregation were potentially not privacy-compliant, because differential aggregation could in theory then be used to identify an individual pharmacy if a firm cross-referenced the two datasets. At this point, the European Commission ordered IMS to grant access to the brick structure on commercially reasonable terms.
It is notable though that in this case it is not data per se that is the essential facility but instead the segmentation and parsing of the data.13
With the growing presence and salience of privacy regulation such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, however, it seems likely that privacy regulation may allow data to become more excludable. In Miller & Tucker (2014),14 we discuss how hospitals often limit the portability of patient data or intentionally “silo” data while citing privacy concerns as their motivation for doing so. However, we show that the likelihood of siloing data under the guise of privacy regulation often seems to reflect the competitive structure of the local market. I modeled this as well in Campbell et al. (2015),15 where we showed that the more strenuous the opt-in requirements are, the more likely it is that consumers will opt into sharing their data with just a few firms, rather than being willing to share data with new firms or potential entrants.
As I point out in a new paper,16 in the past five years there appears to be evidence that in some industries where privacy concerns are particularly salient, concentration of firms increases. One industry I highlight where this has occurred is that of educational technology. The com-plex nature of student privacy has potentially facilitated two firms (Apple and Google) being able to supply a great deal of educational software to K-12 schools, because school administrators feel reassured that they are sufficiently privacy-compliant compared to educational technology startups in this space.

8 In the Stigler report it states that the “home zip code” of the user is useful as there may be some “limited ability to predict interest in a hotel based on this zip code being sufficiently far from the hotel.” The report formally models the likelihood of a user booking a hotel as a function of their distance from the zip code. I assume this means this implies that I am most likely by their model to book a hotel in Augusta (Western Australia), which is the city I believe furthest from Boston. Interestingly, before reading the Stigler report prediction that I would book a hotel in Augusta, I had not contemplated going to Augusta. I agree it does look like a nice destination, though given that Augusta only has two hotels, I suspect that the prediction task is not that hard.

430,"February 24, 2020","Essential Facilities Fallacy: Big Tech, Winner-Take-All Markets, and Anticompetitive Effects","
There have been calls to treat data as an essential facility to reduce barriers to entry in the digital economy where a “winner-take-all” dynamic is often present. In such markets, traditional enforcement may fail to enjoin conduct, or an acquisition, that lowers welfare in expectation because anticompetitive effects, regardless of their magnitude, are given no weight if deemed unlikely to occur. The authors consider several proposals to fine-tune competition law and argue that calls to regulate Big Tech companies like public utilities should be viewed with skepticism because they ignore dynamic competition, the complexity of micromanaging a rapidly evolving sector of the economy, and the very purpose of competition law – to protect competition, not competitors.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Big Tech superstar firms, which is a term used by many to refer to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and sometimes Microsoft, have grown to be among the largest companies in the world principally through innovation, data harvesting and the popularity of their products. Over the past few years, there have been calls for action by populists, the press and politicians to reduce the power of the so-called “dataopolies.”2
The business models of Google and Facebook, for example, operate through multi-sided platforms. They offer products to consumers on one side of the platform for free and recei...

431,"February 24, 2020",Can Digital Data be Replaced? Data Substitutability is the Key,"
The question of whether digital data constitute a barrier to entry or an essential facility does not admit a “one-size-fits-all” answer: only a case-by-case assessment of whether digital data have viable substitutes will allow the antitrust law interpreter understanding whether digital data fall within one of the categories. Therefore, the real question becomes “do digital data have viable substitutes?” In order to answer that question, a thorough assessment of the needs and uses that the undertaking seeking those digital data wants to accomplish through them is required.  Establishing the kind of information that the undertaking wants to infer from the digital data, indeed, will be crucial in order to understand whether such “demand” can be met by recurring to potential alternative datasets. However, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has also revealed competitive risks that the categories of traditional antitrust analysis do not seem to tackle effectively.

“Just the facts ma’am: competition cases are all about facts.”3 That sentence has the merit of highlighting how antitrust law, aiming at ensuring the proper functioning of the market, cannot disregard the knowledge of the many and varied empirical elements that influence economic agents’ decisions and their effects on consumer welfare.

432,"February 24, 2020",Grasping the Meaning of Big Tech Antitrust Consent,"

By Giovanna Massarotto (UCL & University of Iowa)1

I. Is Antitrust all about a Paradox?
Many academic lawyers and economists see antitrust enforcement as either being too lax or too prone to over-regulation.2 Today, Bork’s antitrust “paradox” is even more relevant, because increasingly dynamic data-driven markets are making the enforcement of antitrust principles challenging. Price is no longer the main parameter of competition — most digital markets are data driven, and products and services are offered free of charge to users. Network effects, which characterize these markets, can easily lead to a “winner takes all” outcome.3 As a consequence, concentration in data markets is likely to be the result of a company’s success rather than anticompetitive conduct — and no antitrust action at all or heavy fines seem to be the common solutions.
Like in the past, the antitrust “paradox” seems to be what antitrust is all about — a discipline that is constantly seeking to define its identity and scope. Some scholars have suggested that antitrust should be simply abolished,4 on the basis that for much of its history it has done more harm than good. But, as simple and attractive this suggestion might be, it is unlikely to be an effective solution.

II. Could Consent Hold the Key to Resolve such a Paradox?
In 1906, the DOJ reached the first consent-based solution to settle an antitrust investigation in Otis Elevator Co.5 Nowadays, approximately ninety perce...

433,"February 24, 2020",EU Eyes Single European Data Market,"


In Europe, the continued evolution of data policies and regulation now point toward a single market across the Continent.
As reported mid week, the European Commission is planning a single European market for data, in hopes that by pooling talent, the region can compete with Big Tech in Silicon Valley and China.
Final proposals — expected by the end of this year following feedback from stakeholders — would also limit the control Big Tech firms like Facebook and Amazon have over data.
“The battle for industrial data starts now and Europe will be the main battlefield. Europe has the largest industrial base. The winners of today will not be the winners of tomorrow,” EU industry chief Thierry Breton told a news conference last week.
And one way to leverage that data, and to boost competition, according to reports, focuses on industrial data, which might help Europe become more competitive with the Internet of Things (IoT).
Breton said the plan’s cornerstone calls for the creation of a €2 billion EU cloud platform alliance. Other proposals would include directives governing use of data across borders and data interoperability.
There is also a proposal for getting rid of EU regulations against anti-competitive data sharing.
“We see some platforms as gatekeepers, that is not what we want for our internal market,” Breton said.
Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s digital and antitrust commissioner, has said she is considering launching an inquiry into industries using new technologies.
Japan’s New Legislation
In Japan this past week, the Cabinet approved new legislation that will strengthen regulations on many of those marquee names in Big Tech. The legislation will be sent to Parliament and will require tech firms to increase disclosures and transparency on their business practices.
As noted in this space last week, the legislation mandates that Amazon, Google, Apple and others issue annual reports to the government (the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) that detail how terms and conditions, rates and fees, are struck.
In terms of timeline, as reported, passage is slated for the current parliamentary session and would take effect in March of next year.
Amid the other components of the bill: Big Tech companies have to notify vendors of changes in agreements in advance and must detail how search results are displayed.
Individual Company News
In terms of individual company news, and in the United States, Facebook new is being sued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for alleged tax evasion — to the tune of $9 billion.
In the complaint, as detailed by The Wall Street Journal, the IRS alleges that Facebook understated the value of intellectual property that was sold a decade ago to an Irish subsidiary — and that unit paid more than $14 billion in royalties to the tech giant between 2010 to 2016.
When it filed its tax returns, as reported by the Journal, Facebook put a $7 billion value on the intangible assets (the intellectual property). But Facebook has argued that subsequent estimates of that value are even lower, so it is entitled to a refund.
And in the latest development in the ongoing Wells Fargo saga, the bank agreed last week to pay a settlement of $3 billion for the scandal involving the creation of fake accounts.  That settlement amount is reportedly being finalized with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission.
As reported, the settlement gives the Justice Department the option to pursue future criminal charges in the case.

434,"February 23, 2020",DOJ Approached Outside Law Firms Over Big Tech Probes,"
The US Justice Department has sought outside legal help to bolster its antitrust investigations of large technology platforms, according to Bloomberg, in a sign that the government may be preparing a lawsuit against one or more of the companies.
The Department approached at least one law firm about working on the government’s behalf, said the people. That firm, Kellogg Hansen Todd Figel & Frederick, declined to take on the assignment because of a conflict, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because the investigation is confidential.
The agency has opened investigations into Alphabet’s Google and Facebook, following a July announcement of a broad probe into whether tech platforms are stifling competition. It wasn’t clear which case the Department was seeking help for, or whether it will ultimately go through with hiring an outside firm.
The move, however, may be a sign the Justice Department is preparing for litigation against the tech companies. Attorney General William Barr said in December that the probe was moving “very quickly” and that he wanted to complete it some time this year.

The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is staffing up as it works to finish its investigation into the competitive impact of tech giants.
 The antitrust panel has brought on two new staffers in recent months as it wades through documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google in the competition review.
Former IBM consultant Anna Lenhart, a Congressional Innovation Fellow, joined the staff this month as a technical expert, a person familiar with the hire told Axios. Lenhart, a Carnegie Mellon graduate, most recently focused on artificial intelligence and ethics for IBM.
Former Public Knowledge policy director Phillip Berenbroick joined the subcommittee as counsel in January.
Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline has said he expects the investigation to produce a bipartisan report outlining its findings by the end of the first quarter. He also intends to introduce legislation related to the report.
Cicilline has said he wants to hear from major tech company CEOs, something the White House has also encouraged, according to a recent report by The Hill.

436,"February 20, 2020",The Democratic Presidential Candidates and Antitrust,"
By  Jonathan Hatch & David Kleban, JD Supra
With the Democratic primary process in full swing, we thought it fitting to take a look at where the candidates stand with respect to antitrust issues.  As it turns out, this is a fairly active election cycle for antitrust, with most Democratic candidates invoking antitrust laws (and proposed laws) in connection with their visions for the future.  The increased focus on antitrust has not been lost on other observers.
Perhaps the candidate most explicitly focused on the nuts and bolts of antitrust-related legislation is Amy Klobuchar, who is responsible for introducing the Monopolization Deterrence Act (which would amend Section 2 of the Sherman Act to allow the DOJ and FTC to sue for civil penalties), the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act (which would revise merger requirements under the Clayton Act by, among other things, shifting the burden of proof to merging companies to show that consolidation will not harm competition), the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act (which would amend antitrust enforcement requirements regarding mergers by, among other things, requiring the FTC to study overlapping ownership or control by investors in certain markets), and the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act—all in 2019. 
The last of these bills would amend the FTC Act to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which a brand manufacturer provides a generic or biosimilar manufacturer with “anything of value, including an exclusive license,” unless the thing provided “is compensation solely for other goods or services” the generic or biosimilar manufacturer has promised to provide,” or if the procompetitive benefits of the agreement outweigh any anticompetitive effects. (Certain other safe harbors apply, including deals that allow for entry of a product prior to expiration of the patent and a payment for reasonable litigation expenses “not to exceed” $7.5 million.)  Pay-for-delay litigation is a subject we talk about on this blog with some regularity and a particular concern for Senator Klobuchar, who gave the subject air-time during one of the Democratic debates.
Pay-for-delay is a subject on which several of the other candidates seem to agree.  Senators Warren, Sanders, and Klobuchar (together with Senators Booker and Gillibrand, who have left the presidential race) were co-sponsors on the 2017 Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act, which, among numerous other provisions, included a prohibition on pay-for-delay deals largely similar to that found in the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act mentioned above.  Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg has released a plan that would “end” such deals as part of a broader effort to reduce drug prices.

437,"February 19, 2020",Europe Wants To Grown Its Own Tech Giants,"
The European Union outlined proposals to bolster its digital economy and keep it from being overly reliant on foreign companies, while cracking down on those companies.
Apple, based in California, and Samsung, from South Korea, make the most popular phones in Europe. Facebook owns the most widely used social networks, Google dominates online search and advertising, and Amazon controls e-commerce. European companies run their businesses on cloud infrastructure from Amazon and Microsoft. The region’s wireless networks are largely made with equipment from the Chinese giant Huawei, reported The New York Times.  
The European Union on Wednesday, February 19, outlined an attempt to restore what officials called “technological sovereignty,” seeking tougher regulation of the world’s biggest tech platforms, new rules for artificial intelligence, and more public spending for the European tech sector.
Officials said the effort is a “generational project,” and the ideas reflect a growing concern among European leaders that countries in the region are overly dependent on services provided by companies based elsewhere. With the global economy becoming ever more centered around technology, European countries would have a harder time creating jobs and generating tax revenue to fund government services.
“We want to find European solutions in the digital age,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union that is crafting the policy, said at a news conference in Brussels.

438,"February 19, 2020",EU Unveils Plans To Regulate AI & Big Tech,"


The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled its plans for the future of artificial intelligence in the bloc. The EU is eager to take advantage of the burgeoning technology sector, which has so far been largely dominated by China and the United States.
American tech companies will face new restrictions in the European Union on on the alleged use of data to drive out smaller rivals, as the bloc seeks to assert its “digital sovereignty” from the US and China.
The new strategy aims to stimulate and regulate the development of artificial intelligence in the EU with funding of €20 billion per year for the next decade.
“We want to encourage our businesses, our researchers, our innovators, the entrepreneurs, to develop AI and we want to encourage our citizens to feel confident to use it,” President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told a press conference.
The legislation, to be drafted by the end of 2020, is also likely to home in on what the EU has learned from antitrust cases against Alphabet’s Google and ongoing probes into Amazon.com. and Facebook how these platforms allegedly use data to quash smaller rivals. These technology giants—which some US politicians such as Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren want to regulate as public utilities—are in the firing line of the coming EU legislation.
Liability rules regarding the content shared on online platforms are also due to be spelled out in the Digital Services Act by the end of the year. EU Commissioner Thierry Breton said Monday that a pledge by Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg to accept a degree of liability for content posted was insufficient, because he didn’t address the issue of dominant platforms having responsibilities toward smaller players on the platform. 
The rules will also come with new restrictions for US and Chinese companies that develop machine-learning-enabled technologies, particularly when they handle sensitive data such as medical records or facial images.

439,"February 17, 2020",Calls To Break Up Big Tech Gain Traction In US Presidential Race,"
The race for the Democratic presidential nomination has fuelled trepidation in Silicon Valley, as arguments for breaking apart the world’s largest tech firms achieve traction among the many areas of candidates, reported the Financial Times. 
Both Bernie Sanders, who received the New Hampshire major, and his fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, have been known as for wanting a break-up of America’s largest expertise firms. Moderates equivalent to Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden are pushing for additionally aggressive measures to curtail the ability of firms equivalent to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Arguments which were once confined to leftwing fringes are being examined more closely by government officials as well. Last week the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces competition laws, announced it would review every takeover by a large technology company of a smaller start-up in the past decade to see whether they had displayed anti-competitive behavior. 
For decades, regulators had resisted taking action against companies on competition grounds unless consumers were being harmed through rising prices. But for the past few years, a small group of leftwing academics has argued that large technology companies are causing damage in other ways, such as by killing off smaller competitors and eroding data privacy. 
This group is close to one candidate in particular: Ms Warren. “Competition is dying,” the senator said in a speech that first laid out her ideas on tech antitrust in 2016. “Consolidation and concentration are on the rise in sector after sector. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.” 
Through her advocacy, their ideas are now gaining a wide hearing in the 2020 presidential race. “What Warren is channelling is a variation of antitrust that the progressive left has managed to resurrect over the past five years,” said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which is funded in part by large tech companies. 
Ms Warren’s 2016 speech, which has now become famous in legal and technology circles, was written after a series of informal policy seminars with Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute, and a handful of other like-minded academics and lawyers who have become her brains trust on tech policy. “This was the most important speech by a major public figure about the dangerous concentration in the United States since probably the 1930s,” said Mr Lynn. 
“There was no recognition of the problem, and then there was that speech that highlighted the problem in a way that people could not ignore it.”

Amazon’s top spokesman on Wednesday, February 12, accused lawmakers and and “elite newspapers” of creating the illusion that Amazon would be “taking over grocery in America” when it acquired Whole Foods.
“When we announced that we were going to acquire Whole Foods, you would have thought based on television commentary and commentary in both Washington, DC among government officials as well as in the elite newspapers that we were taking over grocery in America — that we were going to be the largest grocer in America — because we were in fact buying the grocery store that a lot of those folks shop at,” Jay Carney, Amazon’s head of public relations and policy, said in an interview on CNBC. “But as you know, Whole Foods is one of the smallest known grocery chains in America.”
Carney made the remarks after the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday announced an antitrust probe into acquisitions made by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google parent company Alphabet.
Carney said Wednesday that Amazon, including Whole Foods, accounts for about 3-4% of the grocery market.
“Many, many of the chains you know, the big names you know, are just significantly bigger than we are,” he said. “So the competition matter is hard to argue because I don’t see the argument that we are somehow anticompetitive in grocery at 3 or 4% of the market.”

There has been a long and extended empirical literature examining the impact of competition on innovation. I argue that as innovation is the way firms compete, this question does not make a lot of sense and it is not surprising the empirical literature has not found stable results. I argue we should be asking what affect does (digital) innovation have on the creation of new products and better processes – both of which are good for well-being. We should also be asking whether this form of innovation also accelerates the tendency toward larger firms and more concentrated markets – neither of which may be good for income equity and civil society.

I. INTRODUCTION
As topics for discussion, innovation and competition have long been intertwined. Will innovation produce the behemoths that choke competition and lead to the dominance of fewer and fewer firms? Does ruthless competition between near-identical firms smother the profits needed for risk taking? Will the shift from mechanical and electronic platforms towards digital ones exacerbate these trends?
In this article, I examine how the competition – innovation debate has progressed and suggest that the (voluminous) research which tests whether lack of competition holds back innovation is possibly asking the wrong question. I then look briefly at whether the recent new wave of digital innovation is creating larger firms and more concentrated markets.

The current academic and policy initiatives to address competition concerns arising from digital platforms rely on a model of competition for the market. That model is presented as a better account of market processes around these platforms than the traditional model of competition in the market. Yet competition for the market has not taken hold in enforcement despite having been around for more than 20 years. This contribution puts forward a model of competition on the market, where market definition is a competitive parameter and is therefore endogenous to the competitive process. Competition on the market is based on the disruptive innovation literature. If introduced in the analysis, competition on the market could reveal Type I error risks (over-protection of sustaining innovation in Microsoft, Intel and Google Search (Shopping) and of Type II (failure to block the Facebook/Whatsapp merger).

Observers contend that concentrated power in digital markets threatens free speech. At the root of this anxiety is that private companies have accrued unprecedented control over the flow of information, turning free speech into an emerging antitrust issue. Support for increasing antitrust enforcement in the marketplace of ideas has notably come from politicians, litigants, popular commentators, and even the Department of Justice. The obstacle is that courts have so far been hostile to antitrust lawsuits intended to promote free speech. This contribution explores whether antitrust should foster free speech given the emerging challenges of digital markets. It finds that the economic value of ideas and speech in the information age requires a reexamination of antitrust’s consumer welfare standard, though the enterprise should resist promoting political, social, and other forms of non-commercial expression.

444,"February 13, 2020",Trump’s Enforcer: Meet the Man Who Holds Hollywood and Silicon Valley’s Future in His Hands,"
By Eriq Gardner, The Hollywood Reporter
One day last spring, Makan Delrahim was checking in on the day’s news when a story about the Oscars caught his eye. Steven Spielberg was said to be pushing the film Academy to ban from eligibility any movie that premiered on a streaming service rather than in theaters. At the time, Netflix had just won three awards for Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, and the company was forced to defend its Oscars.
That seemed unfair to Delrahim, 50, who in addition to leading the U.S. Department of Justice’s powerful Antitrust Division also happens to be a former movie producer. He says nobody associated with the streaming giant pressured him; he simply felt compelled to do something, so he fired off a letter to Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and warned her that the discussed restriction could amount to a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits “collusive” agreements aimed at suppressing competition. Delrahim didn’t specify how Oscars eligibility would interfere with the marketplace for movies, although it was fairly clear that he saw Spielberg’s effort as part of a plot with greater significance.
“I wanted to ensure that a group of the establishment incumbents didn’t force changes to those rules to disadvantage potential new distribution models that would harm consumers or filmmakers,” says Delrahim, speaking in his office at DOJ headquarters in Washington, adding that he was satisfied with the Academy’s response. “Ultimately they kept the existing rules and did not change them to disadvantage Netflix and Amazon or other streaming services. I basically wanted to remind them that the antitrust laws could apply.”
As the entertainment industry races to scale itself up to compete with Big Tech, and as Apple, Google and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon spend increasingly large sums on premium content, Delrahim has become as potent a business gatekeeper in Washington as anyone not named Donald Trump. He’s refereeing mammoth mergers, including the $105 billion tie-up between AT&T and Time Warner, and Walt Disney Co.’s $71 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. He’s reevaluating licensing rules that have governed the movie and music businesses for nearly three-quarters of a century. He’s even taken an interest in the Writers Guild’s nasty fight with talent agencies. Perhaps more than anyone in the Trump administration, his perspective about what’s considered anticompetitive (or not) at a transformational moment will shape the future of the content industry.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated it had provisionally found that last April’s £90 million (US$116.6 million) takeover “substantially lessens competition nationally.” It stated shoppers could get fewer discounts, receive a lower quality of customer service, and enjoy less choice in stores and online.
JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sports retailer, hit back at the competition watchdog in a strongly worded statement, claiming the CMA’s findings were “fundamentally flawed.” It vowed to fight them.
It claimed the competition regulator failed to recognise the rapidly changing nature of the UK sports retail market, where a large number of retailers selling third-party brands compete, as well as other online players and the international brands selling directly to customers.
The JD Sports executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said, “The CMA’s provisional decision is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of our market to an alarming extent, given its six-month review.
“The competitive landscape described by the CMA is one which neither I, nor any experienced sector analyst, would recognise. Just take a walk down any major UK high street or search for Nike or Adidas trainers on Google and you can see for yourself how competitive this marketplace really is.”

The Trump administration is asking Congress for 71 percent more money for the Justice Department’s antitrust division in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 — an increase that would allow the agency to hire 87 additional staffers.The increase — the biggest increase sought for antitrust in recent memory, according to DOJ officials — is another indicator that the agency is serious about its pending investigations into tech giants like Google and Facebook.The DOJ’s fiscal 2021 budget proposal seeks $53 million in appropriations for the antitrust division, up from $31 million this fiscal year.
The antitrust division is also funded by fees collected from pre-merger notifications, which are split equally between DOJ and its sister agency, the Federal Trade Commission. The proposal estimates a total budget authority of $189 million between the appropriations and merger fees.
The proposed increase comes as the Justice Department is conducting an inquiry into technology markets that has so far focused on Google and Facebook. Attorney General William Barr has said the probe is “a top priority” for DOJ, which is also working with state attorneys general to examine conduct and prior acquisitions by the companies.
The antitrust division’s headcount has fallen since the beginning of the Trump administration as staff left the agency but weren’t replaced because of a hiring freeze.
Justice officials said the antitrust division’s authorized staffing would jump by 87 positions to 782 under the proposed budget. Current staffing is about 600, with almost 100 positions unfilled at the moment.

449,"February 6, 2020",Canada Antitrust Officials Probe Agriculture Companies,"
Cargill, Bayer AG, BASF, and other agriculture companies are under investigation by Canada’s antitrust authorities for allegedly trying to block a tech startup’s growth there.
Canada’s Competition Bureau is investigating the matter, according the Wall Street Journal, citing Canadian court documents filed last Thursday, January 30. Authorities are seeking e-mail and phone records from five agribusinesses, including Corteva Inc. and Univar Solutions, related to the California-based startup Farmers Business Network Inc. (FBN).
The investigation was prompted by a civil complaint FBN submitted a year ago to the agency alleging one of the agriculture companies stopped selling seeds and crop inputs to a Canadian business that FBN had recently acquired. FBN claims the company also urged farmers not to do business with the tech company, which is trying to shift North American farmers’ farm supply purchases online.
In exploring the claims, the Competition Bureau widened its lens to look at other agriculture companies, including Cargill, operating in the region.
FBN, founded in Silicon Valley by former Google executives and venture capitalists, is trying to build an online marketplace for farmers to buy seeds, pesticides, and other ag supplies, much like Amazon has done for consumers with everyday goods.

450,"February 5, 2020","Intel, Apple Are Using Antitrust Suit As Intimidation Claims Fortress","
SoftBank Group subsidiary Fortress Investment fired back at antitrust claims filed in San Francisco federal court by Apple and Intel, calling the lawsuit “an attempt to intimidate” Fortress affiliates out of enforcing their patent rights, reported Bloomberg Law.
“It is ironic that Apple and Intel, who have been accused for many years of violating the antitrust laws, charging supracompetitive prices, and using their patents to block competitors, have brought these claims,” Fortress stated in court papers filed Tuesday, February 4.
The antitrust suit accuses Fortress of anticompetitive stockpiling of patents in a bid to enforce them, and have asked the court to “remedy the harms that they had already suffered” from Fortress and unravel Fortress’s operations.
Intel contests the legality of Fortress’s massive patent aggregation business through a network of patent assertion entities (PAEs) in a bid to license them (usually in packages) to Intel and other high-tech companies. In particular, Intel claims that it had to license patents originally owned by NXP Semiconductors after the latter were acquired by Fortress. That lawsuit has since been withdrawn and replaced with the new lawsuit from Intel and Apple.

Britain’s competition regulator announced on Wednesday, February 5, it plans to investigate the planned merger of gambling companies Flutter Entertainment and The Stars Group, reported Reuters. 
The two firms announced plans for an all-share deal last October that would create the world’s largest online betting business by revenue.
Dublin-based Flutter owns the Paddy Power and Betfair brands, while Toronto-based The Stars Group owns Sky Betting and Gaming. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated it would consider whether the tie-up would result in “a substantial lessening of competition” in Britain. 
Analysts at Davy said the CMA review was expected and the timing was consistent with the timetable previously set by Flutter, suggesting the deal was on schedule to complete by the third quarter this year.

452,"February 5, 2020",The e-Commerce World after Coty – Competition Law Catch Up,"

By Marcin Trepka & Łucja Olszewska (DWF Poland)1
In recent years, as regards competition law, it is actually hard to find a more captivating topic than e-commerce. The internet has revolutionized shopping itself, making it easier and more accessible, but many would say competition law failed to keep up.
As Pierre Fabre and Coty led the way, commentators noticed that in the EU on-line sales restrictions are important as they generally work against the consumer, but they also work against cross border trade, and in turn the Single European Market. Internet bans normally exist to divide and protect local and national suppliers and distributors, thus leading to a restriction on the freedom of exchange of goods. Therefore, as confirmed in the recent Guess decision, modern distribution models that encourage cross-border trade cannot be limited unless the restrictions are proportional and based on legitimate reasons. Put another way, the internet sales channel should have a special status for which the freedom to use should be protected and upheld.
Let’s take a closer look at several post-Coty cases in order to summarize the status quo of competition law enforcement in the e-commerce sphere since that landmark ruling.
Bicycles – Not Dangerous enough to Justify On-line Sale Restrictions 
On July 1, 2019, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a decision concerning a bicycle distribution company, Bikeurope, which had prohibited its authorized retailers from selling its bicycles online between 2007 and 2014.
In the general terms and conditions of sale, Bikeurope inserted provisions setting out that any online sales of its bicycles must be followed by a delivery to “an authorized place of sale” – which meant in the distributor’s understanding that delivery must be made to the retailer’s store. Regardless of the above, the general terms also provided for explicit prohibition of any online sales.
However, the definite on-line sales prohibition was not of greatest importance for the FCA, as it indicated that the store delivery requirement has the effect of distorting the whole online shopping concept.
The FCA underlined that the Internet is a useful tool for consumers as they can compare different offers and choose the most suitable one. The essence of online shopping and its main advantage manifests itself in the fact that one can purchase physical goods with direct-to-home delivery, or with delivery to another chosen (by the consumer) location.
The justifications put forward by Bikeurope, that on-line products and prices’ presentation were allowed to enable “some research,” cannot be accepted as such “research” has no value, particularly when in order to buy a product, the consumer is forced to make an additional effort to visit a specified physical (location) store.
As the FCA examined whether the restrictions imposed by Bikeurope were of an infringing nature, it took into consideration the factors indicated by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in the Pierre Fabre and Coty cases. First of all, the FCA analyzed whether it is necessary to restrict on-line distribution in order to preserve product quality and ensure its proper use. Second, the FCA analyzed whether those objectives are not already satisfied by national laws governing admission to the re-sale trade or the sale conditions. Third, the FCA verified the proportionality of such restriction.
The FCA went even a bit further and analyzed the economic and legal context of the restrictions as well as the actual operating conditions and market structure.
From the perspective of the consumer, for whom the FCA observed a bicycle purchase is infrequent, the absence of online distributors restricted competition in the sector, and led to an increase in prices. It was also taken into consideration that, during the infringement time, the number of bicycles sold online in France was systematically growing due to the growth in demand and popularity of the sport.
The FCA concluded that the ban imposed by Bikeurope was not proportional to any security concerns, and store delivery is not required by any national or European regulation concerning the products in question. Users’ security could be ensured by a bicycle’s pre-shipment inspection and attachment of the necessary assembly tools. Bikeurope claimed it required individual client consulting alongside its sales due to its high-quality brand and advanced business model, which should justify on-line sales prohibition. Conversely the FCA reasoned that this could all be readily achieved in a less restrictive way, e.g. by offering personalized maintenance services or by operating an info-line.
A Long “Drive” before Finding the “Sweet Spot”
Another interesting e-commerce case was recently considered by the UK Court of Appeal following previous assessments from the UK’s Competition & Markets Authority (“CMA”) and Competition Appeals Tribunal (“CAT”). The renowned golf-club manufacturer – Ping fought to overturn a £1.45 million fine over an online-sales ban. Ping attempted to protect its corporate and strategic ethos based on selling individualized clubs that are custom-made to the individual customer rather than being “off the rack.”
Thus far Ping’s arguments have not been successful. It seems that recent UK Court of Appeal’s ruling on the case is a clear signal that blanket online bans by manufacturers on the sale of their products online are against the law.
Ping’s appeal aimed to show that its policy of allowing only authorized retailers to sell its clubs, and mainly in-store only, has a pro-competitive aim and market effects. Therefore, any anticompetitive impact is objectively justified. Ping claimed that that the CMA failed: (i) to take account the ban’s legitimate objective of encouraging custom fitting; (ii) factor in that the ban was part of a pro-competitive “selective distribution” system; and (iii) prove that the harm arising out of the policy was serious enough to conclude a “by-object” finding, which should instead be reserved for hardcore cartels and price-fixing offences.
The CMA and subsequently the CAT and the UK Court of Appeal noted that while the promotion of custom fitting was a legitimate goal, the ban not only hindered shoppers from buying clubs outside their local area and comparing prices, but also inherently restricted the retailers’ ability to make sales via an important sales channel. The CAT held that the ban was unnecessary and that when applying the correct legal standard, Ping’s policy revealed a “sufficient degree of harm to competition.”
While Ping argued that the Coty ruling  shows that a legitimate commercial aim can justify an Internet sales ban, to some extent, and that not all online-sales bans are “by-object” infringements, the CAT ruled that it is important to make a distinction as the Ping case wasn’t the same as that of Coty, whose restriction hadn’t placed any “significant limitation on retailers’ ability to sell to consumers over the Internet” and therefore didn’t cause sufficient harm to the competition.
After all, this boils down to determining whether the per se rule can be automatically applied to an Internet sales ban (i.e. is any on-line sales ban automatically illegal and anti-competitive) or could it be justified in theory by special circumstances, and therefore should the presence of a pro-competitive aim and effects form part of an objective assessment. From Ping’s point of view such balancing exercise must always be carried out before concluding a “by-object” finding.  After the recent ruling we do know that this argument was not exactly a “hole-in-one” shot for Ping.
Ban on the Advertisement Campaigns – Infringement by Object
Not only an online sales ban can be problematic.  In the recent Guess case decision (with a €40 million fine in the background), the European Commission questioned the selective distribution organization model, geo-blocking and trademark-use restrictions.
In its final e-commerce report of 2017, the Commission noted that as online sales were developing manufacturers started to make greater use of selective distribution systems, where the products can only be sold by pre-selected authorized sellers to preserve brand quality, as well as increased use of contractual restrictions to better control product distribution.
Guess operated a complex distribution network that covered different EEA countries and different levels of distribution including exclusive distributors, mono-brand retailers and multi-brand retailers. In its distribution agreements and sales terms, Guess inserted a number of restrictions. The agreements with their authorized distributors required each distributor to obtain Guess’ written approval before carrying out any advertising campaigns or other promotional activities but the company systematically rejected all such requests. Manufacture de facto prohibited any brand names or trademarks used as keywords in Google AdWords for online advertising.
The Commission regarded such behavior as a “by object” restriction, stating that firstly the manufacturer’s main purpose was to guarantee visibility on the Internet only of its own website and secondly, to prevent an increase in Google advertising costs which would be a natural consequence of distributors making use of these advertising means.
The commission also concluded that Guess restricted cross-border sales to end-users as each authorized distributor was only permitted to sell Guess products within its own allocated territory. It was particularly emphasized that the restrictions were aimed at both active and passive sales as neither advertising, nor sales were allowed, outside the allocated territory.
Shopping Platform’s Dual Role
When an entity has a dual role as a platform, i.e. it sells products on its website as a retailer; and (ii) it provides a marketplace where independent sellers can sell products directly to consumers, the entity cannot favor its own online store in relation to the sales activity conducted by other sellers. The two most highlighted cases in this regard are Amazon (currently under investigation of the European Commission and several other national competition authorities) as well as Google receiving a penalty of € 2.4 billion.
Other shopping platforms are also under the national competition authorities’ scrutiny, as for instance, the currently ongoing proceeding against Allegro in Poland.
Allegro is by far the most popular online shopping platform in Poland. Research conducted at the request of the Polish Competition Authority (“PCA”) shows that when buying a new item on a trading platform – 79 percent of consumers use Allegro. For some entrepreneurs, the option of selling on Allegro may be the only way to reach a wide range of customers.
PCA suspects that by using its significant market power, Allegro favored its own – Official Allegro Store.
First, in order to better position and display its own offers, the company was able to use information on the platform’s operation, including the relevancy algorithm, which was unavailable to other sellers. Secondly, some sales or promotional functions were only available to the Allegro Official Store, and other sellers were not able to use them. PCA highlighted as an example a search suggestion system. When the consumer entered the product name in the search engine, an automatic recommendation led to the Official Allegro Store. The platform owner also had the option to exclusively use the special promotional banners that increased the traffic of its own offers on the platform.
Consequently, the products of independent online stores may have been less visible on the platform compared to Allegro’s own offers and as the result may have been less frequently chosen by shoppers.
The problem is not – as the PCA emphasized – the sales algorithms or data collection itself: We only state that Allegro’s own store should operate under the same conditions as any other seller on the platform.
Conclusions
There is no doubt that the Coty and Pierre Fabre rulings and their aftermath shed some light on the competition law enforcement in the e-commerce sector. To sum up the current status quo we note the following:

Subjective convictions of the producer / distributor about the need to ensure customer safety (even those claimed to be in the best interest of customers) will not be enough to impose on-line restrictions. Local product safety laws are of great importance and should be verified before any restriction is put in place;
Blanket online-retail bans will, in most cases, attract competition authorities’ attention regardless of the outcome of the Ping case. The question would be still the same – whether such ban is ever really necessary or proportionate to restrict on-line distribution in order to preserve product quality and ensure its proper use;
Even partial on-line restrictions if they consist in limiting the possibility of running the advertising campaigns or other promotional activities when consequently forbidden by the distribution network organizer can be considered as “by object” infringement;
Favoring one’s own products by shopping platform operators is fraught with risk – a fair and non-discriminatory rules should be available to all platform users.

The US Justice Department has reached out to app developers as part of its investigation into Apple Inc AAPL.O, one of the four big tech companies being probed for alleged anti-competitive behavior, according to Reuters. 
The chief executive of developer Mobicip, Suren Ramasubbu, told Reuters he was interviewed in November by a US investigator who asked about the company’s interactions with Apple. The app, which has nearly a million users worldwide, allows parents to control what their children see on their iPhones.
Ramasubbu said the Mobicip app was temporarily removed from the iPhone app store last year for a failure to meet requirements imposed by Apple.
A source familiar with the Justice Department’s investigation said a handful of app developers had been contacted in what is the first indication of what officials are pursuing involving Apple since the investigation was revealed by Reuters in June.
US President Donald Trump has criticized Apple’s Silicon Valley neighbors for other reasons, calling for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google and accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.
US Attorney General William Barr said in December that he hoped to have the Justice Department investigations into the big tech platforms – Facebook, Alphabet’s GOOGL.O Google, Amazon.com and Apple, wrapped up this year.

454,"February 4, 2020",Tech Companies In German Crosshairs Over Competition Fears,"


Germany’s government has proposed a clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by digital platforms, putting Berlin in the vanguard of European efforts to regulate companies including Google and Amazon, reported The Financial Times.  
The draft “digital law” will strengthen the intervention powers of Germany’s competition watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office. Peter Altmaier, the economy minister, said the measures would “toughen control of abusive practices for big market-dominating digital companies”. 
“There is no other jurisdiction that has proposed such a far-reaching tool for taming the digital giants,” said Rupprecht Podszun, head of the Institute for Competition Law at the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf. 
Germany’s bill is part of a broader “techlash” as governments consider ways to limit the economic and social power of the tech giants and public disquiet grows about the potential threats they pose to competition, privacy and civil liberties.
The bill would make it easier for the cartel office to establish whether companies dominate a particular market. The agency would then be able to prohibit such platforms from “self-preferencing”, that is, giving preferential treatment to their own products or services to the detriment of those provided by rivals.

455,"February 3, 2020",UK Watchdog Pushes For Tighter Controls On US Big Tech,"


The UK’s competition watchdog will push for tougher powers to regulate companies such as Google and Facebook following the UK’s official departure from the EU, and will pursue antitrust investigations against tech giants independently of the bloc.
“The upside [Brexit] is that you take back control, genuinely, of the decisions,” Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) head Andrea Coscelli told the Financial Times.
The comments by the CMA head came as the UK seeks a more active role in scrutinizing large mergers and tackling anti-competitive behaviour by US tech giants.
The regulator wants to take on the power to impose fines on companies engaging in behaviour that is harmful to consumers, without going through the courts as it is currently required to do. The watchdog is also petitioning to stop alleged anti-competitive conduct while probes are ongoing.
The CMA will take on a tough new workload after Brexit, shouldering responsibility for larger and more complex merger, cartel and competition enforcement cases that were previously the domain of the European Commission.  
It will also have to decide whether to follow regulators elsewhere when bringing cases and setting rules or to depart from the status quo.
“These are well-resourced, highly competent competition authorities in sizeable markets. They work quite significantly in parallel with the US agencies and the European Commission and others,” he said. The CMA’s tougher stance,  particularly against digital platforms,  comes in spite of criticism that too much regulation could stifle innovation and policymakers’ hopes of attracting more tech investment in the wake of Brexit.

House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline is looking toward new regulations to reform the digital marketplace and empower antitrust enforcers, the Rhode Island Democrat told CNBC in an interview.
Unlike the investigations into Big Tech by state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, the House cannot impose enforcement actions on the companies as a result of the probe. But it can use its findings to inform new legislation.
Cicilline looking to figuring out a way to measure the outcome of mergers versus what companies promised, and unwind them if there’s a discrepancy.
“If a merger or an acquisition is approved based on a certain set of projected outcomes in terms of impact on the market, but it turns out to be quite different, is there a mechanism to go back and, whether it’s unwind it or at least learn from that transaction so that it will inform the next decision about another acquisition or merger?” he said.
The Rhode Island Democrat and House Antitrust Subcommittee chairman hopes to complete a report on the panel’s investigation into Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple by early April, he told CNBC in an interview in his DC office Wednesday, January 29.
The investigation won’t result in an enforcement action like the investigations by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general could. But Cicilline hopes it will result in laws and regulatory proposals that target behaviors in the broader digital marketplace that he believes hinder competition and prevent start-up growth.
“As I think about this marketplace, it’s pretty clear to me that it’s not functioning properly, that there’s not robust competition there,” Cicilline said.

The Open Markets Institute (OMI) announced the creation of a new academic advisory board to provide expertise for the DC think tank’s work in public policy. Among the 12 new board members is Professor Maurice Stucke, reported the UT Daily Beacon. 
Stucke is the Douglas A. Blaze Distinguished Professor of Law at UT, where he teaches a variety of courses surrounding economics and law. He is also the co-author of several books, including “Big Data and Competition Policy” and the upcoming “Competition Overdose: How Free Market Mythology Transformed Us from Citizen Kings to Market Servants.”
Stucke recounted how he came to meet Barry Lynn, the executive director of OMI, at a conference hosted by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI).
“The AAI was unique because it felt like it was trying to preserve robust antitrust enforcement in this wave of retrenchment,” Stucke said. “Barry comes into this audience and says, ‘You know, you’re the culprits. You’re allowing antitrust to die,’ and everyone’s like, ‘no, no we’re the defenders!’ I then met Barry at that conference, and then we continued talking through that.”
OMI was formerly a program of the influential think tank New America until Lynn — then a senior fellow with the group — issued a statement praising the EU for levying an unprecedented US$2.7 billion fine against Google in 2017.

458,"January 30, 2020",EU Wants To Create Single Market Of Data To Offset Big US Tech Companies,"
The European Union (EU) wants to create a single market of data that will challenge the dominance of private companies like Amazon and Google, according to Reuters Wednesday, January 29.
According to a European Commission proposal seen by Reuters, the plan could be tweaked ahead of its eventual debut. Still, it would primarily involve reining in the aforementioned big tech giants and break up their wide-reaching hold on data.
It would also allow the EU to better compete with China.
The proposal states that the fact that a small number of companies hold so much of the world’s data is a detriment to smaller businesses looking to grow in the same fields, said published reports. Because China and the US are introducing innovations in data all the time, the EU sees its proposal as an urgent one.
The EU wants to capitalize on the trove of industrial and professional data in Europe and look at technological innovation, saying, “the winners of today will not necessarily be the winners of tomorrow,” Reuters reported.
By enacting new rules on cross-border use and data interoperability, the EU wants to establish a central bank of data all its own. There will be other rules on things like geospatial, the environment, meteorology, statistics, and some data that companies can use for free across a proposed network.
The EU also wants new standards for a wide array of manufacturing, climate change, auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy needs.
The rules come alongside another recent EU initiative to establish regulations for artificial intelligence (AI). The EU wants to make sure that the quickly-developing technology can be managed, particularly in high-risk scenarios like healthcare and transport. The rules would aim at achieving a modicum of cohesion in the field, despite the protests of some claiming they could hinder AI development.

459,"January 29, 2020",Innovation and Competition in Financial Markets,"
By Ania Thiemann, OECD on the Level
The substantial growth of BigTech firms, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, in terms of customer base, international presence, and use of customer data, has drawn the attention of practitioners and policy makers to the potential for such firms to leverage their competitive advantages to compete in segments of financial services. 
BigTech is a particular case of FinTech, which is broadly speaking the use of technology and innovation to deliver financial services outside of the traditional bank branches. The FinTech revolution is already substantially changing the delivery of services, the nature of intermediation and competition in the market.[1] The ubiquitous use of mobile devices has expanded the availability of financial services by allowing for mobile payments (wallet), money transfers (remittances) and online shopping. The integration is particularly advanced in Asia where payment apps are currently serving more than one billion users, providing e-commerce, chat, goods deliveries, food ordering and ride-hailing…

“New rules and regulation for the internet” leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and Facebook did not immediately respond when asked by Business Insider what exactly the tech billionaire will be discussing with lawmakers, but the company faces a slew of difficulties. 
The news of Zuckerberg’s trip comes just one week after the EU’s tech regulator Margrethe Vestager said the EU could introduce laws taxing the revenues big tech companies make in European countries, similar to radical tax plans proposed in countries including France and the UK.
Facebook along with Google and Twitter has also been pushing back against moves to make tech companies liable for illegal content hosted on their platforms. The EU said in a statement last year it would publish its assessment on the matter in early 2020. 
The social network giant is also facing two antitrust probes from the EU. The first is into Facebook’s proposed plans to launch its own cryptocurrency called Libra, and the second is into how it collects and monetises user data.

The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has started investigating online mall operator Rakuten’s plan to make marketplace merchants shoulder the costs of its proposed free shipping service, reported The Japan Times.
The source said the antitrust watchdog has begun hearing from Rakuten merchants on suspicion the e-commerce giant’s plan could violate the antimonopoly law.
Around 450 merchants presented a petition to the JFTC last week, claiming Rakuten is abusing its dominant position by forcing them to shoulder the costs of free shipping for all orders exceeding ¥3,980 (US$36.47) starting March 18.
Rakuten President Hiroshi Mikitani said Wednesday, January 29, the company will go ahead with the plan. “I’ll make (the new system) work at any cost as we cannot grow without it,” Mikitani said before Rakuten tenants at an event.
At present, the roughly 49,500 merchants on Rakuten’s online shopping mall set shipping fees for items independently, with some providing free shipping.
The JFTC has been stepping up scrutiny of Rakuten and other tech giants, including Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook, to determine whether they are abusing their dominant market positions against smaller online retailers that depend on their platforms.

462,"January 28, 2020",Dominance Assessment in Two-Sided Platforms: Highlights from the ICN’s Webinar,"
By Valeria Losco (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer)1
On October 22, the ICN Unilateral Conduct Working Group hosted the first in a series of webinars, “Dominance Assessment in Two-Sided Platforms.” The program, moderated by the Competition Commission South Africa’s Chief Economist James Hodge, featured prominent antitrust experts that shared their experience with (i) market definition; (ii) dominance assessment; (iii) economic elements; and (iv) general lessons learned.
Assessment of competition in two- or multi-sided platforms (“TSPs”) is an important topic that has been at the center of the international debate about the proper role of digital platforms in our society. Are the tools traditionally used to define markets, to assess market power and exclusionary conduct sufficient to protect competition in two-sided markets? Silvia Fagá de Almeida, Economist and Director of LCA, and Brazilian NGA, presented challenges of defining markets in TSPs, such as direct and indirect network effects, low marginal costs of the incumbent, and the presence of non-monetary prices. According to Almeida, Brazil’s CADE is still looking for a clear approach on how to analyze two-sided platforms.
Denis Gavrilov, Counsel at Egorov Puginsky Afanasiev & Partners and Russian NGA, focused on why the classic market share calculation based on volume of sales and revenue cannot be applied to digital platforms given that they are generally free of charge. Yandex v. Google, decided by the local antitrust agency, FAS, in 2015 was the first proceeding where Russia’s FAS defined the market for digital platforms and analyzed the potential anticompetitive effects on TSPs.
Andrea Amelio, Policy Officer at EC’s DG Comp, identified seven elements for the economic assessment of dominance in double sided platforms: (i) economies of scale; (ii) economies of scope; (iii) network externalities; (iv) behavioral biases on the consumer side; (v) data advantages of the incumbent; (vi) importance of raising capital; and (vii) brands. He also illustrated the learnings from two landmark decisions of the European Court of Justice, Groupement des Carte Bancaires and Mastercard that have shed light on the application of Article 101 TFEU to the analysis of multi-sided platforms.
Finally, Donald Baker, founder of Baker & Miller and U.S. NGA, provided interesting considerations on lessons and errors from the U.S. antitrust experience. Historically in the U.S., TSPs can be classified into two categories. The first are networks organized by industry users in order for their members to be able to interconnect, such as credit card systems and stock exchanges, and the second are entrepreneurial ventures where the platform owner creates products that sells on both sides (e.g. Google and Facebook). Different types of TSPs generate difference competition problems for enforcers. According to Baker, user-owned TSPs have generated exclusionary abuses of dominance, as the owners sought to penalize disfavored rivals, and impose rules unreasonably restricting TSP users. On the other hand, single-firm TSPs can generate exploitative abuse problems when they have developed substantial market power. Baker stressed that remedies in this area are generally very complex as there is no one-size-fits all remedy for TSP antitrust violations.

With probes of Alphabet’s Google and other major platforms underway, the US Justice Department’s Antitrust Division is hiring both to bulk up for the big tech probes and to replace people who left, according to Reuters. 
The Department is scheduled to post an advertisement for positions, for additional attorneys, paralegals with an interest in tech, and others to work in San Francisco to focus on the tech industry, one of the sources said. 
A job posting for five people for two-year Washington positions that dates from November specifies that the attorneys hired will work on a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. 
Big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple face a slew of antitrust probes by the federal government, state attorneys general, and Congress. 
The number of people hired will depend on the caliber of the applicants, one of the sources said. “We have capacity to take on a good number of folks,” the source said. 
The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division assesses mergers to ensure they are legal, a job it shares with the Federal Trade Commission. It also investigates companies accused of price-fixing.

464,"January 27, 2020",Big Tech Gets Put on Guard by Antitrust Police,"
By Alex Webb, Bloomberg
When the world’s competition police reflect on big tech’s dealmaking over the past 15 years, you could forgive them for wondering what might have been. If Facebook Inc. hadn’t acquired WhatsApp or Instagram, or if Google hadn’t bought YouTube or DoubleClick, would there be stronger competition for the two Silicon Valley firms?
It certainly seems that regulators, particularly in the U.K., are eager to avoid repeat scenarios where companies grab outsize control of an emerging market before it’s clear exactly how important or big that market may be. That’s why a 6.1 billion-pound ($8 billion) food delivery takeover may have broader implications for tech giants’ dealmaking-to-come.
Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing the Dutch firm Takeaway.com NV’s planned acquisition of Just Eat Plc, the U.K.’s online marketplace for restaurant delivery. It’s a remarkable step, given that Takeaway.com no longer has a British business, and so the two firms don’t currently compete, at least not in the U.K. The regulator, the CMA, is instead pondering hypotheticals. It’s deliberating whether, without a deal, Takeaway.com might still otherwise enter the market and add a healthy dose of competition.
The move underscores a recent approach that could make it more difficult for tech giants to make acquisitions, even small ones. (Together, they’ve bought more than 250 companies in the last six years.) Companies might not obviously compete with the firm acquiring them, but the U.K. watchdog is increasingly taking into account the possibility they could become a competitor at some later stage. It seems to have listened to the findings of the government-commissioned review into digital competition last year by Jason Furman, previously economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama, which recommended that the CMA should take “more frequent and firmer action to challenge mergers that could be detrimental to consumer welfare through reducing future levels of innovation and competition.”

465,"January 27, 2020",New EU Policy Pushes For Data Sharing,"
The EU is looking to adopt new antitrust rules that will aim to give European companies more leeway in the market. The new rules, described by Reuters as protectionist, will be unveiled in March.
Documents obtained by Reuters show that the EU wants to adopt a strategy of utilizing more aggressive trade defense instruments against companies thought to be unfairly benefiting from foreign subsidies. While the mission was not to encourage uncompetitive industries or to encourage protectionist ideas, the documents state that the EU can’t afford to abet companies that work against fair competition.
Under the new rules, the Commission will evaluate and analyze new competition rules to make sure they all work toward building a strong European industry and a place for the EU in the world.
There will also be a reckoning with how to approach new technologies, with the documents showing a new framework for how blockchain and artificial intelligence will be dealt with in the future, and to steer companies toward using those things in the future.
The documents signal a promotion of more “Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI),” which will build on things like the eight-billion Euro battery project involving seven EU countries and 17 European companies from 2019. More such projects will involve industries like clean hydrogen technologies, microelectronics and low-carbon industries.
The EU will warn foreign governments more stringently against blockading their companies off and restricting access to their markets, documents say, and the EU will use new or existing tools and enforcing customs controls.
The documents say the EU will “mobilize all relevant tools including rule-making, standards, international financial instruments, trade agreements, public procurement and intellectual property rights to leverage its strengths and advantages.”
As the world continues to become more connected and Big Tech companies continue to evolve, regulation will have to happen in terms of competition. Last year, the EU turned a critical eye toward Apple Pay for its possible anti-competitive practices.
The EU looked into Google’s use of data as well, with an eye towards finding how it mined data.

466,"January 23, 2020",Don’t Break Up Big Tech,"
By Zachary Karabell, Wired
In the shadow of impeachment, the push to break up Big Tech continues to build. Last week, the House of Representatives held a hearing that saw the industry accused of bullying and oligopolistic practices. “They have come to use the scope of their platforms and their overwhelming dominance in certain markets to unfairly disadvantage competitors and squelch potential competition,” said the CEO of wireless speaker company Sonos, which is suing Google for patent infringement.
The same sentiment has fueled a movement that now comprises investigations by multiple federal agencies and most state attorneys general. It has also been embraced by leading Democratic candidates for president. Last May, Joe Biden called antitrust enforcement against Big Tech “something we should take a really hard look at.” The progressive wing is more emphatic: In a December interview with The New York Times, Bernie Sanders said of the big technology companies, “I think we should be breaking them up.” Elizabeth Warren has been arguing since last spring that the concentration of power in Big Tech has “bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.”
The escalating animus toward Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google—fueled by the conviction that these megacompanies imperil not just consumers and competition but privacy and democratic discourse—is one of the few areas of American life that can be considered truly bipartisan. It enjoys polling support not just among a majority of Democrats but in similar proportions of both Republicans and independents.

467,"January 22, 2020",US/EU: Big Tech & regulators in 2020,"
2020 will likely see a race between big tech companies – particularly Google, Facebook, and Amazon – and the regulators that are scrutinizing them. 
Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner, has new powers allowing her to bring together the issues of privacy, monopoly and security. She has called for the burden of proof in antitrust cases to be put on the larger companies (small ones often go out of business fighting the titans, who have deep pockets and big legal staffs).
Ms Vestager has floated the idea of using obscure rules that could  force companies to “cease and desist” from activities considered  problematic while waiting for the outcome of antitrust cases. These  include competing in allegedly unfair ways on their platforms against  their own customers, or refusing to allow audit of algorithmic bias. 
Ms Vestager has advanced the idea that Big Tech should have to show how it helps consumers, rather than merely that it does not harm them. She wants to connect the dots between how companies use data — and whether they might layer from different sources (search, handsets, apps, etc) in ways that are anti-competitive. A company like Facebook, for example, may garner unfair advantages by combining data from various apps that it has acquired. 
The Federal Trade Commission is considering an injunction against Facebook on the sharing of data between Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. This could force not only new disclosures on data value and how much it is worth to the company (something that states like California are pushing for) but also more algorithmic transparency about how data are used. 
We shall see more scrutiny of whether Amazon, which dominates ecommerce outside China, has an unfair advantage against its own suppliers — since it both owns the network and also sells its own products on it, thus competing against them. History records that 19th century US railway companies, which owned networks and conducted commerce on them, were broken up as monopolies.

468,"January 22, 2020",France: Big Tech tax on hold as US threatens tariffs,"
France will postpone payment requirements on its newly levied digital services tax aimed at large tech companies like Facebook and Google due to a dispute with the US over the issue, Reuters reported.
The payments were due in April, and Washington took issue with the tax, which it claimed is unfair and discriminatory toward the US. 
US officials threatened to tack on tariffs to some French goods over the tax.
“What we’re proposing is to give ourselves time and to show our goodwill, to postpone the remaining payments to December,” a French source told the news organization.
France will take time to allow for larger negotiations to take place at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and to rewrite international tax laws.
In other France news, the holiday shopping season in France wasn’t as lucrative as it might have been. Transport workers in Paris were in the midst of a strike and made it hard for business owners to operate over the holidays. It’s the continuing backlash against pension reform in the country, which is being advanced by President Emmanuel Macron.
The issue has been trudging along since last fall.
Clothing store owner Emile Sebbag said he doesn’t know how he is going to make ends meet. Sebbag said the beginning of the winter sales season on January 8 likely wouldn’t make up for lost revenue.
Sebbag also said the holiday shopping season was so poorly attended that he only made about half of what he expected to make during the season. Business, he said, has been “hell since December.”
One of Sebbag’s two stores relies heavily on shoppers who are commuting, as it is located in the basement of Paris’ Les Halles shopping center, near a local train and metro terminal. The strikes make it increasingly difficult for people to get around the city.

469,"January 21, 2020",EU: Antitrust & technology for good’ headline World Economic Forum in Davos,"
The technology sector is set to maintain its dominance at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this year, reported The Financial Times. 
Technology is still where much of the action is in Davos, and the tech companies will still be occupying the best venues on the promenade, a good indicator of who dominates. 
The large public companies will divide their time between acknowledging controversies over a range of issues, from privacy infringements to antitrust violations, and participating in the WEF’s “Tech for Good” content, say analysts, (with delegates expecting to hear much about how fintech can help the unbanked and what cloud computing is doing for small business, along with individual corporate announcements such as Microsoft’s 30-year plan to become carbon negative).
They will also face pressure from regulators such as Rohit Chopra, US Federal Trade Commissioner, who will headline a session covering antitrust issues on Wednesday, January 22, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who is in Davos and talking about the need to curb the power of Silicon Valley giants such as Google and Facebook. 
But the WEF has also invited an unusually large number of the biggest private technology companies, some of them business-to-business groups rather than consumer brands. This reflects a turning point in the technology sector, where money has become more concentrated in private hands.
“You can think of it in terms of ‘before SoftBank’ and ‘after SoftBank’,” said Christian Lanng, chief executive and chairman of Tradeshift, a Silicon Valley-based supply chain platform. Mr Lanng was referring to the Japanese conglomerate that suffered billions of dollars in writedowns after bidding up valuations of companies such as Uber and WeWork. 
“There’s going to be a lot more focus on value over growth and seeing who is actually profitable,” said Mr Lanng. “I think you’ll see more suits and ties on the promenade and fewer hoodies.”

470,"January 21, 2020",Global: Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for global corporate tax reform,"
 Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for global corporate tax reform, adding that he is optimistic that the reform would be fair.
 “It’s very complex to know how to tax a multinational,” Cook said during an awards ceremony in Dublin, held to mark 40 years of Apple in Ireland, according to Reuters.


 “I think logically everybody knows it needs to be overhauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system,” he added.


Big technology companies, such as Apple and Google, are currently facing increased scrutiny in various countries over their tax practices. These firms are accused of using various accounting tricks, for example, booking profit in low-tax countries, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, to dodge their liabilities.
The trend has also triggered the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to advocate the need to pursue a tax reform that will force multinational companies to pay tax in countries where they serve customers, regardless of where their income is eventually funnelled.
In October, the OECD came up with a proposal that gives individual governments more power to target multinational firms earn money in their country. The plan was announced after more than 130 countries agreed on the need for global tax reform. The OECD is expected to provide a more detailed plan later this month.
France is also vocal on corporate tax issue, and has proposed a digital services tax under which a select group of 30 firms, including Amazon, Google and Facebook, would face a three per cent levy on their sales in France.
Ireland, which became Apple’s first European operation in 1980, is now the second home for the US company.
The Irish government and Apple are currently appealing a 2016 ruling from the European Commission, which found that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid from Ireland, and therefore the company must repay €13bn in back taxes to the Irish government.
The declaration was made by Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, following an investigation, which started in June 2014.
Vestager said that that Apple had attributed almost all profits made in the European Union to a head office based in Ireland, which only existed on paper and which could, therefore, not have generated such profits.
Apple said earlier that it was confident that the ruling would be overturned by the European courts.
During the Dublin event, Tim Cook also stressed on the need for more regulation in privacy, highlighting that “the companies will not self-police in this area.”

472,"January 21, 2020","How to lose a monopoly: Microsoft, IBM and antitrust","
By Benedict Evans
When Steve Wozniak created the original Apple I in 1975, IBM dominated the computing industry. It was nicknamed ‘Big Blue’, it was so far ahead of its competitors that people talked about ‘IBM and the seven dwarves’, and it had just come through yet another anti-trust case. IBM’s dominance, of course, was based on the mainframe, which was the central paradigm of the computing industry, and it had sealed its dominance just a decade earlier with the launch of the 360 system. However, over the next decade it became obvious that the flood of PCs that followed the Apple 1 were going to overtake the mainframe. All of the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved to the PC. Indeed, PCs created the very idea that software could be a separate industry, and not just something that was bundled with your hardware. Microsoft, not IBM, dominated the PC ecosystem, and so Microsoft became the centre of the tech industry – it became the new sun in the solar system. 
The funny thing is, though, that mainframes didn’t go away. IBM went through a near-death experience in the 1990s, but mainframes carried on being used for mainframe things and IBM remained a big tech company. In fact, IBM’s mainframe installed base (measured in MIPS) has grown to be over ten times larger since 2000. Most people working in Silicon Valley today weren’t even born when mainframes were the centre of the tech industry, but they’re still there, inside the same big companies, doing the same big company things. (This isn’t just about IBM either – the UK’s sales tax system runs on DEC’s VAX. Old tech has a long half-life). Mainframes carried on being a good business a long time after IBM stopped being ‘Big Blue’.  
Much the same thing then happened to Microsoft. 20 years after the Apple 1, Microsoft launched Windows 95, which sealed its dominance of the PC industry, but Netscape had launched a year earlier, and Netscape and the web ended Microsoft’s dominance just as the PC had ended IBM’s dominance – the focus of innovation, investment and company creation moved elsewhere. Instead of creating software and companies around Windows APIs, the industry moved to creating software and companies around the internet and, especially, around the web. Microsoft never had dominance in the web, though it tried, just as IBM never had dominance in PCs, though it tried. And so in the 1970s, people worried about what IBM might do, and in the 1990s people worried about with Microsoft might do, but today, very few people in tech worry about what Microsoft might do – they worry about Google or Apple or Facebook or Amazon. Microsoft (or even IBM) might be a competitor, but they no longer have that dominance. Indeed, if you talk to senior Microsoft execs about this, they will say that for 20 years everything in tech was a PC accessory, but now the PC is just a smartphone accessory.

473,"January 20, 2020",UK: Regulators’ data violations fines top $126.5M,"


Regulators in the UK have levied €114 million ($126 million) in fines for data violations since instituting new stronger privacy mandates in mid-2018, The Financial Times reportedon Sunday (Jan. 19).
Law firm DLA Piper distributed a report indicating the disparity in fines among countries. France hit Google with a €50 million fine, the largest single violation against one firm. Conversely, the Netherlands, Britain and Germany had the most notifications regarding data breaches.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is intended to protect personal information and imposes steep fines if data is exposed or provided without user consent.
The regulation is enforced by data protection divisions throughout the 28-member European Union. Ireland has the biggest responsibility as the head regulator for Silicon Valley big tech like Facebook.
Penalties, for now, are small compared to the billions levied in EU antitrust violations. That is expected to change as sanctions are probed and legal precedents set.
DLA Piper partner Ross McKean said that in principle, fines of 2 percent or even 4 percent of global annual sales can be levied. Bigger penalties will have to hold up in court, however.
“It’s going to take time,  the regulators are going to be wary about going to 4 percent because they are going to get appealed,” McKean told Reuters. “And you lose credibility as a regulator if you’re blown up on appeal.”
To date, the biggest violation threat was against British Airways owner IAG due to a €183 million ($239 million) data breach affecting half a million people. 
“The total amount of fines of 114 million euros imposed to date is relatively low compared to the potential maximum fines that can be imposed under GDPR, indicating that we are still in the early days of enforcement,” McKean told Bloomberg in a statement. 
“We expect to see momentum build with more multi-million euro fines being imposed over the coming year as regulators ramp up their enforcement activity,” he added.

474,"January 19, 2020", US: Tile testifies against Apple at Congressional antitrust hearing>,"
Among the companies like Sonos and PopSockets that attended an antitrust-focused congressional hearing on Friday, January 17, were representatives of Tile. It’s the company that makes Bluetooth trackers that can be attached to your personal possessions to help you keep track of them — and, in line with the hearing that took a broad look at allegations of antitrust from big tech companies like Google and Amazon (and whether they’re abusing their size to stifle competitors), Tile actually directed lots of its fire at Apple.
Apple, has been cracking down on third-party apps and developers that track customers, especially going after those that track customers in the background and without their knowledge, with the iPhone maker building even more of those protections into iOS 13. That, though, is Tile’s beef with the company, claiming that Apple is purposely hurting its business and makes it too hard for iPhone users to adjust their settings
Tile attorney Kirsten Daru said she thought Congress should step in “to level the playing field” because of Apple creating a “confusing and frustrating experience” for Tile’s users.
Tile’s problem Friday wasn’t even with Apple’s forthcoming “Apple Tags,” which will be Tile-like trackers that you can attach to items like keys to keep track of them. Tile’s complaint is with Apple’s “Find My” feature that helps you find Apple gadgets you might have lost like iPhones and Macs. It’s enabled on iPhones by default, in contrast with the need for Tile users to grant permissions for location — which the user will also be asked to reauthorize repeatedly over time.
Along the lines of Tile wanting Apple to simplify what it claims is a too-complicated process right now, Apple shared a statement as part of the congressional hearing suggesting that a kind of fix to this is coming soon. Per the statement shared by a CNBC reporter, Apple noted that:
“When setting up a new device, users can choose to turn on Location Services to help find a lost or misplaced device with ‌Find My‌ ‌iPhone‌, an app that users have come to rely on since 2010. Customers have control over their location data, including the location of their device. If a user doesn’t want to enable these features, there’s a clear, easy to understand setting where they can choose exactly which location services they want enabled or disabled.
“…We’re currently working with developers interested in enabling the ‘Always Allow’ functionality to enable that feature at the time of setup in a future software update.”

The Justice Department’s antitrust division is preparing to tackle competition issues in several important markets, including alleged price-fixing in the generic-drug industry, rules for music licensing and purported employer collusion that limits options for sought-after workers.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s top antitrust official, said the department would act on those issues in the next several months. He said it was too soon to predict the outcome of his division’s highest-profile endeavor: an investigation of whether dominant tech firms are stifling competition.
“We’re well into the fairway of gathering data and evidence” on the tech probe, Mr. Delrahim said.
The department’s investigation of Alphabet’s Google includes a collaboration with state attorneys general, and the Justice Department is staying in touch with the Federal Trade Commission as both agencies probe Facebook Inc., he said. Separately, the department is considering whether Google should be allowed to acquire Fitbit Inc., the wearable fitness-product company.
Mr. Delrahim also said he was closely tracking how the National Collegiate Athletic Association was handling the issue of payment for college athletes, expressing concerns with the group’s restrictions on benefits and compensation.

477,"January 15, 2020",Why India Is Greeting the World’s Richest Person With Protests—and an Antitrust Case,"
By Ravi Agrawal & Kathryn Salam, Foreign Policy
Welcome to Foreign Policy’s weekly South Asia Brief. The highlights this week: India hits Amazon and Walmart with an antitrust case, a Pakistani high court overturns an ex-leader’s death sentence, and why Bangladesh arrested a top Sufi singer.
The World’s Richest Person Goes to India
When Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos decided to visit India this week, he may have imagined the country and its struggling economy would welcome him with open arms. It seems the opposite will happen. On Monday, India’s antitrust regulator ordered a formal probe of allegations that Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart were promoting some brands over others—practices that would violate Indian laws requiring foreign-owned e-commerce businesses to be neutral marketplaces.
It’s not just legal trouble that awaits the world’s richest man in India. On Wednesday, a trade union representing 70 million brick and mortar retailers has planned protests in 300 cities. “Bezos and Amazon have already destroyed many small businesses and are now trying to build a false narrative of empowering small retailers,” Praveen Khandelwal, the leader of the Confederation of All India Traders, told Bloomberg.
Economic dilemma. New Delhi needs all the foreign investment it can get: New projections show that India’s economy will grow by just 5 percent this year. Given the immense potential market in India, major players such as Amazon and Walmart have long jostled for influence in the e-commerce space. But the small merchants whose trade lobby is organizing Wednesday’s protests control 90 percent of India’s retail, and they broadly support protectionist measures.
There is also often widespread opposition to privatization in India. Last week, banks and businesses closed as millions of workers protested against proposed government divestment from creaking enterprises such as Air India, Bharat Petroleum, and the Shipping Corporation of India. The workers fear the job cuts that would inevitably follow private ownership.
Local challenge. When India introduced new laws in 2018 barring foreign-owned companies from selling their own inventory—forcing companies such as Amazon to operate more like eBay and sell only third-party goods—it opened the door for local companies to exploit the e-commerce market. Reliance, the country’s biggest company by market capitalization, is jumping into the fray with Jiomart. If the platform succeeds, it could link up the millions of mom and pop stores around India, creating better supply chains. But it would be yet another sign to foreign companies that New Delhi can change its laws at any time to favor its own.
As shown below, India has the world’s largest population of people who have yet to use the internet—another reason why foreign companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Uber see it as a massive potential growth market.

478,"January 15, 2020",CPI Talks… with Joseph Simons,"

In this month’s edition of CPI Talks we have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Joseph Simons,1 the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
Thank you, Mr. Simons, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.

In the fall of 2019, fifty States’ Attorneys General announced an antitrust investigation into Google, focusing on Google’s advertising business, but potentially extending into other aspects of its activities. In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google that would have focused on similar issues. In parallel, we understand that the FTC will look at similar issues relating to Facebook and Amazon. What are your views on the interplay between State enforcers, the FTC, and the DOJ in the digital economy? What are some of the ways in which the agencies are coordinating?

I can’t comment on any current investigations, but I’ll note that the FTC has a long history of coordinating with our sister agencies on enforcement matters. The states, in particular, play a critical role in our investigations because they very often are closer to the conduct under investigation or may have closer ties with some of the individuals who are complaining about the conduct. We’ve worked closely with the states on past litigation matters such as the Mallinckrodt case, where Alaska, New York, Texas, and Washington joined our complaint and obtained a portion of the $100 million settlement relating to charges that the company maintained its monopoly by acquiring development rights to a competing drug. And in our recent hospital merger challenges against Advocate/North Shore, Penn States Hershey/PinnacleHealth, and Sanford/MidDakota, we worked closely with the states.
In past cases, attorneys from the states have helped us identify witnesses, taken the lead in conducting interviews, helped develop our thinking around legal theories, participated in depositions, and served as co-counsel when we go to litigation. They are critical partners that share investigative responsibilities and strengthen our ability to prosecute anticompetitive mergers and conduct. Finally, I should note that even when we aren’t directly working with the states, states have, on their own initiative, submitted supportive amicus briefs in cases that we are litigating in federal court.
At the federal level, the FTC and DOJ typically will come to some mutual agreement on which agency will investigate a matter. We try to “clear” matters to one agency or the other in order to avoid duplicating investigations. Although recently, we have had some difficulty coming to an agreement on which agency should handle certain digital-market-focused conduct investigations, we are working together constructively to ensure any overlapping investigative work goes smoothly.

In parallel, enforcers worldwide (notably in Europe) have continued to adopt an interventionist approach in the digital economy, both in terms of recent cases (and various sector inquiries and recently-published reports, that suggest that this trend will continue or intensify). Do you believe that in the months and years to come we will see more convergence between international enforcers in their approach to the digital economy, or do you see a risk of greater divergence? 

Headlines may overstate differences in approach to digital matters. For example, this past summer, the competition authorities of the G7 countries, together with the European Commission, developed a Common Understanding on Competition and the Digital Economy, which focuses on shared principles related to the value of innovation, sound competition analysis, competition advocacy, and international cooperation as keys to promoting the benefits of competition in the digital economy.
As for the U.S. and Europe, the transatlantic relationship is marked by deep and frequent engagement. Over the three decades since our U.S.-EU cooperation agreement, our interaction, with few exceptions, tells a story of convergence. The digital economy is unlikely to be different, as we are examining similar conduct (setting aside the EC’s single market cases), testing similar theories, and usually coming to similar conclusions. The topics the Vestager-commissioned experts explored in the Competition Policy for the Digital Era report are topics we addressed during our year-long series of hearings. Our hearings even had a session dedicated to understanding our respective approaches to platforms.
Moreover, differences in our courts’ approaches to assessing multi-sidedness, or the quantum of effects necessary to find a single firm conduct infringement are not specific to the digital economy, and they are not a harbinger for greater divergence in the digital sphere.
Our shared vocabulary and analytical tools suggest an evolution that is more likely to be a continuing force for incremental convergence than an inflection point for divergence. Frequent exchange will allow us to narrow actual or potential differences as together we develop a better understanding of how these markets function. Although each jurisdiction naturally favors its own regime, we have much to learn from the experiences of others as we work to refine our respective approaches to enforcement in light of new learning and information about the digital economy.

What are your views on the role of “big data” for antitrust enforcement in the digital economy, and how does it interact with other regulatory regimes? The notion of “big data” has implications for different types of regulation, beyond antitrust. Notably, the FTC enforces not only antitrust rules, but also certain aspects of Federal privacy rules (See, for example, the recent COPPA settlement with Google concerning advertising on YouTube), and international antitrust enforcers (notably the German Federal Cartel Office) are showing greater willingness to take data and privacy concerns into account in antitrust enforcement strictu sensu. How will the FTC balance these roles and rules going forward? 

The use of data in commerce is not a new phenomenon. All firms gather and use data to some degree. Although firms have used data for a long time, data usage in commerce is becoming an increasingly important element of competition. Recent advances in technology have enabled firms to gather vast amounts of information about consumers and the marketplace. Commentators sometimes refer to such datasets as “big data.” Harnessing big data can bring enormous benefits to consumers and be a significant driver of economic growth. Firms can use big data to create innovative products and services, develop sophisticated AI applications, and more efficiently market products and services to consumers. Health care providers can take advantage of big data to improve patient care, potentially saving many lives.
However, big data can also be an instrument of anticompetitive conduct that harms consumers. Antitrust enforcers must be vigilant to consider the effects of data on competition. Firms can use data to engage in exclusionary conduct by, for example, abusing their monopoly power to deny rivals access to data through exclusive agreements with suppliers of data. Mergers between firms in markets where access to data is an essential input may also lead to anticompetitive harm. Fortunately, antitrust enforcers at the FTC have the tools necessary to challenge anticompetitive conduct and mergers involving data.
The FTC has been active in enforcement of competition cases involving data. The FTC has had a number of enforcement actions where access to data was a central element of the case. The FTC has required remedies in CoreLogic’s acquisition of DataQuick Information Systems (a transaction involving real property data) and in Dun & Bradstreet’s acquisition of Quality Educational Data (a transaction involving educational marketing data). Most recently, the FTC challenged a proposed merger between Fidelity National Financial and Stewart Information Services Corporation (a transaction involving property title data), leading the parties to abandon the proposed merger.
Moreover, in 2019, the FTC launched a new division within the Bureau of Competition dedicated to antitrust enforcement in the technology sector. The Technology Enforcement Division specializes in antitrust enforcement in digital markets, including antitrust issues associated with big data.
Antitrust, however, is not the only concern arising out of misconduct involving big data. Firms may also harm consumers by collecting, using, or sharing data in a way that violates consumers’ privacy. One of our major priorities at the FTC is to challenge deceptive or unfair practices under Section 5, or violations of other laws enforced by the FTC, relating to consumers’ data. Recently, the FTC obtained a $5 billion penalty on Facebook for violating an earlier Order that prohibited Facebook from misrepresenting how it shares and uses consumer data, and required it to take reasonable steps to protect consumer data. The $5 billion penalty is the largest consumer privacy related penalty ever obtained by any government. In addition to the penalty, Facebook agreed to sweeping new privacy restrictions and a modified corporate structure that will hold the company accountable for the decisions it makes about its users’ privacy.
It is critical that firms collect and use data in a way that respects consumer privacy. Appropriate privacy rules must safeguard consumers. However, when enacting privacy legislation, Congress should consider how legislative choices in the privacy arena would also affect competition. For example, certain legislative choices could favor incumbents. Ideally, any new privacy laws will both protect consumers and promote competition.

More broadly speaking, what are your views on the interaction between antitrust enforcement and sector regulation as it relates to the digital economy? Leaving aside their merits, there are growing calls at a political level for greater intervention in this sector (see for example, the 2019 Congressional hearings into the activities of the large technology companies). Do you think the existing antitrust and regulatory toolkits are sufficient to deal with any problems identified, or do you believe additional legislative or regulatory rules are required to deal with problems unique to this sector?

Antitrust laws work in conjunction with other federal laws and regulations as well as with state laws and regulations. Antitrust laws focus on protecting competition and ensuring that markets remain free from impediments to competition. Other laws and regulations typically have broader social goals and priorities, such as promoting universal access, protecting the environment, ensuring the safety of workers and consumers, protecting privacy, and eliminating deceptive marketing practices. In general, federal antitrust laws apply across all sectors of the economy. Firms that operate in regulated sectors of the economy are generally not immune from antitrust enforcement. However, in some limited circumstances, sector-specific regulations may supersede antitrust enforcement.
Over the past several decades, the United States has reduced regulations in many sectors of the economy with the goal of eliminating impediments to competition in these sectors. Sectoral regulators have also increasingly promoted competition and free markets in pursuing broader policy objectives. I should also note that the FTC has an active ongoing advocacy program to encourage states to adopt laws and regulations (or revise existing standards) that enhance and promote competition. Indeed, many technology-enabled business models have challenged existing regulatory approaches and caused policymakers to adapt regulations to allow competition from newcomers. In addition, the FTC engages with Congress to promote laws that are likely to enhance competition in the U.S. economy.
Current U.S. antitrust laws provide the tools necessary to address competition challenges in the digital economy. U.S. antitrust laws are sufficiently robust to handle competition problems as they arise. Over the years, antitrust laws have proven to be very flexible and resilient in enabling enforcers to challenge conduct that harms competition in a broad range of markets. These laws have proved themselves effective even as the economy evolved with technological progress. I do not expect this to change when it comes to enforcement of antitrust laws in the digital economy.

In parallel to the Congressional hearings discussed above, in the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019, the FTC held a series of hearings examining whether changes in the economy, business practices, and in particular digital technologies might require adjustments to the law, enforcement priorities, and policy. What are your views on the submissions made during this process? Do you foresee any outputs from this consultation in the near-to-medium term and what are some lessons learned so far?

As you note, last fall, the Commission commenced its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. These hearings underscore the unique role that the FTC plays in the development of sound competition and consumer protection policy. We asked for public comment on several questions and topics, and we are taking into account the submitted comments and public testimony as well as the FTC’s experience, judicial decisions, and academic writings as we create our output.
We are planning to release several pieces of output. I expect we will be releasing output from our international hearing very soon. I previewed the content from that hearing in my speech at the Fordham University Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy. Specifically, the output will discuss the broad interest in the following:

Reauthorizing the U.S. SAFE WEB Act;
Stronger information sharing and investigative assistance mechanisms;
FTC’s continued international leadership on competition and consumer protection issues;
Expanded programs to build strong relations with counterparts; and
FTC’s role in formulating broader government policies that relate to competition and/or consumer protection and involve international issues.

We also are working earnestly on Vertical Merger Guidelines, and we have been coordinating with DOJ in that effort. We are drafting a guidance document on the application of the antitrust laws to technology platform conduct, which we also plan to share with DOJ. Beyond that, we are drafting commentary on vertical and horizontal mergers — very similar to the Commentary on the Horizontal Merger Guidelines from 2006. We are conducting a review of the economic literature on “common ownership” or horizontal shareholding. We are developing a protocol for merger retrospective studies that will help us to identify good candidates for horizontal merger retrospective studies.
I should note that while the hearings created direct support for several pieces of output, they also are indirectly kindling other initiatives. For instance, our hearings on labor monopsony issues have partly inspired our interest in hosting another workshop on non-compete clauses in certain labor contracts. We are using this workshop, which we are hosting on January 9, 2020, to gain a better understanding of what support we would need to develop a rule relating to non-compete clauses in certain labor contracts. I wouldn’t be surprised if our work on the hearings inspires other offshoots in our policy work.

479,"January 13, 2020",Insider Q&A: Antitrust Expert Looks for Strong Enforcement,"
By New York Times
Sally Hubbard is an antitrust expert, whose central mission is to call attention to the risks of corporate monopolization. Hubbard previously served as an assistant attorney general in the antitrust bureau of New York state.
With the biggest tech companies under government investigation for alleged anti-competitive conduct, her analysis speaks to an issue of growing urgency.
The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Q: Far from being ripped off, many consumers feel they’re getting great deals and free services from the likes of Amazon and Google. So what’s the problem for the consumer?
A: Antitrust doctrine has been weakened in the last 30 years. The case law that’s come out has been heavily influenced by what’s called the Chicago School of Economics. It took antitrust law and made it all about corporate efficiency and low prices instead of what it was supposed to be about: Competition.
But if you look at the antitrust laws, they don’t talk about low prices. There’s no mention of the word “prices” in the antitrust laws. You’re paying with your data. It’s not free. And the amount of data that you’re paying, it’s very hard to see. We don’t even know the ways we’re being tracked. The fact that Google, because it’s the search engine, can direct half of the world’s traffic to its own properties —that’s not fair competition.

481,"January 9, 2020",US: Feds “all in” for autonomous vehicles,"
As it rolled out new federal agency guidance at the annual CES event, the Trump administration showed strong support for autonomous vehicles. The US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao unveiled the latest principles for autonomous vehicles from the administration that she says brings together the self-driving policy efforts throughout 38 US departments as well as agencies, Reuters reported Wednesday, January 8.
The policy document, which is 51 pages, notes that the federal government will adopt as well as spread “flexible, technology-neutral policies that will allow the public, not the federal government or foreign governments, to choose the most economically efficient and effective transportation and mobility solutions.” Chao said per the report, “The takeaway from AV 4.0 is that the federal government is all in — for safer, better and more inclusive transportation, aided by automated driving systems.”
But the administration didn’t endorse new policies to ensure the safety of self-driving vehicles. In a recent interview, Chao said per the report that the course of action of the Obama administration was “very prescriptive … and in many ways it hampered innovation.” Advocates for Highway Safety said that the “voluntary guidelines” of the administration are “completely unenforceable, will not result in adequate performance standards and fall well short of the safeguards that are necessary to protect the public.”
The news comes after it was reported that a large number of senior government officials will visit CES. The officials will visit in amid an interesting time for tech, when many government agencies are looking into big four tech companies — Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon — over potential anti-competition and antitrust practices.
Chao, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios, and White House adviser Ivanka Trump were among the 150 government officials expected to participate. Few officials visit CES, with only one typically attending in years past and none last year because of a government shutdown.

483,"January 7, 2020",2019 Pharmaceutical Antitrust Round-Up: A Year in Pay for Delay [Part 1],"
By William Cavanaugh, Melissa R. Ginsberg & Amy N. Vegari
2019 witnessed a number of developments in challenges to reverse-payment settlements. In its first decision on a pay-for-delay settlement since the Supreme Court’s seminal 2013 decision in FTC v. Actavis, the FTC took an aggressive approach to evaluating a plausible restraint on trade and analyzing proffered procompetitive benefits, reversing the ALJ who heard the case. In the Southern District of New York, an attempt by direct purchasers to plead a conspiracy arising out patent-infringement settlements without an alleged reverse payment failed. And, in the class certification context, district courts grappled with Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement. These notable cases in antitrust actions concerning the pharmaceutical industry are discussed below.
Reverse-Payment Litigation
Reverse-payment or “pay for delay” cases arise when parties settle patent litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act with an alleged agreement by the brand-name patent holder to provide some form of consideration to the allegedly infringing generic manufacturer inducing delayed introduction of its generic drug. In Actavis, the Supreme Court held that “large and unjustified” reverse payments risk anticompetitive effects, and pronounced that such settlement agreements must be analyzed under the Rule of Reason, considering such factors as: size of the payment, scale of the payment as compared to the patentee’s potential litigation cost; relationship of the payment to any other services agreed upon in the settlement, and any other justifications for the settlement. If the plaintiff makes a showing that the defendant’s conduct prevented the risk of competition, the defendant has the burden of showing procompetitive justifications for the deal.
Since Actavis, reverse payment lawsuits have been brought in which the alleged consideration was not the payment of money, but instead involved:
Cash or legal fees;Global settlement of litigation involving multiple other patents or drugs;Agreement by the brand manufacturer not to market an authorized generic (“No AG agreements”);Co-promotion agreements; orBack-up manufacture or supply agreements.

A large number of senior government officials will visit the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), an annual tech industry event held in Las Vegas, according to a report by Reuters.
The officials will visit in the midst of an interesting time for tech, when many government agencies are investigating the big four tech companies — Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon— over potential antitrust and anti-competition practices.
Both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are looking into the tech companies.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios will be among the 150 government officials expected to participate.
Few officials visit CES, with only one typically attending in previous years and none last year due to a government shutdown.
CES will run Jan.7-10, and more than 175,000 visitors and 4,500 companies are expected to attend, as well as present new technologies in cars, airplanes and batteries.
The current administration said technology is a good way to boost employment in the country, and it’s actively working to make it easier for technologies like self-driving cars and drones to be able to operate.
Most of the Big Tech companies skip the event in favor of holding their own events.
There are plans for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and FTC Chairman Joseph Simons to hold fireside chats, and other FTC and FCC commissioners are planning to attend.
Elena Hernandez, the spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said Kratsios is expected to discuss the national plan for artificial intelligence (AI), which was started in 2018.
“Recognizing the significance of technology on the American workforce, our national security, and the U.S. economy, the [President Donald] Trump administration continues to make leadership in the cutting-edge industries of the future a top priority,” Hernandez said.

485,"January 5, 2020",Big Data Comes to Hollywood: The Brewing Antitrust Battle of the Streaming Era,"
By Eriq Gardner, Hollywood Reporter 
Movie box office. TV ratings. Say what you will about the reliability of entertainment consumption metrics, but for decades, what people watched was hardly hush-hush. Then subscription video streamers came along. Now, massive data is collected about viewing habits but is disclosed only at the discretion of the companies sucking it up. Netflix says it will become more transparent in 2020. But will it? And who knows if the numbers it releases are inaccurate or misleading? How much should the rest of Hollywood care about transparency?
Well, consider that less than two years ago, Time Warner’s then-CEO Jeff Bewkes took the witness stand during a trial where the U.S. government attempted to block his company’s merger with AT&T. Bewkes pointed to Amazon, Netflix, YouTube and Facebook before explaining that these companies “know more about our consumers than we do.” The merger was justified, he explained, because digital giants possessed something that one of Hollywood’s biggest media companies sorely needed — data. “The more you know about viewers, the more it informs your programming,” he said. “It helps you understand how to optimize.”
Hollywood is catching up. Disney has launched its data-sucking streaming service Disney+ while others including AT&T’s HBO Max will be running soon enough. With a 21st century operation, though, comes a 21st century problem: the potential for regulation. Government intervention could drop a bomb on the so-called streaming wars.
Only in the past few years have academics begun discussing whether Big Data presents antitrust issues, and if so, what to do about it. Spurred by frustration at the might of companies like Google and Facebook, lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the political aisle have in recent months openly endorsed the scrutinizing of companies that are leveraging their inside knowledge about consumer habits to the disadvantage of third parties.

486,"January 2, 2020",Big Tech to Spur Global Antitrust Rewrite in 2020,"
By Victoria Graham, Bloomberg
If 2019 was the year of the techlash, 2020 is poised to be the year of the global antitrust rewrite, as countries worldwide retool their laws to confront Big Tech.
Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other tech giants are facing increased criticism from antitrust regulators over their expanding power, particularly their control over troves of data.
Heading into 2020, some countries have signaled that their displeasure with the tech industry isn’t just talk. Regulators from the U.S. to the U.K. to Australia have warned that they plan to take action to rein in the power of Silicon Valley’s biggest names, by tweaking the policies that govern competition.
“The techlash is the rhetorical thing, it’s the easy bit,” said Greg Francis, a London-based managing director at Access Partnership, a global public policy consultancy for the tech sector. “The dangerous and challenging part is the regulation that is getting drafted in response.”
The Eastern Hemisphere is already dotted with a handful of tech policy proposals, many of which could become a reality in 2020.
Germany’s federal cartel office, which has already sought to overhaul Facebook’s user tracking practices, proposed rules that would address the use of data in digital markets. Australia is slated to set up a new committee in the new year that will monitor Big Tech’s potentially anticompetitive online advertising practices.
The year ahead is the “next chapter” of the techlash debate, said Marianela Lopez-Galdos, global competition counsel at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Facebook and Google.
“For 2020, what we will see is how these ideas get implemented,” she said.

487,"January 1, 2020",Russia: Regulators to crack down on US Big Tech in 2020,"
New Russian protectionist legislation takes aim at US Big Tech companies as additional laws are being prepped to restrict content.
According to The Hollywood Reporter (THR), all computers and mobile devices sold in Russia are required to have preinstalled Russian software effective July 1.
Apple is among the many US tech companies that are opposed to having to preinstall the Yandex Russian web browser and other apps, which would require additional licensing and development fees.
Google, Samsung, and Dell joined Apple and the Association of Trading Companies and Manufacturers of Household Electrical Equipment and Computers (RATEK) in petitioning Russian authorities to drop the restrictions.
“The initiative is potentially harmful to the market. It will hit consumers, electronics manufacturers and software developers alike,” a spokesman for the association told THR on December 29. “Specifically, manufacturers will suffer as operational systems of some of them are not suitable for external applications, and even those who potentially can preinstall local apps will have to pay sizable license fees.”
Under Russian legislation, global streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV+ would also face restrictions.
“At this point, we don’t see Apple TV+ as a competitor, since they have a totally different content policy and audience,” Elena Khlebnikova, a content director at the Russian-based video service tvzavr, said in a statement.
Any services that jeopardize the Russian market could be banned or face government restrictions, which limit foreign-owned streaming services to 20% of users.
Facebook and Twitter are already violating older legislation that requires the personal data of Russian citizens to be stored in Russia, and were also accused of publishing anti-Kremlin content. When LinkedIn refused to comply, it was immediately blocked; Russian legislators are looking to block Facebook and Twitter in the same manner.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in Russia has opened a probe into hospitality and reservation site Booking.com over anti-competition issues. According to the regulator, Booking.com asked other hotels and hostels to list the same prices on other reservation sites as it does on its own site. If the FAS finds that Booking.com is in breach of anti-competition laws, the company faces a fine of between 1% and 15% of all the revenue it generates in the country.

488,"January 1, 2020",Trending Topics of 2019,"
DisCo covered a range of topics in 2019 and is working on even more for 2020. Below are some topics we have covered which are quite popular with our readers and we expect will continue to draw attention next year.
1. The challenges of social media:
Social media has risen to center stage this year, which can be attributed to efforts from these services to innovate and stay competitive in the market during increasingly negative sentiment and rising calls for regulation. 
DisCo readers were most attracted to how social media will continue to operate facing this shift. Facebook’s new “off-Facebook activity” feature was one example of social media platforms addressing issues such as privacy, data portability, transparency, and user control over their data.
Furthermore, readers were interested in how social media will handle current and proposed regulation. One point of note is how the Internet handles current copyright law and hastily written regulations that may in fact damage services rather than resolve the issues they were created to fix. Another is that the current climate in the U.S. and in the European Union may be shifting towards increased regulation, as evidenced by multiple cases, one of which is the German FCO’s Facebook case.
2. The evolution of the entertainment industry:
This year has seen a lot of disruptive innovation — especially in the entertainment industry. Netflix’s Oscar nods (and wins), and the birth and growth in streaming services chronicle an increase in competition. [1, 2]
The video game sector is additionally experiencing the same disruptive innovation and increase in competition. Video games like Fortnite are becoming more multifaceted and now competing against movies, TV, and other forms of digital entertainment for consumers’ attention.
A 2019 report from the Copia Institute and CCIA, the Sky is Rising, supports these claims. The report details how creative industries such as music, videos, books, and video games are thriving more than ever now.
3. The Oracle Java litigation:
DisCo has covered the Oracle v. Google case since its commencement. We have built a page dedicated to the case with multiple resources including a short 60-second read, timeline, background, legal briefs, consequences, and media and scholarly analysis.
This year, readers took particular interest in certain stages of the case. First, in February when fourteen amicus briefs were filed in support of Google’s petition to the Supreme Court to review the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Second, in April when Google filed its reply brief responding to arguments made in Oracle’s recent opposition brief. 
As the Supreme Court has now agreed to hear the case, DisCo will continue to cover developments in this important case next year.

489,"December 31, 2019",Antitrust Pitfalls in Global Licensing: Perspective from China – A “Glocal” Battleground,"

By Frank JIANG, John JIANG (Zhong Lun Law Firm)1
Introduction
As a participant in the global economy, and in response to current delicate global trade and geopolitical situations, China is making increasing efforts to encourage investment in innovation. One of China’s initiatives relates to the intersection of IPR licensing and antitrust, with China growing its antirust regulatory teeth to become one of the leading jurisdictions taking initiatives to foster an innovation-driven economy. China is learning the art of balancing IPR protection and antitrust regulation in a “glocal” battleground. China’s activities, as described below, may shed some light on such emerging trends:

Legislation. A special Anti-monopoly Guidelines on Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights (“AML Guidelines on IPR (Draft)”) is in the process of formalization.
Enforcement. A super-agency – the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) was created in 2018 to consolidate antitrust and IPR enforcement functions, and technology-intensive industries have become one of the antitrust enforcement priorities.
Judiciary. The Supreme People’s Court (“SPC”) established a special IP appellate tribunal in 2019 to hear the appeals of IP and antitrust cases and, at its discretion, high profile and complicated first-instance trials. Local courts are also aspiring to address new emerging antitrust/IPR related issues.

The Anti-monopoly Law (“AML”) does not apply to lawful exercise of intellectual property rights, but prohibits abuse of IPRs to eliminate or restrict competition. Accordingly, for antitrust compliance, it is key to assess the competitive effect of the relevant conduct and mergers which involve IPRs. In China, the starting point for such competition analysis is delineating a relevant market (from both a product and geographic perspective). Where IPRs are involved, factors such as innovation, R&D, protection period and the “territoriality” of IPRs may impact the market definition.
Below are some key highlights of Chinese enforcement and judicial practices with respect to IPR licensing in China, from the perspectives of merger control, joint conduct and unilateral conduct.
1. Merger Control
IPR licensing plays its role in China’s merger control regime mainly in terms of competition assessment, and imposition of merger remedies, etc. For example, in competition assessment, IPRs could be deemed to be a significant market entry barrier (see, e.g. Merck/AZ Electronic and Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent). IPRs could also become a key element in remedies to conditionally clear a merger, either in the form of structural remedies (see, e.g. Baxter/Gambro and Panasonic/Sanyo) or behavioral remedies (see, e.g. Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies, Google/Motorola, and Bayer/Monsanto).
2. Joint Conduct
An IPR license arrangement could raise cartel or vertical concerns. Competing IPR holders may engage in conduct such as price fixing, production/sales volume restriction, market allocation, new technology restriction, or boycotts. Standardization processes or patent pools may also breed cartel concerns. An IPR licensor could also impose resale price maintenance terms on a licensee. Also, we have seen instances of IPR holders exclusively licensing their technology to their Chinese joint ventures. The interaction between the licensor and its Chinese joint venture, e.g. in attempting to achieve consistent pricing strategy, may raise horizontal and/or vertical concerns.
3. Unilateral Conduct
Under the AML, unilateral conducts (more often referred to as abuses of dominance) include excessive pricing, predatory pricing, refusal to deal, exclusive dealing, tying and imposing unreasonable trade terms, and discriminatory treatment. Finding abusive conduct generally follows a four-step approach: dominance, abusive conduct (restrictive conduct), a lack of justification, and effects (an anti-competitive impact). We will discuss below some typical instances of IPR-related abusive conduct, with more detail forthcoming in the next issue.
Excessive royalties
Excessive royalties might be assessed by looking at the costs and the value of the IPR, and pricing for comparable licenses. Assessment of costs can take into account whether an IPR holder has assumed the risk of making significant R&D investments without the guarantee of success in commercializing any resulting products. For standardization activities, there is additional technical risk as to whether the developed technology can be incorporated into the standard, and whether the standard can be widely adopted.
In adopting the comparable license approach, “comparability” is a key factor. In addition, the “top-down” approach adopted in TCL v. Ericsson2 (vacated in part, reversed in part and remanded during appeal) and other SEP disputes in the U.S. also has implications in China. We have learnt that in complex cases the court may cross-check fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms based on different approaches.
“Justifiable cause” used to not be available as a specific defense against unfair pricing allegations. However, newly-issued AML implementing rules appear to provide room for a dominant firm to defend against alleged “unfair” pricing by factoring in additional criteria.
Refusal to license
Where an undertaking has a dominant market position, especially when it holds SEPs or its IPR is found to constitute an “essential facility” for production and business operations, refusal to license its IPR without justifiable causes may constitute an abuse of dominance. The plaintiffs’ allegation of market dominance for possessing an essential patent portfolio and invocation of the “essential facility” doctrine in Hitachi Metals Case has attracted significant attention. While denying access to an essential facility creates heightened exposure to refusal to license allegations, the new AML implementing rules also call for a more nuanced evaluation.
Tying 
Tying arrangements in an IPR license could take the form of tying another IPR (e.g. tying of SEPs and non-SEPs) or tying another physical product while licensing the IPR. Finding illegal tying in connection with IPR licensing generally follows the same analytical framework regarding tying of physical products. One key factor is to assess whether the licensed IPR and the tied IPR/product are separate products, whether the licensee has been required to accept the tied IPR/product against its will, and whether a tie’s efficiency cannot outweigh the possible anticompetitive effect.
Imposing questionable license terms (including exclusive terms)
The imposition of exclusive and other pro-licensor terms by a dominant IPR holder may trigger antitrust concerns in terms of the imposition of unreasonable contractual terms or excessive pricing allegations. For SEP holders, being held-out by implementers that do not engage in good-faith license negotiations and/or withhold royalty payments, Qualcomm v. Meizu and InterDigital v. Huawei (a patent infringement action recently filed by InterDigital against Huawei seeking, among other things, a determination of FRAND terms for SEP license) provides meaningful guidance.3
I. The Intersection of IPR Licensing and Antitrust in China: A Balancing Act
As the largest marketplace worldwide and in response to the current delicate global trade conditions, China is striving to upgrade its economy to an innovation-oriented model by attracting foreign investments and encouraging indigenous innovation in IPR intensive sectors. For example, the new Foreign Investment Law (“FIL”) promulgated in March 2019 (and entering into effect on January 1, 2020), its implementing rules and associated policies emphasize that China will protect the IPR of foreign investors and foreign investors in China, and encourage technological cooperation based on fair and equal terms.4 Shortly after the promulgation of the FIL, the Chinese government announced amendments to its joint venture law and the Regulations on Administration of Technology Import and Export (“TIER”), to loosen restrictions on cross-border technology transfers and offer more flexibility for negotiation of certain terms. These include the requirement that a foreign licensor be obligated to indemnify Chinese licensees for any loss arising from the use of licensed technologies, the requirement that any improvements made by a Chinese licensee to an imported technology must per se belong to the licensee, and the provision requiring that certain restrictive clauses imposed by foreign licensors are invalid5. As shown in the chart below, the number of IPR disputes tried by Chinese courts has also increased in the past decade, especially in the last five years.

(Source: Publicly available information of SPC statistics)
The “glocal” dynamic is also reflected in antitrust enforcement concerning IPRs. Since the Anti-monopoly Law (“AML”) took effect in 2008, China has shown its growing regulatory teeth in terms of antitrust enforcement, becoming more confident to conduct independent and China-specific investigations in high profile and complex global cases. On the other hand, the Chinese antitrust authority is also striking a balance between antitrust regulation and IPR protection, and has been taking a more prudent stance.
The following developments in IPR-related antitrust legislation, enforcement and judicial activities sheds some light on these emerging trends.
a. Legislation. Similar to the EU and the U.S., which have specific guidelines with respect to antitrust regulation of technology transfers and IPRs, China is also in the process of formulating a special AML Guidelines on IPR (Draft), amid existing IPR-related provisions in the AML and several other implementing rules.
b. Enforcement. A super-agency – the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) was created in last year’s government reshuffle program to consolidate not only the antitrust enforcement functions of State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) and Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), but also a number of other responsibilities concerning patents, trademarks and geographical indications, by housing the State Intellectual Property Office (“SIPO,” now called China National Intellectual Property Administration, “CNIPA”) and some other agencies under the same roof.
IP-intensive industries have become one of China’s antitrust enforcement priorities. Enforcement in IPR-intensive sectors and some highlighted cases is illustrated below:

c. Judiciary. As indicated above, Chinese courts have accumulated rich experience in adjudicating IP-related disputes, with increasing numbers of IP cases being brought before courts in recent years. At the beginning of this year, the Supreme People’s Court (“SPC”) established a special IP appellate tribunal to hear appeals against first-instance decisions and rulings in patent and antitrust disputes and to hear, at its discretion, first-instance trials over such disputes when they involve highly important and complicated nationwide matters. The IP tribunal is expected to centralize jurisdiction, leveraging more professional resources in IP/antitrust disputes and to improve the consistency of decisions.
Local courts are also aspiring to address new emerging antitrust/IP related issues, with the Guangdong and Beijing courts being especially active. In April 2018, the Guangdong High People’s Court (“GHC”) issued a working guide on adjudicating cases concerning SEP disputes (“GHC Guide”), with comprehensive coverage of SEP-related issues, including approach to finding SEP infringement, injunctive relief, determination of FRAND license terms, and SEP-related anti-monopoly claims. In September 2018, the Beijing High People’s Court (“BHC”) issued the Opinions of the Beijing High People’s Court on Enhancing the Adjudication of IPR Cases and Promoting Innovation and Development (“BHC Opinions”), which includes principles on adjudication of SEP related cases and monopoly cases.
In addition to these domestic efforts, China is actively participating in international cooperation on antitrust legislation and enforcement. China has entered into a memorandum of understanding (or a similar arrangement) with a number of countries or regions, including the U.S., the EU, Japan and South Africa. For example, on October 15, 2015, MOFCOM and the European Commission concluded a best practices framework for cooperation in reviewing mergers, marking growing cooperation between regulators handling multinational transactions, and. further, in April 2019 signed the Framework Agreement on Competition Policy Dialogue between China and the EU and another competition cooperation MoU.6/sup>
Against this backdrop, we will provide an overview of China’s antitrust regulation on merger control, joint conduct and unilateral conduct in the context of global IPR licensing. We will highlight the antitrust pitfalls that companies should watch out for, as well as possible defenses against alleged AML violations.
II. Analytical Framework for IPR Related Conduct
As IPRs, by their very nature, concern a legitimate right to exclude competitors, IPR licensing arrangements generally enhance competition. Under Article 55 of the AML, the AML does not apply to lawful exercise of intellectual property rights, but abuse of IPRs to eliminate or restrict competition is regulated.7
With Article 55 of the AML being the legal basis, Article 2 of the AML Guidelines on IPR (Draft) further sets forth the following analytical principles for IPR related conduct: (i) adopt the same regulatory standard as those applicable to other property rights and follow the basic analytical framework under the AML; (ii) take into account the characteristics of IPR; (iii) do not presume that an undertaking has a dominant market position in the relevant market due to its IPRs; and (iv) take into account the positive impacts of the relevant conduct on competition and innovation on a case-by-case basis.
Accordingly, for antitrust compliance, it is key to assess the competitive effect of conduct and mergers which involve the exercise of IPRs, such as licensing. In other words, it is particularly important to assess the positive impacts of IPR-related conduct on innovation and efficiency (including promoting the dissemination and utilization of technologies, enhancing the utilization efficiency of resources, etc.).8
III. Starting Point – Defining the Relevant Market
Any competition analysis (such as identification of competitors, assessment of market power, competitive effects) is carried out within a “relevant market.” Therefore, the starting point of any such analysis with respect to merger control, unilateral conduct or joint conduct is delineating a relevant market (from product and geographic dimensions).
Where IPRs are involved, factors such as innovation, R&D, protection period and the “territoriality” of IPRs may impact the market definition. For example, in Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies,9 for certain products that were highly technology-intensive or have proprietary patents, and where the global market relies on large suppliers, the relevant geographic market was defined to be worldwide; for the remaining products that involved less complicated production technologies and no proprietary patents, and could be produced by either domestic or foreign suppliers, the relevant geographic market was defined at the China level.
In addition, certain technologies may be defined to constitute a standalone market in technology transfer or licensing arrangements. Subject to a substitutability analysis, the relevant technology market may not necessarily be the same as the specific technology covered by the licensed IPR. In determining whether a given technology is substitutable for the technology embodied in a certain IPR, one may need to take into account not only its field of use but also potential fields of use.10 Despite the lack of clear-cut guidance or practice, the option of defining a relevant technology market does offer more flexibility for both the IPR holder and enforcement agencies to conduct more meaningful competition analysis.
For the licensing of standard essential patents (“SEPs”), recent enforcement and judicial practice (such as Huawei v. InterDigital and NDRC Investigation into Qualcomm) tends to define the license of an individual SEP as a separate product market. As such, an SEP is unique and non-substitutable, and the relevant geographic market is taken to be as a particular country or region, because the issuance, use and protection of patents are territorial in nature. Accordingly, for a portfolio license, the relevant market has been defined as a set of separately formed relevant product markets for the licensing  of each SEP and the relevant geographic market would also be the set of the national or regional markets at issue. However, this approach is not followed in every case.11 It may also be worthwhile to explore some novel alternative approaches, yet to be tested in practice, such as a market of technologies enabling certain functionality, a market of different generations of communication standards, or a market of wireless public network communication methods.
Definition of markets involving essential facilities have some similarities to SEP licensing markets. In the antitrust dispute between four Chinese rare earth companies and Hitachi Metals (the “Hitachi Metals Case”), the plaintiffs accused Hitachi Metals of refusing to license patents that were essential, non-substitutable and inevitable for the plaintiffs’ production (even though such patents are not SEPs). The plaintiffs argued that the relevant market should be defined as the market for essential patents for sintered NdFeB magnets in an attempt to invoke the “essential facility” doctrine.12
While defining a relevant market may not be necessary or essential for conducting a competition analysis in every case as it is in some jurisdictions, in China, as noted, the relevant guidelines generally take market definition as the starting point for analyzing any given conduct, and as an important step in antitrust enforcement,13 regardless whether it is IPR-related or not.
IV. Merger Control
IPR licensing plays a role in China’s merger control regime in several contexts.
Firstly, an IPR license in and of itself might constitute a transaction that triggers a merger filing. Where the license of an IPR constitutes a stand-alone business, gaining control over the IPR may constitute a concentration. In accordance with the AML Guidelines on IPR (Draft), in addition to the transfer of IPR, such control can also be gained through an exclusive license arrangement, depending on the term of such license.
More importantly, IPR licenses can impact competitive assessments, and the imposition of remedies.
In assessing the competition impact of a concentration, the Chinese antitrust authority usually takes into account the market share and market power of relevant undertakings, the level of concentration in the relevant market, the impact on market entry and technology progress, the impact on consumers and other undertakings, and the impact on the national economy.14 The IPR factor mainly plays a part in the market entry factor, and the reliance by consumers or other undertakings. For example, in Merck/AZ Electronic,15 MOFCOM considered that some patents held by Merck constituted substantial barriers for new entrants to enter the relevant market, thereby strengthening Merck’s market power and the merger may have adverse competition impact. Similarly, in Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent,16 MOFCOM considered communication SEPs to be the major obstacle to entry in the downstream market, as licensees were highly reliant on access to communication SEPs.
IPRs may also play a part in any remedies imposed on the concentrations that are deemed to be likely to have adverse competitive impact. These can be structural, behavioral or hybrid in nature.
a. As a structural condition, IPRs and research facilities may form part of a divestiture or as a supporting condition for securing an effective divestiture. For example, in Baxter/Gambro AB,17 some IPRs and know-how owned by Baxter were required to be divested in order to clear the case; in the Panasonic/Sanyo,18 Panasonic was required to license relevant IPRs to the purchaser when divesting certain business.
b. Behavioral conditions involving IPRs may take a variety of forms, including supply commitments (granting access to a license consistent with current practice, see, e.g. Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies and Google/Motorola19), non-discrimination (license relevant IPRs on non-discriminatory terms, sometimes on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, see, e.g. Bayer/Monsanto20), reporting obligations (reporting on the execution of a license agreement to the antitrust authority, see, e.g. Merck/AZ), etc. The Chinese antitrust authority may use the term FRAND in connection with a behavioral remedy both in cases that involve IPRs and others. But it is noteworthy that the meaning of “FRAND” in this context is different from that in the SEP licensing context. Here it relates to the requirements under the AML, covering instances such as imposing unreasonable additional transaction terms in the course of a transaction and discriminating among trade counterparties under the same conditions in respect of transaction terms, such as pricing, etc.
V. Joint Conduct
An IPR license arrangement could raise cartel or vertical concerns. The assessment of vertical or horizontal restraints in an IPR license arrangement is similar to the assessment of such restraints in other types of agreements.
Competing IPR holders may engage in conduct such as price fixing, production/sales volume restriction, market allocation, new technology restriction, or boycotts. Such conduct is viewed as per se illegal and the relevant AML rules do not appear to require a stand-alone effects analysis to find a violation. Among these, price fixing, production/sales volume restrictions, and market allocation will be viewed as extremely “hard-core” cartels.21 Close cooperation among competitors during standardization or in patent pools may also breed cartel concerns – patent pools may also provide a forum for a dominant undertaking to engage in abusive conduct.22 On the other hand, implementers might also jointly boycott against a common licensor.
A license agreement is typically seen as a vertical relationship between a licensor and licensee, though it may also sometimes have a horizontal component when the licensor and the licensee, or licensees themselves are actual or potential competitors in a relevant market. A horizontal restraint on competitors in a licensing arrangement does not necessarily raise antitrust concerns.  Vertically, an IPR licensor could also impose resale price maintenance (“RPM”) terms on a licensee. In China’s administrative enforcement practice, RPM is viewed as per se illegal and the relevant AML implementing rules do not appear to require a stand-alone effects analysis to find a violation. However, there remains an unresolved tension with judicial practice, as Chinese courts have adopted a rule of reason approach in reviewing vertical restraints (that the SPC attempted to harmonize in its recent ruling on Yutai RPM Case).23
In practice, we have seen a number of cases where a global licensor, as a strategic arrangement for China, decides to establish a joint venture in China and exclusively license its technology to the joint venture for use and sublicense it to Chinese licensees. It is possible that the licensor may wish to achieve a consistent pricing strategy with respect to Chinese licensees. There are both horizontal and vertical components in any such arrangement. From a horizontal perspective, while the licensor and the China JV may not actually compete with each other, there is still uncertainty as to whether the regulator may regard such a strategy as akin to market allocation or another unlawful monopoly agreement, in particular if the licensor and China JV share any common customer(s), although it may be argued that the international parent company, its JV partner and the JV are not competitors in the traditional sense if the JV partner has no competing technology to contribute to the JV, and the JV itself is not developing a competing technology. From a vertical perspective, as the licensor and the China JV should have no visibility of each other’s customer pricing as a matter of principle, if pricing constraints are imposed on the JV, there could be a higher risk of a finding of RPM.

His expertise is especially sought by clients for PRC merger control issues in connection with M&A transactions, as well as unilateral conduct and joint conduct. His practice covers antitrust, merger and acquisition, market entry strategy, alliance/outsourcing, and technology licensing. This paper was firstly prepared for a panel discussion on “Global Licensing – How to Avoid Antitrust Pitfalls” during the 2019 annual conference of American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA). Emily Xu, Elemy Yuan and Nicole Yu, members of Zhong Lun’s antitrust practice group, contributed to this paper. A debt of gratitude is also owed to Richard Stark and Dina Kallay for their helpful comments.
2 The first instance was ruled by Judge James V. Selna on March 9, 2018 (No. 8:14-cv-00341-JVS-DFM, the United States District Court for the Central District of California).  On December 5, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated in part, reversed in part the district court decision for depriving Ericsson of the right of jury trial and remanded the case for further proceedings, leaving the top-down approach still pending future judiciary examination at the lower court (2018-1363, 2018-1732).
3 Relatedly, on December 19, 2019, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (DOJ) issued a joint policy Statement recognizing that when licensing negotiations fail, “appropriate remedies” for patent infringement, including injunctive relief, should be available to SEP holders.  This Statement follows the DOJ’s withdrawal from the 2013 SEP policy statement, which had been construed incorrectly as suggesting that special remedies applied to SEPs and that seeking an injunction or exclusion order would harm innovation and dynamic competition.
4 Article 22 of the FIL: The State protects the intellectual property rights of foreign investors and foreign-invested enterprises, and protects the legitimate rights and interests of holders of intellectual property rights and relevant right holders; any infringement of intellectual property right shall be strictly subject to legal liability in accordance with the law.
In the course of foreign investment, the State encourages technology cooperation on the basis of voluntariness and commercial norms. Conditions for technology cooperation shall be determined by all investing parties upon negotiation on the basis of equality in accordance with the principal of fairness. Administrative departments and their staff may not use any administrative means to force the transfer of technology.
China is also formulating the Regulation on the Implementation of the FIL. In the latest draft for comments, it is provided that the State establishes the punitive compensation system for intellectual property infringement, promotes the establishment of rapid coordinated protection mechanism for intellectual property, improves the diversified dispute resolution mechanism for intellectual property dispute and the aid system for defending intellectual property, and enhances the protection of intellectual property of the foreign investors and the FIEs.
In the formulation of standards, the intellectual property of the foreign investors and the FIEs shall be equally protected in accordance with the law; if the patents of the foreign investors and the FIEs are involved, the relevant administration regulations about the patents in the national standards shall apply.”
In the Opinion of the State Council on Better Utilizing Foreign Capital issued in early November 2019, it further emphasizes the significant role of courts in IPR protection and requires to improve the IPR protection systems, including the arbitration, mediation and diversified dispute resolution mechanism, etc.
5 Pursuant to the updated TIER, parties may independently agree on indemnity provisions and the ownership of improvements made by the licensees. Cross license, royalty free license or joint ownership should be allowed. Notably, although the provision regarding certain restrictive clauses is removed from the TIER, theses clauses are prohibited under the PRC Contract Law and relevant judicial interpretations for any and all licensors, and its implication is pending further observation.

7 Article 55 of the AML specifically provides that: “[t]his Law shall not apply to the exercise of its intellectual property rights by an undertaking in accordance with the relevant provisions of intellectual property laws or administrative regulations; provided that this Law shall apply to any conduct of an undertaking whereby intellectual property rights are abused to eliminate or restrict competition”.
8 For example, Article 25 of the GHC Guide provides that in adjudicating cases concerning SEP related monopoly disputes, the court shall follow the basic approaches including assess the effect of the relevant conducts on market competition, with a focus on the impact of the conducts on innovation, efficiency and consumer welfare, on a case-by-case basis. Consistent with the GHC Guide, the BHC Opinions provide that competition harm analysis shall be based on the competition effect, including the impact of the conduct concerned on promoting competition and improving efficiency.

10 Article 3 of the AML Guidelines on IPR (Draft): Where it is difficult to comprehensively assess the competition effect of the exercise of IPR by merely defining the relevant product market, the definition of the relevant technology market may need to be introduced. In light of the situation of a specific case, the effect on factors such as innovation and R&D can also be taken into account…The relevant technology market refers to a market that consists of a group or a class of technologies which are fairly closely substitutable as deemed by users…When determining whether certain technology is substitutable to the technology involved in the IPR, we not only need to take into account the current practice field, but also the potential practice fields.
11 Some SEP owners have argued that the relevant market should be defined as the license of the collective technologies covered by certain standard(s), instead of a single SEP (see Huawei vs InterDigital before GHC); in addition, in Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent, MOFCOM also accepted the market definition of the license of the collective communication SEPs and assessed Nokia’s market power mainly based on the proportion of its SEPs against the overall SEPs covered by the 2G and 3G standards.

13 Article 2 of State Council Anti-monopoly Commission Guidelines for Definition of Relevant Market (24 May 2009): The scientific and sensible definition of a relevant market is of significant relevance for critical issues such as identifying competitors and potential competitors; determining both an undertaking’s market share and the degree of market concentration; finding an undertaking’s market position; analyzing the impact of an undertaking’s conduct on market competition; and determining the whether an undertaking’s conduct is illegal, and if so, the legal liabilities to be assumed. Therefore, the definition of the relevant market is generally the starting point for analyzing a competitive conduct, and an important step in anti-monopoly law enforcement.
14 Article 27 of the AML: The following factors shall be taken into account in reviewing the concentration of undertakings:
(i) the market shares of the participating undertakings in the relevant market and their market power;
(ii) the level of concentration in the relevant market;
(iii) the impact of the concentration of undertakings on market entry and technology progress;
(iv) the impact of the concentration of undertakings on consumers and other relevant undertakings;
(v) the impact of the concentration of undertakings on the national economic development; and
(vi) other factors affecting competition in the market which are to be considered, as determined by the competent State Council Anti-monopoly Enforcement Authority.

491,"December 19, 2019",EU: Court boost for activist in Facebook data transfer fight,"
EU regulators must block tech companies from transferring data outside the bloc in cases in which privacy rules are broken, an advisor to the European Union’s top court said Thursday, December 19, part of a lengthy legal case involving an Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook, reported The Financial Times. 
In a legal case that has been running for nearly seven years, Henrik Saugmandsgaard Oe, advocate-general at the European Court of Justice, said the main set of tools that enables hundreds of thousands of companies to transfer emails, pictures and other personal data outside the EU provides sufficient protection for consumers. 
“Standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries is valid,” he wrote in a decision published in Luxembourg on Thursday. However, he noted that national regulators have an obligation to act in any case where they feel that data protections are insufficient. 
His opinion came after supporters of the current framework said a blanket ban would cause economic upheaval and hamper Europe’s access to social media and a host of other online services, many of which are provided by US companies. 
Facebook responded, “We are grateful for the advocate-general’s opinion on these complex questions. Standard contractual clauses provide important safeguards to ensure that Europeans’ data are protected once transferred overseas.”
Campaigners however, led by Austrian data privacy activist, Max Schrems, who is also a party to this case, have argued that the current way of transferring data, particularly by companies such as Facebook and Google, continues to expose EU citizens to surveillance by intelligence agencies and governments, mainly in the US. 
As part of his complaint, Mr Schrems had specifically asked that the Irish Data Protection Commissioner invoke a part of the law, known as Article 4, that would allow it to suspend data transfers from Facebook Ireland in specific cases where necessary. 
“The advocate-general is now telling the Irish data protection authority again to just do its job,” Mr Schrems said. “We asked for a targeted solution, only for companies that fall under these surveillance laws. The DPC could have issued such a decision within a day,” Mr Schrems continued. “But they didn’t want to use article 4 and kicked it back to Luxembourg . . . this whole case is a responsibility-shifting exercise, because the Irish are terrified they’ll be sued into the ground by Facebook.”

Between 2017-2019 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission con- ducted a “world rst” inquiry into digital platforms and their impact on media and advertising services markets. Its focus was Google and Facebook re ecting their “in uence, size and signi cance” in Australia. Concluding that these platforms have market power, the Final Report makes a raft of recommendations traversing competition, consumer, privacy, media and broader public interest concerns. In the competition space, minor recommendations were made with respect to Aus- tralia’s merger laws and processes and a targeted recommendation is made that Google remove default search and browser preferences from Android devices.

On 09.02.2017, Turkish Competition Board (Board) initiated an investigation to determine whether the economic entity composed of Google Inc, Google International LLC and Google Reklamcılık ve Pazarlama Ltd. Şti. (Google) has abused its dominance via the restrictions it imposed on mobile device manufacturers while licensing its Android Operating System.
In this scope, basically, the investigation focused on whether Google has leveraged the monopoly-level market power it had in mobile operating systems market to maintain or strengthen its dominance in other markets, especially the general internet search services market.
As a result of the investigation, it was found that by using the licensing conditions imposed on mobile device manufacturers, Google made it significantly harder for its rivals to get pre-installed on mobile devices and also has provided financial incentives to manufacturers in return of being the sole internet search services provider in selected devices.

495,"December 18, 2019",Competition Policy for the Digital Era,"
A number of recent reports and studies has discussed the need for competition law reform in the digital era, in particular with a view to exclusionary conduct by digital platforms and with a view to data access. While these reports share a common analysis, they diverge in their recommendations: Can we handle the new challenges on the basis of the existing set of competition rules? Do we need a new set of tests of abuse? Or do we need to shift from ex post competition law enforcement to ex ante regulation? In this article, we compare the reports. In particular, we discuss the need to shift from an effects-based analysis to “by object” prohibitions for dominant digital platforms, the need to promote data portability and interoperability, and the need for procedural reform, namely for a voluntary notification procedure for novel forms of cooperation. We conclude with some remarks on the need to adjust the enforcement style in light of the uncertainties of the digital era.

496,"December 18, 2019",UK: CMA lifts the lid on digital giants,"
The CMA has published an update in its examination of online platforms and digital advertising, uncovering new detail about how the sector’s biggest names operate.
The work is part of the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) wider digital strategy, which aims to co-ordinate the authority’s approach to tackling the new challenges of the rapidly developing digital economy. The CMA will now consult on the contents of today’s update ahead of publishing its final report next year.
In July 2019, the CMA set out to find out more about how major online platforms like Google and Facebook operate. Whilst the services these firms provide appear to be free, consumers pay for them indirectly through providing their attention and personal data, which platforms use to sell digital advertising. In the UK, people spend an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes online each day. More than a third of that time is spent on sites owned by either Google (including YouTube) or Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp). As a result, the digital advertising sector has grown massively and is now worth around £13 billion – much larger than any other form of advertising.
The CMA’s interim report has found that:
Last year, Google accounted for more than 90% of all revenues earned from search advertising in the UK, with revenues of around £6 billionIn the same year, Facebook accounted for almost half of all display advertising revenues in the UK, reaching more than £2 billion
‘Big’ is not necessarily ‘bad’ and these platforms have brought very innovative and valuable products and services to the market. But the CMA is concerned that their position may have become entrenched with negative consequences for the people and businesses who use these services every day.
A lack of real competition to Google and Facebook could mean people are already missing out on the next great new idea from a potential rival. It could also be resulting in a lack of proper choice for consumers and higher prices for advertisers that can mean cost rises for goods and services such as flights, electronics and insurance bought online. The market position of Google and Facebook may potentially be undermining the ability of newspapers and other publishers to produce valuable content as their share of revenues is squeezed by large platforms.
Through its market study, the CMA has used its statutory information gathering powers to build a better understanding of this complex market, the drivers behind the positions of Google and Facebook and the competition issues this might present. It has also been able to build a better picture of how these large platforms collect and use personal data to assess whether people have the right amount of control over their own information. All of this will help the CMA identify steps that could open up competition and contribute to the discussion about whether and how best to regulate this sector.
Each year, about 15% of queries on Google have never been searched for before. Other search engines like Bing will not have the same access to these queries, putting Google in a powerful position of being able to better train its algorithms and provide more accurate search results than its rivals.
The CMA has also found that the default settings people are faced with online have a profound effect on choice and the shape of competition. Last year in the UK, Google was willing to pay around £1 billion – 16% of all its search revenues – where it was the default search engine on mobile devices such as Apple phones.
Personal data collection also plays an important role in driving Google and Facebook’s powerful market position by allowing them to target their advertisements more effectively than others. Both for privacy and competition reasons, it is essential that people feel in control of their data. At the moment, the CMA is concerned that this is not always the case.
For example, social media platforms such as Facebook do not allow consumers to opt out of personalised advertising: rather, people are presented with a take-it-or-leave it offer, forcing them to share considerable amounts of personal data as a condition for using the service. And it is difficult to access privacy settings on these platforms, which are often only visible after navigating through multiple menus.
While there are examples of better practice, with search engines such as Google giving consumers better control, overall, we have found that consumer engagement with privacy settings and controls is low and, that, as a result, most consumers follow the default settings set by platforms – which may result in them giving up more data than they would like.
The CMA is also concerned about a lack of transparency in the way that business on these platforms works. Publishers, such as newspapers, who rely on Google and Facebook for about 40% of their traffic, have expressed concerns about unexplained dramatic changes in the number people visiting their websites due to changes in Google’s search and Facebook’s news algorithms. Different sorts of transparency concerns are particularly acute in the market for display adverts, where advertisers and publishers participate in a ‘black box’ process of real-time bidding but have limited ability to verify the effectiveness of their adverts.

The UK’s Government has been accused of breaching State aid rules by allowing Amazon to have access to public national health service (NHS) data for free.
A letter, seen by the PA news agency, shows that a formal complaint has been lodged with the EU Commission, claiming that the arrangement is “excessive” for the reasons Amazon has given for using the information.
Jolyon Maugham QC, a prominent anti-Brexit campaigner and founder of the Good Law Project, wrote the letter which was sent on Wednesday, December 11, claiming the tech giant should have paid for access.
“Amazon gets a leg up in the hugely valuable healthcare sector. But what’s in it for us? Our Government should have charged Amazon for the data but it didn’t. I’m making this complaint so that the EU Commission forces Amazon to pay up” said Maugham. 
He said, “We know from secret recordings that the Government lent on the tax authorities to go easy on Amazon. It now looks like it is also giving Amazon, worldwide, forever, irrevocably and royalty-free, a licence to all of the NHS’s healthcare information.
“Amazon gets a leg up in the hugely valuable healthcare sector. But what’s in it for us? Our Government should have charged Amazon for the data but it didn’t. I’m making this complaint so that the EU Commission forces Amazon to pay up.”

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) welcomed the Australian Government’s commitment to adopting the key recommendations from its Digital Platforms Inquiry, which will help address the impact of digital platforms on Australian consumers, business, and society.
The Government’s immediate commitments and roadmap for reform address the ACCC’s main competition and consumer priorities, including concerns about privacy and the use of data.
The ACCC will continue its work in digital platform markets through the establishment of a permanent Digital Platforms Branch. This will enable continuous and consistent scrutiny of digital platforms, and current and future consumer and competition law enforcement cases.
In addition, the ACCC will start a new inquiry into the digital advertising tech supply chain, focusing on digital display ads. “We are delighted that the Government has recognised the significance of the ACCC’s findings on the impact of the leading digital platforms on competition, consumer, privacy, media and advertising markets,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. 
“We’re proud that Australia will now be one of the first countries in the world to develop such a comprehensive roadmap for broad reforms relating to digital platforms.
“Google and Facebook have grown to have almost unfettered market power with significant impacts on consumers that must be addressed.”
The Government’s response includes tasking the ACCC to oversee the development of a new code that will address the inherent power imbalance between platforms and media companies in Australia.

500,"December 12, 2019",US: Apple’s Tim Cook says not all monopolies are bad,"


When is a monopoly not a threat?
Maybe when you’re the monopoly.
We make that statement a bit tongue in cheek, of course. The jury is still out as to whether Apple is indeed a monopoly, and/or whether it has a detrimental effect on its competitors across a slew of verticals at all.
But in the eyes, and the words, of Apple CEO Tim Cook,  monopolies are not inherently bad.
As noted in an interview Wednesday (Dec. 11) with Nikkei Asian Review, Cook said that “a monopoly by itself isn’t bad if it’s not abused.” He said, too, that Apple does not have a monopoly on any of the verticals in which it competes.
Maybe the quotes were aspirational. Again, we are tongue in cheek.
But we’d also bet that Cook’s musings might perk the ears of any number of regulators who are looking into Apple’s activities, or Big Tech’s for that matter.
As has been widely reported, there are a few inquiries ongoing into how Apple’s online app store works with – or doesn’t – other tech firms that offer competing products and services. Among the most visible examples has been Spotify’s antitrust complaint filed earlier in the year with European authorities.
“The question for those companies is, do they abuse it?” Cook was quoted as stating. “And that is for regulators to decide, not for me to decide.”
Critics have charged that the company limits its rivals.
And in another statement, he seemed to nod toward the controversies surrounding companies like Facebook and Google.
“You’re not our product — that’s very clear in our minds,” Cook told Nikkei. “We don’t believe in trafficking your data.”
Cook’s latest comments echo at least some sentiment he shared back in June. In an interview with CBS News, he said that “we should be scrutinized” but said, too, that it does not have a dominant position in its markets.  The antitrust scrutiny by regulators has been proceeding seemingly along departmental lines, while the Department of Justice has been focusing on Apple and Google parent Alphabet.
And in reference to the monopolistic argument, the logic seems to be, via Cook: Platforms can host a range of offerings, and competition can be healthy even if there are dominant players. Developers can grab multiple sources of top line by making apps available in several locations — especially if they don’t want to enter into revenue sharing pacts with Apple (known by some observers as the “Apple tax”).
The various strategies that Apple is deploying to generate recurring revenues was noted by Karen Webster in this space more than a year ago — and so were the strategies by which places like Netflix and Spotify can enroll and activate consumers away from Apple’s app store.
Monopolies, then, are in the eye of the beholder — and whether good or bad is open to debate. But in any event, the regulatory screws of scrutiny are likely to tighten.

501,"December 10, 2019",EU: Antitrust regulators consider tougher legislation against tech giants,"
EU antitrust regulators are considering taking a tougher line against tech giants by forcing them to do more to ensure a level playing field, a senior European Commission official said on Tuesday, December 10, a move which could affect Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google. 
The four US tech companies are currently in EU competition enforcers’ crosshairs, with rivals complaining about being shut out of key markets, reported Reuters. 
The Commission has traditionally ordered companies to halt anti-competitive practices.This may not be enough, especially in digital markets, said Cecilio Madero Villarejo, acting director-general at the Commission’s competition division. 
“In fast-moving markets there is a risk that this would take too long to implement and be too difficult to monitor,” he told a CRA conference. 
“Therefore in particular in these markets, fast moving markets, we may design more prescriptive and possibly restorative remedies in order to ensure that conditions for effective competition will be fully restored,” Madero said, without elaborating.

502,"December 10, 2019",US: AG Barr wants Big Tech probe finished next year,"


US Attorney General William Barr has signaled he wants to finish the antitrust investigation into US technology giants next year.
“I think it’s important to move quickly on these things as they have a cost to companies,” Barr said. “I’d like to have it completed sometime next year.”
The news may come as a relief for investors in some of America’s biggest tech firms who have been concerned about the damage of a protracted probe. The names of the firms being investigated haven’t been revealed. Some of the biggest tech firms in America are Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook.
Barr was speaking at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council summit in Washington, DC, on Tuesday.
A few months ago, the Justice Department said it would initiate a review of tech firms including social-media giants, online retailers and search platforms. Barr has acted swiftly on President Trump’s wish for tech investigations. “We started in earnest in July. It’s been moving very quickly and we have a very ambitious schedule,” He said.
Barr indicated that the Justice Department is looking into areas beyond anticompetitive practices that could be prosecuted under antitrust law. Other issues include potential bias in search results by Google.
“We are also looking at behaviors across the board and that means other laws,” he said.

503,"December 9, 2019",This Man May Be Big Tech’s Biggest Threat,"
By Steve Lohr, New York Times
At a hearing this summer about the rising power of the country’s biggest tech companies, Representative David Cicilline zeroed in on Amazon. Unhappy with a response from one of the company’s top lawyers, he delivered a biting retort.
“I may remind you, sir: You are under oath,” Mr. Cicilline said.
Tech companies are under various antitrust investigations, including by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. Those inquiries could lead to lawsuits against the companies to enforce existing laws.
But Mr. Cicilline has a more ambitious goal — one that may be the greater threat, in the long run, to Big Tech’s practices and profits. He’s trying to build evidence, and a bipartisan consensus, for changing the laws themselves.
When his party took control of the House this year, Mr. Cicilline, a five-term Rhode Island Democrat, became chairman of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust law. In June, he opened an investigation into possible anticompetitive practices by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.
Under his direction, the panel has held hearings and collected thousands of documents from the companies. The lawmakers have requested countless more records, including emails among top executives.
He has made clear to the companies that he is not messing around. When he found the July testimony of industry witnesses incomplete, Mr. Cicilline sent the companies follow-up questions. His list: 181 questions for Google, 45 for Facebook, 158 for Amazon and 43 for Apple.

504,"December 9, 2019",UK: CMA decision looms over Amazon’s Deliveroo deal,"
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will decide on Wednesday (Dec. 10) if Amazon’s quest to acquire a stake in Deliveroo, among the UK’s most thriving startups, can move forward.
Antitrust concerns caused CMAto freeze the deal between Amazon and Deliveroo in October and will decide if the investigation should continue, Bloomberg reported on Monday (Dec. 9) 
The eCommerce giant bid roughly $500 million for a minority stake in the food-delivery service. 
“The CMA is very interested in tech giants extending their tentacles into other markets,” Alan Davis, a competition lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London, told Bloomberg. Antitrust regulators “are paranoid about it at the moment because they are concerned they have not looked at these mergers enough in the past, like Facebook-WhatsApp.”
EU officials accused Facebook of misleading them when the social media giant acquired WhatsApp in 2014 and changed its data-handling policy. Big Tech is now on the antitrust radar worldwide, with the US having active investigations into Google, Facebook and Amazon. The CMA is also probing Google’s $2.6 billion takeover bid for Looker Data Sciences.
CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli previously stated that Facebook’s Instagram acquisition was an error. The CMA doesn’t generally investigate minority stake deals, but Amazon’s access to massive data likely triggered concerns.
“UK regulators may have some antitrust concerns with the proposed investment,” said Bloomberg intelligence analysts Aitor Ortiz and Diana Gomes. “One of them could be whether Amazon could get access to Deliveroo’s user data, leveraging the delivery giant’s position in other markets besides on-demand restaurant delivery, such as online groceries.”
The stakes are high for Deliveroo, which lost £232 million in 2018 even with global sales up 72 percent. The takeaway startup has already raised $1.53 billion in funding from investors.
Despite numerous acquisitions and international expansion in the delivery sector, Amazon has yet to successfully break-in, closing its UK and US takeaway divisions — Amazon Restaurants — last year.
In August, Deliveroo said it will end its operations in Germany and shift its focus to other markets. The company has been backed by Amazon, where the eCommerce giant invested $575 million in Deliveroo earlier in the year.

505,"December 8, 2019",US: T-Mobile and Sprint head to court today,"
The future of the US wireless industry hinges on a court battle kicking off Monday, December 9, a case that could end with T-Mobile buying Sprint and Dish Network getting the go-ahead to enter the market.
In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Victor Marrero will weigh arguments from a group of states that say he should block the US$26.5-billion Sprint deal because eliminating competition between the two carriers would cause consumer prices to rise. T-Mobile claims the opposite: by combining with Sprint, it could reduce costs and lower prices.
According to the Los Angeles Times, a win for the companies would create a new wireless giant that would overtake AT&T Inc. to become the No. 2 carrier in terms of monthly regular subscribers behind Verizon Communications Inc. A loss would leave Sprint a distant No. 4 in the market, weighed down by a debt load that threatens to cripple the company.
The trial is expected to last two to three weeks, and a decision from District Judge Victor Marrero in the Southern District of New York is expected in February, according to people familiar with the proceeding, reported CNET. Experts and economists from both sides are expected to testify on whether the merger benefits consumers and what the merger will do to competition in the wireless market, as well as Sprint’s prospects for remaining a standalone company.

506,"December 8, 2019",France Plans a Revolution to Rein in the Kings of Big Tech,"
By Cédric O, Wired
During a joint press conference in London with President Emmanuel Macron of France this week, President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on French goods such as champagne, in retaliation for a new tax on large tech companies. As he spoke, Macron’s digital affairs minister, Cédric O, was in Washington, DC, trying to build support for even stronger actions against Google and other tech giants.
“Tech platforms have a footprint in our economies and our democracies that is a huge challenge for public power,” O said, during a visit to WIRED’s offices in San Francisco, one stop on a week-long, cross-country trip that involved meeting lawmakers, regulators, and academics to discuss antitrust tactics. O says French and European ideas about restraining tech’s power are catching on in the US—and that France’s digital services tax is just the start.
Macron signed that new levy into law in July. It takes 3 percent of digital sales from companies with more than €750 million ($829 million) in global revenue and revenues in France of over €25 million ($27 million) in categories such as online ads or ride hailing. Despite the ire it has drawn from tech companies and Trump’s US trade representative, O describes it as a kind of warmup.
“The digital tax is politically and symbolically important, but from an economic and democratic point of view, it is a really, really small part of the problem,” O says. More important? Targeting the biggest tech companies—most of which are American—with new regulations to prevent them stifling competition and damaging democracy. “We’ve designed our regulatory framework for the industrial age, and at some point it’s not relevant any more,” O says.
Unlike presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, O doesn’t want to break up tech companies. He instead quotes a slogan he says he heard this week from the man who used to be America’s top internet regulator, erstwhile Federal Communications Commission chair Tom Wheeler: “Don’t break them up, break them open.”

507,"December 8, 2019",China: Beijing orders gov offices to remove all foreign computer,"


China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years, the Financial Times reports.
The government directive is likely to be a blow to US multinational companies like HP, Dell and Microsoft and mirrors attempts by Washington to limit the use of Chinese technology, as the trade war between the countries turns into a tech cold war.
The Trump administration banned US companies from doing business with Chinese Chinese telecommunications company Huawei earlier this year and in May, Google, Intel and Qualcomm announced they would freeze cooperation with Huawei.
By excluding China from western know-how, the Trump administration has made it clear that the real battle is about which of the two economic superpowers has the technological edge for the next two decades.
This is the first known public directive from Beijing setting specific targets limiting China’s use of foreign technology, though it is part a wider move within China to increase its reliance on domestic technology.
The FT reported that the directive would result in an estimated 20m- to 30m pieces of hardware needing to be replaced and that this work would begin in 2020. Analysts told the FT that 30% of substitutions would take place in 2020, 50% in 2021 and 20% in 2022.

508,"December 3, 2019",Dethroning the Digital Platform Champions,"

By John Pecman (Fasken)1
One has to applaud the success of the so-called “Tech Superstars”, often referred to as “GAFA” (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple). The great innovations they have developed for consumers and businesses alike contribute significantly to Canada’s gross national well-being. Their collective success should be admired both by those of you who believe in the power of capitalism to grow the economy and by those of you that believe the most innovative and efficient companies, those that invest and take risks, should reap the rewards, along with their shareholders, for having tipped the “winner takes all” race. These companies are the champions of today’s digital markets.
Competition Authorities around the world encourage and promote competitive races where there are winners and losers. A fundamental principle of antitrust doctrine is that success ought not to be condemned, even when it leads to large firms which possess market power. To do otherwise would destroy the incentives that drive our free and open economies. It is understood by knowledgeable industrial organization economists that many markets in our economy are naturally concentrated (in Canada, competition laws are monopoly friendly by design, but that is a subject for further commentary). Market concentration is often the result of the competitive process. Increasing concentration in many sectors is a result of growing economies of scale which results in larger, more efficient firms as opposed to smaller ones. Quite rightly, competition authorities worry about, and are empowered to take action against, companies with market power who engage in anti-competitive behavior to maintain or enhance their market power.
Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, once said, “Competition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.”2 Warren Buffet invests in companies which have built impenetrable moats to protect their dominant market positions.3 The major digital platforms are highly concentrated. Notable policymakers around the world, led by Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, and Elizabeth Warren, Democratic presidential nominee in the US, believe this concentration will persist with detrimental consequences for consumers and business. Ms. Warren has famously vowed to break up the so-called ‘Big Tech’ companies as a solution to the market power problem.4
By tipping the platform markets in their favor, Big Tech companies have built moats around their core product lines that are deep and wide. Recently published international studies and reports, such as the final report of the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms have confirmed this view. Digital platforms are winner-take-all markets on account of traditional economic factors which create durable barriers to entry. These factors include: (i) economies of scale and scope (ii) network effects, (iii) consumer behavioral biases, (iv) incumbent data advantages, and (v) strong brands and access to capital.
In view of these powerful winner-take-all factors in the digital platform markets, it would seem unlikely that one or more of the Big Tech incumbent champions can be beaten by newer, deeper-pocketed or even more innovative competitors. For example, Microsoft’s accumulated losses in search have been estimated in the billions of dollars with minimal gains on Google’s dominance. Despite the fact that many dominant technology companies and platforms in the past seemed unassailable (e.g. Microsoft’s dominance of operating systems and browsers), Google overtaking Yahoo in search, and Facebook displacing MySpace in social media, has many politicians, competition authorities, and scholars believing that Big Tech’s platform markets require government intervention, outside the realm of antitrust law, to restore competition.
The Stigler Report has proposed mandating not only an open, but also a common, Application Program Interface (“API”) which would allow different messaging systems to connect to one another – a common API guarantees interoperability and eliminates the network externalities that drive the winner-take-all nature of the social media market. It also proposes changing merger guidelines for digital platforms, strengthening antitrust enforcement and creating a new Digital Authority which would oversee all aspects of digital platforms, similar to the UK’s proposed Digital Markets Unit. Furthermore, the Stigler Report proposes empowering the FTC to: (i) have access to digital platforms’ internal databases and studies, (ii) perform their own independent research on how platforms impact different areas of our society, and (iii) moderate independent researchers’ access to these databases. And if all other solutions fail, it proposes the introduction of fiduciary duties on digital platforms.
In Canada, the application of competition law and policy to Big Tech platforms is slowly making its way on to the government agenda. In September 2017, the Competition Bureau released a discussion paper to engage stakeholders in the topic of big data and competition law to contribute to the debate. In February 2018, the Bureau released its final report, Big Data and Innovation: Key Themes for Competition Policy in Canada, which summarizes the Bureau’s enforcement approach. In its internationally awarded final report, the Bureau, based on its own experiences, noted that firms’ use of big data may raise challenges for competition law enforcement. The Bureau identified the need to adapt its tools and methods to this evolving area, while its antitrust investigations and analysis will continue to be guided by its traditional framework for market definition, market power and competitive effects.
A few days following the Bureau’s pronouncement that the Competition Act5 was fit for purpose to tackle Big Tech, the Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada called for a modernization of competition policy with respect to big data.6 Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development announced a new Digital Charter in May 2019 including among its 10 principles “Transparency, Portability and Interoperability.”7 A Government white paper to reform Canadian privacy law proposes a new general data portability right.8 In addition, a recent report from the Senate Committee on Banking Trade and Commerce specifically recommended that a consumer data portability right be added to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act9 and examines the merits of Open Banking.10
Competition authorities and experts, including the Bureau in its report recommending Open Banking,11 the UK’s Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel,12 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,13 and the Stigler Report suggest personal data portability encourages new entrants, enables innovation and enhances consumer welfare. In the EU, a regulatory approach has been taken to consumer data rights through the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation14 which creates a legal right for consumers to port their data.
It appears that the Tech Superstars have developed and maintained their dominant positions principally through innovation and popular products. A regulatory approach which mandates data-sharing with competitors or other companies in the ecosystem is the first step being taken, or proposed, by governments to temper their durable market power. Interestingly, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Twitter launched their own Data Transfer project in 2018 to allow data portability between multiple online platforms.15
Will data mobility designed to level the playing field chill innovation and investment by the incumbent firms? Will consumers benefit from lower prices, quality improvements, expanded choices, and accelerated innovation as the economic textbooks suggest will transpire with increased competition? As the championship belts are being removed from Big Tech and governments ponder improved antitrust laws to address the market power challenge, policymakers must strike the right balance between taking steps to prevent anti-competitive behavior and over-regulation that chills innovation and dynamic competition.

509,"December 2, 2019",“United States v. Apple” Review: In Competition We Trust,"
By L. Gordon Crovitz, Wall Street Journal
Politicians and social critics who worry about “the curse of bigness”—and vow to rewrite antitrust law to break up Facebook and Google—forget what happened the last time the government used the law against a Silicon Valley company. In 2012 the government successfully sued Apple for daring to compete with Amazon in selling e-books. The unintended result was not exactly a victory for the consumer or for competition: the continued dominance of Kindle, Amazon’s e-book format and reading device; increased e-book prices; and suppressed e-book innovation.
Chris Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University, explains in “United States v. Apple: Competition in America” what he sees as confusion about antitrust law. His analysis can be helpful—he notes the long history of companies invoking claims of “predatory pricing” as a cudgel against more efficient competitors and stresses that consumers often benefit when industries and companies are driven out of business—but he is confused about the case itself.
His thesis is that Apple’s entry into the e-book market was so clearly a violation of antitrust law that critics of the case must not believe in competition. But critics object to an interpretation of antitrust law that ended up punishing Apple for introducing a new pricing approach—an approach that is now common in every other area of online sales. Mr. Sagers forgets the guardrail rule of antitrust: Don’t bring cases against innovations that create more competition.
Consumers were delighted when Amazon launched its Kindle e-reader in 2007, and book publishers were happy to sell books in digital form. But there was an unusual feature. In its selling of e-books, Amazon operated according to the same pricing arrangement that had governed the sale of print books—that is, it bought e-books wholesale and chose its own price for them, just as bookstores had long done with print books. Brick-and-mortar bookstores needed this pricing flexibility for many reasons, not least to clear their inventory of unsold books by means of lower prices. The arrangement let Amazon sell e-books for years as a loss-leader—at the low price of $9.99—to boost profitable sales of its Kindle devices.

510,"December 2, 2019",EU: Facebook tells regulators “data is complicated”,"
Facebook has a message for regulators and policy makers concerned about the company’s harvesting of user information: don’t treat data as a simple resource like oil.Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs and communications, said Monday that antitrust officials should be careful not to treat data like other commodities that could be monopolized, but rather as something more complex that can be shared and kept at the same time.
“We think it is legitimate to ask profound questions about how data is held,” Mr. Clegg said at a briefing with journalists on Monday. But he added that officials defining what he called the orthodoxy of competition policy should “reconfigure old concepts” and “relinquish themselves of the idea that [using data] is the same as using finite resources in finite, one-off ways.”
Mr. Clegg’s statement comes as tech companies including Facebook and Alphabet Google face growing antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic for their control and use of user data. In the US, both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing the companies.
The European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust enforcer, is also in the early stages of probes into how both Google and Facebook gather and monetize data about their users for advertising purposes, according to a commission spokeswoman.

511,"November 27, 2019",US: DOJ ends wireless carriers’ probe with no charges,"


The US ended an antitrust probe, without filing charges, into whether wireless carriers steered technical standards to make it harder for customers to switch providers, reported the New York Times. 
The Justice Department in 2018 demanded information from AT&T, Verizon Communications and other US companies as well as from GSMA, the international trade group that manages standards for the technology, called eSIM.
Smartphones with an eSIM, or embedded subscriber identity module, let users store multiple carrier profiles on the same device. That makes it easy to switch between their networks, although only one can be used at a time.
Smartphones with eSIMs are common in many countries but less often used in the US. The government’s inquiry focused on whether American telecom companies might have steered GSMA’s standards-writing process, making it harder for subscribers to switch wireless companies. The department’s 2018 inquiry revived a previous information-gathering process that had wrapped up in 2016.
The department said Wednesday the group and its carrier members “used an unbalanced standard-setting process, with procedures that stacked the deck in their favor” with provisions that limited competition among networks. But antitrust officials stopped short of filing any charges.
Apple  and Google owner Alphabet which make devices with eSIM technology, pushed for more leeway to design smartphones with flexible SIMs.
The Justice Department issued a “business review letter” to GSMA that said the London-based group’s updated procedures for managing eSIM standards would comply with antitrust law.

512,"November 26, 2019",US: Delrahim says Big Tech probe focused on abuse of data,"
The Department of Justice’s investigation into online platforms is focused on the possibility that tech firms could use data they’ve gathered from customers to block competitors from markets they manage, according to the agency’s top antitrust official.
“If we found that they had market power in a specific, you know, in a defined market, and they have data that they could use to prevent a competitor from challenging that market? Then that could be a violation, yes, absolutely,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim told the Washington Examiner, referring to big tech corporations such as Facebook and Google.
The “defined markets” in question, Delrahim said, could be the search industry or social media. “Our investigation is focused on” the potential abuse of data by online platforms, he said.
Delrahim also noted that the DOJ was “trying to identify what other [harmful] conduct could go on in any of these, by any of these companies.” 
The investigation on the use of data could put increased scrutiny on big tech companies that are already under significant pressure from Congress, regulatory agencies, and the public at large.
“This definitely seems like a trend emerging, of a focus by [Delrahim] and others on zero-price markets and the value of data,” said John Newman, a DOJ antitrust lawyer during the Obama administration and an associate professor of law at the University of Miami. “I think it’s a good sign, and I hope to see future development.”

513,"November 21, 2019",EU: Vestager takes aim at “biopower” of tech giants,"
Global tech giants have been sowing the seeds of an economy predicated on “biopower,” in an attempt to “set their own standards and conditions” amid the EU’s attempts to rein in their dominance, the bloc’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview.

Vestager, who will also be responsible for “making Europe fit for the digital age”’ as part of her upcoming mandate as an Executive Vice-President, also revealed that the European Commission is in talks with the French competition authorities in order to examine whether a further investigation into Google’s stance on the EU’s copyright directive is necessary.
The news comes following French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent request for competition authorities to probe Google’s recent changes of service that will result in the company avoiding the legal obligation to remunerate press publishers for the displaying of links to online articles in search results.
“We’re in contact with the French competition authorities, in order to see what would they do, to see if they would want to handle the question or if we should have a look,” Vestager said, adding that the objective of modernising the EU’s copyright rules was to ensure than online content creators “should be remunerated.”

514,"November 19, 2019",Australia: Digital takeovers may harm consumers says Sims,"
Takeovers of smaller rivals by digital platforms, including their data sets, may pose a threat to consumers’ choice and privacy, said Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chair Rod Sims.
Mr Sims was speaking at the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC) Conference on the ACCC’s perspectives on consumer welfare in the data economy.
“Few consumers are fully informed of, nor can they effectively control, how their data is going to be used and shared. There are further concerns when the service they sign up to is taken over by another business,” said Mr Sims.
Mr Sims raised these issues in relation to Google’s recently announced proposed acquisition of Fitbit.
“The change in data collection policies, when a company like Fitbit transfers its data to Google, creates a very uncertain world for consumers who shared very personal information about their health to Fitbit under a certain set of privacy terms,” said Mr Sims.
At the time of Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, DoubleClick reportedly denied that the data it collects through its system for serving ads would be combined with Google’s search data. Eight years later, Google updated its privacy policy and removed a commitment not to combine Doubleclick data with personally identifiable data held by Google.
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp, Facebook claimed it was unable to establish reliable matching between Facebook users and WhatsApp users’ accounts. Two years later, WhatsApp updated its terms of service and privacy policy, indicating it could link WhatsApp users’ phone numbers with Facebook users’ identities.
“Given the history of digital platforms making statements as to what they intend to do with data and what they actually do down the track, it is a stretch to believe any commitment Google makes in relation Fitbit users’ data will still be in place five years from now.
“Clearly, personal health data is an increasingly valuable commodity so it is important when consumers sign up to a particular health platform their original privacy choices are respected and their personal data is protected even if that company is sold.”
Research from the ACCC inquiry showed around 80% of users considered digital platforms tracking their online behavior to create profiles, and also the sharing their personal information with an unknown third party, is a misuse of their information.
Facebook’s recent announcement of its planned offering of a cryptocurrency Libra is also a potential cause for concern, said Mr Sims.
“Here we have an organization, whose lifeblood is to monetize data, getting into the financial services industry,” said Mr Sims.
“A lack of clear information about how their data will be handled reduces consumers’ ability to make informed choices based on that data.
“During our DPI we found a lack of consumer protection and effective deterrence of poor data practises have undermined consumer’s ability to choose products.
“Vague, long and complex data policies contribute to this substantial disconnect between how consumers think their data should be treated and how it is actually treated,” said Mr Sims.
“Transparency and inadequate disclosure issues involving digital platforms and consumer data were a major focus of our Inquiry, and remain one of the ACCC’s top priorities.”

515,"November 18, 2019",US: Big Tech antitrust examination by AGs gathers steam,"
Antitrust headlines dominated the regulatory sphere this past week – focused, of course, on marquee names such as Facebook and Google.
In one salvo, lawmakers in the US House of Representatives said antitrust regulators should take action against larger tech firms, which typically evaded much oversight at the expense of smaller players.
As reported by Reuters and elsewhere, members of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee expressed frustration over the acquisitive pace seen by the tech firms.
At a hearing of the antitrust subcommittee on November 13, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice, said they were focusing on how personalized advertising transactions actually work.
“By understanding these competitive dynamics, we can understand how the market leaders have monopoly power, how they exercise that monopoly power and whether the source of that power is for merit-based competition or the source of that power is exclusionary,” Delrahim said.
The DOJ has been looking into Big Tech firms, while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating Facebook and Amazon.
In terms of individual companies, Google was singled out as subcommittee Rep. David Cicilline said deals such as the US$2.1 Fitbit bid showed that “the hubris of the executive team to pursue an acquisition of this size while under federal and state antitrust investigations is astonishing.”
And Google, of course, may be facing investigations of a wider scope, as the antitrust investigation will be expanded beyond advertising to include search and Android businesses. As has been widely reported, back in September, 50 attorneys general announced an investigation into whether Google has abused its position in the online advertising market.
The investigation is being led by the Attorney General of Texas Ken Paxton, and involves 48 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico.
This time around, the AGs are reportedly in the process of preparing subpoenas known as civil investigating demands for the expanded push to examine the search and Android businesses. The subpoenas may look for materials spanning emails and strategy documents.
Outside the US
Beyond US shores, Nippon.com reported that a Japanese government panel last week reaffirmed a plan to put tougher regulations in place that would govern the online shopping platforms run by technology firms.
The site reported that the “future investment panel,” which is chaired by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said companies that should be examined include Amazon, Z Holdings (formerly Yahoo! Japan Corp.) and Rakuten. Under the terms of the proposed regulations, the firms would be required to disclose how they decide search result rankings and report their operational status. Further details will be worked out next year, according to reports. Under scrutiny, too, has been the alleged practice of companies that pay fees to the firms having their products ranked higher than would otherwise be seen.
Crypto, Too
In the cryptocurrency arena, the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Kenneth Blanco said on Friday, November 15, that there will be strict implementation of new rules that would force crypto exchanges, marketplaces and digital wallets to identify their customers. That identification would take place above a certain monetary threshold, according to a report by Reuters.
As reported in this space last week, one part of the anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is the “travel rule,” which compels exchanges to disclose identities of recipients and receivers for money transfers of US$3,000 or higher.
“It [travel rule] applies to CVCs [convertible virtual currencies], and we expect that you will comply, period,” Blanco said. “That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new.”
The amount of money laundering may exceed US$4.3 billion this year, according to reports.

516,"November 18, 2019",US: FTC to review antitrust laws as a result of tech probes,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is looking at whether the legal thresholds to bring antitrust suits need to be modified to confront today’s biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google, reported Bloomberg Law.
Enforcers at the Commission are taking “a fresh look” at the primary lens used to bring an antitrust violation, called the consumer welfare standard, FTC Chairman Joe Simons said November 18 at an American Bar Association conference in Washington. 
According to Bloomberg, under the consumer welfare standard, the de facto analysis used by federal antitrust enforcers, a merger or anti-competitive conduct, like price-fixing, is an antitrust violation if it results in direct harm to consumers, such as higher prices. Critics have said that standard doesn’t account for the fact that most of the services Facebook, Google, and other tech platforms offer to consumers come at no cost. 
The Commission, which has publicly disclosed it’s reviewing Facebook Inc. for potential antitrust violations, plans to review the consumer welfare to see if there are “alternatives,” Simons said. 
“We expect to have some output on this topic,” Simons added. He did not elaborate on a specific date. 
Simons also said the Commission is conducting multiple probes, but he didn’t name any additional companies. 
The commissioner’s latest remarks come after Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, said November 18 at the same conference that the current antitrust laws are “flexible” enough to deal with new technologies. 
Rosen, who is overseeing the DOJ’s probes into tech platforms, said antitrust isn’t a “panacea” for every competition problem and that government’s investigation will take into account non antitrust concerns including consumer protection and public safety. 
Simons also said the FTC plans to release new “commentary” on how the Commission reviews vertical mergers, in which two companies in different parts of a supply chain combine. Such guidance will state how the Commission will “deal” with nascent competitors, which includes when dominant platforms buy emerging startups, Simons said.

517,"November 18, 2019",The Limits of Australia’s Digital Platforms Inquiry,"
By Dirk Auer (International Center for Law and Economics)1
In July of 2019, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) concluded its high-profile 1.5-year investigation into the effect of digital platforms on competition in media and advertising markets.2
The ACCC’s Final Report3 claims that competition is “not working” in the media, communications, advertising and other markets it investigated,4 and that substantial regulatory and legislative changes are necessary to solve — and would solve — the problems caused by ineffective competition.5 These changes include mandated “platform neutrality” obligations,6 tighter merger rules,7 firm- and industry-level codes of conduct over which the ACCC would have a discretionary oversight,8 and the adoption of more stringent privacy rules.9 The ACCC’s proposals would thus tilt the scales of competition and regulatory enforcement in its favor.
However, as discussed below, the premise that markets are failing is not well supported by the ACCC’s report.10 Moreover, even if the ACCC’s premise were accurate, its conclusions miss the bigger picture:: Government intervention is appropriate only if it produces net social benefits. The fact that a market does not satisfy some idealized benchmark (for instance, because firms have some degree of market power) is irrelevant if regulation merely exacerbates the perceived failure or creates new and greater costs.11 Yet the ACCC Final Report almost entirely omits consideration of possible regulatory failure. It is thus of little practical value in evaluating the merits of potential regulatory interventions.
The Overlooked Costs of Enforced Platform “Neutrality”
The ACCC Final Report puts forward many recommendations to address perceived competitive concerns in digital platform industries. These include merger law reforms, and changes to search engine and internet browser defaults.12 In doing so, it disregards traditional tools of competition policy in favor of a much looser approach. Most notably, the ACCC relies upon a piecemeal market definition exercise and departs from established competition law theories of harm. This methodological frailty also ripples through the report’s recommendations. Indeed, the report does not sufficiently defend its conclusions that mandated platform neutrality and the establishment of a digital platforms branch would alleviate the concerns identified by the ACCC.
The report notably claims that Google controls a large share of the “general search advertising” and “vertical search advertising” markets.13 It similarly asserts that Facebook commands a 51 percent share of “display advertising.”14 However, the report fails to put forward a coherent — let alone quantitative — argument that these are indeed relevant markets for competition policy purposes (as opposed to, for example, a market encompassing all online advertising). Readers are left to guess why it is that large players, such as Amazon, as well as the massive range of offline advertising and marketing outlets, are excluded from this analysis. It is true that the report mentions — and then dismisses — the possibility of competition between online and offline advertising.15 But the report’s means of distinguishing between the two markets does not turn on the competition-relevant criteria of demand and supply substitution; rather, it turns on the differences between the specific matching mechanisms employed by each.16 Further gradations (e.g. between online search and display advertising) turn on similarly inapposite characteristics.17
Likewise, the ACCC’s “theory of harm” amounts to little more than an observation that digital platform markets have features that purportedly complicate market entry by rivals. For instance, the ACCC concludes that “consumer inertia” and “default bias” cause users to stick with Google’s search engine and browser, rather than switch to its rival’s products.18
In fact, it is likely that a majority of consumers simply prefer Google’s browser and search offerings. In the desktop environment, Google’s ChromeOS has less than 1 percent market share in Australia, whereas Microsoft’s Windows has a market share of 69 percent and Apple’s iOS a 24 percent market share.19 The default browser on Windows is Edge, while the default browser on iOS is Safari, yet Chrome is chosen by about 70 percent of users in Australia.20 Meanwhile, about 90 percent of desktop searches in Australia are performed using Google.21
Given the demonstrable preference for Google’s browser and search engine, forcing consumers to go through a choice screen may at best be a waste of time, and at worse a paralyzing choice between indiscernible options.22
In spite of having failed to demonstrate actual harm to competition or consumer welfare, the ACCC calls for the imposition of stringent “platform neutrality” obligations. Most notably, it would require Google to provide users of the Android platform with a choice of internet browsers and search engines, rather than make its own services the default option.23 The ACCC would also investigate whether similar obligations should be imposed upon other digital platforms, via a newly established digital platforms branch.24
Unfortunately, the ACCC mostly ignores the potential costs of platform neutrality obligations, as well as the potential rent-seeking opportunities created by a branch dedicated to digital platforms. From an error-cost perspective, it is thus unlikely that the ACCC Final Report achieves the right balance between over and under-enforcement.
Micromanaging the News Industry
Much of the same can be said about the ACCC’s analysis of platforms’ dealings with traditional news outlets. In a nutshell, the ACCC is concerned with the bargaining power of small media firms (or lack thereof) relative to global internet platforms, and the potential effect that these platforms may have on the market for journalism.25 To address these alleged problems, the report recommends that platforms should be made to establish regulator-approved codes of conduct that would bind them in their future dealings with media outlets.26 It also recommends the introduction of fiscal policies that would prop up Australia’s struggling local journalism industry.27
Even if one accepts the ACCC’s assertion that there is a market failure in the provision of certain kinds of content, it is far from certain that its recommendations would produce the desired outcome. Take the ACCC’s rosy view of local journalism. The report hardly considers the possibility that the relative decline of local journalism has not been caused by online platforms (correlation is not causation).28 Nor does it envisage that local newspapers may no longer be the optimal way to stay informed about local events. Finally, it is not clear that shifting additional revenue towards Australia’s struggling local news industry will necessarily lead to the type of content that the ACCC deems essential for Australian consumers.
To make matters worse, the report also fails to grapple with the risk of regulatory failure. Subsidizing local news and favoring public broadcast channels raises the prospect of “white elephant” spending — that is, of public expenditures that exceed the social value they create.29 The ACCC’s fear that local news is being underprovided is not set against a relevant economic benchmark. Instead, the report merely observes that local news coverage has declined compared to its previous highs.30 But this is hardly a convincing argument. All industries go through ebbs and flows. Nor is there any basis for presuming that previously established practices were optimal — especially when they were established under very different technological conditions. Accordingly, if the government acts on the ACCC’s calls to subsidize local news and boost public broadcasting, the resultant expenditures may well harm taxpayers through waste rather than create socially valuable pieces of news.
Finally, the ACCC’s plans create unavoidable incentives for rent-seeking. Rivals will surely attempt to game the approval process for platform codes of conduct. And decisions regarding the allocation of public funding will also be vulnerable to undue influence. Under the ACCC’s proposals, the assessment criteria for grants would be designed by a committee comprising journalists, academics, and former industry participants.31 But allowing industry insiders to play an active role in the allocation of grants is problematic. For instance, it is far from clear that these stakeholders will be willing to embrace the potential disruption that digital platforms may bring to the local news industry.
Privacy Regulation is No Free Lunch
The report also touches upon the topic of online privacy. But while its recommendations are very similar to the privacy regulations recently introduced by the European Union32 and California,33 the ACCC overlooks the tremendous compliance costs created by those regulations. Yet its own recommendations would likely entail proportionally similar costs.
For instance, it has been estimated that American S&P 500 companies and UK FTSE 350 companies alone spent a combined total of $9 billion to comply with the EU’s GDPR in the year running up to its entry into force.34 Likewise, a survey of American companies with over 500 employees found that three out of four planned to allocate over $1 million to GDPR compliance.35
Things are similar for California’s CCPA. One estimate places the upfront costs of compliance with the CCPA (including lost advertising revenue) at $24.5 billion — even as it identifies comparably modest benefits of roughly $6-9 billion.36 Another survey estimated that 70 percent of firms would pay at least $100,000 to comply with the CCPA, while a further 20 percent would spend more than $1 million.37
And compliance costs are not the only problem. One study found that, following the GDPR’s entry into force, weekly venture capital deals in the EU decreased by 17.6 percent, compared to the US, and the amount raised in an average deal decreased by 39.6 percent.38 Furthermore, it has been argued that data regulations may have a significant impact on competition between platforms, arguably limiting the entry of smaller firms, entrenching established incumbents, and disincentivizing increases in product quality on privacy dimensions.39
Conclusion: The Limits of the ACCC’s Digital Platform Inquiry
In his groundbreaking “The Limits of Antitrust,” Frank Easterbrook famously argued that the task of competition enforcers and regulators is not crudely to maximize certain policy preferences.40 Instead, their task is to maintain a delicate balance between the societal harms of anticompetitive conduct on the one hand and, on the other, the administrative and societal costs of unavoidable, if occasional, enforcement errors that invariably follow even modest enforcement activity.
The ACCC Final Report fails to grapple with this complex tradeoff. While it claims to show pervasive market failures throughout the digital economy, it ignores the specter of regulatory failure. This goes against a commendable trend that has seen Australian competition enforcement move towards a more effects-based system.41
The ACCC’s lackadaisical assessment of regulatory costs is all-the-more troubling given that its report focuses on an extremely dynamic industry. What is only a small regulatory cost today could severely hamper competition in the future. Yet, rather than reconsider how ham-fisted regulation might be throttling traditional media firms, or how it may further entrench today’s dominant technology platforms, the ACCC advocates more of the same.
Could excessive media regulation be preventing traditional media from competing against digital platforms (and might the ACCC’s recommendations have a similar effect in the future)? Has this type of regulation really produced net social benefits? And could ill-designed regulation act as a barrier to entry? By almost completely ignoring these questions, the ACCC Final Report all but guaranteed that its conclusions would be heavily skewed in favor of increased government intervention — and potentially ineffective or even harmful intervention, at that.

518,"November 18, 2019",US: FTC to review antitrust laws as a result of tech probes,"


The Federal Trade Commission is looking at whether the legal thresholds to bring antitrust suits need to be modified to confront today’s biggest tech companies, such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet’s Google, reported Bloomberg Law.
Enforcers at the commission are taking “a fresh look” at the primary lens used to bring an antitrust violation, called the consumer welfare standard, FTC Chairman Joe Simons said Nov. 18 at an American Bar Association conference in Washington. 
According to Bloomberg, under the consumer welfare standard, the de facto analysis used by federal antitrust enforcers, a merger or anti-competitive conduct, like price-fixing, is an antitrust violation if it results in direct harm to consumers, such as higher prices. Critics have said that standard doesn’t account for the fact that most of the services Facebook, Google, and other tech platforms offer to consumers come at no cost. 
The commission, which has publicly disclosed it’s reviewing Facebook Inc. for potential antitrust violations, plans to review the consumer welfare to see if there are “alternatives,” Simons said. 
“We expect to have some output on this topic,” Simons added. He did not elaborate on a specific date. 
Simons also said the commission is conducting multiple probes, but he didn’t name any additional companies. 
The commissioner’s latest remarks come after Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, said Nov. 18 at the same conference that the current antitrust laws are “flexible” enough to deal with new technologies. 
Rosen, who is overseeing the DOJ’s probes into tech platforms, said antitrust isn’t a “panacea” for every competition problem and that government’s investigation will take into account non antitrust concerns including consumer protection and public safety. 
Simons also said the FTC plans to release new “commentary” on how the commission reviews vertical mergers, in which two companies in different parts of a supply chain combine. Such guidance will state how the commission will “deal” with nascent competitors, which includes when dominant platforms buy emerging startups, Simons said.

519,"November 18, 2019",US: Big Tech antitrust examination by AGs gathers steam,"
Antitrust headlines dominated the regulatory sphere this past week – focused, of course, on marquee names such as Facebook and Google.
In one salvo, lawmakers in the US House of Representatives said antitrust regulators should take action against larger tech firms, which typically evaded much oversight at the expense of smaller players.
As reported by Reuters and elsewhere, members of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee expressed frustration over the acquisitive pace seen by the tech firms.
At a hearing of the antitrust subcommittee on Nov. 13, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice, said they were focusing on how personalized advertising transactions actually work.
“By understanding these competitive dynamics, we can understand how the market leaders have monopoly power, how they exercise that monopoly power and whether the source of that power is for merit-based competition or the source of that power is exclusionary,” Delrahim said.
The DOJ has been looking into Big Tech firms, while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating Facebook and Amazon.
In terms of individual companies, Google was singled out as subcommittee Rep. David Cicilline said deals such as the $2.1 Fitbit bid showed that “the hubris of the executive team to pursue an acquisition of this size while under federal and state antitrust investigations is astonishing.”
And Google, of course, may be facing investigations of a wider scope, as the antitrust investigation will be expanded beyond advertising to include search and Android businesses. As has been widely reported, back in September,50 attorneys general announced an investigation into whether Google has abused its position in the online advertising market.
The investigation is being led by the Attorney General of Texas Ken Paxton, and involves 48 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico.
This time around, the AGs are reportedly in the process of preparing subpoenas known as civil investigating demands for the expanded push to examine the search and Android businesses. The subpoenas may look for materials spanning emails and strategy documents.
Outside the US
Beyond US shores, Nippon.com reported that a Japanese government panel last week reaffirmed a plan to put tougher regulations in place that would govern the online shopping platforms run by technology firms.
The site reported that the “future investment panel,” which is chaired by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said companies that should be examined include Amazon, Z Holdings (formerly Yahoo! Japan Corp.) and Rakuten. Under the terms of the proposed regulations, the firms would be required to disclose how they decide search result rankings and report their operational status. Further details will be worked out next year, according to reports. Under scrutiny, too, has been the alleged practice of companies that pay fees to the firms having their products ranked higher than would otherwise be seen.
Crypto, Too
In the cryptocurrency arena, the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Kenneth Blanco said on Friday (Nov. 15) that there will be strict implementation of new rules that would force crypto exchanges, marketplaces and digital wallets to identify their customers. That identification would take place above a certain monetary threshold, according to a report by Reuters.
As reported in this space last week, one part of the anti-money laundering (AML) regulations is the “travel rule,” which compels exchanges to disclose identities of recipients and receivers for money transfers of $3,000 or higher.
“It [travel rule] applies to CVCs [convertible virtual currencies], and we expect that you will comply, period,” Blanco said. “That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new.”
The amount of money laundering may exceed $4.3 billion this year, according to reports.

520,"November 17, 2019",Microsoft’s Antitrust Scars,"
By Eric Newcomer, Bloomberg
Hi all, it’s Eric. Two decades ago, Microsoft Corp. fended off the U.S. government’s best effort to break the company into pieces. But even as it kept regulators from cleaving it apart, Microsoft seemed to fall into something of an antitrust-induced stupor. According to one popular theory, the company’s executives became overly worried about what their counterparts in legal might say, slowing innovation. 
Today’s technology giants are staring down their own antitrust dilemma and seem resolved not to get too fussed about it. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are venturing into all sorts of industries even as the regulars are bearing down. It’s almost like they’ve studied Microsoft’s regulator-abetted lethargy and are making sure to avoid it.
Google recently announced it would pay $2.1 billion to buy Fitbit, the wearable device maker, and is also building a search engine for a hospital network, scooping up healthcare data on “millions of people across 21 states” in the process. (Google says there’s nothing nefarious about the effort, dubbed “Project Nightingale.”) It’d like to be your banker, too. This week, the Wall Street Journal revealed Google’s plans to create checking accounts in a partnership with Citigroup Inc.

521,"November 14, 2019",US: House antitrust chair suggests halting major tech mergers until after probes end,"
According to Politico, the House lawmaker leading a sweeping investigation into tech competition on Wednesday, November 13, floated the prospect of preventing major Silicon Valley firms from making acquisitions until the federal government’s top two antitrust enforcers are finished with their own probes into the sector.
Rep. David Cicilline, who chairs the House antitrust subcommittee spearheading a congressional review of possible anti-competitive conduct in tech, at a hearing pressed Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Federal Trade Commission Chairman (FTC) Joe Simons on whether they’d support a “merger moratorium for dominant platforms” while they investigate industry giants.
Cicilline on Wednesday suggested any big tech deals that can’t be immediately shown to promote competition could be put on hold. “In this context where there is significant harm being imposed upon consumers, it seems like something worth considering,” he said. 
Delrahim, whose department announced a broad investigation into the online marketplace that has in part targeted Google, expressed openness to the idea, though he suggested that “a lot that can be done short of a merger moratorium.” 
“I don’t have a clear administration position on that, but we’d be delighted to explore that with you,” he told Cicilline. 
Simons, meanwhile, said the FTC is already reviewing consummated tech mergers as part of its own enforcement efforts, but did not comment on the prospects of a moratorium.

522,"November 14, 2019",Japan: Yahoo and Line to merge,"


The operators of Yahoo sites in Japan and popular messaging app Line seek to merge into an internet group that spans finance, retail and other services, Nikkei reported.
SoftBank, which owns 45% of Yahoo Japan parent Z Holdings, and South Korea’s Naver, which owns 73% of Line, are in the final stage of negotiations, sources said. They aim to reach a basic agreement by the end of the month.
SoftBank, the mobile arm of SoftBank which controls Z Holdings, said in a statement on Thursday morning that it is “discussing various possibilities including [the merger]”.
The deal would create a mega-platform with more than 100 million users across financial services, e-commerce and more, reshaping Japan’s digital landscape and forming a bigger competitor to American and Chinese internet groups.

523,"November 11, 2019",US: DOJ: Current antitrust legislation can apply to tech firms,"
Current antitrust laws are “flexible enough” to handle issues caused by technology firms, said Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ).
“Some have suggested changing the antitrust laws, creating new agencies or even regulating the conduct of some firms … it bears repeating that our existent framework is flexible enough to detect harm in any industry and emerging ones,” Delrahim said at an antitrust conference at Harvard Law School hosted by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA). The membership roster for the CCIA includes Amazon, Facebook, and Google, among others.
Against a backdrop of comprehensive inquiries, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are being criticized by lawmakers for debating which agency should probe which tech company.
Delrahim also cautioned that there could be competition concerns by regulators over data collected by tech companies.
European antitrust regulators have expressed concerns similar to Delrahim’s comments and have already punished tech companies for using consumer data in anti-competitive ways.
“Although privacy fits primarily within the realm of consumer protection law, it would be a grave mistake to believe that privacy concerns can never play a role in antitrust analysis,” Delrahim said.
It was first announced in August that the US government was working with state attorneys general to probe online platforms for possible antitrust violations. The US Justice Department’s Antitrust Division announced it could ask Silicon Valley companies for documents in its investigation of Big Tech’s market power of major technology.
Previously approved tech company acquisitions are also part of the antitrust review, which was announced in July.
While the DOJ never mentioned any company by name, its concerns are aligned with Google’s search, Facebook’s dominance in social media, and Amazon’s position as the country’s eCommerce leader.

525,"November 10, 2019",US: DOJ antitrust chief outlines role of data in antitrust review,"
The Justice Department’s top antitrust official warned Big Tech companies Friday (November 8) that the government could pursue them for anticompetitive behavior related to their troves of user data, including for cutting off data access to competitors.
“Antitrust enforcers cannot turn a blind eye to the serious competition questions that digital markets have raised,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim told an antitrust conference hosted by CPI at Harvard Law School.
Delrahim did not name any specific companies, but his office is investigating companies including Google while the Federal Trade Commission probes Facebook. The House Judiciary Committee is also conducting an inquiry looks at those two companies plus Amazon and Apple.
“Most notably, enforcers must confront the reality that data insights in the digital economy are combined across the ecosystem of the internet sometimes in ways that transcend product improvement and impact consumer choice altogether,” Delrahim said, according to prepared remarks for a speech at an antitrust conference hosted by CPI at Harvard Law School.
Delrahim said some of the most interesting and alarming legal issues raised by the rise of the digital economy are in the “collection, aggregation and commercial use of consumer data,” which he called “analogous to a new currency” reported the Washington Post. 
He said his office is studying “the ways market power can manifest in industries where data plays a key role,” particularly when large amounts of data are amassed that are “quite personal and unique in nature” and offers insight into “the most intimate aspects of human choice and behavior, including personal health, emotional well-being, civic engagement and financial fitness.

526,"November 10, 2019",EU: Apple Pay may be stifling payments competition,"
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said numerous grievances have been filed with the European Commission concerning Apple Pay and its negative effect on competition in the payments space, CNBC reported.

“We get many, many concerns when it comes to Apple Pay for pure competition reasons,” Vestager said on Thursday (Nov. 7) during a press conference at Web Summit 2020 in Lisbon, Portugal. “People see that it becomes increasingly difficult to compete in the market for easy payments.”
The European Commission is also reviewing Apple’s response to an antitrust accusation filed by Spotify over Apple’s App Store terms.
Under Vestager, Europe has been a leader in the charge against Big Tech.
A formal antitrust probe into Amazon was launched in July concerning how the eCommerce giant functions as both a merchant and a marketplace. The commission is also “in the process of receiving information” about Facebook’s Marketplace, Vestager said.
“It is quite a substantial set of questions we’ve been asking about Marketplace and how that works,” she said, adding that Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency Libra is also being investigated.
“We have quite deep concerns about what would be the effect of Libra if ever launched,” she said.
Vestager is widely seen as a strict and meticulous enforcer who has taken on Big Tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon without fear, and has imposed harsh penalties on them, as well as taking them to task for perceived abuses of power.
She’s been at the head of a number of newsworthy events, including the investigation of Apple over Irish tax breaks, which discovered that the company avoided upwards of $14.5 billion in taxes.
She also brought three antitrust fines against Google. One was for $2.72 billion for abusing powers in its search engine, one was for $5 billion for taking advantage of Android’s market power, and one was for $1.69 billion for favoring itself in its ad network.

527,"November 10, 2019",Big Tech Acquisitions and the Potential Competition Doctrine: The Case of Facebook,"
By Mark Glick & Catherine Ruetschlin(University of Utah)
The Big Tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, have individually and collectively engaged in an unprecedented number of acquisitions. When a dominant firm purchases a start-up that could be a future entrant and thereby increase competitive rivalry, it raises a potential competition issue. Unfortunately, the antitrust law of potential competition mergers is ill-equipped to address tech mergers. We contend that the Chicago School’s assumptions and policy prescriptions hobbled antitrust law and policy on potential competition mergers. We illustrate this problem with the example of Facebook. Facebook has engaged in 90 completed acquisitions in its short history (documented in the Appendix to this paper). Many antitrust commentators have focused on the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions as cases of mergers that have reduced potential competition. We show the impotence of the potential competition doctrine applied to these two acquisitions. We suggest that the remedy for Chicago School damage to the potential competition doctrine is a return to an empirically tractable structural approach to potential competition mergers.

The DOJ’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, confirmed that he has spoken with President Donald Trump, but said the president doesn’t call him up directly to discuss topics like the department’s controversial effort to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, reported CNBC.

Delrahim’s office is reportedly leading several antitrust investigations in the tech industry and earlier this year announced a broad review of tech power.

532,"November 6, 2019",Germany’s Pressing Ahead:  The Proposal for a Reformed Competition Act,"

By Rupprecht Podszun & Fabian Brauckmann (Heinrich Heine University)1
Germany’s Ministry of Economics has published its draft for the 10th amendment of the German competition act, the Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (“GWB”). While the starting point for the amendment is the implementation of the ECN+ Directive public attention focuses on the rules for digital players. In this contribution, we give an overview regarding the most important changes to be expected. The draft bill, that has been published in the blog D’Kart,2 is supposed to enter into the legislative process soon. People responsible in the Ministry of Economics and Energy expect the bill to be passed in the first half of 2020.
While former amendments of the German competition act were largely of a rather technical nature and did not arouse public interest so much, this is different with the 10th amendment, proposed by the German minister of Economics, Peter Altmaier, a close ally of chancellor Angela Merkel. He and his competition law crew are determined to enact a modern, new competition law that sends out signals to the public that this government takes up the fight for a competitive framework for digital markets. It is also the German ambition to set a precedent for reforms on the European stage.
A History, of Sorts
With the 9th amendment Germany had already introduced rules for platforms, e.g. mentioning the special characteristics that give market power to platforms, such as access to data. Germany had also introduced a transaction value based merger threshold (400 m EUR) so as to catch the next Facebook/WhatsApp merger. The EU does not yet have such a merger threshold and had been advised by the Special Advisers not to introduce one.3
The new reform comes at very interesting times: While the 9th amendment was ahead of time, somewhat, this one now stands in the shadows of the big cases: The three Google cases of the European Commission, the much-discussed Facebook case of the Bundeskartellamt and the Amazon investigations of both institutions. How does a legislator react to what we have witnessed so far?
To complicate matters, Germany was thrown into trouble by a widespread feeling that the German companies, once the pride of the nation, are falling behind in the data economy: SAP was the last big IT champion from Germany, and that company has been around in pre-Internet times already. Car manufacturers seem to have lost touch with latest developments, instead fighting in the self-inflicted Diesel saga. Merger cases of companies like Siemens/Alstom or Tata/Thyssen where the European Commission found that competition from China was not strong enough to allow the mergers to proceed met with criticism in Germany. This is the scene set for the reform of competition laws.
Implementing ECN+
The reform was triggered by the ECN+ Directive 2019/1 of the EU which required changes in procedural law and institutional matters for the antitrust enforcement framework in all Member States. The largest part of the draft is dedicated to implementing these rules. Changes in practice may not be particularly significant. One point where practitioners are troubled is that the Bundeskartellamt, the national competition agency, shall have powers of interrogation during dawn raids in a way that – in their reading – exceeds the requirements of Article 6(1) e) of the Directive (cf. section 59b (3) of the draft). There may be a conflict looming with the right against self-incrimination (nemo tenetur). It has to be noted in this context that in Germany individuals are liable to fines as well as companies. Yet, while the right to remain silent may help the individuals as they may be granted a guarantee by the Bundeskartellamt not to be prosecuted in person, then they may be required to incriminate their company.
The main goal of ECN+, namely to make competition authorities more independent, has already been realised for the Bundeskartellamt. It already works very independently (sometimes to the dismay of politicians), yet some amendments in this regard were still necessary, e.g. a strengthening of the position of the Bundeskartellamt in court proceedings when fines are dealt with. The rules on leniency and fines are now incorporated in detail in the law. The current version of the draft does not solve the conflict of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court and the Bundeskartellamt in how to calculate the fine. The Düsseldorf court is often even stricter than the agency since it does not start from the turnover relevant for the offence, as does the agency in its guidelines (that are not binding for the courts).
New Thresholds for Merger Control
There is also considerable news in merger control including amended thresholds. In particular, the high number of non-problematic merger notifications (around 1300 per year) is to be reduced:
“The provisions on formal merger control are being revised in order to make merger control more effective and to enable the Bundeskartellamt to focus on the most relevant mergers. (…) The central objective here is to further relieve small and medium-sized enterprises of their notification obligations.” (p. 59) With the proposed changes, the Ministry expects 20 percent less notifications of mergers.
To this end, the second domestic turnover threshold is raised from 5 million EUR to 10 million EUR. An extra-rule currently contained in the law for smaller independent undertakings that are sold becomes superfluous with this amendment.
The rule in merger control that there is no prohibition of a merger if it only relates to minor markets is extended. Minor markets (or Bagatellmarkt in German) are now markets that have less than 20 million EUR market volume (as opposed to 15 before). Yet, markets with free goods or services are not included in the definition.
Merger control for press publications is eased by raising the turnover thresholds. So far, the turnover of publishers had been multiplied by 8 for the calculation of the turnover thresholds. Now, this is reduced to a multiplication by 4. The multiplication as such serves the aim of having a tighter control of media concentrations. For TV and radio, it remains with factor 8.
Plans that had been around to have some more freedom in picking merger cases with a view to smaller mergers have not made it into the law, and there has been no provision proposed so far on “killer acquisitions.” It may be up to legislators in Parliament to step forward with a proposal.
The time frame for a phase II investigation in Germany is prolonged from four months to five. At the same time, extensions of deadlines in merger proceedings may not exceed one month in total.
The ministerial authorisation procedure that had become an easy exit for undertakings that had lost their merger case with the Bundeskartellamt will have a new requirement. Now, you can only turn to the Minister for his approval of a banned merger if you sought help from the Düsseldorf court before – at least in interim proceedings.
The Proposed Digital Regulatory Framework
According to the Ministry of Economics, “the present draft contributes to the creation of a digital regulatory framework.” For a start, three minor things:

In section 19 (equivalent to Article 102 TFEU), the new law cuts the causal link of dominance and abuse in some way. At least the new wording (only visible in the German version) may be interpreted in this sense.
In section 18, dealing with market power, access to data is acknowledged as a factor for that, not just for platforms, but for all sorts of undertakings.
There is also a special mention for intermediary services in section 18 now (as had been suggested by a preceding study commissioned by the Ministry).4

Regulating GAFA
The most remarkable change is a new rule in section 19a of the act that implements a competition-oriented regulation for “undertakings with paramount significance for competition across markets” (“UPSCAM”). The rule has been dubbed as “revolutionary” by observers, and it seems to be inspired by the notion of undertakings with strategic market status, as identified in the UK Furman Report.5
Paragraph 1 of section 19a goes into more detail who shall be targeted by the rule. The requirement to be fulfilled is “paramount significance for competition across markets” The draft says in its explanatory part: “It is to be expected, that the determination of a paramount significance for competition across markets can only be made for a few companies and the rule will therefore have a narrowly limited circle of addressees.” (p. 73) It instantly becomes clear who is meant by this rule – the GAFA companies, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon. The key component, “across markets,” remains rather vague, there is no further explanation of that. But there are indications. The first requirement is that the undertakings are active to a significant extent on multi-sided markets or with networks. So, this is primarily really a rule for digital players (although other companies can be active on multi-sided markets as well). Indicators for paramount significance across markets are dominance, financial strength, access to resources, vertical integration, activities on other related markets, access to data and “the importance of its activities for third parties’ access to supply and sales markets and its related influence on third parties’ business activities.” This can be interpreted as meaning that the undertaking in question must have a gatekeeping position. Companies operating “digital ecosystems,” locking customers and suppliers into their business model, are the ones targeted here.
The Bundeskartellamt has to establish that an undertaking is in such a position, which brings it close to a traditional provider of infrastructure, a utility. It is not entirely clear from the wording how that procedure actually takes place and what the value of that is (e.g. for private enforcement cases), but the competition agency has to decide this by order and this order may be challenged in courts.
The explanatory memo states: “The background to this is that markets in the digital economy can exhibit strong and rapid concentration tendencies, particularly due to network effects, data advantages and the associated self-strengthening effects, which require early intervention in the event of undesirable developments.” (pp. 72-73)
If an undertaking is identified as an UPSCAM there is a distinct set of powers that the Bundeskartellamt holds to apply (paragraph 2 of section 19a): The UPSCAM may not:

discriminate in intermediary services;
impede competition in markets where it is not yet dominant;
use data for making market entry more difficult;
demand terms and conditions that allow the use of data of others;
make portability of data more difficult;
withhold information from other companies about their success in markets.

In accordance with the objective of the provision, the abuses referred to in paragraph 2 are aimed at those types of conduct which have an increased potential for competitive harm, particularly if they are used by undertakings with paramount significance for competition across markets. In particular, such undertakings have the possibility to use their power positions and resources from other markets to restrict competition on additional markets, thereby also promoting their market position there and ultimately further consolidating their paramount significance for competition across markets. (p. 73)
Undertakings may prove that the behaviour in question is justified, yet they carry the burden of proof for this. The agency may not just work with plain prohibitions but also with interim measures and remedies for section 19a.
Paragraph 3 clarifies that Sections 19 and 20 GWB remain unaffected in their entirety. Conversely, any conclusion to the effect that conduct not prohibited under paragraph 2 would thus also be permitted under sections 19 and 20 of the act is also excluded.
There is some concern among practitioners, that the order that establishes a company as an addressee of section 19a and the prohibition order regarding specific abuses may coincide. The company would only learn of its paramount significance for competition across markets once there is already a prohibition order hitting.
The rule is on the defining line of sectoral regulatory rules on the one hand and standard competition law on the other. It certainly stimulates the imagination of people that favour a sturdier approach in enforcement, yet the success will largely depend on the judiciary’s willingness to make the rule effective.
Access to Data
Access to data has been a major topic of discussions in Germany for some time. This is owed to a mix of motivations. Companies need access to data for innovation, particularly in the field of Internet of Things or smart applications. German companies seem to be particularly data-hungry in this respect – they have all it takes from a hardware perspective, but lack the necessary data. At the same time, the Facebook ruling and the whole controversy surrounding this pointed at the lack of consumer sovereignty in this field and the privacy issues associated with personal data (and regulated by the GDPR). Former head of the Social Democrats, Andrea Nahles, had proposed a Data for all-law including the suggestion to hand out non-personal data as a public good, oblige “data monopolies” to share, and incentivise data sharing models.
It seems that the industrial players were most influential with their plea to the legislator. In section 19 (2) No. 4, the equivalent to Article 102 TFEU, the draft amendment aims at easing the essential-facility-rule. The definition of “essential facility” is now explicitly extended to include data, or networks.
The explanatory memorandum explains the shift from physical infrastructure to a broader notion, including intangible assets: “The previous wording of number 4 was characterised by a narrow understanding of an abusive refusal of access, particularly related to physical infrastructure. (…) The new version, with its more open wording, is intended to make it clear that a refusal of access to platforms or interfaces can also be abusive, as can a refusal to license intellectual property rights.” (pp. 71-72)
This is a significant amendment even though follow-on problems (such as on remuneration and updates) will keep on troubling courts and parties.
Even More Help with Data
Germany has tougher rules, than European competition law, on abusive practices in section 20. In particular, for abusive practices it largely suffices to have superior bargaining power or relative market power. This provision is strengthened, and again it is particularly tailored for access to data.
Firstly, companies may rely on section 20 not just if they are small or medium-sized enterprises. So far, bigger companies were not able to rely on section 20(1). This shall now be changed, so that, just as an example, Allianz, the insurer, or BASF, the chemical company, could use the provision to tackle Google or Amazon (there still needs to be a power asymmetry). The explanatory memo justifies this change with a move from traditional German protection of the Mittelstand to the protection of competition as a process:
Section 20(1) is not primarily intended to protect small and medium-sized businesses, but to protect competition as a process and an institution. (…) The extension of the scope of protection applies to all sectors of the economy, not only to the digital economy, but a particularly great benefit of this change for competition is to be expected there. (…) Section 20 (1) may thus be of particular importance, for example, in the case of obstruction strategies for digital platforms with a gatekeeper position, because large enterprises may also be dependent on such platforms. (pp. 78-79)
Accordingly, it is further clarified that intermediary companies are bound not to impede other companies when they act as gatekeepers for supply and sales markets (new section 20(1) sentence 2).
Thirdly, dependency may also be there if a company depends on access to data for its activities. The draft states that this is even possible if access to such data had not yet been commercialised, i.e. commerce had not yet been opened up at all. This will be a feast for all those who wish to go into fields where they have everything but the data, and where these data are not available on the market.
A Special Provision on Tipping
The answer to many digital cases may be the new section 20(3a), that aims to reduce competition problems through tipping of markets:
“It shall also be an unfair impediment (…) if an undertaking with superior market power on a market in the sense of section 18(3a) impedes the independent attainment of distinctive positive network effects by competitors and thereby creates a serious risk that competition on the merits is restricted to a not inconsiderable extent.”
It aims at digital companies again (section 18(3a) is a rule for multi-sided markets and networks), and it seems to entail a very broad notion of impediment.
On Interim Measures, Cooperation Agreements, Damages, and Consumer Protection
The Bundeskartellamt – just like the European Commission up to recently – has not made use of interim measures. The government sees the cause in a lack of practicability of section 32a in its current version. Accordingly, “[t]he amendment contains a moderate lowering of the conditions for the use of interim measures in order to enable the cartel authorities to intervene more quickly (in particular in the digital economy)” (p. 84).
Whereas up to now section 32a required a prima facie infringement (as expressly required by the parallel European provision in Article 8 of Regulation 1/2003), now a “predominant probability” suffices. This allows the Bundeskartellamt to base its assessment on whether, at the time when the interim measure is adopted, it appears more likely than not, that an infringement will also be established in the main proceedings.
Section 32c reintroduces the comfort letter. Up to 2004, as some readers may remember, the European Commission’s DG COMP championed in issuing comfort letters. The notification system for restrictive business practices had led to the request by parties to rubber-stamp their contracts. The Commission decided that this was to no avail since usually cartels were not notified, but everything else was and the Commission simply was no longer able to carry the burden. This meant that companies lost a lot of legal certainty since there were no more decisions on the day-to-day business of cooperation agreements. Guidelines and case law did not always help.
Today, this has grown into an even bigger problem since some forms of cooperation are new to the undertakings, their lawyers and the agencies. The standard example is data pooling or data sharing. Are you allowed to cooperate in order to make a smart app run – or does that amount to an illicit information exchange? This is often hard to tell. So companies can now turn to the Bundeskartellamt and ask for a decision – to be given within six months! – that the competition authority does not see grounds to take action.
The legislator also used the chance of the amendment to clarify minor aspects regarding damage claims, thereby “correcting” findings of courts after the implementation of the Damages Directive.
Other than expected, the proposal has no new powers for the Bundeskartellamt to deal with consumer protection issues (e.g. under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29).
Concluding Remarks
In summing up, the changes in merger control, procedure and other parts already add up to a significant change. Yet, at the heart of this amendment is a far-reaching, partly even “revolutionary” change of abuse provisions. Germany intends to set a European standard for a digital framework, by on the one hand “taming the tech titans” (as the Economist once put it), and on the other hand helping European companies with their access to the data economy. While the rules may trouble more conservative laissez-faire antitrust scholars, they are still far from being radical. There is no talk of prohibiting killer acquisitions, no breaking up of the GAFAs, no consumer-related enforcement powers. It is largely up to practice by the agency and the courts how far the changes will reach in practice. And before this implementation, there is still the whole legislative procedure coming up – we may well expect to see changes in the draft. This makes it clear that it is very timely now to join the debate!

By ZHANG Chenying (Tsinghua University)1
Introduction
From August 1, 2008, the date China’s Anti-Monopoly Law became effective, China’s anti-monopoly law enforcement authorities have identified 61 cases of abuse of market dominance,2 and punished certain relevant undertakings, including in several well-known cases, such as the Qualcomm case pursued by the National Development and Reform Commission,3 the Tetra Pak case by the former State Administration for Industry and Commerce,4 and the chlorpheniramine maleate case by the State Administration for Market Regulation.5 The industries involved in the cases are mainly those important to various people’s livelihood, such as telecommunications, water/power/gas, salt, and medicine, accounting for 50% of the total number of the cases.
On April 10, 2018, the State Administration for Market Regulation6 (“SAMR”) was established to be responsible for anti-monopoly law enforcement in a centralized way, ending past decentralized law enforcement. and developing a unified standard of enforcement. On June 26, 2019, the SAMR promulgated the Interim Provisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Market Dominance (the “Interim Provisions”),7 which became formally effective on September 1, 2019. The Interim Provisions summarize the approaches and mature law enforcement practices over the past decade, unify, refine and optimize the system for regulating abuse of market dominance after the integration of anti-monopoly law enforcement autho...

536,"October 30, 2019",EU: Vestager considers toughening ‘burden of proof’ for Big Tech,"


Large internet companies could be held to higher standards of proof in competition cases as part of changes to EU rules being considered by Margrethe Vestager, reported The Financial Times. 
The EU antitrust chief said she was examining a proposal from independent experts suggesting that digital platforms suspected of anti-competitive behavior be required, in certain cases, to demonstrate clear gains for their users to avoid punitive measures,  instead of Brussels having to show the damaging effects on consumers.  
“I think it’s an important discussion in figuring out what kind of regulation would be useful,” Ms Vestager told the Financial Times.
Stressing she had yet to reach a decision on whether to tighten the standard of proof, the Danish politician said that companies such as Google should bear extra responsibilities because they are so dominant that they have become “de facto regulators” in their markets.
 “When you own a market and you’re the de facto market regulator, what are then the obligations that you get? And how do you show that you actually meet your obligations?,” the commissioner said.

537,"October 29, 2019",US: Ohio Senate hearing looks into antitrust violations from Big Tech,"
Ohio lawmakers held their second hearing into whether tech giants such as Google and Facebook are engaged in anticompetitive behaviors that harm consumers or violate antitrust laws.
On Monday, October 28, at the University of Cincinnati, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from legal experts and representatives from interested parties. Committee members heard from parties which that claimed that more regulation is necessary to prevent big tech from controlling content as well as those who argued that statewide regulations could actually harm the marketplace.
Professor Felix Chang, the co-director of the Corporate Law Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, told the Committee that a person in a rural area will not often have access to more than one or two potential internet service providers. Because of the lack of options, a company may be able to run a monopoly that determines the type of content a person can access.
As an example, Chang noted that the Comcast-Time Warner merger could slow access to Google because the company holds stock in Hulu. This, he said, would benefit their company by gutting access to an opponent’s service.
David Chaver, the president and CEO of News Media Alliance, warned that the growth of big tech is a threat to the news industry. Tech giants, he said, follow algorithms that can suppress brands, control data, or refuse to recognize quality journalism.
Print newspaper circulation is dropping significantly, and many small newspapers are going out of business, Chavern said. He said the unprecedented control coming from tech giants has made it difficult for any news outlet to build a sustainable business model.

By Elizabeth Culliford, Reuters
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, America’s big tech companies are being challenged on many fronts from across the political spectrum, from antitrust concerns to their policies on political ads and ensuring election security. 
Many of the Democratic presidential candidates have argued in favor of either breaking up or tightening regulation of firms such as Facebook, Alphabet’s Google and Amazon.com.
Republican President Donald Trump’s administration has also stepped up its scrutiny, announcing a wide-ranging investigation in July into whether major digital tech companies engaged in anti-competitive practices.
Trump’s Democratic challengers also criticize online platforms for allowing politicians to make false claims in advertising ahead of the election next November.
Social media platforms are under particular scrutiny after U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia used them to wage an influence operation to interfere with the 2016 election – a claim Moscow has denied.

There is no certainty that the negotiations between Google and Fitbit will lead to any deal, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The exact price that Google has offered for Fitbit could not be learned.
Fitbit’s fitness trackers monitor users’ daily steps, calories burned, and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.

By Matthew Lees (Arnold Bloch Leibler)1
Introduction
While the final report by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) in its digital platforms inquiry
addresses various important issues relating to digital platforms,2 the inquiry is perhaps more revealing
for what it tells us about the relationship between competition policy and
another industry: news media and journalism.
Born out of a political deal to relax cross-media
ownership laws, the inquiry was conducted by the media-savvy ACCC. News media
and journalism was the focus of the inquiry’s terms of reference, as well as
key recommendations in the final report. 
News media and journalism are important not only to
politicians and competition and consumer regulators: they play an essential
role in a democracy like Australia by keeping citizens informed of public
affairs, holding those in power to account and facilitating healthy public
debate. They are also important for facilitating informed markets, providing
valuable information to consumers.
In recent years, a number of countries around the
world have experienced concerns about the quality of news and information (or
“fake news”) being publicly disseminated, particularly online, accompanied by
concerns about the quality of the political process and fears of rising
political extremism.3
These are issues that affect us all and underline the importance of fair and

542,"October 24, 2019",US: The Trump administration sues California over emissions deal,"
The United States sued on Wednesday (October 24) the state of California over its cap and trade emissions agreement with Quebec in Canada, arguing that only the federal government has competence to enter into or endorse agreements with foreign states or countries.
The lawsuit contends that international pacts such as California’s cap-and-trade program can be agreed to by the federal government, reported the Wall Street Journal.
The US filed a civil complaint against the state of California, several of its officers, the California Air Resources Board, and the Western Climate Initiative, the Department of Justice said.  
“The state of California has veered outside of its proper constitutional lane to enter into an international emissions agreement. The power to enter into such agreements is reserved to the federal government, which must be able to speak with one voice in the area of US foreign policy,” said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.
“California’s unlawful cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec undermines the President’s ability to negotiate competitive agreements with other nations, as the President sees fit,” Clark added.
The Trump Administration argues in its complaint that California entered into an integrated cap-and-trade program with Quebec in 2013 without approval from Congress. The complaint, filed in the Eastern District of California, asks the court to declare California’s emissions trade deal unconstitutional and to stop its operation.
In 2013, California and Quebec integrated their cap-and-trade programs, creating an emissions trade market as they were seeking “cost-effective approaches to cut greenhouse gas emissions.”
The lawsuit filed by the US against California is the latest in a series of clashes between the Trump Administration and the state of California in environment-related matters in recent months and years.

543,"October 24, 2019",US: DOJ taps prominent lawyer for Big Tech probe,"
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has bolstered the staff for its investigation into potential antitrust violations against Big Tech, adding Ryan Shores, a former partner in an international law firm.
Reuters reported that Shores, who comes from the firm of Shearman & Sterling, will help with the probe of Google, Facebook and other notable technology companies. He will be joining the office of the deputy attorney general, which heads the antitrust division.
Shores is a former Supreme Court clerk who worked under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on antitrust issues.
In July, the DOJ announced a probe to determine whether Big Tech violated antitrust law. The department did not name specific companies, but said they were related to “search, social media and some retail services online.”
Shores’ official title will be associate deputy attorney general and senior advisor for technology industries.
“The addition of Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan A. Shores for this important role reflects the significance of the department’s review of competitive conditions among online platforms,” said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen. “His years of high-stakes antitrust and litigation expertise will bring invaluable experience to the review as he works closely with our antitrust division.”
Last month, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent a letter to the Justice Department complaining about the DOJ’s behavior in regard to the investigations and voicing concerns about the recent interactions between the two agencies.
Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust matters, said he planned to ask about the letter at a hearing, where FTC Chairman Joe Simons and DOJ Antitrust Chief Makan Delrahim were expected to testify.
“Sen. Lee is aware of the letter, and he intends to inquire at tomorrow’s oversight hearing about whether the clearance process between the agencies is working and, if not, whether the FTC and DOJ are engaging in duplicative investigations,” noted a spokesman for Lee.

544,"October 24, 2019",The Antitrust Threat to National Security,"
By Jon Bateman, Wall Street Journal
Forty-six state attorneys general have joined Letitia James, their New York counterpart, in an antitrust investigation of Facebook. Every presidential candidate in last week’s Democratic debate agreed that big tech companies have grown too powerful and must be humbled or diminished, if not broken up entirely. This idea has gained popularity across the political spectrum, with two-thirds of Americans now saying they would break up Big Tech. Although still a long shot, the breakup campaign has spawned dozens of antitrust probes against Amazon, Apple and Google as well as Facebook. And it has started a long-overdue debate about Silicon Valley’s sweeping influence.
But there are dangers in restructuring any U.S. industry. One of the most serious remains largely unrecognized: national-security risk. Despite their faults, tech companies contribute directly to American military and intelligence operations. Their titanic scale can itself be an asset. Any responsible antitrust debate must address the national security risks of breaking up Big Tech—and the parallel risks of keeping these companies intact.
Consider cloud computing. The Defense Department is planning a massive global cloud called JEDI. Unlike corporate clouds, the “war cloud” must support life-or-death missions on austere battlefields despite virtual or physical onslaughts. The Pentagon found only two eligible bidders: Amazon and Microsoft. Three defense secretaries, a federal judge and the Government Accountability Office have upheld this bidding process.

545,"October 23, 2019",US: Proposed social media law would let data flow among platforms,"
A proposed law created to increase competition in the tech sector would allow users to move their data between social media platforms.
The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act, introduced by Sens. Mark Warner (D., Va.), Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), has three mandates for platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users. The first would require them to make it easy for users to move their data from one platform to another, while a second mandate would require “interoperability” by competitors. And the third order would have platforms allow other firms to manage a user’s account settings if given permission.
“As a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry. By making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies,” said Warner, a former technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist, in a press release. “And empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies. In other words—by enabling portability, interoperability, and delegatability, this bill will help put consumers in the driver’s seat when it comes to how and where they use social media.”
 Tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet—owner of YouTube and Google—have already voiced their support for the Data Transfer Project, which also aims to allow users to move their data from one platform to another.
“We believe people should be able to move their data from one service or app to another,” Facebook said in a statement attributed to Kevin Martin, its vice president of US public policy, according to the Wall Street Journal.

I. INTRODUCTION
On July 15, 2019, the European Commission (the “Commission”) published its Report on Competition policy for 2018 (the “Report”). This report is prepared annually for the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions. Once produced, it is debated in the European Parliament and is the subject of a non-legislative resolution. It presents an opportunity for the Commission to provide an update on the most important decisions and legislative and policy initiatives adopted in the field of EU competition law during the previous calendar year. It thus covers the entire range of competition policy issues, from cartels and investigations to mergers and State aid.
II. COMPETITION LAW IN THE NEW DIGITAL ECONOMY
The most extensive section of the Report deals with developments resulting from the digitization of the economy. The Report notes that this digital transition has profoundly transformed the entire economy, changing consumer attitudes and the way in which markets operate. However, it places particular emphasis on four specific challenges: (i) the treatment of data which are necessary to improve increasingly important algorithms and make them more “intelligent”; (ii) the growing market power of digital platforms, especially when they market their own products in the same digital marketplace; (iii) the need for competition law to assist in the creation of a well-functioning Digital Single Market so that Europe can take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by digital technology; and (iv) the need to ensure that new market players that have grown rapidly into major technology providers do not use their market power to foreclose new competitors. The overall policy objective is to ensure that the digital market serves the people of Europe and not the other way around.2
A. Competition Policy Fit for the Digital Single Market
To that end, in 2018, the Commission started a process of reflection to determine the best way for competition policy to serve consumers in the digital market. It appointed Professors Heike Schweitzer, Jacques Crémer and Assistant Professor Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye as Special Advisers and commissioned a report on “Competition Policy for the Digital Era” which was published on April 4, 2019. The report: (i) identifies the main features of digital markets; (ii) suggests the objectives that competition law should pursue; (iii) examines the role of merger control in balancing fair competition and support for innovation; and (iv) discusses the application of competition rules to digital platforms and data.3 This report will inform the Commission’s thinking as it seeks to develop competition policy to address the new challenges presented by the digital market.
B. Antitrust and Cartel Enforcement
In 2018, the Commission adopted a series of antitrust decisions relating to the digital market. On January 24, 2018, the Commission found that Qualcomm had abused its dominant position in the market for LTE baseband chipsets by making significant payments to Apple in exchange for the exclusive use of Qualcomm chipsets in iPhone and iPad devices.4 Moreover, in the context of a global investigation involving the competition authorities of Brazil, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and the United States the Commission fined eight producers of capacitators for participating in a 14-year long cartel to coordinate future behavior and avoid price competition in the market for the supply for electrolytic capacitators.5 On July 18, 2018, the Commission also found that Google had abused its dominant position in respect of general internet search and fined the company €4.34 billion.6 Finally, it also continued an investigation against the same company in respect of potential restrictions on the ability of certain third party websites to display search advertisements. The investigation was concluded on March 20, 2019 and Google was fined €1.49 billion.7
C. Price Competition in E-commerce
The online commerce market plays a central role in the Commission’s vision for a Digital Single Market. The Report notes the significant benefits afforded by e-commerce to both consumers and businesses. E-commerce has provided customers with unprecedented access to choice of goods and services and has allowed them to compare prices from all over Europe. Simultaneously, businesses can market their products and services to over 500 million Europeans through a single website.
The Commission conducted a sector inquiry in respect of e-commerce which was published on May 10, 2017. The final report highlighted the threat of resale price restrictions combined with automatic software facilitating price monitoring as well as cross-border sales restrictions in distribution agreements.8
Following the results of the sector inquiry, the Commission is particularly keen to protect price competition in the European online commerce market (which is now worth more than €500 billion per year) and ensure that it is not fragmented. On December 17, 2018, it fined the clothing company Guess approximately €40 million (with a 50 percent reduction to reflect the company’s cooperation) for preventing cross-border sales advertising in distribution agreements.9 Moreover, on July 24, 2018, the Commission adopted separate decisions in respect of Asus (Taiwan), Denon & Marantz, Pioneer (Japan) and Philips (the Netherlands) and imposed a total fine of €111 million for restricting the ability of retailers to determine their online resale prices independently.10
D. State Aid and the Commission’s Digital Agenda
Finally, the Report illustrates how State aid rules can be used to further the Commission’s “digital agenda” by enabling European governments to support broadband deployment. An estimated €500 billion in the form of private and public investments in infrastructure will be required within the next decade to achieve the Commission’s Single Digital Market connectivity goals. In this context State aid rules play a crucial role in ensuring that public investments do not stifle private ones and that publicly-funded infrastructure is accessible to all operators. In 2018, in its first decision directly supporting its connectivity goals, the Commission approved a Bavarian project to install very high capacity networks in six municipalities.11
III. ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPETITION ENFORCEMENT
The Report also focuses on the Commission’s efforts to streamline procedure in competition cases in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enforcement actions. The Report points to the updated guidance for companies regarding business secrets and other confidential information as well as the templates and guidance for the use of confidentiality rings in the context of access to file.12 In addition to that, the Commission pursues specific policies to streamline the application of competition law.
A. Efficiency in Cartel Enforcement
To enhance the efficiency of cartel enforcement procedures, the Commission has introduced an Anonymous Whistleblower Tool that allows individuals with insider knowledge of competition law infringements to alert the Commission via a two-way encrypted messaging system.
The Commission also makes extensive use of the settlement procedure which in 2018 accounted for 75 percent of decisions adopted during the year.13 In such cases, the relevant undertakings acknowledge their participation in the infringement and accept their liability in exchange for a reduction in fines. This allows the Commission to apply a faster, simplified procedure thus freeing resources for further investigations. To further encourage undertakings to take advantage of that procedure, the Commission published informal guidance explaining how companies can cooperate with anti-trust investigations in exchange for lower fines.
Under the settlement procedure, on February 21, 2018, the Commission adopted three different decisions relating to a cartel in the markets for the maritime transport of cars and the supply of car parts imposing a total fine of €546 million.14 Finally, on September 18, 2018, the Commission opened an investigation into the potential collusion of certain car manufacturers in the development of emission cleaning system for passenger cars.
B. Efficiency in State Aid Rules
To enhance efficiency in State aid proceedings, the Commission has been pursuing a major reform package since 2012, the so-called State Aid Modernization. Within that framework, in 2014, the Commission introduced the General Block Exemption Regulation (“GBER”) under which Member States do not have to notify certain less distortive aid measures to the Commission. According to the 2018 State Aid Scoreboard, since 2015, more than 96 percent of measures fell within the ambit of the GBER.15 This allowed the Commission to focus on the more challenging cases and permitted more rapid implementation of the more uncontroversial measures.
C. Empowering National Competition Authorities
Finally, following the Commission’s proposal, on December 11, 2018, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the so-called ECN+ Directive. Once transposed into national law (by February 4, 2021), ECN+ will empower national competition authorities to be more effective enforcers of EU competition law by providing them with appropriate enforcement tools and resources to adopt decisions entirely independently. The Directive will also allow them to impose deterrent fines and to coordinate their leniency programs.16
IV. MERGER CONTROL AND THE SINGLE MARKET
Another area of interest in the Report is the application of merger control rules by the Commission. The Report notes that companies may expand either through organic growth or by entering into mergers in order to penetrate new markets, take advantage of economies of scale, or to combine complementary portfolios. While consumers may benefit from such mergers the Commission is vigilant to ensure that price competition, quality, choice, and innovation are preserved. The Report provides various examples of in-depth investigations in the agro-chemical and steel markets where extensive remedy packages worth billions of euros were required to obtain clearance.
A. Steel Market
In respect of the Steel market the Report emphasizes that merger control “goes hand in hand with decisive EU action to protect the EU’s steel industry from unfair trade and distortions from third countries.”17 It appears, therefore, that the Commission is receptive to the concerns of the European steel industry. Indicatively, the Commission required an extensive remedy package to authorize the acquisition of Ilva by ArcelorMittal in order to ensure that European customers will have access to steel at competitive prices enabling them to compete with imported products.18
B. Transport Sector
The Report also highlights the crucial role of a competitive transport sector for a properly functioning Single Market and sustainable growth. In this context, on July 13, 2018, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the proposed acquisition of Alstom by Siemens. The Commission ultimately prohibited the acquisition over concerns that the transaction could lead to higher prices and restrict choice and innovation.19
The air transport market appears to occupy a particularly prominent place within the transport sector. Therefore, the Commission uses the full range of competition tools at its disposal to ensure that it functions properly. Indicatively, in 2018, the Commission opened an investigation into the market for airline ticket distribution services, adopted a series of merger decisions to facilitate the timely disposal of Air Berlin’s assets following its bankruptcy, and used the State aid rules to ensure that a fair market price is paid for airport concessions.20
V. OTHER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS
The Report also addresses various ancillary topics which can provide meaningful insight into how the Commission’s competition policy fits within the context of its other objectives.
A. Competition Policy in Support of the EU’s Energy and Environment Objectives
One of the Commission’s core objectives is the creation of a European Energy Union, i.e. a market where clean energy flows securely and unimpeded. The Commission uses competition law to further this objective. It, therefore, adopted a decision forcing Gazprom to remove obstacles to the free flow of gas in Central and Eastern Europe thus ensuring competitive prices.21
Additionally, the Commission applies State aid rules to support investments in renewable energy and energy-efficient plants,22 in green and decarbonisation technology, and in improving the security of supply. Additionally, through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (in respect of which a revised Directive was adopted in March 2019), State aid rules contribute towards achieving the EU’s climate objectives.
B. Level Playing Field in the Area of Taxation
The Commission also deploys the State aid rules to preserve confidence in the Single Market by ensuring that competition on the merits is not skewed by unfair tax advantages. This is achieved by reviewing the tax treatment of certain undertakings as well as by investigating individual tax rulings in Member States.
C. Fostering a Global Competition Culture
Finally, according to the Report, the rising number of global market players and value chains necessitates worldwide cooperation between competition authorities and the creation of common standards and procedures. The Commission strives to be a leading force in international cooperation. On a bilateral level, the Commission negotiates the inclusion of competition State aid provisions in the various Free Trade and Association agreements with third countries. In 2018, it continued negotiations with Chile, Mexico, Mercosur, Azerbaijan, Tunisia, Indonesia, Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino. It also started negotiations with Australia, New Zealand, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan and signed an Administrative Arrangement with Mexico.
VI. THEMES AND TRENDS
The Report provides significant insights into the Commission’s future priorities. In order to fully understand their significance the Report must be viewed in the context of recent political developments in the EU and global competition law trends. In respect of the former, the announcement of the make-up of the Von der Leyen Commission is particularly informative as the current Competition Commissioner and soon-to-be Executive Vice-President Vestager has obtained an expanded brief which except for the competition portfolio includes responsibility for ensuring that Europe is “fit for the Digital Age.”
A. Markets that Work for Consumers
A central theme that emerges from the Report is that the Commission wishes to ensure that markets work for consumers and not the other way around.23 Such rhetoric is connected to the need make sure that competition policy not only materially benefits consumers but that it is also plainly seen to be being doing so in order to foster trust and confidence in the Commission’s work. This means that the Commission is likely to prioritize cases with obvious benefits to consumers.
B. Focus on Digital Markets
The Report makes clear that the application of competition law in the Digital Market was a priority for the Commission in 2018. This focus will certainly persist and will likely be reinvigorated in the foreseeable future and at least throughout the mandate of the new Commission. The incoming Executive Vice-President Vestager’s expanded brief is likely to have a significant impact on this. In her Mission Letter, the President-Elect asks Vestager to “focus on maintaining [the EU’s] digital leadership where [it] has it, catching up where [it] lags behind and moving fit on new-generation technologies.”24
In this context, an area of particular interest is likely to be the treatment of data due to their crucial role in most digital technologies and especially new-generation technologies. This is specifically recognized as a challenge in Report and is also addressed in the Mission Letter. The latter requires the incoming Executive Vice-President to coordinate, within the first 100 days of the new Commission’s mandate, Europe’s approach to “how we can use and share non-personalised big data to develop new technologies and business models.”25 Although this responsibility is derived from Vestager’s mandate to make “Europe fit for a digital age,” the latter is intended to have a broad application and will likely affect competition policy.
A connected issue is interaction between competition and data protection law in the treatment of big data. Until now, these two issues were treated separately even though sometimes the dividing line was blurred. With Vestager’s enlarged brief and considering the absence of direct enforcement powers in respect of privacy law, the Commission might become more tempted to blur the line further.
The Report strongly underlines the benefits of the sector inquiry into e-commerce.26 Simultaneously, the Mission Letter includes a requirement to consider whether to launch sector inquiries into “new and emerging markets that are shaping our economy and society,” a description which fits neatly with the Single Digital Markets or certain markets within that. Therefore, it is likely that the Commission will launch a sector inquiry in respect of the Single Digital Market at some point “in the first part of [Vestager’s] mandate.”27
Sector inquiries use the targeted tools available in individual investigations to gather information on entire markets and sectors. Therefore, they can be particularly useful as the information collected can form both the basis both for policy development and for launching individual investigations into specific infringements. In this case, a sector inquiry might allow the Commission to start monitoring certain nascent markets involving new-generation technology from a very early stage. In this fast-moving environment, this will be a rare opportunity for the Commission to develop a coherent competition policy from the start.
Notably, this focus on Digital Markets is a global trend. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) recently set up a Data Unit while a distinct Digital Markets Unit with powers to review mergers and impose remedies has also been announced by the UK Government. The CMA also recently completed a market study (the equivalent to a sector inquiry) into online platforms and digital advertising. This study included an examination of the control exercised by customers over their data and the market power of digital platforms. The CMA has since described the results of that study as forming the “core” of its Digital Market Strategy.28 Equivalent studies have also been conducted by the French Competition Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.29
However, while the focus in relation to developing policy and collecting information will likely be on the Digital Market for the foreseeable future, it should be noted that, in the short term, the vast majority of merger reviews and anti-trust investigations are likely to relate to the more traditional industries.
C. Industrial Policy and Merger Control
Finally, the Report indicates that the Commission sometimes uses competition enforcement to achieve its wider objectives. In most instances, such as in relation to its energy and tax policies, this is fairly uncontroversial. However, when it comes to the EU’s industrial policy, there appears to be a tension between the EU’s political wish to support European champions and DG Competition’s stated aim of preserving a level playing field conductive to innovation and investment. As demonstrated by the prohibition of the Alstom/Siemens transaction, that tension is usually resolved in favor maximising the perceived benefit for competition. It remains to be seen whether the inclusion of a responsibility to “co-lead [the EU’s] work on a new long-term strategy for Europe’s industrial future”30 in the incoming Executive Vice-President’s brief will shift this balance.

548,"October 22, 2019",US: Delrahim says breakup of Big Tech ‘on the table’,"
According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the top US prosecutor investigating tech giants like Facebook and Google made clear Tuesday, October 22, that no measure is out of his reach.
Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department’s growing antitrust division, raised the spectre of breaking up big Silicon Valley names, calling such an action “perfectly on the table.” That is a chilling prospect for the largest companies, which haven’t faced such a threat since the government sought a breakup of Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.
Speaking at the WSJ Tech Live summit, Mr. Delrahim laid out what has to be considered the worst-case scenario for Silicon Valley as the Justice Department’s antitrust review, unveiled over the summer, takes shape. He said the technology revolution has brought improvements for consumers, but that questions remain about potential anticompetitive behavior.
“There’s no question consumers have benefited from technology. There’s no question we have a lot more conveniences at our disposal. The big question is: Are companies abusing the market power that they have gained,” Mr. Delrahim said.
He summed up his operating philosophy with a quip a few moments later. “Big is not bad,” he said. “Big behaving badly is bad.”

549,"October 22, 2019",US: Senators want social media users to be able to take their data,"
Three US lawmakers active in tech issues will introduce a bill requiring social networks like Facebook to allow users to pack up their data and go elsewhere, Senator Mark Warner’s office said in a statement on Tuesday, October 22.
The senators, Republican Josh Hawley and Democrats Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal, are introducing the bill at a time when there is growing concern that Facebook—along with Alphabet’s Google—have become so powerful that smaller rivals are unable to lure away their users, reported Reuters. 
The bill would require communications platforms with more than 100 million monthly active members—Facebook has more than two billion—to allow its users to easily move, or port, their data to another network. 
The idea, which is already part of European law, has the support of Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee.
Data portability has been promoted in the past as giving consumers the power to move their data, which could spur the growth of social media alternatives that offer features such as greater privacy or less advertising.

550,"October 21, 2019",Can antitrust enforcement protect digital consumers?,"
By Fiona M. Scott Morton, Yale Insights
The first antitrust laws and enforcement efforts in the United States were taken in response to the emergence of sprawling industrial conglomerations—the “trusts” in “antitrust”—that amassed inordinate power over the growing American economy. John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, for instance, controlled as much as 90% of refined oil production in the country around the turn of the 20th century. The company was broken up under the Sherman Antitrust Act, spawning successor companies that would eventually become Exxon, Mobil, and Chevron.
In recent months, increasing interest has been focused on applying antitrust law to a new breed of “trusts”—the digital conglomerates that have amassed inordinate power over how citizens communicate, shop, and, possibly, cast their ballots. The Department of Justice and the FTC have initiated antitrust investigations of big tech, and in September, 48 state attorneys general announced that they are collaborating on an investigation as well. 
Fiona Scott Morton, the Theodore Nierenberg Professor of Economics at Yale SOM, has been an intellectual standard bearer for the effort to effectively apply antitrust principles originally crafted for an age of steel and oil to the new digital landscape. Earlier this year, she chaired a committee of scholars that studied consumer harms caused by the market power of digital platforms like Google and Facebook, and proposed updated antitrust enforcement and regulation to address them. In August, she launched the Thurman Arnold Project, an initiative funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Omidyar Network that will leverage resources from across Yale to further understanding and action on these issues. “Antitrust enforcement and competition policy are lagging behind academic knowledge, and new energy is required to bring these issues to public attention and into the policy arena,” Scott Morton said in announcing the creation of TAP@Yale. 
Two new papers co-authored by Scott Morton further this agenda by synthesizing findings from academic research in antitrust to explain how lack of competition can lead to decreased innovation and higher prices for consumers—and what can be done about it. Scott Morton describes the goal of her work as “trying to make the economic literature more understandable to policy makers, and trying to demonstrate where the results are applicable to, in particular, competition enforcement and regulatory issues.”
Scott Morton spoke with Yale Insights about how smart antitrust policy and enforcement can protect innovation and prevent exploitative markups.

551,"October 20, 2019",US: House panel’s “Big Tech” report due early 2020,"
The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee expects to have a final report on its probe of big technology companies and their potential breaches of antitrust law, by the “first part” of next year, reported Reuters.
The Committee has received tens of thousands of documents from Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, Amazon, and Apple and is expecting more material in the coming weeks, Representative David Cicilline told reporters.
“Our hope is to conclude our evidence collection end of this year, beginning of next year with the idea that we will have a final report, instead of recommendations in the first part of next year,” said Cicilline, a Democrat. 
He made the comments at a hearing to discuss the effect of consumer data collection by big technology platforms on online competition. Rohit Chopra, Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, as well as experts from Harvard Kennedy School and the American Enterprise Institute participated in the hearing.
There are several probes at the federal, state, and congressional level aimed at determining if big technology companies use their considerable clout in the online market illegally to hurt rivals or otherwise break competition law.

552,"October 20, 2019",US: Rohit Chopra is concerned that the government is “captured” by Big Tech,"
According to a report from The Hill, Rohit Chopra, a Democrat commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), testified before a House panel that he is concerned the US government is “too often captured” by the country’s largest tech companies.
During a hearing on Friday, October 18, Chopra made the comments about data privacy before the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, which has been investigating whether the top technology firms wield their power in the marketplace.
“All too often, the government is too captured by those incumbents that use their power to dictate their preferred policies,” Chopra said, discussing his concerns around the unprecedented power and strength of Big Tech. He did not name any specific agency or company.
Chopra, a Democratic official who formerly helped Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts) establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in recent months has aggressively dissented to the FTC’s record-breaking settlements with large tech companies including Facebook and Google’s YouTube, claiming the agency is not using the full breadth of its authority to take on Big Tech.
The House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel is currently probing competition issues around Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. As part of that investigation, they are looking into whether Congress needs to modernize antitrust laws to better take on the digital marketplace, and if the regulatory agencies—which include the FTC and Department of Justice—are properly enforcing the laws on the books.

553,"October 20, 2019",Who’s the Daddy?,"

By Philip Marsden (College of Europe)1
I love babies, I love running, and I love
water…especially tides. What does any of this have to do about competition
issues in the digital economy though?
This note is provoked by many visits I’ve made
recently to competition authorities and governments. They want to do something
about online harms and competition problems, but don’t know what to do, and
don’t think they have the necessary tools or – frankly – the economic might to
make a difference. I thus introduce some thoughts I was honored to debate at
the United Nations this summer, in a digital and competition conference of 193
member governments.
Digital giants are often perceived as all powerful,
and enormously complex…but this doesn’t mean that governments should throw up
their hands and say it is “all too difficult” or “what can one country do?” or
even “what if we get it wrong, won’t the sky fall in?” The tech giants are all
relatively young – Facebook is a teenager and Google in its early 20s – but
they don’t always act like grownups, sad to say. In fact, more often than not
they act like giant babies with very simple wants. Indeed, they may seem to be
providing us with amazing things, but they also take up a lot of our energy.
So, yes, like babies they are life-changing, and wonderful, and they let us see
the world through new eyes, and do things we could never have imagined. They
give us joy and add real value to our lives....

554,"October 16, 2019",US: Could Amazon be open to splitting?,"
A writer for The Atlantic, who wrote a sprawling story about Amazon, thinks that CEO Jeff Bezos will spin off the highly profitable Amazon Web Services (AWS) before antitrust regulators get a chance to break it up.
CNBC ran an interview with writer Franklin Foer, who said breaking off the service “would be the obvious thing for [Bezos] to do in the face of this.”
“I think that eventually Bezos, who is seeing around corners, is going to break up his own company,” Foer said. “AWS exists as its own fantastically profitable business. There’s no reason that it needs to be connected to Amazon the e-retailer. And as he looks at what’s happening in politics, where there’s this increasing bipartisan consensus that Big Tech is a problem, I’m pretty sure he’s going to say, ‘okay, fine.’”
In a June interview, Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, said the company would listen to regulators if it was ordered to split off, but that he saw no upside to doing it just yet. As for revenue, AWS made up 13% of Amazon’s total in Q2, but more than half of its US$3.1 billion in operating income for the same time period.
Amazon has so far steered clear of most of the regulatory antitrust interest, as Facebook is receiving record fines and Google is also under a microscope, but the company is reportedly the subject of inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the House Judiciary Committee. There is also a looming investigation by the Justice Department that does not name specific companies.
Data is a big part of the equation, as Amazon collects a lot of information from sellers on its platform. House Judiciary Committee members recently asked AWS and Amazon how that data is used and shared.

556,"October 15, 2019",She Fined Tech Giants Billions of Dollars. Now She Wants Sharper Tools,"
By Valentina Pop, Wall Street Journal
 Margrethe Vestager made a name for herself as Europe’s top antitrust enforcer by slapping record fines on U.S. tech companies. Now she says those fines don’t work. 
As she prepares to start an unprecedented second term as the European Union’s competition commissioner, this time with added powers as the EU’s digital-economy policy maker, Ms. Vestager is shifting her focus from fining giants to preventing market abuses.
Fines are “not doing the trick,” she told EU lawmakers recently, despite having hit Alphabet Inc.’s Google with penalties totaling $9.4 billion in recent years. “We have to consider remedies that are much more far-reaching.”
Ms. Vestager already has the power to break up companies as a last resort, a step some Democratic presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have advocated. Ms. Vestager said that isn’t her intent. “My obligation is to do the least-intrusive thing in order to make competition come back,” she said.
Instead, she pointed to national competition authorities in the U.K. and the Netherlands, which have the power to reorganize a marketplace before consumers or competitors suffer. She said the two countries have “tools that could be considered, to reorganize before harm is done.”
Ms. Vestager should get similar powers, Dutch Competition Authority Chairman Martijn Snoep told a recent conference in Brussels. “We don’t need tools to cure yesterday’s problems,” he said of the Netherlands. “Tools should be aimed at preventing [bad] behavior.”
The approach departs from traditional punitive remedies because it addresses market conditions without casting blame. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority can order companies to divest parts of a business in order to improve competition, “but there’s no liability, no fines,” said Mike Walker, chief economic adviser at the CMA, at the same conference.
The CMA in July launched an inquiry into online platforms and their advertising businesses. A previous inquiry into the auditing sector led in April to the conclusion that audit firms Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP should separate their auditing and consulting businesses.

557,"October 14, 2019",Australia: Ex-competition head questions ACCC’s merger law reform,"
Former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Graeme Samuel has joined business groups in disputing the need for new laws to block corporate mergers, reported the Sidney Herald. 
The ACCC has asked for new powers allowing it to stop technology giants from buying smaller startups, if the merger risks preventing a potential competitor from being created. Australia’s current merger laws require courts and regulators only consider existing competitors.
The ACCC’s reform call follows an 18-month inquiry into digital platforms such as Google and Facebook, which have concentrated their control of digital communication by buying smaller ventures such as Instagram, Whatsapp, YouTube, and Double Click.
Professor Samuel, who was chair of the ACCC from 2003 to 2011, said he was “very hesitant about wanting to see a significant change to the law as it currently stands.”
“Let’s not rush to change law because all of a sudden the ACCC is not being successful in court cases,” he said, noting the regulator’s recent losses in contested merger cases.
However the ACCC’s proposed new laws would apply to all types of businesses, not just tech giants, sparking alarm from groups including the Business Council of Australia.

558,"October 13, 2019",Austria: State approves 5% tax on digital ads,"
Austria’s Federal Council approved a 5% tax on the digital advertising revenues of large tech firms, reported Bloomberg.
The country joins a growing list of jurisdictions launching similar taxes targeting digital revenues generated by large tech firms like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
The levy will be paid by any firm which has €750 million (US$826 million) of revenues worldwide and €25 million (US$27.6 million) of digital advertising revenue in Austria. The tax was already approved by the country’s National Council on September 19 and is part of a wider tax reform package.
Austria expects the new tax to generate €200 million (US$220.8 million) of revenue per year.
The US intends to take trade action against countries that enact taxes aimed at US companies, Chip Harter, deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs at the Treasury Department, said September 11 at the International Fiscal Association 2019 Congress in London.

559,"October 13, 2019",Why U.S. Businesses Want Trustbusting,"
By Matt Stoller, Wall Street Journal
Trustbusting is back, and it’s a bipartisan effort. Last month, 50 state attorneys general, led by the conservative Republican Ken Paxton of Texas, announced an investigation of Google for anticompetitive conduct. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has been a fierce critic of big tech, as has the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, which is probing the sector. Several Democratic presidential candidates have pledged to address the problem of concentrated power not just in tech but in agriculture, defense and media too.
It might seem like both parties and the American public are turning against business creators and investors who put their hard-earned capital to work. But there’s a more optimistic way to see this dynamic. If you listen to the complaints against these large companies, they aren’t coming from Occupy Wall Street-style protesters. They are coming from business leaders who, in most cases, are just seeking the liberty to trade with whomever they wish and feel that they are being blocked.
Take complaints about Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which is such an important marketing platform that it is essentially the home page for every company. Google’s searches once primarily sent people to independent web pages, but the internet has increasingly become Google’s own walled garden. A recent study by the data analytics firm Jumpshot shows that more than half of Google searches now end with snippets from web pages displayed on the search page itself instead of visits to those pages, or else by sending users to Google apps or to sites that paid Google for ads—instead of to pages outside Google’s sphere. Meanwhile, Google has packed so many ads onto its results page that companies are finding that they have to buy ads even to reach people who search for their product by name.
This would not be such a problem except that Google is essentially a search monopoly, with roughly 90% of the web search market and a dominant share in other segments of the internet, like mapping. (Google counters by defining the market more broadly to include any online service that helps consumers to find something, such as Amazon or Expedia.) One small-business owner told The Wall Street Journal, in an article earlier this year about fake listings in Google maps, that he fears Google far more than the government. “The government will hit me with a fine,” he said. “But if Google suspends my listings, I’m out of a job. Google could make me homeless.”

560,"October 10, 2019",Washington watches as EU steps up scrutiny of Big Tech,"
 By RICHARD WATERS, Financial Times 
 Washington’s antitrust enforcers have a severe case of Margrethe envy. That would be Margrethe Vestager, who is taking on a second five-year stint as Europe’s competition chief, this time with added responsibility for overall digital regulation. As American politicians and regulators look at ways of restraining the power of Big Tech, a tendency to look across the Atlantic has been understandable. Brussels began its first informal probe into Google nearly a decade ago, and Ms Vestager has since earned a reputation as the regulator who has done the most to rattle Silicon Valley. But her success has been mixed and it wouldn’t do to follow too closely in her footsteps. Instead, it is where the European digital chief trains her guns next that matters. 
Ms Vestager’s first term was marked by success in extracting cash for perceived wrongdoing, including more than €8bn in antitrust fines from Google and a demand for Apple to cough up €13bn in an illegal state aid case (all of these cases are under appeal). 
But the fines belie the fact that she hasn’t done anything to change the competitive dynamics in digital markets.h
Take Google. The EU took aim at two of its core business drivers: How it steers search traffic to other Google services, and how it uses Android to lock users into its mobile services. Yet the rival companies who were supposedly the beneficiaries of the search case faded away long before the commission took action. And Google’s mobile services — like its Play store for apps — look too deeply entrenched in the Android world to allow much room for competition. Cases like these highlight the difficulty of restraining powerful and self-reinforcing digital platforms. By the time regulators notice — let alone reach the point of pressing for remedies — it is often too late.

European enforcers have brought high-profile antitrust cases against the tech giants, and both activists and members of Congress are calling for action in the United States. This short note identifies ten hard-wired differences between the European and American enforcement regimes that make very it difficult for the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies to emulate their European counterparts. This note also identifies a few other points of contrast between Europe and the United States that affect antitrust enforcement against tech giants going forward.

Gregory J. Werden & Luke M. Froeb1
The European Commission (“EC”) and some national competition authorities in Europe have taken on tech giants in high-profile cases, and more cases are in the works. Activists and members of Congress call for action in the United States, although their calls typically are vague about what action should be taken and by whom. Without criticizing any enforcement action, or the inaction of any enforcer, we explore how Europe systemically differs from the United States in ways that affect enforcement against the tech giants.
Our main point is that numerous hard-wired differences between the European and American enforcement regimes make it very difficult for the United States (“U.S.”) antitrust enforcement agencies to emulate their European Union (“EU”) counterparts. Generally speaking, we do not favor changes to the U.S. regime to...

Europe’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday, October 8, she preferred to use fines or other penalties on rule-busting companies rather than break them up, saying that this approach would be less disruptive to the companies and the market, reported Reuters. 
Vestager is staying on in her job as European Competition Commissioner for another five years and now enjoys additional regulatory power to target the technology industry as part of a broader role ensuring Europe is fit for the digital age. 
According to Reuters, calls from critics and politicians to break up tech giants accused of abusing their position to squash competitors have intensified in recent months, especially in the United States.
Vestager, a former Danish economics minister, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer, notably with a record fine totaling more than €8 billion euros (US$8.8 billion) on Alphabet unit Google for throttling rivals. 
Asked if she would consider breaking up companies that violate rules, Vestager told her confirmation hearing at the European Parliament that it was not her favored option. 
“Breaking up companies, well, this is a tool that we have available, it can be done. The thing is I have obligation to use the least intrusive tool in order to restore fair competition,” she told lawmakers in a packed chamber.

563,"October 8, 2019",“Multi-Homing by all Means”: Russian Competition Policy Towards Digital Platforms,"
By Svetlana Avdasheva
Competition enforcement towards digital platforms in Russia concentrates on the issues of multi-homing for inter-platform competition (competition between digital platforms) and non-discriminatory access for intra-platform competition (competition on digital platforms). Both in antitrust enforcement (Google-2015 and Microsoft-2017 cases in Russia) and under merger approval (Bayer/Monsanto-2018 and Uber/Yandex-2017) theory of harm is based on both anticompetitive exclusionary effects and exploitative effects in adjacent markets. Typical remedies are “non-discriminatory access” and a ban on any form of single-homing clauses. Under international merger approval, the competition authority may elaborate remedies to support the upgrading in adjacent markets. Russian competition enforcement towards digital platforms does not contradict the overall attitude to the platforms in competition law and economics (while being criticized for protectionist intent).

Digital markets in India are growing exponentially and this brings with it complexities in enforcement in all segments of competition law. New forms of collusion using artificial intelligence have emerged. Hub and spoke cartels pose distinct problems. While dealing with digital markets, market definition needs to be nuanced. The Indian authority has had occasion to handle a few cases related to horizontal as well as vertical agreements in the digital space. As regards online resale price maintenance the rules evolved in offline cases are expected to apply, mutatis mutandis. Not insignificant market power in the relevant market is a necessary pre-condition for looking at vertical restraints. The role of data and network effects in abusive conduct was noticed by the Commission in Google I. However, the Commission had no occasion to examine if data is an essential facility. While looking at predatory pricing in the digital market the Commission has been cautious while defining market and dominance. The way price is defined in law, the existing provisions are sufficient to address anti-competitive agreements, including cartels, as also abuse of dominant position, though the Commission has been seen to be cautious not to err on the side of activism. However, the current asset/ turnover thresholds for mandatory merger notification has been found to be inadequate for digital markets, and the recent report of the Competition Law Review Committee has recommended â€śtransaction valueâ€...

Digital publisher Group Nine Media has agreed to acquire women-focused publisher PopSugar, reported The New York Times. This is the latest merger of new-media firms hoping that greater scale will help them sell online ads, where Facebook and Google dominate.
The all-stock deal values PopSugar at more than US$300 million, according to people familiar with the matter, and will give its shareholders more than 30% ownership of the combined company, which will keep the Group Nine Media name. Group Nine’s shareholders will own the rest.
Group Nine—whose properties include The Dodo, a digital outlet focused on animal stories and videos—and news destination NowThis, was valued at more than US$600 million in the deal, the people said. That is consistent with the valuation from its latest funding round last month, the people added. Group Nine, whose largest shareholder is nonfiction TV programmer Discovery, has raised US$190 million to date. The combined company is worth about US$1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Group Nine’s purchase of PopSugar is the third digital-media deal in the past two weeks. Vox Media recently agreed to purchase New York Media in an all-stock deal that valued New York at about US$105 million.

566,"October 8, 2019",The Transaction Value Threshold in Germany – Experiences with the New Size of Transaction Test in Merger Control,"

By Dr. Martin Sauermann, CFA (Bundeskartellamt)1
Introduction
The takeover of WhatsApp by Facebook in 2014 was widely perceived as an eye-opener in the global competition policy community. The case showed that there might be a gap in the system of international merger control regimes in the face of new business models of the digital world. Despite both firms’ undisputed market positions, the case proved challenging for typical turnover based merger control thresholds. In fact, the case was not notifiable in most European jurisdictions due to the companies’ turnover figures. Therefore, in 2017 German and Austrian lawmakers introduced new additional size of transaction tests in their competition laws. These amendments now require notifications of mergers and acquisitions above a certain value, even without requiring the merging parties to fulfill the former pure turnover thresholds. Thus, the amendments enable the German and Austrian competition authorities to control the takeover of low turnover unicorn firms in their infancy. As the European competition community had little experience with transaction value thresholds, the German and Austrian competition authorities published a joint guidance for their application in 2018. Now in 2019, for the first time the authorities have also published some statistics and experiences concerning the application of their law amendments.

The Facebook probeannounced by attorneys general in September now has 40 states signed on to investigate allegations of the social media giant’s anti-competitive practices, The Washington Post reported on Monday (Oct. 7).
Sources told Reuters that several state attorneys general met with US Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Antitrust Division head Makan Delrahim to discuss the investigation.
The probe of Facebook, announced in September, is led by New York and includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia. Several states have raised concerns that Facebook and other big tech companies engage in anti-competitive practices, expose consumer data to potential data breaches and push up advertising prices.
“Today, we held bipartisan conversations with attorneys general from around the country and key officials at both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission about our investigation into Facebook,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement to The Washington Post .
The investigation will evaluate if Facebook has “endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, or increased the price of advertising,” James (D) said in September when the probe was announced.
The meeting came after Reuters and other outlets reported on Sept. 25 that the Justice Department would open an antitrust investigation of Facebook, which also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission.
The new antitrust investigation marks the fourth legal inquiry of Facebook and comes on the heels of investigations launched by the Federal Trade Commission and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. 
There was also a July meeting with AGs from eight states with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to discuss Big Tech’s ramifications.
Facebook isn’t alone when it comes to scrutiny. A Google investigation was announced by a bipartisan group of three dozen state attorneys general led by Texas AG Ken Paxton at a press conference on Sept. 9 outside the U.S. Supreme Court.

568,"October 7, 2019",FTC v. Qualcomm: Origins and Problems,"

By Matthew Spitzer (Northwestern University)1
The
District Court’s opinion finding Qualcomm guilty of antitrust violations in a
case brought by the Federal Trade Commission2 is
on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. This post will show that the circumstances
under which the FTC chose to bring this case should lead everyone, including
the Court of Appeals, to view this case with skepticism.  
The
Federal Trade Commission’s case against Qualcomm for allegedly violating
Section 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization) was initiated in a most unusual
and troubling fashion.
The FTC is supposed to have five members. However, at the time the FTC voted to bring the case, there were only three sitting members. Gridlock between the President and the Senate had prevented filling the vacancies.The vote to bring the case was 2 to 1, along party lines.3There was a written dissent by Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen from the decision to bring the case.One of the two Commissioners who voted to bring the case (Chairperson Edith Ramirez) announced her resignation on January 13, four days before the vote to bring the case.4The vote was taken on January 17, 2017, three days before the inauguration of a new President, during the “lame duck” period. The new President represented a change of the party in power.
How
disquietingly unusual was this procedural setting? Very unusual and very
disquieting, as it turns out.
To
examine this question, I5
scraped the FTC’s website to gather all of the votes on bringing, settling, or
taking court action in antitrust monopolization actions (excluding Hart-Scott-Rodino
filings) since 1994.6
There have been 329 such actions, and the votes are summarized in the table
below. The numbers in the first row indicate votes for, votes against, and
recusals. Thus, 4-0 indicates four votes for, zero against, and no recusals.
And 4-0-1 indicates four votes for, zero against, and one recusal. Thus, the
4-0 vote also indicates that the FTC had only four members, while the 4-0-1
vote shows that the FTC was at full strength. Any row with a “lame duck” period
vote is shown in bold and italics. The category into which the FTC’s decision
to bring an action against Qualcomm falls (2-1) is highlighted.
The
columns may need a bit of explanation. The first column shows the outcome of
the vote in all the cases since 1994 detailed in that row. The second column
shows the total number of cases since 1994 that had that vote. And the third
column shows the total number of cases since 1994 that had that vote and
that were brought in the lame duck period. Thus, the entries in the third
column are also represented in the second column. 
The
first thing to note is that only 3 of the 329 cases were brought by a 2-1 vote.
That is less than 1%. And the only one of those to be brought during the lame
duck period was FTC v. Qualcomm.
Second, if we add in the 3-2 votes, the only others where there is a one-vote
margin, we get 11, or about 3%. Why focus on these? They are the cases where
the wisdom of bringing the case is most suspect. A multimember expert body,
such as the FTC, is supposed to apply its wisdom to the decision to bring a
case. Where the decision is brought on a razor thin vote, the wisdom is also
razor thin. Not surprisingly, only 3% of the cases brought are in this
category. 
To
turn this around, the typical way to bring a case is by unanimous vote. This is, by definition, where all Commissioners
agree. If we sum the 5-0, 4-0, and 4-0-1, 3-0, 3-0-1, and 3-0-2 (all of the
unanimous votes with at least 3 votes in favor) we get 270 of the 329 cases, or
82%. If we throw in the 27 cases with 2-0, 2-0-2, and 2-0-3, we have 297 of the
329 cases, or 90%. Thus, 90% of the cases are unanimous. These are the cases
where our belief is that the case is strongest. And the 4-1 and 3-1 cases lie
in between the unanimous cases and the “razor thin margin” cases in terms of
likely strength of case. 
What about cases brought in the “lame duck” period – between the date of the election of a new President from a different party and the inauguration?7 These are cases where we should be most suspicious that the case is politically motivated. After all, if there were no political motivation for the case, the Commissioners would just put the case on the back burner for a few weeks and allow the new President’s appointees to make the decision about whether to bring the case. There are only nine votes in the lame duck period in the data set, and only one of these had a dissenting vote –  FTC v Qualcomm.

Thus,
the vote to bring FTC v Qualcomm
provides the least wisdom and confidence of any vote to bring any FTC antitrust
case since 1994. The vote, 2-1, was the least likely to signal a meritorious
case in the data set, while bringing it in the lame duck period suggests
political considerations produced it. 
So,
what are the implications of all of this? Everyone – courts, journalists, law
professors, techies, and the general public – should view this case with a
great deal of skepticism. Or, to put the same point differently, there should
be a very high burden of proof on the FTC. 
What happened after the vote to bring the case? On November 6, 2018, Judge Koh handed down an opinion8 finding that Qualcomm violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and ordered far-reaching remedies. These remedies are so broad that they threaten to disrupt the worldwide modem chip business. The remedies have now been stayed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.9 While staying the remedies the court stated that “Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits.”10  The case is now before the Ninth Circuit. I am not surprised that there are serious questions on the merits. The circumstances of bringing this case in the first place virtually guaranteed that there would be questions. One can only hope that the Ninth Circuit will take a very close look at this case, and that the FTC will refrain from bringing any more cases under similar circumstances.

Commission v. Qualcomm Inc., 2018 WL 5848999, Nov. 6, 2018, N.D. Cal.
3 The FTC, after getting a full contingent of
Commissioners, reconsidered the wisdom of bringing the case. The FTC split 2 to
2, with the Chairperson recusing himself because Chair’s former law firm had
represented Qualcomm.
4 How often is the deciding vote in favor of bringing
the case cast by a Commissioner who had already announced her resignation? That
turned out to be more difficult to chase down than the other aspects of this. I
am still working on it.

570,"October 3, 2019",EU: Facebook can be forced to remove content internationally top court rules,"
On Thursday, October 3, the European Union’s top court ruled that lower court judges could order Facebook to remove illegal comments from its platform, expanding on the power individual countries have to extend content bans across the world. 
The European Court of Justice came to its decision after an Austrian politician, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, requested an order that would force Facebook to remove comments that were “harmful to her reputation.” Glawischnig-Piesczek argued that Facebook should remove the comments and limit access to them worldwide. The court ruled against Facebook, dealing a heavy hit on tech companies as lawmakers and platforms continue to discuss how to regulate online speech.
“EU law does not preclude a host provider like Facebook from being ordered to remove identical and, in certain circumstances, equivalent comments previously declared to be illegal,” the court said in a statement. “In addition, EU law does not preclude such an injunction from producing effects worldwide, within the framework of the relevant international law.”
In its ruling, the European Court of Justice affirms that companies like Facebook and Twitter are not liable for the content posted on their platforms, but that exemption does not prohibit the courts from ordering the companies to take down illegal content. Late last month, this same court ruled that Google doesn’t need to remove links taken down from “right to be forgotten” requests worldwide. But illegal content can be limited internationally, according to Thursday’s Facebook ruling.

The Cupertino, California-based company plans to release a software update later this year that will help outside messaging applications work better with the Siri digital assistant.
Right now, when iPhone users ask Siri to call or message a friend, the system defaults to Apple’s Phone or iMessage apps. If you want to use WhatsApp or Skype, you have to specifically say that.

A US judge on Monday, September 30, dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit against several large banks for allegedly rigging the market for Mexican government bonds, according to Reuters.
JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Citigroup, and Bank of America are among 10 financial companies that had been accused in the lawsuit of benefiting from manipulating the market for Mexican government bonds.
US District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan said in his opinion he was dismissing the lawsuit because the plaintiffs failed to allege a direct link between each defendant and a conspiracy. 
According to Reuters, Oetken said he never determined if there was a plausible existence of an antitrust conspiracy, but said the plaintiffs could try to amend their complaint. 
Todd Seaver, a lawyer for the pension funds, said his team was evaluating the ruling and had no further comment.

575,"September 26, 2019",US: DOJ seeks Facebook antitrust probe,"
US Attorney General William Barr is urging the US Justice Department to investigate Facebook to determine whether it violated federal antitrust laws, Reuters reported on Wednesday, September 25. 
This new investigation comes on the heels of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe seeking to discover if Facebook stifled competition.
The new antitrust investigation marks the fourth legal inquiry into of Facebook. 
Another investigation of Facebook was launched earlier in September by a bipartisan group of attorneys general led by Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. Attorneys general from 39 states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia, have all signed a letter to the FTC asking it to look at a large range of factors when it comes to how Big Tech is harming consumers.
“We continue to engage in bipartisan conversations about the unchecked power of large tech companies,” James said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal on September 3. “The attorneys general involved have concerns over the control of personal data by large tech companies and will hold them accountable for anti-competitive practices that endanger privacy and consumer data.”
There was also a July meeting with AGs from eight states with US Attorney General William Barr to discuss Big Tech’s ramifications.
Facebook isn’t alone when it comes to scrutiny. A Google investigation was announced at a press conference on September 9 outside the U.S. Supreme Court. A bipartisan group of three dozen state attorneys general is also joining the investigation.
Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the Google probe. At issue is Google’s impact on digital advertising markets and the possible harm this might have caused to consumers, the sources told the newspaper.
Facebook recently paid US$5 billion to settle charges from FTC allegations over deceptive practices that lured users to give up their personal data. The company is still under investigation regarding its purchase of Instagram.

576,"September 25, 2019",UK: PayPal fined over iZettle buy,"
According to a report from Reuters, the UK competition regulator has fined US payments company PayPal for breaching rules concerning its US$2.2 billion acquisition of Swedish start-up iZettle. 
PayPal completed its tie-up with iZettle in September 2018, bringing together the two largest suppliers of mobile point-of-sale devices in the UK and triggering an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). 
That month, the CMA issued an enforcement order that halted integration of the businesses in the UK while the watchdog’s probe continued. The CMA warned that the deal could lead to a “substantial lessening of competition in any market or markets in the United Kingdom” and launched a formal merger inquiry one month later. 
On Tuesday, September 24, the regulator announced PayPal had flouted its rules by cross-selling to customers based in the UK, resulting in a £250,000 (US$308,984) fine.

 By Kevin O’Connor, Wall Street Journal
In the early days of DoubleClick, a prospective employee asked what my ultimate goals were for the newly formed internet advertising company. With the arrogance of a young startup founder, I responded, “To be broken up by the Department of Justice.”
That was 1996, and we were still trying to persuade established companies to buy ads on our newfangled platform, so my answer was obviously a joke. Yet in 2007 Google announced it was acquiring DoubleClick, and now the company I used to lead is a target of Justice’s antitrust investigation…

578,"September 22, 2019",Australia: Facebook expands Local News Accelerator,"
The Facebook Journalism Project, which works with publishers around the world through training, has announced the expansion of its Local News Accelerator program to Australia and New Zealand.
The program will launch in partnership with the Walkley Foundation and support 11 publishers for three months to boost direct reader revenue through subscriptions, memberships, and one-off payments.
Participating partners include News Corp, Australian Community Media, The Guardian, The Conversation, Crikey, The West Australian, The New Daily, Schwartz Media, and New Zealand publishers The New Zealand Herald, The Spinoff, and Newsroom.
The Accelerator program provides platform-agnostic training, coaching and project funding for news organisations to connect with and monetise their audiences on and off Facebook.
Louisa Graham, chief executive of the Walkley Foundation, said, “Facebook’s Accelerator Program is designed to support Australian newsrooms in maximising new revenue streams. This will ultimately allow news organisations to continue their important work and report on the issues that matter to Australian society.”
The Australia and New Zealand launch of the Accelerator Program follows hot on the heels of Facebook’s response to the ACCC Digital Platforms Final Report, which saw the social media giant targeted alongside Google. The report, suggested the two tech companies have too much power in the Australian market and have hurt publishers with their monopoly ...

579,"September 19, 2019",The new monopolies: reining in big tech,"
By Sandra Jones, Chicago Booth
Chicago Booth’s Stigler Center presents suggestions on how to rein in digital platforms based on yearlong multidisciplinary research
Digital platforms such as Google and Facebook have grown exponentially, swallowed rivals, and revolutionized the world of media, demonstrating increasing potential to harm consumers, even as they provide convenient and valued services.
On the campaign trail, many candidates are demanding new rules, but which ones are justified? To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.
The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released today, identifies the trouble with America’s largest technology companies in four areas—market structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.
“We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,” says Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. “Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, pr...

580,"September 17, 2019",US: Senate panel grills DOJ and FTC chiefs over their antitrust probes into Big Tech,"
Officials from the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission were questioned  on Tuesday (September 17) at a Capitol Hill hearing that focused in part on their antitrust probes of Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet’s Google.
Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, and FTC Chairman Joseph Simons largely declined to offer specifics about the investigations, though Delrahim did disclose that his agency has close to several dozen attorneys doing the work, and he said the Justice Department is cooperating with states’ attorneys general, who have launched their own probes.
Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among the lawmakers who argued for more aggressive actions.
“The fact that you’re coming here without any specifics, I think, reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit. Call it a culture of capitulation. What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech, and no immediate prospect of urgency,” said Blumenthal, speaking at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee.
In a similar vein, analysts at Height Capital Markets predicted in a note Tuesday that there will be “3-5 years before any antitrust action is taken against Big Tech companies given the nascent stages of the DOJ’s and FTC’s investigations.”
In response to Blumenthal’s criticism, the FTC’s Simons said: “We have the same concerns you have, and th...

581,"September 17, 2019","US: Bill Gates defends Big Tech, says firms shouldn’t be broken up","
Bill Gates doesn’t think it’s a good idea to break up the biggest US tech companies, reported Bloomberg. 

The Microsoft co-founder and former chief executive officer battled the Justice Department for years in the late 1990s in a bruising antitrust case.
At issue was the software giant’s bundling of its Internet Explorer browser with Windows as a way to maintain its dominance in PC operating systems. Ultimately, Microsoft remained intact.
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft is one of the few big US technology companies not under regulatory scrutiny in Washington. The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and a congressional committee are all scrutinizing Big Tech companies from Alphabet’s Google to Facebook and Amazon, that Washington has concluded have gotten too big and too powerful.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, has made a forceful and detailed plan about how she would go about breaking them up.
Gates however said, “You have to really think; is that the best thing?” in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “If there’s a way the company’s behaving that you want to get rid of, then, you should just say, ‘OK, that’s a banned behavior.’ But splitting the company in two, and having two people doing the bad thing — that doesn’t seem like a solution.”

582,"September 17, 2019",US: Top antitrust officials admit to infighting on big tech probe,"
The top US antitrust regulators admitted on Tuesday they had wasted time arguing over who would investigate which tech company as they take on major probes of firms like Alphabet’s Google for using their market power unfairly.
The Justice Department’s antitrust division chief, Makan Delrahim, acknowledged instances where officials’ time “is wasted on those kinds of squabbles.”
The hearing was a tough one for Delrahim and Joe Simons, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who were criticized by lawmakers at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel for overlapping on the probes, and for other matters.
Reuters and others reported in June that the agencies had divided up the companies, with Justice taking Google and Apple , while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.
The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms. This led some industry observers to question whether the two investigations would overlap.

583,"September 16, 2019",US: FTC letter to DOJ raises concerns over Big Tech probes,"


US antitrust regulators investigating the giants of the tech industry are at odds over recent probes. This was made clear by the way of  the delivery of a letter from the FTC to the DOJ recently, reported the Wall Street Journal.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division both assert authority to investigate whether US companies are violating antitrust law by squeezing out competition. According to the Journal, in recent months, the two entities, as well as a number of state attorneys general, have launched high-profile scrutiny of tech giants such as Alphabet’s Google and Facebook  that have come to dominate nearly every aspect of Americans’ digital lives.
In a letter obtained by the Journal, sent late last week to the Justice Department, the FTC complained about the department’s behavior and raised concerns about recent interactions between the two agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.
The previously undisclosed letter, signed by FTC Chairman Joe Simons, raises the prospect that a longstanding power-sharing agreement between the agencies is fraying. It is also raising broader concerns that the boiling tension could eventually derail the agencies’ focus on so-called Big Tech, among the biggest and most significant undertakings that either of them has conducted in years.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust matters, Republican Mike Lee of Utah, said he plans to ask abou...

584,"September 16, 2019",US: Amazon changed search algorithm to boost profitable products?,"
Amazon has altered its search algorithm in a way that would boost profits for the online retail giant despite pushback against the decision from within the company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, September 16.
The change reportedly came last year with a tweak that prioritizes products that are more profitable for Amazon⁠—including its own brands—in a departure from its long-standing practice of displaying products in order of relevance to a user’s search terms.
According to the Journal, Amazon’s retail business was behind the push for the product search system to take profitability into account. Programmers tasked with running the search algorithm—a group called A9—reportedly opposed the idea as running counter to the company’s ethos of putting the customer above all else.
Amazon’s legal team also raised concerns about the idea, according to the Journal, pointing out that the decision could draw scrutiny from the European Union, which had fined Google US$2.7 billion in 2017 for elevating its own comparison shopping service in its search results.
In an emailed statement to the Journal, the company wrote said it has not “changed the criteria we use to rank search results to include profitability.”
“Amazon designs its shopping and discovery experience to feature the products customers will want, regardless of whether they are our own brands or products offered by our selling partners,” Amazon spokeswoman Angie Newman...

585,"September 15, 2019",EU: Tech regulators may impose new data rules,"
The European Union’s (EU) Antitrust Chief Margrethe Vestager said new rules may be imposed to ensure companies that collect data are not misusing it, according to a report by Reuters.
Vestager, who made the comments on Friday, September 13, was recently appointed to stay in her position as European competition commissioner for another five years. Her comments could mean there will be new rules on the horizon to specifically cover how companies handle data.
So far, most data issues with tech companies have been handled on a case-by-case analysis, without specific regulatory guidelines. Vestager has fined Google and Qualcomm around US$10 billion euros after they were found to have squashed competition.
“If we want to define the market, to set out what’s acceptable and what isn’t, then what we need is not more competition enforcement. We need regulation,” she said in Copenhagen. “So we may also need broader rules to make sure that the way companies collect and use data doesn’t harm the fundamental values of our society.”
Vestager said the data protection rules that were put in place in 2018 did allow for control over personal data, but fell short when it came to tech companies using data to make conclusions about individuals or in terms of maliciously undermining democracy.
In July, it was reported that Amazon would face a major investigation by the Commission. The probe had been ongoing, but there were questions about whether it would grow wider....

Rohit Chopra, a commissioner with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said that fining Big Tech companies won’t have any real effect on changing the way they run and that more may need to be done, according to a report by CNBC.
“We’re not going to solve some of these problems just by small-time fines that aren’t going to change the underlying business model of these firms,” he said. “We actually have to take a hard look at whether these behemoths are killing off innovation and competition.”
Chopra voted against the recent US$170 million fine of YouTube, as well as Facebook’s US$5 billion fine. Facebook is also being investigated by the FTC in an antitrust probe.
There are government-wide investigations into Big Tech companies, as last week attorneys general across the US said they were going to start investigating Facebook.
Google is facing a similar issue, not only from attorneys general, but also from regulators in the European Union. Chopra applauded the effort to have “all hands on deck.”
“We have to act if we see that they are breaking the law,” he said.
Amazon is also in the FTC’s crosshairs. The Commission is reportedly interviewing small merchants and sellers. The House Judiciary Committee recently requested some documents from Facebook, Apple, and Google in yet another probe into the industry.
Also in the mix is the Justice Department, which is conducting an antitrust probe of its own.

Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the Koch family, announced a new ad campaign defending Google and Facebook from antitrust probes launched by state attorneys general in the past week.
On Tuesday, September 10, the group urged the state officials to exercise restraint in going after the companies, saying in an announcement that “consumers will be worse off if antitrust laws are used to advance a political agenda by threatening or breaking up successful companies.”
“It’s completely appropriate for state attorneys general to launch this investigation, as long as it isn’t used to create a political spectacle,” Americans for Prosperity’s tech policy analyst, Billy Easley, said in a statement. “There are serious consequences to abusing this kind of enforcement that create troubling ripple effects for American workers and families. The AGs involved should not use this investigation as a means to score political points.”
The ads simply say, “Don’t let government abuse antitrust authority” and direct users to a page that prods them to contact their state attorney general.
Fifty attorneys general announced a major investigation into Google’s market dominance on Monday and a smaller group of nine offices launched a similar investigation into Facebook last week.

According to Bloomberg, investigators with the Federal Trade Commission have started interviewing small businesses about how much revenue they make on Amazon versus other online marketplaces like Walmart or eBay.
Citing three merchants, the report claims multiple attorneys and an economist have been conducting interviews that last 90 minutes. Antitrust experts quoted by Bloomberg claim the length of the interviews and the people involved suggest a serious probe of Amazon’s business, reported Bloomberg.
A reported probe comes as tech giants such as Amazon face increased scrutiny from lawmakers over their business practices. In July, the Justice Department stated it was reviewing online platforms such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Twitter over possible anti-competitive and anti-consumer actions.

Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who has taken on Apple, Amazon, and Google, will stay in charge of Europe’s competition rules and take charge of EU digital policy, reported the Financial Times. 
Appointed to an unprecedented second term as the EU’s Competition Commissioner, Vestager will also oversee EU digital policy and will have the job title of “executive vice-president, Europe fit for the digital age.”
Vestager, who said she was “happy for and humbled by the task ahead,” has been one of the most high-profile members of the current EU executive. Her competition job, in charge of vetting mergers and breaking up cartels, has always been a powerful position in the EU commission, and the Danish politician has won renown beyond Brussels by forcing Apple to pay €14 billion in unpaid taxes and fining Facebook for misleading regulators.
Under her new roles as both Commission executive vice president for digital and competition chief, she will have unprecedented power to direct how Europe tackles the dominance of Big Tech, promotes local players and sets rules for artificial intelligence and the use of big data.
Vestager has been given new powers to tap into the EU’s legions of bureaucrats in Brussels to both inform and set legislation. This access to her own staff and resources, including the bloc’s powerful and well-resourced competition authority, means that Vestager will have more power to direct policy than vice presidents...

The new head of South Korea’s antitrust regulator on Tuesday, September 10, said the agency will crack down on tech companies over their abuse of monopoly power and dominant market position, reported the Korean Herald.
Joh Sung-wook, the chairwoman of the Fair Trade Commission, said in her inaugural speech that the move is meant to facilitate market innovation, but she did not elaborate. She said last month that the antitrust regulator has been looking into alleged unfair trade practices by two US tech giants, Google and Apple as well as South Korea’s top portal operator, Naver.
Joh said the Commission will tackle lingering practices by large companies to award lucrative business contracts to their subsidiaries.
According to the Korean Herald, South Korea has been pushing to stem unfair business practices and level the playing field for smaller firms in a country that has been dominated by family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, for decades.

For Big Tech, expect fireworks for fall, or a September to remember.
This Thursday, September 12, the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee will hold a hearing on issues top of mind in the digital realm, touching on how data and privacy affect competition online, and specifically, for online marketplaces.
The witness list is varied and international in scope. Before the day is through, and as detailed by Bloomberg, the panel will have heard from: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims; former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman, who now is a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School; Roslyn Layton, visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra.
This is the third hearing in a series focused on larger tech firms and economic power that has been held by Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who serves as subcommittee chairman.
Thus far, the other hearings and testimony have focused on the impact that marquee names, such as Google and Facebook, have had on the media industry.
The second hearing focused on innovation and competitive impact on the tech space, and panelists included executives from Apple, Amazon, and Google.
This time around, and at least thus far, the Thursday hearing does not feature appearances from company executives. But the hearings, ongoing as they are, take on new significance against the backdrop where regulatory scrutiny of tech ...

594,"September 9, 2019",How Each Big Tech Company May Be Targeted by Regulators,"
By Jack Nicas, Karen Weise and Mike Isaac (New York Times)
Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have been the envy of corporate America, admired for their size, influence and remarkable growth.
Now that success is attracting a different kind of spotlight. In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.
The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the antitrust arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office said in a statement that it will announce on Monday, September 9, a multi-state probe of large tech companies, reported Reuters. 
That probe, which will be announced Monday outside the US Supreme Court, will include an investigation of Google and its sway in the digital advertising market. 
According to the Walls Street Journal, formal civil subpoenas are likely to begin going out from that effort soon. The investigation will examine Google’s impact on digital advertising and information markets, according to one of the people, as well as whether the firm has stifled innovation or harmed consumer choice and privacy.
Paxton’s office did not name the companies, but the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, Apple, and Amazon for potential violations of antitrust law.

Alphabet announced on Friday, September 6, it had received a civil investigative demand from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on August 30 seeking information and documents relating to its prior antitrust investigations in the United States and elsewhere.
“On August 30, 2019, Alphabet received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations in the United States and elsewhere,” the company wrote in the filing. “We expect to receive in the future similar investigative demands from state attorneys general.”
The investigation will focus on the company’s dominant position in digital advertising markets and possible consumer harm, according to Washington Post.
The company stated it would continue to cooperate with the DOJ, federal, and US state regulators, and other regulators around the world.

According to CNN, the attorneys general of eight states and the District of Columbia are launching an antitrust investigation into Facebook, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Friday.
The investigation is expected to focus on Facebook’s impact on advertising prices, data and consumer privacy and the company’s previous acquisitions, including Instagram and WhatsApp.
“I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk,” James said in a statement. “We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook’s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, or increased the price of advertising.”
The multi-state coalition includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee, James said. 
The announcement comes days before dozens of states led by Texas are expected to launch a separate antitrust investigation targeting Google and its advertising practices, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN Business, in another probe that adds pressure on Silicon Valley’s biggest platforms.

South Korea’s incoming competition chief Joh Sung-wook appears to have taken a leaf out of European counterpart Margrethe Vestager’s book as she sets her sights on tech giants including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, reported Nikkei. 
In her first media appearance since President Moon Jae-in nominated her to lead South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, Joh identified reducing data monopolies and enforcing better protections for customer information as two of her biggest priorities.
“We will analyze unfair activities of leading companies in the ICT sector, such as Google, Apple and Naver, which we are currently investigating,” Joh told reporters in Seoul last week.
Joh’s comments signal a shift in focus for the competition watchdog after outgoing commissioner Kim Sang-jo, known as the “chaebol sniper,” spent the last few years targeting the country’s powerful family-run conglomerates.

YouTube and its parent company Google have agreed to pay US$170 million to US regulators after being accused of violating children’s privacy.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Wednesday, September 4, the companies will pay the amount to settle claims the video-sharing website illegally collected personal information from children without their parents’ consent.
YouTube was accused of using cookies, which track users across the internet, on channels directed at children without first getting parents’ consent. Regulators said the platform earned millions of dollars by allowing companies to target advertisements at those children.
Joe Simons, the FTC chair, said in a statement, “YouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients. Yet when it came to complying with COPPA [the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act], the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids. There’s no excuse for YouTube’s violations of the law.”

By Adam Satariano, The New York Times
Casper Klynge, a career diplomat from Denmark, has worked in some of the world’s most turbulent places. He once spent 18 months embroiled in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. For two years, he led a crisis management mission in Kosovo.
Yet Mr. Klynge, 46, says his toughest foreign posting may be the one he has now: as the world’s first foreign ambassador to the technology industry.
In 2017, Denmark became the first nation to formally create a diplomatic post to represent its interests before companies such as Facebook and Google. After Denmark determined that tech behemoths now have as much power as many governments — if not more — Mr. Klynge was sent to Silicon Valley.
“What has the biggest impact on daily society? A country in southern Europe, or in Southeast Asia, or Latin America, or would it be the big technology platforms?” Mr. Klynge said in an interview last month at a cafe in central Copenhagen during an annual meeting of Denmark’s diplomatic corps. “Our values, our institutions, democracy, human rights, in my view, are being challenged right now because of the emergence of new technologies.”

Evidence is being gathered on US big tech companies as the European Commission prepares for new leadership, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, September 3.
Within 100 days of taking office on November 1, President-elect Ursula von der Leyen and her team indicate there will be new laws governing artificial intelligence (AI) and how tech companies like Facebook use big data. 
Big tech investigations were already initiated by Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and could end with multimillion-dollar fines. Facebook and Amazon deny wrongdoing.
Alphabet’s Google has already been hit with US$9.4 billion in fines resulting from three separate EU investigations, and a fourth is underway.
“There is a frenzy of pitching ideas to her,” a source told the WSJ. 
Although tech companies have expressed they felt unfairly singled out, they do want to make peace with lawmakers.
“We want to work with governments and policymakers to design the sort of smart regulation that fosters competition, encourages innovation and protects consumers,” said a Facebook spokeswoman.
Regulation, however, should be limited so new technology can flourish. “New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse,” Michael Punke, vice president at Amazon Web Services, wrote in a blog post. 
Laws are already being formulated concerning facial recognition and the use of robots and algorithms.

The  Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) announced Thursday, August 29, it has compiled draft guidelines for tighter regulation of technology giants in order to strengthen protection of customer data, and aims to introduce the first such rules as early as October.
The antitrust watchdog stated the guidelines are designed to address the concern about major tech companies, such as Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook, and Google, obtaining personal data by making use of their “superior bargaining position.”
These companies are facing growing criticism that they are discouraging new companies from entering the market, by monopolizing customer data through their platforms to bolster their competitive positions.
The new guidelines will be applied to companies providing online shopping, social media, search engines and video, music, and app distribution, the Commission stated.

By Nancy Scola & Margaret Harding McGill, Politico
Executives from some of the biggest U.S. news organizations met with a British economist last fall at Washington’s exclusive Metropolitan Club to strategize on a mutual obsession: getting their industry out from under the thumb of Google and Facebook.
Over a breakfast of bacon and eggs in a private banquet room, executives from CNN, USA Today and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones listened intently as Dame Frances Cairncross described how British publishers are navigating the internet giants’ domination of the news business, an attendee from the media delegation told POLITICO. During the session, the details of which have not been previously disclosed, Cairncross in turn sought the perspective of the American media for a report, commissioned by then-Prime Minister Theresa May, on the fate of journalism in the digital age.
The meetingwas part of an ongoing campaign by news publishers in the U.S. and Europe to counter the growing power of Silicon Valley — a significant, if often overlooked, aspect of the anti-tech backlash brewing on both sides of the Atlantic. And it comes amid an existential struggle for most U.S. news companies, at a time when Google and Facebook control 60 percent of online ad dollars and can decide the fate of newsrooms by tweaking their algorithms.

605,"August 29, 2019",Why France’s Antitrust Cop Is Wary of Apple Pay and Deadly Deals,"
 By Gaspard Sebag and Aoife White, Bloomberg
France’s Isabelle de Silva may be about to become Europe’s most feared antitrust regulator as Margrethe Vestager’s term as European Union competition commissioner winds down.
De Silva, 49, was picked to head France’s antitrust arm in 2016 and immediately grabbed headlines fining firms owned by billionaire Patrick Drahi. Since then her achievements have been somewhat overshadowed by those of her EU counterpart who doled out massive penalties to the likes of Google.
That may be changing as the EU readjusts amid a top jobs reshuffle in the coming weeks and as de Silva enters a more assertive phase of her five-year term as president of the Autorite de la Concurrence.
In an interview at her Paris office last month, de Silva said she’s set her sights on Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc.’s forays into online payments. She’s also wary of the power Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google could gain via their digital assistants.
But she also said that merger watchdogs need more power to vet so-called killer acquisitions, where big companies snap up fledgling firms and their ideas.
“There can be major competition concerns the instant new actors gain strong positions in the payment sector while also having strongholds elsewhere,” de Silva said, referring to products such as Apple Pay. “It could amount to existing dominant market po...

The Justice Department’s antitrust division has lost another high-ranking official with the departure of top deputy Andrew Finch, two sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg Law.
The leadership change was first announced by Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ’s antitrust division, during an American Bar Association conference last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the sources who attended the meeting said. The people did not want to be identified since the matter isn’t public yet. The meeting wasn’t open to the press. 
Barry Nigro, who is currently a deputy assistant attorney general, has accepted an offer to take over Finch’s role as principal deputy assistant attorney general, according to one of the sources. 
Nigro, who has been at the DOJ since August 2017, will now step up to a higher profile role at the antitrust division as he will be second in command and help oversee all civil and criminal antitrust enforcement, including the DOJ’s probes into big tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has criticized corporate media and accused some outlets of a bias against his campaign, vowed to clamp down on media mergers and toughen enforcement of antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google, reported Reuters.
In an editorial, Sanders, a US  senator from Vermont, wrote that as president he would seek a moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations, more funding for “non-profit civic-minded media,” and moves to prevent Facebook and Google from siphoning off advertising revenues from news organizations. 
Sanders also said he would limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide, and require media corporations to disclose whether their merger proposals would involve “significant” journalism layoffs. 
“Today, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read, and download,” Sanders wrote in a Columbia Journalism Review editorial published on Monday, August 26. 
“Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and ‘benevolent’ billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.”

Will Big Tech face bigger tax bills on an international stage?
Beyond the debates on data privacy and compliance, marquee names in technology face greater scrutiny from various governments, and perhaps bigger tax bills, too.
In India, the Central Board of Direct Taxes, is looking at ways to bring new taxes to bear on companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, among others, according to timesnownews.com. The site reported that tax policymakers will hold meetings in September at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. At least one unnamed official has been quoted as stating that “all countries are trying to find a consensus on major tech companies.”
In other news regarding tax policy, in Egypt, the government, as reported by menabytes.com, is “close” to issuing new income tax regulations, in draft form, that would tax advertisements posted online across platforms and social media sites.
As reported, the tax imposed could be as much as 20% on social media and search ads. The tax would reportedly be levied on the total cost of the ads.
In Kenya, the country’s revenue authority has stated it will seek to introduce a digital tax on products and services that are delivered across digital platforms, through a Value Added Tax. The new digital tax may also apply to what are known as Over the Top (OTT) Services and streaming services, as reported by gadgets-africa.com.

There is no shortage of people arguing that America’s large technology companies — namely Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google — have gotten too big and too powerful. That has helped spur the scrutiny by the government officials.
But what to do about the issue? On that, the industry’s critics are split.

According to Reuters, Thyssenkrupp on Thursday, August 22, stated it was filing a complaint with a European court to dispute an antitrust decision that blocks a planned joint venture with Tata Steel.
The complaint to the General Court of the European Union—seen as a symbolic move—comes after the Commission in June vetoed plans to create Europe’s second-biggest steelmaker, fearing it would overly hurt competition.
The Commission was most concerned about the two companies’ combined position in the area of automotive and packaging steel, resulting in a remedy proposal Thyssenkrupp said would have been sufficient. Brussels disagreed.
“In its competitive assessment of the product groups of packaging steel and hot-dip galvanized steel for the automotive industry, the Commission has for the first time set out a restrictive market definition that unduly extends the scope of the existing competition law,” Thyssenkrupp said in a statement.
It was already clear in early May that Brussels would block the deal, causing a strategic U-turn at the group which includes a planned stock market listing or sale of its elevators division.

Airline technology company Sabre plans to fight an antitrust lawsuit filed Tuesday, August 20, by the Justice Department over the Southlake-based company’s US$360 million purchase of competitor Farelogix. 
Sabre agreed to buy Miami-based Farelogix in November, but the government’s Antitrust Division sued to stop the merger. The government argues the deal would be harmful to competition.
“Sabre’s proposed acquisition of Farelogix is a dominant firm’s attempt to take out a disruptive competitor that has been an important source of competition and innovation,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim. “If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would likely result in higher prices, reduced quality, and less innovation for airlines and, ultimately, traveling American consumers.”
Both Sabre and Farelogix provide technology systems that help airlines, such as American Airlines, sell tickets to passengers. Sabre operates a “global distribution system” that allows airlines, travel agents, hotels, car rental agencies, and other companies to manage inventory in real-time across the world.

After the Fiat Chrysler Alliance (FCA)-proposed merger with Renault collapsed in June, reports in the Italian media suggest that the shelved deal could be revived and that talks have been taking place between the companies.
The proposed merger appeared to collapse due to political difficulties associated with existing shareholdings that are part of the Renault-Nissan Alliance. The French government put the brakes on progress at a Renault board meeting, claiming more time was needed to obtain Nissan’s backing for the proposed merger.
However, a report Wednesday, August 21, in Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 ore citing “well informed” sources says that dialogue between the companies has continued, with the aim of securing a merger deal that has backing from all parties – including the French government and Nissan as well as major FCA shareholders. In particular, progress is said to have been made in phone calls between Renault chief Dominique Senard and Nissan CEO Hiroko Saikawa.

In a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday, August 20, the government claims says Sabre pursued the US$360 million deal to eliminate a competitor that has disrupted the market with more modern technology.
The Department claims if Sabre succeeds, it will lead to higher prices and less innovation for airlines and their customers.
Sabre announced that it will challenge the lawsuit and is confident of winning. It says the companies offer complementary services.
Sabre is based in Southlake, Texas, and started as the reservations arm of American Airlines. It’s the largest seller of services that let airlines sell flights through travel agents. Sabre had planned to close the deal Wednesday.

Officials said they’re concerned about how Libra may create “possible competition restrictions” on the information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data, according to the document, which is a standard part of an early-stage EU inquiry to gather information.
The investigation into founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitions to take on traditional cash adds to another preliminary EU investigation into how Facebook may unfairly use its power to squeeze rival apps.

616,"August 20, 2019",US: Writers union says talent agents are violating antitrust law,"
The Writers Guild of America filed claims Monday, August 19, in federal court alleging the entertainment industry’s biggest talent agencies are violating antitrust and anti-racketeering laws, the latest move in a long and heated battle between those who write scripts and the agents who represent them.
The filings are a response to lawsuits filed by three agencies in recent months alleging the Writers Guild has itself violated antitrust law with organized actions in the dispute, including the mass firing of agents by thousands of writers in April.
At issue are so-called packaging fees, where talent agencies combine elements including writers, scripts, or actors—most often on television series—and sell them directly to studios as a unit.
Writers have long held that the practice, common for decades in Hollywood, takes money that should rightfully be theirs and puts it in agents’ pockets. They are now saying that it violates federal law, in part by agents taking money directly from studios before the writers see it.
“The way this should be working is there should be payment to the employees, and the employee pays commission to their representative,” Tony Segall, general counsel for the Writers Guild of America West, told The Associated Press on Monday. “That’s not the way it works, which we think is a big problem.”
The suit alleges the major agencies have conspired to fix the price of packaging fees, and have been strong-arming smalle...

617,"August 20, 2019",How Elizabeth Warren came up with a plan to break up Big Tech,"
By Sheelah Kolhatkar, The New Yorker
When Robert Bork published “The Antitrust Paradox,” in 1978, concerns about monopolies suppressing competition were not new. The first U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890; during the early years of the twentieth century, President Theodore Roosevelt used the law to break up Standard Oil and to apply new regulations to the dominant railroad companies. In 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Act, which granted powers to the Department of Justice and the newly created Federal Trade Commission to insure companies did not become too dominant in the first place. President Franklin Roosevelt and other New Deal policymakers continued the tradition of aggressive antitrust enforcement. But Bork, a professor at Yale Law School and later a nominee for the Supreme Court, argued that many of these antitrust measures had been unnecessary. When deciding whether a particular enterprise posed an antitrust threat, he wrote, the government should only take action in cases where concentration of power in the market harmed consumers in the form of higher prices. In the decade after Bork published his influential treatise, there was a boom in corporate mergers as airlines, energy companies, pharmaceutical firms, and media conglomerates acquired their competitors; as long as it could plausibly be argued that the prices consumers paid for products wouldn’t rise, regulators generally allowed the deals to proceed.
Bork’s consumer...

618,"August 19, 2019",US: State AGs will reportedly kick off antitrust investigation into tech giants,"
A group of state attorneys general is preparing to move forward with a joint antitrust investigation of big technology companies. Citing sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the probe could be launched in September and could look into whether companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon use their power to stifle competition in the market.
It follows the Department of Justice last month announcing its own antitrust reviewof how online platforms achieved market power and whether they are using that power to reduce competition and stifle innovation. And that investigation followed the Federal Trade Commission in February forming a task force to monitor competition among tech platforms.
“A dozen” state attorneys general met with officials from the Department of Justice in July to discuss the investigation, the report said.
Amazon and the Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Google pointed to its antitrust testimony from last month before the House Committee on the Judiciary, when it said it has “helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants.” Facebook declined to comment.
“The department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the Justice Department said on July 23.

619,"August 19, 2019",US: Amazon execs donated to antitrust investigator’s campaign,"
Amazon’s top executives allegedly made donations to the chair in charge of investigating the eCommerce giant, CNBC reported on Sunday.
The donations were reportedly made two months before lawmakers were planning to interrogate Amazon as part of a bigger antitrust probe that also involved Apple, Facebook and Google.
The main benefactor of the campaign funds was reportedly Rep. David Cicilline (Rhode Island), the head of the House antitrust investigation. He allegedly started getting donations in late May from five Amazon senior executives, the article said.
Amazon’s CEO of Worldwide Consumers Jeff Wilke, general counsel David Zapolsky, SVP of Worldwide Operations Dave Clark, and SVP of North America Consumer Doug Herrington contributed US$2,800 each, the maximum donation allowed. CFO Brian Olsavsky donated US$1,500.
CNBC reported there were no 2019 donations to Cicilline’s campaign from the other tech companies involved in the antitrust probe.
Experts said the timing of Amazon executives’ payments likely reflects the company’s heightened urgency over growing regulatory scrutiny, the article said.
“It suggests a greater sense of pressure or threat of regulation from Congress, especially given the growing bipartisan attention being directed to this issue,” Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political science professor at Columbia University, told CNBC.
CNBC stated an Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. Cicilline’s representative emailed the news outlet and said t...

Boston Scientific announced on Monday, August 19, that it finished its US$4 billion acquisition of BTG. The Marlborough, Massachusetts-based medtech giant reported that the transaction will be immaterial to adjusted earnings per share this year, thanks to – among other factors – the deal closing later than initially anticipated.
To satisfy antitrust regulators, Boston Scientific is also in the process of selling its global embolic microspheres portfolio to Varian Medical Systems. Earlier this month, Boston Scientific got the official go-ahead from the Federal Trade Commission and British regulators.
The largest division of British medtech company BTG makes devices for vascular and oncology applications. BTG also makes overdose and antivenin drugs for snakebites.
“The addition of the BTG Interventional Medicine portfolio reinforces our category leadership strategy and enables us to offer best-in-class technologies, unparalleled clinical evidence and a strengthened commercial infrastructure to support physicians treating some of the most challenging diseases impacting patient health around the world,” Boston Scientific’s chairman & CEO Mike Mahoney said in prepared remarks.

El jefe de la Comisión Federal de Comercio de los Estados Unidos (FTC, por sus siglas en inglés) dijo que estaría dispuesto a dividir las compañías tecnológicas si fuera necesario, según un informe de Bloomberg.
La FTC está investigando si Facebook y otras grandes compañías tecnológicas están perjudicando la competencia al comprar compañías tecnológicas más pequeñas y fusionarse con ellas. El presidente de la FTC, Joe Simons, dijo que sabe que dividir las compañías sería un desafío, pero que lo haría si fuera la forma correcta de recuperar un nivel saludable de competencia.
“Si es necesario, lo haces”, dijo Simons. “No es ideal porque es muy desordenado. Pero si tienes que hacerlo, tienes que hacerlo.
Simons lidera un equipo para analizar cómo se comporta la industria y para ver si las fusiones fueron anticompetitivas. La investigación actual de la compañía es si Facebook intentó intencionalmente frustrar la competencia.
En 2012, Facebook compró Instagram, y en 2014 compró el servicio de mensajería WhatsApp, y la FTC aprobó ambas adquisiciones. Muchos críticos y políticos, incluida la candidata presidencial a la senadora Elizabeth Warren, han pedido que se rompan las empresas para permitir una mayor competencia.

Congressional Democrats are lobbying to have the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) delay an announced vote on whether to give the T-Mobile-Sprint merger  the final sign of approval, reported the Verge.
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar along with Senate colleagues Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren (all currently running for president) were among those who signed a letter on Friday, August 16, asking for the FCC to “issue a public notice and seek public comment on the proposed merger” before moving to a vote.
The senators cited widespread concerns that the deal would actually hurt competition by further consolidating the wireless industry under the control of a handful of massive corporations.
“We have major antitrust concerns regarding the impact of the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger on consumers, competition, and the public interest,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We remain concerned about the lack of transparency in the FCC’s merger review process and the lack of certainty on whether this merger will protect competition and consumers.”
“For these reasons, we urge the FCC to issue a public notice and seek public comment on the proposed merger as altered by the Consent Decree and the terms set forth in Dish’s extension request letter prior to its consideration of the merger to determine if this transaction is in the public interest,” they added.
The revised merger deal that cleared Justice Department scrutiny would set up Di...

One of two federal lawsuits pursued by West Virginia and other states alleging that a number of generic drug makers engaged in a scheme to fix prices and allot market share took a step forward last week.
The judge denied the defendants’ joint motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims that the drug makers engaged in an overarching conspiracy, and allowed the plaintiffs to move forward to establish those claims.
Curtis Johnson, spokesman for Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, commented, “We believe the order is a big win for the states and private plaintiffs. We believe it has the potential to be a significant factor in moving the cases forward.”
Both suits are in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania before Judge Cynthia Rufe. Both allege that the defendant drug firms colluded to fix and raise prices, and to divvy up market share  in order to avoid competition and maintain agreeable, inflated price.

An education group seeking to increase access to college textbooks and research materials on Wednesday, August 14, asked the US government to block the proposed merger of textbook publishers McGraw-Hill Education and Cengage Learning.
The proposed merger “will significantly decrease competition in a market already rife with anti-consumer behavior,” the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) wrote in a filing with the Justice Department’s Antitrust division.
The merger announced in Maybetween Cengage and McGraw-Hill, which is owned by Apollo Global Management, would reduce the number of major textbook publishers to three from four. Publishers Pearson and Wiley, hold an estimated 40% and 7% of the market, respectively, sources close to the companies told Reuters.
SPARC advocates the open sharing of research and educational material. Its members include colleges and universities from around the United States, such as Harvard University, Iowa State University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, according to its website.

626,"August 15, 2019",Assessing Merger Impacts on Consumer Welfare in a Converging Internet Marketplace,"
By Rob Frieden (Pennsylvania State University)
This article identifies substantial flaws in how U.S. government agencies and courts assess merger proposals by ventures operating in the information, communications and entertainment (“ICE”) marketplace. Using current market definitions, consumer impact assessments and economic doctrine, antitrust enforcement agencies may fail to identify the risk of harm to consumers and competition, a so-called false negative.
In recent years, the Department of Justice, Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission, individually and collectively, have assessed the competitive consequences of numerous multi-billion dollar acquisitions and have conditionally approved almost all of them. These agencies appear predisposed to favor deals that involve vertical integration up and down market segments, based on an assumption that short terms consumer welfare gains would exceed any potential competitive harms.
The article concludes that reviewing government agencies appear to overemphasize past and current marketplace conditions rather than assess future impacts on consumers and competition. By “fighting the last war,” these agencies fail to identify new risks to consumer welfare, particularly by ventures operating in multiple markets that do not readily fit into the conventional assessment of mutually exclusive vertical and horizontal “food chains.” In an ecosystem where both technologies and markets converge, ventures can...

627,"August 14, 2019",US: FTC Chief says breaking up big tech is on the table,"
The chief of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said he’d he’d be willing to break up tech companies if necessary, according to a report by Bloomberg.
The FTC is currently investigating whether Facebook and other large tech companies are harming competition by buying smaller tech companies and merging with them. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said he knows breaking up the companies would be challenging, but he would do it if it was the right way to bring back a healthy level of competition.
“If you have to, you do it,” Simons said. “It’s not ideal because it’s very messy. But if you have to you have to.”
Simons is leading a team to look at how the industry conducts itself, and to see if the mergers were anticompetitive. The company’s current investigation is into whether Facebook intentionally tried to thwart competition.
In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram, and in 2014 it bought messaging service WhatsApp, and the FTC approved both acquisitions. Many critics and politicians, including presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have called for the breaking up of companies to allow for more competition.
Warren said large companies are “using mergers to limit competition” by purchasing competitors. She cited the Facebook/Instagram, Google/Waze and Amazon/Diapers.com acquisitions as examples.
In order to undo the mergers, Simons said, the FTC could say “we made a mistake,” and then a court would need to approve the decision.
In July, the FTC announced a bro...

CBS and Viacom, two television programming companies that split more than a decade ago, finalized a merger deal Tuesday, August 13, to recombine, creating a single entity with about US$30 billion in market value. The new company, which will be called ViacomCBS, brings brands like CBS and Showtime together with the likes of Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, and Paramount.
A CBS-Viacom reunion is the latest in a wave of mergers and acquisitions of traditional media companies, as they try to come to grips with the scale of their emerging competitors in the tech world. Netflix and YouTube dominate eyeballs online, and companies like Apple and Amazon, with market caps hovering around US$1 trillion, are delving more deeply into video programming. In response, legacy media companies are consolidating to bulk up.
Once the deal is completed, expected by the end of the year, ViacomCBS will have a combined library with more than 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including franchises such as “Star Trek” and “Mission: Impossible.”

The exact timing of the merger announcement remains somewhat in flux, these people said. But the boards of both companies and their investment banks are rushing to complete the necessary paperwork to announce the deal sometime today, perhaps after the market close at 4 p.m. ET, these people add.
Both companies had worked over the weekend in an attempt to announce the merger on Monday, August 12, but two outstanding issues delayed any official announcement. First, the companies needed to reach a firm agreement on the price to take into account that CBS, with a market value of US$18 billion, will technically be taking over the smaller Viacom, with a market value of around US$12 billion. Under the terms of the deal, each Viacom share will be worth 0.59625 shares, these people say.

In the suit filed in Trenton, New Jersey, Sanofi claimed Mylan caused it to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in sales by erecting barriers to US consumers’ access to and use of a rival product, Auvi-Q.
In particular, Sanofi claimed Mylan offered rebates to insurers, pharmaceutical benefit managers, and state Medicaid agencies conditioned on Auvi-Q not being an epinephrine auto-injector device they would reimburse for use by consumers.

The company was in advanced discussions with Houseparty, but ended deal talks after it became clear that acquiring another social media company would be too risky, given Facebook’s dominance in the space, the Times reported.
Houseparty allows users to video chat with multiple users at once and is popular among those under age 24. The company was acquired in June by Fortnite maker Epic Games for an undisclosed sum.
The report comes as Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants face rising antitrust scrutiny from Washington and beyond. Last month, the Department of Justice announced that it’s opening a broad antitrust review of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media, and retail services.

The Journal reported that The European Union could begin to hit Facebook with decisions under the bloc’s new privacy law by the end of the year, raising the specter of billions of euros in fines and orders to change business practices.
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission claims it is nearing the end of its investigations in some of the 11 cases it has opened into the tech giant under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.
The Irish regulator has given Facebook copies of its final investigative reports for some cases, and plans to begin drafting decisions in coming weeks, according to Graham Doyle, a spokesman for the regulator. Ireland aims to send at least some draft decisions, along with any proposed fines and sanctions, to the EU’s 27 other national privacy regulators by the end of September, Mr. Doyle added.
The sending of those draft decisions will kick off an EU approval process that could stretch to the end of the year or into the beginning of 2020, European privacy officials say.

US aluminum producer Novelis has offered concessions to address EU antitrust concerns over its US$2.6 billion bid for aluminum producer Aleris, a filing on the European Commission website showed on Monday, August 12.
The Commission has expressed worries about reduced competition and higher prices as a result of the deal, with carmakers in particular feeling the impact.
The EU competition enforcer did not provide details of the concessions, in line with its policy. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding by October 7 whether to clear the bid.
The company could make a written commitment to boost capacity and add 80 new jobs at the Aleris plant in Duffel, Belgium, to allay regulatory concerns that capacity may be curtailed to increase prices, people with knowledge told Reuters.
According to Reuters, Novelis stated it was working constructively with the Commission.
“While we have no definitive information to share at this time, we are exploring a range of options, including potential remedies, with the continued aim of closing the transaction by the end of this calendar year,” Novelis said in a statement.

637,"August 11, 2019",US: Judge dismisses antitrust suits against pork companies,"

On Thursday, August 8, a federal judge in Minneapolis dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing several US pork companies of conspiring to limit supply in order to inflate prices and their own profits.
Chief Judge John Tunheim said the plaintiffs failed to show “parallel conduct” among the companies, whose combined US market share exceeds 80%. It was suggested the pork companies had conspired beginning in 2009 to fix prices, Reuters reports.
The defendants included Hormel Foods, the JBS USA unit of Brazil’s JBS, WH Group’s Smithfield Foods, and Tyson Foods, among others, as well as data provider Agri Stats. The defendants claimed the plaintiffs failed to allege any agreement to rig prices, and that supply and capacity actually increased during this time.
Tunheim’s decision covered 13 lawsuits from consumers, “direct” purchasers of pork and “indirect” purchasers, Reuters reports.
The plaintiffs claim the producers manipulated pork prices by publicly touting the need to cut production, thereby signaling to each other that the conspiracy was on, and by sharing price, capacity, sales, and demand data via Agri Stats, Reuters reports.

638,"August 11, 2019",US: GateHouse’s bid for Gannett could be in trouble,"
Heath Freeman, the boss of private equity firm Alden Global Capital, is throwing a wrench into the mega-merger between Gatehouse Media and USA Today owner Gannett.
In a bombshell disclosure Friday, August 9, it was revealed that MNG Enterprises, the newspaper group Alden controls, snapped up 9.4% of the stock of New Media Investment Group, which is poised to acquire Gannett. Shareholders can vote on the merger.
The Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealed that MNG may vote down or campaign against the plans to create the largest newspaper publisher in the country. New Media’s Gatehouse Media is the nation’s second-largest newspaper owner behind Gannett.
New Media announced on Monday that it plans to acquire USA Today owner Gannett. But MNG has previously made offers for Gannett that Gannett has turned down. So it looks like MNG’s purchase of a New Media stake might be a way for MNG to try and kill the Gannett deal. MNG was not immediately available for comment about when it bought its 5.7 million shares in New Media.

639,"August 8, 2019",US: Tuna price-fixing case get class action status,"
Plaintiffs suing the Big Three tuna companies—Bumble Bee Foods, StarKist, and Chicken of the Sea—over alleged price fixing among the competitors have been granted class certification.
The judge’s decision is good news for the plaintiffs, as such certification generally means lower legal costs and an increase in the likelihood of seeing a financial reward.
The lawsuits allege  that the three largest tuna companies conspired to keep the price of the staple of lunch boxes and pantries artificially high between at least November 2010 and December 2016.
Federal Judge Janis Sammartino last week approved three tracks for the suits to continue. One class is the “direct purchaser plaintiffs,” which includes warehouse and distribution companies like Olean Wholesale Grocery, Piggly Wiggly, and Benjamin Foods.
The second is the “commercial food preparer plaintiffs,” which includes eateries like Thyme Cafe & Market, A-1 Diner, and Groucho’s Deli of Five Points.
The third track is the “end payer plaintiff,” which represents individual consumers who bought tuna to eat. The class includes consumers in 30 states, Washington, DC, and Guam.
The 59-page order was filed July 30 in the US District Court for the Southern District of California.

640,"August 8, 2019",Russia: Apple for locking out Kaspersky Lab,"
According to Patently Apple, Apple is under investigation in Russia following a complaint from cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab to Russia’s anti-monopoly watchdog claiming Apple may be abusing its dominant market position. The original complaint was filed in March.
Watchdog FAS (Federal Antitrust Service) stated it was investigating why a new version of Kaspersky Lab’s Safe Kids application had been declined by Apple’s operating system, resulting in a significant loss in functionality for the parental control app.
It stated Apple had released version 12 of its own parental control app, Screen Time, which had similar functions to the Kaspersky program. Parental control apps allow parents to control their children’s phone and tablet usage.
Kaspersky claimed Apple’s App Store guidelines allowed for a limited use of MDM, but that it was not clear how to obtain Apple’s permission to do so. It also claimed the requirements reduced the competitiveness of third party developers.

641,"August 7, 2019",US: Allergan to shed two drugs for AbbVie deal,"

Allergan has confirmed that it will divest experimental inflammatory bowel disease therapy brazikumab and marketed drug Zenpep ahead of its US$63 billion acquisition by AbbVie.
Allergan announced it had decided to divest brazikumab and Zenpep—a treatment for pancreatic lipase deficiency—regardless of whether getting rid of them is required for clearance of the AbbVie takeover by antitrust regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said the company achieved “steady growth” in the second quarter, driven once again by wrinkle treatments Botox and Juvederm, up 4% to US$974 million and 11% to US$323 million, respectively. There was also a strong contribution from antipsychotic drug Vraylar (cariprazine) which grew 72% to US$196 million.
The deal, worth about US$80 billion including debt, is the second this year that would knit together two of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. Earlier this year, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay US$74 billion for rival cancer drugmaker Celgene.

642,"August 6, 2019",US: Caesars expected to sell Vegas strip properties after Eldorado merger,"
Eldorado Resorts is strongly considering the sale of a Las Vegas Strip casino after finishing its acquisition of Caesars Entertainment next year, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Reno, Nevada-based Eldorado and Caesars Entertainment have stated the US$8.58 billion acquisition deal will close in the first half of 2020. On Tuesday, August 6, Eldorado Chief Executive Thomas Reeg told analysts that he expects to complete the acquisition closer to the beginning of that window than the end, adding that any sale of a Strip property won’t be announced before then. Mr. Reeg didn’t say which casinos are being considered. Caesars has a big presence on the Strip, including Caesars Palace, Harrah’s, and Planet Hollywood, among others.
Eldorado Resorts operates casinos in Reno, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and smaller markets in Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, and other states. The combined entity would be the largest casino company in the US, operating under the Caesars name with about 60 casinos in 16 states.

643,"August 6, 2019",Ten Things To Know About The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry,"
August 2019
CPI Oceania Column edited by Sam Sadden (CPI) presents:
Ten Things To Know About The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry By Prof. Caron Beaton-Wells (University of Melbourne)1
On July 26, 2019 the much-anticipated final report of the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) in its Digital Platforms Inquiry (the “Inquiry”) was released (the “Report”).2
This article is an attempt to distil the 619 pages of the Report into ten key take-outs as relate to the findings and recommendations on competition.3 For those who can’t wait, here they are:

Yes, in some respects, it is ground-breaking;
It confirms what we already knew – Google and Facebook are big;
But it also acknowledges their success;
It sings from the international song sheet on substantial market power;
But it rejects break up and proposes to contain power in other ways;
Its central finding is that markets aren’t working;
And it commits to playing the long game on enforcement;
It is cool on regulating for competition;
But it is hot on other regulatory measures;
The work is just getting started.

Before proceeding further, it is important to point out that the Inquiry was not concerned with digital platforms at large. Its Terms of Reference directed the ACCC to study the impact of “digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms … on competition in media and advertising services markets.”4 That effectively meant the focus was on Google and Facebook.5
That said, many of the Report’s recommendations extend (deliberately) to digital platforms other than the two main protagonists and, if adopted, will affect economic sectors beyond media and advertising.6
Yes, in some respects, it is ground-breaking 
The Inquiry has been hailed as “ground-breaking” and a “world first.” What is the basis for such hyperbolic claims? After all, there have been just shy of 30 such inquiries on the same or related topics published or announced around the world in the last five years.7
The feature that most distinguishes the ACCC’s endeavor is the breadth in its scope, traversing not just competition, but consumer protection, unfair trading, data protection and privacyrelated considerations, and, importantly, the intersections between them.
The significance of these intersections is captured in the following Figure in the Report:8

The Inquiry’s scope reflects the ACCC’s status as a multi-functional agency and one that takes an active and integrated approach to administering its responsibilities in each of its portfolio areas.
Moreover, in accordance with the Inquiry’s Ministerial mandate, the ACCC ventured beyond its standard parameters to consider public interest issues associated with a diversified and sustainable news and journalism sector.
Further features of the Inquiry which merit emphasis were its method in information gathering and stakeholder engagement and its level of detail. Within the relatively short time assigned for the formidable task (18 months), both were impressive on any measure.
The ACCC received 180 written submissions. It issued 60 statutory notices compelling the production of documents. It held eight public fora and commissioned a series of research reports and surveys. It also conducted innumerable meetings with individual firms, representative groups, and other regulatory agencies, in Australia and overseas.
Totaling 1036 pages of output, an Issues Paper (39 pages) was published in February 2018 and a Preliminary Report (378 pages) in December 2018. The Final Report (619 pages) was delivered to the Government six months later, in June 2019.
It confirms what we already knew – Google and Facebook are big 
The Report logically commences with what have now become standard and unsurprising statistics on the size and pervasiveness of Google and Facebook in online usage and activity.
As of 2018, Google Search accounted for 90 percent of search traffic originating from Australian desktop computer users and over 98 percent of search traffic from Australian mobile users, while 84 percent of Australian adults access the Facebook platform at least monthly, with 54 percent accessing Instagram.9 Moreover, as depicted in the following Figure from the Report, the time spent on these two platforms was shown to “dwarf” the time spent elsewhere online.10

Google and Facebook account for 84 percent of the growth in the total online advertising market over the last five years. If classified advertising is excluded, this rises to 102 percent of the total market increase.11 It was estimated that for a typical AU$100 spent on online advertising (excluding classifieds), AU$47 goes to Google, AU$24 to Facebook, and AU$29 to all other websites.12
Google was found to have a 96 percent market share of general search advertising revenue,13 and Facebook to have a 51 percent market share of display advertising revenue in Australia.14
Almost half the population (43 percent) use online news as their primary news source,15 with 33 percent accessing news through social media, 20 percent through search, and 12 percent through news aggregators (such as Google News and Apple News), as compared to 30 percent accessing news directly from the websites of news organizations.16
But it also acknowledges their success 
As is also now routine (and important), the ACCC acknowledged that the size of Google and Facebook reflects the innovative high-quality products and services they provide and the extent to which they are valued by consumers.17 It also recognized the significant complementary benefits that the platforms deliver for business users, including advertisers and news organizations.
Equally, having observed that Australians’ attachment to these platforms shows “no sign of slowing” and that investors apparently expect continued growth, the ACCC considered it necessary to point out that “it does not have concerns with digital platforms pursuing growth and profitability.”18
Indeed, since the commencement of the Inquiry, the Chairman has been at pains to acknowledge and applaud the platforms for their ingenuity and success.19
The Report also importantly emphasized that, under Australian competition law, it is neither illegal to possess substantial market power nor to outsmart less skillful and efficient rivals in the competitive process. However, it is illegal, according to the Report, “for a firm with substantial market power to damage this competitive process by preventing or deterring rivals or potential rivals from competing on their merits.”20
Section 46(1) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA), as amended in 2017, in fact provides that a “corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition” in a relevant market. The scope of the amended section is yet to be properly tested.
There is reference in the Report to firms with substantial power having a “special responsibility” in relation to their conduct. This invocation of a central tenet of European abuse of dominance law is interesting given that, on its face at least, there is no such requirement in the Australian provision.
The Report is also replete with references to the European Commission’s cases against Google as well as the Bundeskartellamt’s decision against Facebook for abuse of dominance. However, such references should not be read to imply equivalence between Article 102 of the European competition rules and Section 46 of the CCA. In particular, Article 102 encompasses some types of conduct that may be characterized as unfair or exploitative abuses. Even in its amended form, Section 46 is unlikely to extend that far, not least because in Australia unfair trading practices are dealt with under the Australian Consumer Law, in provisions that the Report recommended be strengthened and extended.21
The ACCC’s brief was not to consider whether any firm has acted in breach, or even potentially in breach of the provisions of the CCA. Such consideration is for an investigation of specific conduct with reference to specific facts and evidence. Moreover, in Australia, liability for any such breach can only be determined by a court in a proceeding brought by the ACCC (or a private plaintiff).
The report disclosed that the Commission has five investigations of possible breaches, one in connection with a potential misuse of market power and four in connection with potential contraventions of consumer law. It is expected these investigations will be concluded “later in the year.”22
It sings from the international song sheet on substantial market power 
In analyzing their multi-sided business models, identifying relevant markets, and determining whether Google or Facebook has substantial power in them, the ACCC joined the chorus of similar inquiries around the world to date.23
In relation to Google, it found that the firm has substantial power in a general search services market and a search advertising market in Australia. Facebook was found to have substantial power in a social media services and a display advertising services market. In each case, it was found that the power of these firms is non-transitory.24
Needless to say, the ACCC rejected submissions of Google and Facebook that they compete in broader markets.25
The reasoning in support of the substantial market power findings was familiar also. In the case of each platform, the ACCC identified the following factors as relevant:26

same-side and cross-side network effects and associated positive feedback loops;27
in the case of the general search market, consumer inertia exacerbated by default and pre-installation settings;28
brand strength;29
extreme economies of scale and sunk costs;30
advantages of scope and conglomeration effects, including as arise through data accumulation, multiple user touch points across the web, and integrated advertisingrelated services;31
strategic acquisitions that have either entrenched power in core markets (through the acquisition of potential competitors particularly) or enabled expansion into related markets;32 and
in the case of the search and display advertising markets, the highly fragmented structure of each market in which Google and Facebook each have substantial shares relative to competitors and the fact that users tend to single-home on each of these platforms.33

Separately, the ACCC singled out Google and Facebook’s access to personal data as a significant competitive advantage, highlighting the volume, quality, granularity, and diversity of such data as being a source of considerable value to each firm.34 It is this data, the Commission observed, that enables both firms to offer highly targeted and personalized advertising that in turn constitutes their primary source of revenue.
The Commission firmly rejected the opposing position, namely that data is ubiquitous, nonrivalrous and low cost to collect, and is not of itself inherently valuable (as distinct from the skills required to extract relevant and actionable insights from it).35
The Report characterized these various factors as raising barriers to the entry of new rivals or expansion of existing ones.
Relatedly, it rejected the argument made by both firms that each is subject to constraints from dynamic competition. While not excluding the possibility of disruptive innovation in the relevant markets, the ACCC took the view that both Google and Facebook are substantially insulated from competition, at least in the short to medium term.36 It also saw the prospects of disruption as less probable than in early phases of internet competition given the persistence and scale of the current incumbents (Google especially).37
Moreover, in view of competition being “for” rather than “in” the market, the ACCC pointed out that concerns about competitive risks would not be ameliorated by the mere replacement of Google and Facebook by another dominant firm.38
But it rejects break up and proposes to contain power in other ways 
The ACCC fulsomely rejected the submissions of some stakeholders that the platforms be subjected to structural separation.
The Commission took the view that such a remedy was laden with risks of unintended welfare-reducing consequences. It also considered it doubtful at best that divestment would effectively address the competition and consumer concerns identified in the Report.39
However, reflecting a similar emphasis in other reports, the ACCC expressed a concern that the existing power of digital platforms not be extended by anti-competitive acquisitions.
It adhered to its preliminary recommendation that Australia’s merger law be amended to identify additional factors to be considered in the review of proposed acquisitions, namely:40

the likelihood that an acquisition would result in the removal from the market of a potential competitor;41 and
the amount and nature of assets, including data and technology, which the acquirer would likely have access to as a result of the acquisition.42

The Commission acknowledged that the existing law enables such factors to be considered. However, it regarded the proposed amendment as useful “to signal to merger parties, the courts and the Tribunal the need to consider these factors in considering whether an acquisition will substantially lessen competition.”43
This recommendation does not go as far as recommendations made in other reports in relation to competition law upgrades to tackle the challenges posed by digital power and acquisitions. In particular, it does not encompass considerations such as reducing the standard of proof or reversing the burden of proof as is contemplated elsewhere.
Relatedly, the Report does not directly tackle the challenging issues raised by the uncertainty of the counterfactual where the target is a young and small-scale operation.44
These omissions are explained by the fact that the ACCC is actively considering broader questions in relation to the merger regime and whether it should advocate for legislative changes that would have economy-wide effect.45 Such changes could involve a rebuttable presumption that an acquisition will substantially lessen competition in cases involving markets with high levels of concentration.46 The ACCC may be aided in this advocacy if it had a program of ex post review of merger decisions. The agency is out of step with many of its major counterparts in not having such a program.47
The ACCC also confirmed its preliminary recommendation that, in the absence of a compulsory notification scheme, Google and Facebook be requested to voluntarily provide notice of acquisitions of any business with activities in Australia and provide it with sufficient time to review the acquisition.48
Google was not opposed to providing advance notice. Facebook did not respond.
The ACCC acknowledged concerns about unintended effects on innovation and investment commonly raised in response to more aggressive merger control in digital markets. In deference to such concerns its final recommendation was that the notification protocol between the ACCC and each platform would specify the types of acquisitions covered (including any minimum transaction value) and the minimum advance notification period prior to completion of the proposed transaction.49
Further, the ACCC repeated its threat that if the proposed undertakings from Google and Facebook were not forthcoming, it “will make further recommendations to Government to address this issue.”50
In addition to these merger-related recommendations, the Preliminary Report had proposed changes to address consumer inertia owing to default settings for search engines on internet browsers and for internet browsers on operating systems.51
Confirming but qualifying its proposal (to confine it to Google), the Report recommended that the search company provide Australian users with the same options being rolled out to Android device users in Europe, that is the ability to choose their default search engine and default internet browser from a number of options.52
The ACCC’s decision to narrow its recommendation on this issue was in acknowledgement of concerns that its scope could have adverse effects, including raising barriers to expansion for existing smaller suppliers of search services that are vertically integrated with an internet browser and in turn further entrenching Google’s power in the browser market.53
                                                                                                                             
Its central finding is that markets aren’t working 
Key questions that the ACCC identified for itself in the Inquiry were whether either Google and Facebook “are exercising their market power in their dealings with advertisers and content creators” and what might be “the price or non-price effects of this.”54 Expressed in these terms, it might have been assumed that the ACCC was embarked on a standard consumer welfare analysis.
However, the Report does not in fact answer those questions directly. Its findings are more holistic, reflecting the wide mandate given to the ACCC in the Inquiry, the breadth of its portfolio, and its corresponding institutional charter, encapsulated in the pithy mission statement: “making markets work.”55
In accordance with this broader purview, the ACCC found that, as a consequence of the platforms’ power, markets are not functioning as efficiently as they would be absent such power.
Google and Facebook each were said to have the ability and incentives to act in ways that threaten the competitive process. They have the freedom to raise prices or reduce quality and/or to anti-competitively leverage power to favor their own products and services at the expense of rivals.56 Having referred to price and quality, somewhat surprisingly, the Report did not canvas the effects of the platforms’ power on the pace and nature of innovation.57
In addition, the degree of opacity in the relevant markets were said to undermine confidence and trust that are crucial to effective market operation and risk the distortion of competition by penalizing firms that do operate transparently.58
Underscoring its view on market functioning, the ACCC emphasized substantial imbalances in information and bargaining power for each of the affected user groups vis-à-vis the platforms.
Consumers have insufficient information and are unable to make meaningful choices about the collection and use of their personal data. While there are different levels of awareness and different preferences among consumers concerning privacy, most are concerned about the lack of transparency and their lack of choice in relation to platform data practices. There is particular concern relating to the extent of online and location tracking and sale of data to third parties.59
Media organizations are forced to accept unfavorable terms concerning the ranking and display of news content, notice of algorithmic changes, formats that affect content monetization, access to user data, and the timing and process for take-down of copyright infringing material.60
In addition, the media industry is heavily regulated while virtually no regulation applies to the platforms despite their active participation in the online news eco-system. This regulatory disparity is a further imbalance with distortionary effects on competition.61
For advertisers there is a lack of transparency in ranking and display practices by the platforms, issues with measurement and verification of advertising performance, limited ability to negotiate on prices, and a risk of anti-competitive self-preferencing of the platforms’ own ad inventory and ad tech services.62
The ACCC made it clear that its concerns regarding leveraging of market power were not confined to advertisers and that there are risks (and some evidence) of such conduct with anti-competitive effects across the wide range of markets in which digital platforms (and not just Google and Facebook) operate.63
In addition to potential abuses on the platform, the Commission noted submissions raising misuse of market power allegations within markets in which the platforms have substantial power, including foreclosure of access to data by competitors, restrictive clauses in contracts with third party websites and restrictions on user switching. It hinted that these may be matters for investigation in Australia in the future.64
And commits to playing the long game on enforcement 
Despite the strong language of the Report and the ACCC Chairman in his press conference announcing its release,65 the Inquiry has not made recommendations for any significant changes (yet) to Australia’s competition law.
Consistent with a number of other reports, the ACCC took the view that “the existing goals and tools” of the legal framework “remain applicable to digital markets.”66
However, unlike some of its counterparts, the Report did not suggest that there needs to be a shift in approach to error cost so as to favor enforcement notwithstanding risks of false positives. This is unsurprising given that, under the current Chairman, the ACCC has a proven track record of embracing litigation risk and testing the law in grey areas.67
The ACCC’s central proposal to contain the risks it had identified was that it invest in a more pro-active, concerted, and sustained effort to monitor, investigate, and, where there is evidence of a breach of the law, bring enforcement proceedings against digital platforms.68
In support of this proposal, the ACCC pointed out that there are conditions in digital platform markets that are likely to strain the effectiveness of existing prohibitions (the misuse of market power prohibition particularly) and that reinforce the need for something other than a “business as usual” approach. Five such conditions were identified:
First, competition law is insufficient to deal with market failures that arise due to a lack of transparency or due to externalities in other markets. Furthermore, a lack of transparency may mean that potential breaches of the law go undetected.
Second, effective enforcement will require a body of data amassed over time to assess competition matters. Proactive monitoring and collection of data will enable the ACCC to build an evidence base for future assessments under existing competition laws.
Third, investigations can take a significant amount of time and by the stage at which they are complete, it may be too late to effectively remedy the competition concern. Developing knowledge and industry expertise may result in more timely outcomes when using existing competition laws as it will reduce the learning curve for the agency.69
Fourth, existing laws rely on conduct to be brought to the ACCC’s attention. It is likely that some discrimination will not be able to be detected by market participants. This possibility is heightened where digital platforms operate as “black boxes” and exacerbated where participants are reluctant to air their concerns.70
Finally, some conduct may not substantially lessen competition but there may be public benefit nevertheless in reporting on that conduct. The ACCC may want to highlight conduct that has the potential to substantially lessen competition in the future, or which may suggest that a firm with substantial market power is taking advantage of the imbalance of bargaining power in a way that causes significant detriment to user groups.
The ACCC identified four ways in which to deal with these challenges:

The creation of a specialist digital platforms branch within the ACCC to maintain consistent scrutiny and investigation of issues relating to digital platforms.71 The branch would have a mandate directed at monitoring and enforcing compliance with both the consumer protection and the competition rules.72
The ability to proactively investigate and gather information. This will enable the investigation of broader issues and enable the ACCC to investigate potential market failures as well as potential breaches of the CCA where information has not been forthcoming through complaints by market participants.
The ability to periodically compel data from digital platforms. Similar to other industries, such as telecommunications, there is seen to be value in having compulsory powers to gather information from digital platforms to facilitate the monitoring of market developments, and assist in informing decisions.
The ability and resources to publicly report on issues of concern that may fall beneath the threshold of breaching the CCA, and to make recommendations based on evidence gathered by the branch, to the Government and other relevant regulators.

The branch would direct its attention to “all” digital platforms, even if the initial focus would be on Google and Facebook.73 This was justified by the fact that some but not all of the issues the ACCC had identified were dependent on market power and enabled the ACCC to side-step the thorny issue of identifying criteria to determine which firms warrant additional scrutiny or regulation.74
It is cool on regulating for competition 
There is a growing view around the world that robust competition law enforcement in digital markets needs to be complemented with regulatory measures and some jurisdictions have already taken steps in this direction.
The ACCC’s view on regulation is more cautious.
Its Preliminary Report recommended the establishment of a new regulatory authority tasked with monitoring, investigating, and reporting on the criteria, commercial arrangements, or other factors used by “relevant” digital platforms in dealings with advertisers and media organizations.75
This approach met with strong criticisms, not least from Google and Facebook in relation to the possibility of having to disclose their proprietary algorithms and the risk of algorithmic gaming.76 Others raised questions about the effectiveness of such an authority,77 including risks of capture.78
In its final analysis, the ACCC retreated from this recommendation. It took the view that it was the appropriate body to carry out the functions of “shining a light”79 and reporting on platform practices, while also taking any enforcement action where there is evidence such practices involve an infringement of competition or consumer laws.
It justified this position by reference to its existing skills and expertise in the relevant areas as well as its existing relationships with key regulators in adjacent fields, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority (“ACMA”) and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (“OAIC”). Evidently, these relationships have been strengthened by the experience of working together in the Inquiry.80
Moreover, the ACCC made clear that a substantial aspect of the new branch’s work would be continuing to study digital platform markets, starting with a five-year study of the ad tech supply chain, which could result in recommendations to Government for regulatory action.81 The ACCC was also temperate on the need for other pro-competition regulation.
It was not convinced that imposing data portability requirements would have a significant effect in ameliorating barriers to entry and expansion in digital platform markets in the short term. It also noted that Google and Facebook already voluntarily provide users with the capacity to access and port their data.82
However, it did concede that data portability (as well as interoperability) could spur new entry and innovation and undertook to consider recommending to Government that the recently introduced Consumer Data Right be extended to digital platforms in the future.83
But it is hot on other regulatory measures 
The foregoing could give the false impression that the Report was “light touch” in respect of regulation generally.
The ACCC was prepared to recommend that Google and Facebook be required to negotiate enforceable codes to govern their dealings with media organizations, a process to be overseen by ACMA which would also have responsibility for code enforcement.84
In addition, it recommended a mandatory code to facilitate copyright enforcement on platforms.85
In relation to issues concerning “disinformation” the agency recommended that the platforms establish an industry code to govern complaints, failing which, a mandatory code for this purpose should be introduced.86
It further recommended that there be a prescribed minimum standard for platform internal dispute resolution processes and the additional support of an ombudsman scheme to deal with complaints and resolve disputes that consumers and small businesses have in relation to scams and advertising services.87
Arguably most significantly, the ACCC recommended sweeping changes to update Australia’s outmoded Privacy Act 1988.88 In addition to this economy-wide reform, it proposed a special code for all digital platforms supplying search, social media and content aggregation services to address particular concerns regarding their notification and consent processes.89
If this strategy of “attack by code” is to have any prospect of success, there will need to be genuine “buy-in” by the platforms. The ACCC has allowed for Google and Facebook to play a role in code development but has also proposed time limits on patience in this regard. Inevitably, there will be issues with finding a sensible middle ground between motherhood statements and over-prescription in code provisions. As recommended by the ACCC, there also will need to be a serious threat of meaningful sanctions for code breaches.
Doubtless, there will be reactions to the proposed regulatory onslaught that draw attention to its associated costs and possible chilling effects. In connection with the privacy proposals, there is also likely to be consternation that those costs necessarily will fall on businesses other than the digital platforms, including advertisers and media organizations.90 The platforms, after all, have GDPR-proofed their operations already.
Conscious of these risks, the ACCC has proposed its close involvement in the process of code development and law reform that is otherwise to be led by ACMA and the OAIC. That involvement will be crucial in attempting to balance the various interests at stake.
The platforms themselves are likely to have strong views about the proposed regulatory burdens and will be tested in their stated commitment to support regulation.91
The work is just getting started 
In releasing the Report, the Government accepted “the ACCC’s overriding conclusion that there is a need for reform – to better protect consumers, improve transparency, recognize power imbalances and ensure that substantial market power is not used to lessen competition in media and advertising services markets.”92
It also accepted that there is a need to develop a harmonized media regulatory framework.
The Government announced a 12-week consultation process to receive and consider feedback from stakeholders before it issues a more detailed response, together with a roadmap and timetable for implementation of recommendations that are accepted. This deferral and engagement are warranted given the breadth and depth of the Report.
The Government is likely to accept the recommendation that there be a specialist digital platforms branch in the ACCC and that it have the powers and resources to do the work as laid out by the Commission in the Report.
The recommendations concerning merger control are also not expected to cause much trouble, even if there may be some tweaking around the edges.
It would be surprising if Google refused to extend the benefit of its default setting changes to Australian Android users. However, the Government and the ACCC may also need to take a close look at how Google has designed those changes given that, as they are proposed in Europe, they may in fact have little impact on competition in the search engine market.93
There is also unlikely to be much hesitation by the Government in accepting the need for an overhaul of Australia’s general privacy framework.
However, given the scope, complexity, and cost involved in the swathe of regulatory recommendations, a challenging process of stakeholder engagement lies ahead.
Regardless of the outcomes of this process, what is pellucidly clear is that the ACCC’s work on digital platforms is just getting started.

2 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Digital Platforms Inquiry, Final Report, June 2019, at https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries/digital-platforms-inquiry/final-report-executive-summary.
3 The Report’s detailed discussion of reforms to Australia’s privacy and consumer laws (ch. 7) are largely excluded from this article. Those parts of the Report that deal with choice and quality of news and journalism (ch. 6) and identify issues in connection with artificial intelligence and other emerging and new technologies (ch. 8) are also not canvassed.

5 Currently, Amazon’s presence in online advertising in Australia is relatively small (see pp. 96-97). The Report only considered Apple in the context of Apple News as a digital content aggregator and its consideration was relatively marginal given that, as compared with other platforms, the user base of Apple News is not significant (see p. 43).
6 See pp. 452-453
7 This number encompasses inquiries that have been undertaken or commissioned by national governments, parliamentary committees and competition authorities. It excludes the additional substantial number of studies and reports that have been published on related topics by regional and international intergovernmental organizations, including the OECD, BRICs, and the World Bank. It also excludes reports by private think tanks, institutes, and other such bodies such as the World Economic Forum and the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center.

17 The Report attempts to estimate the value of platforms to consumers (as well as the value that consumers bring to platforms) but also acknowledges the methodological challenges and limitations of any such estimates (see pp. 47-51).

21 It was recommended that the ACL be amended so that unfair contract terms are prohibited (not just voidable, as currently). This would mean that civil pecuniary penalties apply to the use of unfair contract terms in any standard form consumer or small business contract. See Recommendation 20 (p. 37). It was recommended also that this prohibition be supplemented with an additional unfair trading prohibition targeting specific practices concerning the collection and handling of data. See Recommendation 21.
22 See p. 38.
23 It is evident that the ACCC paid close attention to the analysis in and findings of such inquiries. In particular, the Report makes repeated reference to the Furman Report (see Jason Furman et al., Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, Unlocking digital competition, March 2019) and the Cremer Report (see Jacques Cremer et al., Competition policy for the digital era, April 2019).
24 See ch. 2.
25 However, it did retreat from its preliminary finding of an additional, “news referral services” market in which it had also found both firms to have substantial power (see pp. 103-105). The ACCC decided it was unnecessary to reach a definitive view on such matters (although it also said that they still regarded them as “probably” correct (p. 99)). Nevertheless, the Commission did find that the platforms have substantial bargaining power in their dealings with media businesses. This conclusion was based on the view that, in the context of the mutually beneficial exchange between the parties concerned, news organizations need Google and Facebook more than the platforms need the former. This was found to be the case in relation to Facebook despite the social media network having only a 25 percent share of news referrals at the time of the Preliminary Report and that share having fallen to 16 percent by the time of the Final Report (see p. 104). For the news industry, the platforms were said to be critical and “unavoidable trading partners” (the Report is peppered with this catchy phrase).
26 Listed here in the order in which they appear in the Report.
27 See pp. 66-68 (Google); p. 79 (Facebook). In relation to same-side network effects, the ACCC identified these arising for Google as a result of data accumulation which enables it to improve its search algorithm and thereby enhance the quality of its search results which in turn attracts more users, allowing for even greater data accumulation and enhancement effects (pp. 66-67).
28 Google’s has default settings for its search engine on both the Chrome and Safari browsers. Together these two browsers account for more than 80 percent of the Australian market for browsers. Google pays a substantial fee to Apple for using Google Search as the default search service on Safari, estimated globally as US$9 billion in 2018 and US$12 billion in 2019 (p. 69). Chrome is pre-installed on Android devices (owned by Google), as a result of which the Google search engine is the default on over 95 percent of mobile devices (40 percent Android; 55 percent Apple iOS) in Australia (see p. 70). Beyond the issues raised by default settings, ch. 7 of the Report contains a more detailed discussion of the issues raised by behavioral biases on the part of consumers in connection with data collection and use and privacy settings (not just confined to the digital platforms).

40 The merger provisions in the CCA already refer to “the dynamic characteristics of the market, including growth, innovation and product differentiation” as a factor to be considered in determining whether an acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition (see s 50(3)(g), CCA).
41 The ACCC rejected criticisms of this proposed merger factor that raised concerns about the emphasis on a potential “competitor” as distinct from potential “competition” and the prospects that the amendment would result in false positives and a chilling of competition (see p. 105).
42 See p. 105. The second factor was broadened from just a reference to “data” in the Preliminary report by way of recognition that data is one of a number of assets that may be a source of competitive advantage and so as to ensure that the proposed factor is sufficiently flexible and forward-looking, as well as suited for application across the economy (see p. 108).
43 See p. 106.
44 In relation to these issues the Report does not entertain the adoption of a “balance of harms” test, as recommended by the Furman report in the UK. However, in a recent speech referencing that report, the ACCC Chairman did say that “if the prospect that the target will become an effective competitor is small, but the potential increase in competition and consumer welfare is large, greater weight should be put on the potential for competition.” See https://www.accc.gov.au/speech/address-to-the-2019-competition-law-conference.
45 The ACCC’s success rate in persuading Australian judges to block acquisitions that it considers are likely to substantially lessen competition has been poor. In light of this, the ACCC has long harbored concerns that its evidentiary burden in such matters is too onerous (see https://www.accc.gov.au/speech/law-council-ofaustralia). More recently, it has been critical of the fact that, even where anti-competitive effects are identified in connection with an acquisition, the courts and Tribunal are prepared to allow it to proceed based on behavioral commitments which the ACCC has argued would not be sufficient to overcome structural concerns (see https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/court-dismisses-accc-proceedings-opposing-rail-freightconsolidation).

47 See https://theconversation.com/are-too-many-corporate-mergers-harming-consumers-we-wont-know-ifwe-dont-check-115378.
48 See p. 109. This reflected the ACCC’s concern that it may not have an opportunity for advance review of acquisitions where either company chooses not to notify the Commission (a likely explanation as to why none of the acquisitions about which the ACCC expresses concern in the report (including Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and What’s App and Google’s acquisitions of Youtube and DoubleClick) were reviewed in Australia).
49 The ACCC also made it clear that it would not necessarily undertake a public review of every transaction of which it is notified pursuant to the protocol (see p. 110).

57 However, there was discussion of innovation in the context of the proposed privacy reforms, the ACCC expressing the view that greater privacy and data protection would shore up consumer trust in data practices which in turn would provide the environment in which data-driven innovation can flourish (see p. 455).

69 The ACCC noted that this may be a significant benefit given the international experience regarding the time and resources other competition agencies have needed to conclude cases, pointing in particular to the European Commission’s Google Shopping case, in which the initial complaint was lodged by Foundem in November 2009, the European Commission officially opened its investigation in November 2010, and only came to a decision in June 2017 (see p. 139). Additionally, the ACCC pointed to its experience with other industries as confirming the view that there is significant benefit in having staff dedicated to specific sectors. By devoting resources to assess the conduct of digital platforms and proactively investigating issues in the markets in which digital platforms operate, more timely resolutions, capable of addressing competition concerns before they become entrenched, may be possible.
70 Such reluctance was observed by the ACCC in the course of the Inquiry (see p. 14).
71 The recommendation is consistent with digital capacity-building initiatives under way in competition authorities around the world. It also bears resemblance to the proposal of a Digital Markets Unit in the Furman Report. However, that report left open the question of whether such a unit would be housed within or separate from the Competition and Markets Authority and it also ascribed more of a regulatory than enforcement role to the proposed new body.
72 This compass is important given that these two sets of rules “are closely linked and mutually reinforcing.” It is also important given the particular significance for consumer protection in the presence of acute information asymmetries and bargaining imbalances (see p. 339).
73 See p. 141.
74 Cf the Furman Report’s jurisdictional concept of “strategic market status.”
75 “Relevant” platforms were defined as platforms which generate more than AU$100 million in revenue per annum.

644,"August 5, 2019",US: Tyson received a subpoena from the DOJ,"
Tyson Foods announced in its 10-Q issued Monday, August 5, that it has received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division related to complaints about price manipulation.
The action stems from a class-action complaint Maplevale Farms filed on September 2, 2016. Additional lawsuits with similar complaints have been filed since that time while others have opted to proceed on their own.
The lawsuits allege that starting in January 2008, Tyson and certain poultry subsidiaries conspired to “fix raise, maintain and stabilize the price of broiler chickens in violation of U.S. antitrust laws” and to manipulate the Broiler price index, the Georgia Dock. A DOJ grand jury subpoena is seeking more information about the chicken industry.

645,"August 5, 2019",US: Allergan beats Class Certification appeal,"
The union pension funds claiming Allergan delayed the rollout of generic Asacol will have to wait until the end of trial-level proceedings to challenge the denial of their renewed bid for class certification.
The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the petition for a mid-case appeal by the pension funds. Their antitrust lawsuit accuses Allergan of reaching “reverse payment” patent settlements with Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA and its parent Cadila Healthcare over Asacol, a colitis drug. The lawsuit also claims Allergan and Warner Chilcott engaged in “drug hopping.”
The original Asacol was a 400-milligram tablet that treated two digestive-tract ailments, colitis, and Crohn’s disease. It had been brought to market by Warner Chilcott, a company bought by Actavis 3 in 2013, and was its biggest drug, with sales of US$891 million in 2012. In the spring of 2013, just as the patent was about to expire, Warner Chilcott/Actavis discontinued Asacol and came out with Dezicol, followed by Asacol HD. They both had the same basic ingredient; the only difference was that Dezicol came in capsule form, while Asacol HD was an 800-milligram version.

646,"August 5, 2019",UK: Just Eat and Takeaway.com finalize merger,"
The British food delivery group Just Eat and the Amsterdam-based Takeaway.com have reached an agreement to finalize the merger announced on July 29, creating the world’s largest online food delivery company outside China.
The two companies are relatively similar in size.Takeaway.com has a market capitalization of €4.74 billion (US$5.3 billion) compared to £5.01 billion (US$6.1 billion) for Just Eat. Just Eat shareholders will receive 0.09744 new Takeaway.com shares for each of their shares in the deal that values the London-listed group’s equity at around £5 billion (US$6.1 billion) or 731 pence (US$8.88) a share.
Just Eat is focused on the UK and western Europe, and is expanding into Canada, Latin America ,and Australia, while Takeaway.com holds a dominant position in Germany and Eastern Europe, making the two companies not having any significant geographical overlap.
The new group—to be called Just Eat Takeaway.com—will have it headquarters located in Amsterdam, although the companies plan to maintain a number of Just Eat’s current headquarter functions in London. The merger is expected to lead to €20 million (US$22.4 million) in cost savings within four years, with around €10 million (US$11.2 million) of this expected within a year. The deal is set to close by the end of 2019, after which it will apply to list its shares on the London stock exchange and will retain a listing on Euronext Amsterdam for a year before rotating off that exchange.

647,"August 4, 2019",US: Senators want “serious” fines for antitrust breaches,"
US Senators Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal introduced legislation on Friday, August 2, to allow harsher penalties for companies that violate antitrust law, following a Justice Department probe into alleged anticompetitive behavior by big tech.
The “Monopolization Deterrence Act” by the Democratic senators would allow the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to seek civil penalties for monopolization offenses under US antitrust law, Klobuchar’s office said in a statement.
US antitrust enforcers are scrutinizing tech giants Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, Amazon, and Apple to probe allegations that they engage in anticompetitive behavior.
Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, said in the statement the legislation would allow “serious financial consequences” to combat the United States’ “major monopoly problem.”  Under the bill, the penalties could be as high as 15% of the company’s total US revenue.

648,"August 4, 2019","US: Delta, Air France, Virgin JV gets approval wth conditions","
US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao granted tentative approval on Friday, August 2, for an expanded transatlantic joint venture made up of Delta Air Lines, Air France KLM, and Virgin Atlantic.
The expanded joint venture would replace two previously approved arrangements in the US-United Kingdom and US-Continental Europe markets and will allow for additional benefits like more options on European flights, a Department of Transportation statement said.
The Department tentatively approved antitrust immunity for the joint venture and will require the carriers to report annually on commercial cooperation efforts and provide a detailed assessment after five years, the statement said.
In May 2018, the three airlines signed definitive agreements as part of a plan for an expanded transatlantic joint venture. EU antitrust regulators in February cleared Air France-KLM, Delta, and Virgin Group to acquire joint control over Virgin Atlantic, stating they did not see any competition concerns.

649,"August 4, 2019",EU: Novelis must offer concessions or face veto for Aleris deal,"
US aluminum maker Novelis must offer concessions to European Union competition authorities by August 9 to gain approval for its US$2.6 billion takeover of aluminum processor Aleris, sources close to the matter said.
Novelis, part of India’s Hindalco Industries, bid for Aleris in July last year as part of its diversification into the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and construction industries among others.
The European Commission conducted a four-month investigation of the acquisition and last month set out its concerns over how the deal could hurt competition, particularly for carmakers that use the companies’ products.
Novelis and Aleris defended the proposed deal before antitrust officials at a closed-door hearing last week, hoping to address EU competition concerns and secure unconditional approval.

650,"August 4, 2019",European Competition Policy in Digital: What’s Next?,"
August 2019

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
European Competition Policy in Digital: What’s Next? By Nicolas Petit (University of Liege & College of Europe)1
This short note is about the future of European Union (“EU”) competition policy in digital industries. It is somewhat patent that in the global division of labor, the U.S. (and China) have specialized in creating large digital firms, while the EU’s comparative advantage has been in producing competition policies to discipline them. In past five years, the European Commission (“EC”) has issued three decisions against Google, and collected close to 10 billion USD from its shareholders, i.e. Google Search (Shopping), Google Androïd, and Google AdSense. It fined Facebook in 2017 for breach of merger processes. The EC is currently investigating whether Amazon is using sensitive data from retailers to promote its own product offerings. And it is also looking at Spotify’s complaint against Apple’s 30 percent fee, as well as alleged foreclosure from the Apple Watch.
A draft Stigler Center report issued in May called the European Commission the “global enforcer” against digital platforms exclusionary conduct. And in a recent paper economist Carl Shapiro invites us to “look to Brussels for much of the action.”2
So the question seems not so much whether European competition policy will be activist. It will be. The recent adoption of a Statement of Objections in proceedings against Amazon suggests that the EC is not yet ready to loosen the grip on digital firms.3 That said, one may expect a progressive recalibration of the EC’s competition policy mix, with more balance between antitrust enforcement in particular cases and rule-making/guidance initiatives. Moreover, we should not forget the EU courts who will ultimately be called to shed light on the legal tests applicable in the abovementioned cases, as defendants have sought annulment of the EC decisions on substantive, procedural, and remedial grounds.4 Readers will recall that  some EC decisions like Google Shopping have been criticized for their alleged failure to articulate a clear theory of liability in support of the case.
With this background, the purpose of the present piece is to address two speculative questions: (1) what will be the focus of EU competition policy in digital ?; and  (2) can we expect this policy to deliver consumer welfare?

What will be the Focus of EC Competition Policy in Digital Industries?

We can get a sense of what future European competition policy will look like from a report entitled “Competition Policy for the Digital Era” from May 2019. The report was commissioned to a group of three experts, independent from the EC. Over its 132 pages, there are many ideas. But a handful of them are aligned with the legal and policy preferences previously expressed by EC officials in published papers. In fact, close observers of the Brussels antitrust scene read the report as a JV between the three independent experts and the EC policy units.5
The first one concerns abuse of dominance cases. It looks technical. But it could have significant impact on antitrust enforcement and litigation. The idea is that in highly concentrated markets characterized by strong network effects, the burden of proof should shift on the incumbent, who should be asked to demonstrate the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. Otherwise, and absent a defendant showing of procompetitive purpose or effect, conduct ought to be deemed unlawful. This proposition marks a deviation from the rule of reason, evidenced-based approach increasingly taken by the Court of Justice of the EU in this area of the law, and it will thus necessitate a test case in Luxemburg. The practical significance of that procedural modification is the following: It is often complained that startups subject to platform anticompetitive conduct do not have the resources necessary to bring evidence-hungry complaints before courts and agencies, and go bust due to litigation fatigue. If the shift in the burden of proof happens, this could lead to increased enforcement activity levels before national agencies and antitrust courts across Europe.
The second is stricter merger policy against startup acquisitions by dominant platforms. The EC seems interested in controlling deals like Facebook/Instagram, where an incumbent with a dominant ecosystem buys a quickly growing startup that operates outside of its market.6 To date, these mergers are looked at as “conglomeral” transactions. In the absence of clear horizontal overlaps or risks of input foreclosure, they are presumptively innocuous. The proposed novel theory of harm is to think of the target firm as a horizontal competitor active within a same “technological space” or “users’ space.” Under the new test, the merger ought to be prohibited even if the platform has the ability and incentives to grow the startup, as long as it can be shown that “the target can grow as a self-standing competitive force if not acquired by the incumbent, or if other companies may be realistically interested.” The counterfactual scenario assumes that there is more social value to stand alone growth or M&A with another competitor than with a dominant firm. Little is said though of the empirical basis for the assumption that merging with a dominant platform is a second best option from a social welfare perspective.
The third one is antitrust spirited data regulation. It is not a secret that the EC is not convinced by the economic idea whereby firms with market power can collect excessive data from users. It is well known that the EC was not particularly enthusiastic about the German 2019 case against Facebook, plausibly on the ground that firms without market power equally exploit users’ behavioral biases to coerce them into excessive terms of use (note that this economic perspective on data irks European privacy officials charged with GDPR enforcement, who believe that competition officials should take a more moral perspective on data minimization).7 By contrast, the EC seems to accept the notion that personal and non-personal data possession raise entry barriers for both competitors and complementors, and in turn necessitate data access, sharing, and interoperability remedies. Practicalities like monitoring of continuous data access or pricing disputes however plead against anything other than exceptional antitrust enforcement. The EC report logically proposes data regulation or soft law guidance through business review letters, though it does not demarcate clearly how to think of the division of labor between regulation and antitrust enforcement.
These are, in a nutshell, the priority items on the wish list of EC antitrust officials. Note that ideas often aired in the U.S. policy discussion have zero chance of success in Europe. Chris Hughes’ and others’ dream of a GAFA breakup will not come from Brussels. There are demanding legal tests to meet to dismember firms in European competition law.8 Nor do we see much demand for institutional reform or procedural innovation, beyond faster investigations.

Will Activist EC Competition Policy in Digital Deliver Consumer Welfare?

Can we assess the economic impact of the EC activist competition policy in digital industries? Short of clear remedial impact in the various closed cases to date, the EC’s motivation and justification have often boiled down to moral high ground antitrust rhetoric, like “fairness” or “trust.” In reality, the answer to whether activist competition policy delivers consumer welfare necessitates to discuss several hard questions.
The first is the following: Can we be confident that activist antitrust policy against platforms is socially beneficial, absent a clear understanding of the relationship between market structure, business models, and consumer surplus in digital markets? On this, a recent paper by Brynjolfsson, Collis & Eggers cuts new ground.9 The authors use choice experiments to estimate the consumer surplus created by digital goods with zero price. Concretely, their study asked users how much compensation they would require to forego the digital good. Though the study does not compare monopolized digital goods to competitive ones, it estimates the consumer surplus generated by platforms like Facebook or digital services like search engines. The study finds that the monthly median consumer surplus for a Facebook user is 48 USD. Emerging experimental work relativizes policy arguments that characterize users as unpaid data subjects. Moreover, it suggests that platforms that profit on other sides of the market earn Ricardian rents, not monopoly ones (otherwise, they would charge for the service).
Second hard question: Are Google, Facebook, and other digital platforms active in online advertising markets actually engines of intense non-price competition in the economy (and thus enablers of competitive markets)? In traditional economics, advertisement is modeled as a form of non-price competition. So, if demand (and supply) of online advertisement grows (as it has historically done), should we not consider (i) that this is a sign that there is increased non-price competition between advertisers; and (ii) that by providing the technological infrastructure that makes non-price competition possible, tech giants actually enable competitive markets? This, in turn, calls into turns on its head several sacred cows of European competition policy. For indeed, the argument could imply that tech giants’ rivalry is an instantiation of the “wasteful competition” argument, where excessive competition leads to oversupply of socially harmful activities, like excessive advertisement or personal data extraction.
Third hard question: What can we learn from past antitrust cases? Say we accept the commonly heard claim that big antitrust cases like U.S. v. Microsoft10 helped create firms like Google and other tech giants. We still fail to understand the causal, let alone, functional relationship between the antitrust case and subsequent social benefits like new firm entry, technological innovation, and dynamic efficiency. Did these firms enter on the expectation that Microsoft would be deterred (by antitrust litigation) to squash them? Or because of a corporate culture change at Microsoft? Or because Microsoft was distracted by protracted antitrust processes (in the U.S., but also most likely by subsequent proceedings elsewhere in the world)? On this, retrospective studies of past antitrust cases would certainly help improve the stock of expert knowledge, and assist the design of antitrust remedies, though we have to be aware that they will not yield unambiguous results.
Fourth hard question: What kind of policy can assist the creation of a European GAFA? Many in Brussels who support active antitrust enforcement in digital markets in their day job dream at night of a European Google or Facebook. Not long ago, a German minister talked of a European AI “Airbus.” Last time I checked, we had not found the recipe. But aren’t we faced with a puzzling natural experiment? For the past 30 years, the U.S. has given birth to GAFA under a weak antitrust enforcement paradigm; and in the past 20 years, China has given birth to BAT under a policy paradigm where centralized cooperation prevails over decentralized competition. Of course, it would be hasty to infer that deviations from mainstream antitrust policies help create superstar firms in tech.11 There are too many confounding factors: labor and capital market institutions, cultural and social norms, demographic and linguistic homogeneity, size of population sets, etc. At the same time, must domestic consumer welfare driven antitrust policy be sensitive or insensitive to the growth of large home tech firms when foreign incumbents enjoy first mover advantages?12 This issue could lead to original developments in Europe like M&A restrictions or forced data sharing against U.S. and China tech, as we hear increased calls for strong industrial policy and digital sovereignty.
Conclusion
One should expect sustained European antitrust policy in digital markets in upcoming years. And certainly more, beyond antitrust. Many of the previous European Parliament Members (“MEPs”) who worked on tech have just been reelected, and especially the German conservative group who were vocal supporters of the content industry and the press against Google. There is an expectation that they will push the envelope on a number of regulatory initiatives. Some of these reforms may have a much more adverse impact on tech platforms than the one-year-old GDPR. One that should already make the digital industry shiver is a possible attempt to discard the limited liability regime applicable to passive online intermediaries for illegal users’ activities under e-commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.13 In her recently announced political platform EC president elect Ursula Von der Leyen announced an upcoming Digital Services Act that will upgrade “liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products.” As Carl Shapiro says, “look to Brussels.”

Nexstar Media and Tribune Media must divest television stations in 13 markets to resolve antitrust concerns over their proposed US$6.4 billion merger, the US Justice Department stated on Wednesday, July 31.
The markets are centered in Davenport, Iowa; Des Moines, Iowa; Ft. Smith, Arkansas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Huntsville, Alabama; Indianapolis;Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salt Lake City; and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the Department said in a statement.
“Without the required divestitures, Nexstar’s merger with Tribune threatens significant competitive harm to cable and satellite TV subscribers and small businesses,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in the statement.
Nexstar announced in December it had agreed to buy Chicago-based Tribune in a transaction worth US$6.4 billion, a deal that would make it the largest regional US television station operator.

Roche, the Switzerland-based drugmaker, announced says it has extended its US$4.3 billion offer to buy all shares of Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics Inc. from investors past its July 31 target date until September 3, so US and UK regulators can finish their longer-than-expected review on the combination.
“The offer was extended to provide additional time for the US Federal Trade Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority to complete their previously disclosed reviews” of the deal, Roche and Spark said in a this joint statement.
The companies had hoped to combine Roche, which makes the hemophilia treatment Hemlibra among many other drugs, with Spark, one of several biotech companies developing a gene therapy hemophilia cure among its projects, by last spring.
The $4.3 billion sale, first announced in February, was the biggest payout for a gene therapy company since doctors at research hospitals including Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania began gene therapy trials in the 1990s.
But Roche and Spark have had to delay the deal closing several times, as U.S. and UK regulators consider how the combination will change the companies’ incentives and plans to speed product development, and how that could affect prices and availability of their therapies.

654,"July 31, 2019",US: Artist Rights Alliance urges Big Tech crackdown,"

According to a report in The Hill, a trade group representing musicians and other content creators wants Congress to take in their perspectives as it investigates the effects of large tech companies’ market power.
The Artist Rights Alliance (ARA) sent a letter on Wednesday, July 31, to lawmakers leading an antitrust probe into Silicon Valley’s giants, raising concerns about how large internet platforms impact the music business.
“We have seen first-hand the damage wrought by the monopoly platforms using their market power to exploit outdated or misinterpreted public policy,” the group wrote in the letter. “If left unchecked, we fear they will squeeze the life out of American music and every other field of creativity and put the dream of earning a decent living out of reach for the next generation of creators. That is a matter of national concern.”
The ARA, which until recently was known as the Content Creators Coalition, sent the letter to Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), the chairman of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, as well as the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, two agencies which are conducting their own investigations into how large tech companies wield their market power.
Cicilline’s panel has held two hearings in the investigation since launching it in June.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued civil subpoenas to Johnson & Johnson (J&J) in June as part of an investigation into whether contracting practices for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, violated antitrust laws, the company stated in a regulatory filing on Monday, July 29.
J&J stated that the FTC had issued a “civil investigative demand,” or CID, the equivalent of a subpoena to determine if the contracting practices were legal.
Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, alleging its rival’s contracts with health insurers for Remicade were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer’s biosimilar called Inflectra.
Pfizer claimed in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998.

656,"July 30, 2019",Australia: Vodafone laments stalled merger,"

Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) has posted a half-year loss of more than AU$150 million (US$103.1 million), in its first financial results since the competition watchdog made its decision to block the proposed AU$15 billion (US$10.5 billion) merger TPG Telecom.
But the company insisted performance had remained “stable in the face of significant headwinds,” and stated it was committed to the merger, which remains a possibility pending the outcome of a Federal Court challenge.
In the six months to June, VHA reported a loss of AU$153.4 million (US$105.4 million), a 66% increase on the same period last year, when losses were just AU$92.3 million (US$63.4 million).  The company is yet to turn a profit since it was established 10 years ago.
The firm, a joint venture of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison and UK-based telecom giant Vodafone Group, saw revenue fall 1.7% year on year to AU$1.738 billion (US$1.19 billion). Average revenue per user (ARPU) per month, a key measure for telco companies, also fell more than 5% to AU$34.52 (US$23.72).

Combined, the companies will lead worldwide food delivery markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada, Reuters reported on Monday, July 29.
The deal gives Just Eat shareholders 0.09744 in Takeaway.com shares for each Just Eat share, giving them about 52.2% of the combined group, the news outlet stated.
Takeaway.com chief executive Jitse Groen will serve as the combined group’s CEO while Just Eat chairman Mike Evans will be the chair. The new company will be incorporated and headquartered in Amsterdam.
The merger is a triumph for hedge fund investor Cat Rock Capital, which is invested in both companies and has asked for a deal.
Just Eat has undergone a number of changes in recent months, including the acquisition of restaurant tech companies City Pantry, Flyt and Practi. After merging its customer and restaurant operation teams earlier this month, Just Eat went through a round of layoffs in the UK and Ireland to get rid of redundancies.

By Professor Caron Beaton-Wells, University of Melbourne
The final report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on its Digital Platforms Inquiry was released by the government late last week.
The Inquiry concerned “the effect that digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms have on competition in media and advertising services markets.”
Central to the ACCC’s inquiry were the questions: Do Google and Facebook hold substantial power in crucial digital markets and does this pose a risk to competitive processes?
In its final report released by the government, the ACCC correctly answered both questions with a resounding “yes”.
The ACCC did not set out to determine whether either company had broken the competition rules. That can only be determined in an investigation of specific conduct based on specific facts and evidence.
Taking on big tech: Where does Australia stand?
There is at least one such investigation under way and signs are that more will follow.

The skyrocketing cost of a US college education could get even more expensive if two top college textbook companies combine as planned, especially if they succeed in starving off a scrappy competitor: used textbooks.
The proposed merger of textbook publishers McGraw-Hill Education and Cengage Learning Holdings, announced in May, would reduce the number of major textbook publishers from four to three. McGraw-Hill is owned by Apollo Global Management.
Sources close to the two companies say their combined market share is 30% at most. That differs from figures by market research firm Simba Information, which puts Cengage at 22% and McGraw-Hill at 21%, behind leader Pearson with 40% of the market by revenue, and ahead of Wiley at 7%.

660,"July 28, 2019",US: Facebook co-founder aids FTC in antitrust investigation,"
Facebook co-founder and outspoken critic Chris Hughes is working with regulators as they investigate whether the company should be broken up for violating antitrust rules. The Washington Post reported that Hughes is assisting two prominent antitrust academics, and has met with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to discuss its investigation into the social media company he helped found back in 2004.
Hughes involvement is significant even though he left the company more than a decade ago. He’s already made the argument for why Facebook should be broken up, reported The Verge . Now he can provide investigators with a list of people to talk with in order to gain critical insight into the motivations behind key Facebook acquisitions. This insight could be essential to successfully making the antitrust argument to the FTC, alongside arguments from  Scott Hemphill from New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University.
According to The Washington Post, the two academics are attempting to make an argument for breaking up Facebook based on its acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. They argue that these acquisitions broke antitrust rules, because Facebook used them to stamp out competition and shore up its monopolistic position. If they can prove the acquisitions broke antitrust rules, then they can make a case for undoing the empire, similar to the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911. “There is a direct connection between the conduct and the remedy — undo the acquisition,” H...

661,"July 28, 2019",US: Oakland’s antitrust lawsuit against the Raiders is dismissed,"

Oakland’s uphill legal claim for damages from the Raiders’ impending move to Las Vegas got steeper this week when a federal magistrate dismissed, for now, the city’s lawsuit against the National Football League (NFL), reported the San Francisco Chronicle.
Chief US Magistrate Joseph Spero ruled Thursday, July 25, that Oakland hasn’t shown how it is harmed by the NFL’s limit of 32 teams, a central issue in the city’s antitrust suit. But he also gave the city until September 9 to file a revised suit to address that and other objections. A lawyer said Friday the city can meet that deadline.
The Raiders plan to move to Las Vegas for the 2020 season, although a recent agreement with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority could keep the team in Oakland for that season if its new stadium in Las Vegas is not ready.
“We feel very confident that we can address a number of the issues that he raised,” said attorney Bruce Simon. He said the amended suit would also strengthen Oakland’s claim, rejected by Spero, that it has a right to damages under a provision of the NFL’s relocation policy requiring each team to “advance the interests of the League in its home territory.”

André Mathieu, formerly Vice-President and Associate for Cima+, admitted to playing a lead role in the scheme, which targeted Gatineau infrastructure contracts between 2004 and 2008. Mr. Mathieu received a 22-month sentence and was ordered to perform 140 hours of community service.
Claude Marquis, formerly Regional Director, Outaouais for Genivar, admitted to joining the scheme in 2005. Mr. Marquis will be sentenced at a later date.
Following a Competition Bureau investigation, criminal charges were laid in June 2018 against Mr. Mathieu, Mr. Marquis and two others in connection with bid-rigging on a total of 21 City of Gatineau infrastructure contracts awarded between 2004 and 2008.

On Friday, July 26, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) posted the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry.
The report contains 23 recommendations, spanning competition law, consumer protection, media regulation and privacy law, reflecting the intersection of issues arising from the growth of digital platforms.
“Our recommendations are comprehensive and forward looking and deal with the many competition, consumer, privacy and news media issues we have identified throughout the course of this Inquiry,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“Importantly, our recommendations are dynamic in that they will provide the framework and the information that governments and communities will need to address further issues as they arise. Our goal is to assist the community in staying up to date with these issues and futureproofing our enforcement, regulatory and legal frameworks.”
During the course of its Inquiry, the ACCC identified many adverse effects associated with digital platforms, many of which flow from the dominance of Google and Facebook.

The market power of Google and Facebook has distorted the ability of businesses to compete on their merits in advertising, media and a range of other markets

664,"July 24, 2019",US: FTC hits Facebook with $5B fine and new privacy checks,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) formally announced its US$5 billion settlement with Facebook on Wednesday morning, July 24, which is the culmination of a years-long investigation into the Cambridge Analytica scandal and other privacy breaches.
In the agreement filed Wednesday, the FTC alleges that Facebook violated the law by failing to protect data from third parties, serving ads through the use of phone numbers provided for security, and lying to users that its facial recognition software was turned off by default. In order to settle those charges, Facebook will pay US$5 billion and agree to a series of new restrictions on its business.
Aside from the multibillion-dollar fine, Facebook will be required to conduct a privacy review of every new product or service that it develops, and these reviews must be submitted to the CEO and a third-party assessor every quarter. As it directly relates to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook will now be required to obtain purpose and use certifications from apps and third-party developers that want to use Facebook user data. However, there are no limits on what data access the company can authorize to those groups once the disclosure is made.
“The Order imposes a privacy regime that includes a new corporate governance structure, with corporate and individual accountability and more rigorous compliance monitoring,” the three supporting FTC commissioners wrote in a statement. “This approach dramatically increases the likelihood that Face...

United Technologies executives defended their deal after making a slightly raised the company’s 2019 profit outlook reported the Wall Street Journal.
The industrial conglomerate is pursuing a restructuring that will split it into three companies by mid-2020. It also closed its acquisition of aircraft-parts maker Rockwell Collins late last year, and last month agreed to merge with defense contractor Raytheon. 
Activist investors have attacked the Raytheon deal, in particular, saying United Technologies risks losing its focus. But in an interview, finance chief Akhil Johri deflected the criticism.
“Things are starting to come together,” he said. “The investments are paying off.”
The Farmington, Connecticut-based company also is dealing with pressures from trade tensions, including higher US tariffs on inputs, and the grounding of Boeing’s MAX jets. In the recent quarter, the company announced increased volume and pricing for some of its products offset tariff costs.

The UK’s competition authority has launched a merger inquiry into JD Sports’ acquisition of fellow retailer Footasylum, months after the deal completed, reported the Financial Times.
JD agreed to buy the remaining shares in Footasylum that it did not already own in March of this year, in a cash deal that valued the shoe and clothing chain at £90.1 million (US$112.6 million). Shareholders approved the deal the following month.
The Competition and Markets Authority announced an initial investigation in May, which banned the two groups from integrating their businesses, and on Wednesday said it would launch a full merger inquiry.

Deutsche Telekom has called a leadership meeting on Wednesday, July 24, in expectation of US regulatory approval of the proposed merger of its US T-Mobile unit with rival Sprint, according to Reuters.
A meeting to update Deutsche Telekom’s supervisory board on US strategy was scheduled for 10:15 am, Handelsblatt reported.
It cited unnamed sources as saying that officials at the US Department of Justice (DOJ) were expected to give the nod to the US$26 billion deal after months of negotiations to address antitrust concerns arising from the deal.
T-Mobile, in which Deutsche Telekom owns a 63% stake, and Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank, have offered a series of concessions, including divesting T-Mobile’s Boost prepaid brand and a slab of spectrum to alleviate DOJ concerns on market dominance.

668,"July 23, 2019",US:  DOJ launching broad antitrust review of Big Tech,"
The Justice Department is launching a formal antitrust review of the nation’s biggest tech companies, raising the stakes for Silicon Valley after weeks of anticipation in Washington, reported the Wall Street Journal.
The review appears wide-ranging and could cover conduct from numerous firms. Policymakers in Washington have increasingly focused on complaints of anti-competitive behavior concerning Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google; while those companies were not named by the Justice Department on Tuesday, the agency indicated it will look into areas where those companies are dominant players.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the DOJ said in a press release Tuesday afternoon. “The Department’s Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others.”
The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission had previously negotiated to divide up oversight jurisdiction over the tech industry, with Justice assuming responsibility for Google. But the new, broader probe is separate from a potential Google-specific investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report the review.

669,"July 23, 2019","US: Facebook, Amazon spend millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny","
Facebook and Amazon have been spending big to influence government policy on Capitol Hill. Each company has spent around US$4 million on lobbying in the second quarter of 2019, reported CNBC.
Another tech giant, Google, spent much less, at US$2.9 million for the quarter. Apple was the lowest spender in the pack, at US$1.8 million for the second quarter.
These four tech companies are currently embroiled in an antitrust investigation which began at the beginning of June. The investigation aims to find out whether these companies have too much influence over the market and whether they have been violating antitrust law.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerrod Nadler (Democrat – New York) has said that “there is growing evidence that a growing handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content and communications.”
Democratic presidential candidates have also taken aim at the big tech companies, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren vowing to “break up big tech” and introduce legislation if elected president that would set new antitrust standards for the companies.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is expected to announce a roughly US$5 billion settlement with Facebook as early as this week of its investigation into the social media company’s handling of user data, two sources briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The FTC, Justice Department, and Facebook declined to comment. The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Reuters and other outlets reported July 12 that the FTC had voted to approve the settlement, but was awaiting the concurrence of the Justice Department.
The settlement is expected to include government restrictions and oversight on how Facebook treats user privacy. It would mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.

Tobii AB announced that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced that it postponed its final conclusion in the investigation of the acquisition of Smartbox Assistive Technology by Tobii by up to eight weeks.
CMA’s final conclusion was expected to be announced by July 25, but has now been extended with up to eight weeks meaning the reference period will be extended to September 19, 2019. Tobii continues to work closely with the CMA in the final stages of the investigation.
On October 1, 2018, Tobii AB acquired Smartbox Assistive Technology, a UK based company operating in the field of assistive technology for communication. Smartbox employs some 70 people. Net sales in 2017 were £9.3 million (US$11.6 million).
Upon the announcement of the acquisition, the CMA opened an investigation, expressing concerns that Tobii’s acquisition of Smartbox may lead to less choice, lack of innovation, and higher prices for people with speech and language disabilities in the UK. Tobii disagreed with these concerns and has since worked closely with the CMA during the investigation process. The two companies’ brands and operations have been held separate, pending completion of the review.

672,"July 22, 2019",Advertising as Monopolization in the Information Age,"
By Ramsi Woodcock (University of Kentucky)
Economists have long recognized that advertising has two main functions: to inform and to persuade. In the information age, the information function is obsolete, because consumers can get all the product information they want from a quick Google search. That makes virtually all advertising today purely persuasive in function. The courts have long recognized that purely persuasive advertising is anticompetitive, because it induces consumers to buy products that they do not really prefer, harming consumers and placing sellers of consumers’ preferred products at a competitive disadvantage. Antitrust enforcers must respond to the obsolescence of the information function of advertising by treating advertising as a per se illegal form of monopolization under the Sherman Act.

The US ban on sales to China’s Huawei is expected to be a topic of discussion Monday, July 22, between White House regulators and tech executives.
Semiconductor and software executives were invited to a meeting by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, two sources briefed on the meeting told Reuters.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also expected to attend the White House event, along with Intel, Qualcomm, Google, and Micron, Reuters reported. Broadcom Inc and Microsoft Corp also received invitations.
The subject of Huawei was expected “to come up, but that it is not the reason why they are convening the meeting,” said the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
US companies’ ties to Huawei are shaky since the Trump administration blacklisted the world’s top maker of telecommunications equipment, citing national security concerns.
The  ban prevents American companies from buying parts and equipment from Huawei without the approval of the US government. President Trump also signed an executive order in May that prevents US companies from using Huawei equipment.
With US export blacklisting along with other actions against Huawei, founder Ren Zhengfei expects revenue to be roughly US$100 billion this year — down from last year’s approximately US$107 billion.
Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said in May that licenses would be issued where there is no threat to national security.

Endo Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay US$2.3 million to 18 states late last week, settling allegations that the drugmaker paid a competitor to keep a generic version of pain relief drug Lidoderm (Lidocaine patch 5%) off the market.
Endo Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay US$2.3 million to 18 states late last week, settling allegations that the drugmaker paid a competitor to keep a generic version of pain relief drug Lidoderm off the market.
Utah and the other states had accused Endo of entering into a reverse-payment agreement (a pay-for-delay agreement) with Watson Laboratories to obstruct generic competition to Lidoderm for more than a year.
“At the time of the Lidoderm agreement, Lidoderm was Endo’s most important branded prescription drug product. In 2011, Endo generated more than $825 million from its branded Lidoderm patches, comprising 30% of Endo’s total annual revenues,” alleged the states.
According to the claim, Endo paid Watson, which is now a Teva subsidiary, to not compete with Endo’s “lucrative” Lidoderm franchise.
In the separately filed settlement agreement, Endo denied that it engaged in any wrongful or unlawful conduct. Under the settlement, the drugmaker agreed to pay US$2.3 million to the states.

675,"July 22, 2019",US: Ninth Circuit received amicus brief saying they should stay Qualcomm injunction,"

Retired Federal Circuit Chief Judge Paul Michel filed an amicus brief in Qualcomm’s appeal of the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust case to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The following day, the United States government filed a statement of interest with the appellate court as well. Both parties filed in support of Qualcomm’s request for a partial stay of an injunction handed down this May in the Northern District of California, which requires Qualcomm to license its standard essential patents (SEPs) to modem-chip suppliers after determining that the company’s “no license, no chips” policy violated US antitrust law.
In addition to Judge Michel’s brief, the United States government also filed a brief in support of Qualcomm, with representatives of the Department of Justice, Department of Energy, and even representatives of the Federal Trade Commission siding with Qualcomm over the FTC and against Judge Koh’s decision. Moreover, Ericsson similarly filed a brief supporting Qualcomm, stating saying that the public will not benefit from the injunction and will, in fact, be harmed because this is a critical moment for the deployment and future of 5G technology.

Concerns about the power of the major technology companies echoed across the nation’s capital on Tuesday, with politicians in both parties demanding more regulatory scrutiny of the tech giants’ reach and plans for expansion.

In three hearings, which were focused on Facebook Inc.’s cryptocurrency plans, alleged Google censorship, as well as on an antitrust examination of Facebook, Google, its owner Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., the companies took punches on a range of political and policy issues.

The EU’s Competition Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation into Amazon to investigate whether the company is using sales data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller sellers on the Marketplace platform. The Commission stated it will look into Amazon’s agreements with marketplace sellers, as well as how Amazon uses data to choose which retailer to link to using the “Buy Box” on its site.
The announcement came on the same day that Amazon announced changes to its third-party seller service agreement in response to a separate antitrust investigation by German regulators.
“E-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices,” said the EU’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. “We need to ensure that large online platforms don’t eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behavior. I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon’s business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer, to assess its compliance with EU competition rules.”

Amazon struck a deal with Germany and Austria to shut down antitrust probes into how it handles other merchants on its site, just as it faces a bigger European Union investigation into its use of sellers’ data, reported Bloomberg.
The US retail giant will change its business services agreement worldwide in mid-August to address a number of complaints from sellers, the German Federal Cartel Office announced in an emailed statement on Wednesday, July 17.
“We have obtained far-reaching improvements for sellers active on Amazon marketplaces worldwide,” Andreas Mundt, president of the German regulator, said in the statement. “The proceedings are now terminated.”
Amazon’s troubles in Europe are only just beginning even as those two probes end. The company faces a full-blown EU antitrust investigation that could be announced as soon as this week. That probe targets Amazon’s online business model as a host to many smaller retailers in an inquiry that could also affect other tech giants.

The US Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling against mobile chip supplier Qualcomm on Tuesday, July 16, citing support from the Energy Department and the Defense Department (DoD).
“For DoD, Qualcomm is a key player both in terms of its trusted supply chain and as a leader in innovation, and it would be impossible to replace Qualcomm’s critical role in 5G technology in the short term,” Ellen M. Lord, Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, wrote in a filing made in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Qualcomm, the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks, on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year. 
US District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market. Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers, which include firms like Taiwan’s MediaTek and Huawei Technologies’s HiSilicon chip unit.
Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal. The San Diego, California, company has argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.

The nation’s biggest tech companies—Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple—faced House Judiciary hearings on how their market power affects competition.
In three hearings, which were focused on Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans, alleged Google censorship, as well as on an antitrust examination of Facebook, Google, its owner Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, companies took punches on a range of political and policy issues, reported the Wall Street Journal.
“In an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,” said House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island) at the outset of a hearing featuring executives from the four US tech giants, the Journal reported. “But as a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.”
In their testimonies, the companies claimed that they still face competition in markets from advertising to apps, and that their online platforms have facilitated the growth of many other smaller companies.
“We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world,” said Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy. Mr. Cicilline’s hearing raises the prospect of Big Tech’s worst fear: actions to break them up or fundamentally restrict their business models.

682,"July 16, 2019",US: DOJ supports the NFL in Oakland’s antitrust suit,"


The Justice Department is asking a federal court in California to dismiss Oakland, California’s antitrust lawsuit against the Oakland Raiders and the National Football League (NFL), arguing that the city lacks standing.
The city charged that the Raiders, which will move to Las Vegas in 2020, violated federal antitrust law when the team broke their contract. Oakland is seeking to recover tax revenues from the team that would be lost after the move.
Oakland filed suit in December, alleging the NFL and Raiders violated antitrust laws by approving the move to Las Vegas, and claimed doing so amounted to a group boycott of Oakland. Outside attorneys have taken the city’s case on a contingency basis, meaning it comes at no cost to the city. The city also alleges in its suit that the Raiders violated the league’s relocation policy by not seriously negotiating with Oakland and Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott’s group, which proposed to help finance a new stadium at the Coliseum.
But attorneys for the Raiders and NFL wrote that the competition between Las Vegas and Oakland was not a violation of antitrust laws, which are designed to promote competition and prohibit monopolies. The city did not suffer antitrust injury, the attorneys said, but rather “the injury flows from an increase in competition” and “another community’s willingness to make an offer better than Oakland’s.”

684,"July 16, 2019",The Record of Weak US Merger Enforcement in Big Tech,"
By Diana L. Moss (American Antitrust Institute)
The term “Big Tech” is often used to describe the five largest multinational online service or computer hardware and software companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. These companies hold five of the top six slots, by market value, for publicly traded firms. The growth of Big Tech over the past three decades is a function of numerous forces. These range from economic phenomena such as network effects and winner-take-all markets, organic growth resulting from innovative business models and technologies, to expansion through a series of acquisitions of smaller, potential, or nascent rivals.
While Big Tech has undoubtedly produced benefits, significant concerns have coalesced around it. The growth of Big Tech has created controversy over the companies’ role in our society and raised a suite of competition issues that are attracting attention from Congress and enforcers. These include effects on innovation and market entry; incentives to compete on price and non-price dimensions of competition such as privacy; and the potential for artificial intelligence-driven algorithmic pricing to facilitate coordinated conduct. The debate over the size and alleged dominance of Big Tech companies has promoted wideranging proposals to use the antitrust laws to break them up. But few of these proposals are driven by a methodological, fact-based analysis. Such analysis would explore the strategic competitive abilities and in...

Surescripts has moved to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) charge from earlier this year that it holds an illegal monopoly on the e-prescribing market.
This past April, the FTC alleged that Surescripts “intentionally set out to keep e-prescription routing and eligibility customers on both sides of each market from using additional platforms (a practice known as multihoming) using anticompetitive exclusivity agreements, threats, and other exclusionary tactics.”
FTC stated its suit aims to counter that outsized influence and competition in the marketplace and to provide “monetary redress to consumers.”
FTC has stated its case against Surescripts was just part of its larger ongoing efforts to end anti-competitive practices that put consumers at a disadvantage and raise the cost of care.
“Surescripts’ illegal contracts denied customers and, ultimately, patients, the benefits of competition – including lower prices, increased output, thriving innovation, higher quality, and more customer choice,” said FTC Bureau of Competition Director Bruce Hoffman in April. “Through this litigation, we hope to eliminate the anticompetitive conduct, open the relevant markets to competition, and redress the harm that Surescripts’s conduct has caused.”

A pair of Republican senators have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate “tech censorship practices,” reported Bloomberg.
Senators Josh Hawley (Montana) and Ted Cruz (Texas) sent a letter to all five commissioners (the majority are Republicans) to ask them to study how tech companies curate content “due to the enormous influence” they have over speech and what they called the “alarming and endless possibilities for abuse.”
“Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech,” the two Republican senators wrote in the letter, which Hawley’s office provided. “They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.”
The request comes as Republicans increasingly allege that the companies engage in systematic anti-conservative bias, an unsupported claim. But the possibilities for abuse “are alarming and endless,” including potentially swaying elections, the senators claim.

This comes as tech giants are under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers in both parties, over data privacy, antitrust issues, and accusations of partisan censorship.
On Friday, July 12, the Wall Street Journal reported the FTC agreed to a $5 billion settlement with Facebook over its privacy missteps.

689,"July 15, 2019",US: Beef packers antitrust suit to be consolidated into one,"
Three lawsuits filed against America’s largest beef packers can be consolidated, a Minnesota federal court ruled last week.
US Magistrate Judge Hildy Bowbeer wrote in a nine-page order the court will oversee three proposed class actions filed by ranchers and industry groups that claim beef packers colluded to suppress prices and violated federal antitrust laws.
In April, R-CALF USA (Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America) filed suit in Chicago against Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill, and National Beef Packing Company, and certain of their affiliates alleging that from at least January 1, 2015 through the present, the packers conspired to depress the price of fed cattle they purchased from American ranchers, thereby inflating their own margins and profits.

The European Commission published on Monday, July 15, the Report on Competition Policy for 2018, presenting its most important policy and legislative initiatives, as well as key decisions adopted last year.
The 2018 report stresses how fostering a competitive internal market benefits both EU consumers and companies, with a focus on the effectiveness of competition enforcement, challenges in the digital economy, a more resilient financial sector, and a fair and non-discriminatory taxation of firms active in the EU, as well as on promoting a global competition culture.

El Senado de Francia ha aprobado un impuesto especial, a ser aplicado sobre los ingresos de los gigantes de la tecnología como Google, Amazon y Facebook, desafiando una advertencia del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump, quien criticó que dicho impuesto “se dirige injustamente a las compañías estadounidenses”.
El mandatario de EEUU ordenó una investigación sobre el planeado “impuesto digital” de Francia sobre las empresas de tecnología. El impuesto del 3% se aplicaría a los ingresos generados en Francia de aproximadamente 30 compañías importantes, principalmente de los EEUU.
“Francia es soberana, y Francia decide sus propias normas fiscales. Y este seguirá siendo el caso “, dijo el ministro de Finanzas de Francia, Bruno Le Maire, en una declaración. Añadió que EEUU y  Francia podrían encontrar acuerdos, en lugar de utilizar amenazas, para llegar a un acuerdo sobre los “impuestos justos” de los gigantes de Internet.
En una declaración el miércoles, el representante comercial de los EEUU, Robert Lighthizer, dijo que su país investigará si el impuesto francés “es discriminatorio o irracional y representa una carga o restringe el comercio de los Estados Unidos”. La investigación podría llevar a EEUU  A imponer aranceles o restricciones comerciales sobre productos franceses, intensificando un conflicto comercial.

692,"July 14, 2019",US: Gov will probe whether French tax on tech is fair,"
The US government will investigate whether a French plan to tax American technology companies is fair, and it could potentially issue retaliatory tariffs in response, according to a report by The Financial Times.
The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said that he would carry out a Section 301 investigation into France’s digital services tax. Lighthizer said the tax unfairly spotlights American companies.
The move could potentially lead to tariffs on French items like wine or automobiles, although both parties would have to try and reach a negotiated settlement before it gets to that.
“The United States is very concerned that the digital services tax which is expected to pass the French Senate tomorrow unfairly targets American companies,” Lighthizer said. “The president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.”
A source in the Finance Ministry in France told the FT that the tax was completely compliant with all international agreements and that it wasn’t appropriate to potentially threaten trade tariffs because of it.
On Thursday, July 11, senators in France voted on the passage of the tax, which will put a charge of 3% on a company’s turnover if it has revenues higher than €750 million (US$845.5 million) worldwide and €25 million (US$28.2 million) in France.
Some of the affected companies would include Apple, Facebook...

E.ON is expected to win EU antitrust approval to buy rival Innogy’s network and retail assets, sources said on Friday, July 12.
The green light from the European Commission is set to come after E.ON sweetened its concessions to address competition concerns, the sources, who are familiar with the matter, said.
The deal, which will mark the biggest overhaul of the German power industry since the country sped up its exit from nuclear energy, is part of a bigger asset swap with Innogy’s parent RWE and will more than double E.ON’s customers in Germany to nearly 14 million.
E.ON last month offered to sell part of its retail business in Hungary as well as Innogy’s retail power and gas business in the Czech Republic with 1.6 million customers, after the European Commission voiced concerns that the deal may reduce competition.

France’s Senate approved a tax on the revenues of tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook on Thursday, defying a warning from the President Donald Trump administration that it “unfairly targets American companies.”
On Wednesday, Trump ordered an investigation into France’s planned “digital tax” on tech companies. The 3% tax would apply to the French revenues of roughly 30 major companies, mostly from the US.
“France is sovereign, and France decides its own tax rules. And this will continue to be the case,” France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement.
He added the US and France could find agreements, rather than using threats, to reach a deal on the “fair taxation” of internet giants.
In a statement Wednesday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the US will investigate whether the French tax “is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.” The investigation could lead to the US imposing tariffs or trade restrictions on French goods, potentially escalating the global fight over trade.

T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including to sell the prepaid brand Boost, to gain merger approval, but they still need a green light from the US Department of Justice. The department’s antitrust staff recommended the agency block the deal.

The companies are in talks with Dish to hammer out the Boost sale in order to win over the department.
The parties are haggling over restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future, with T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

International Business Machines closed its roughly $34 billion acquisition of open-source software company Red Hat, the company said, a deal for the 108-year-old tech giant that will help define Chief Executive Ginni Rometty’s legacy.
With Red Hat, the most expensive deal in IBM’s history, the company hopes to gain on competitors in cloud computing, where users store information remotely instead of on their own machines.
IBM was an early proponent of the cloud more than a decade ago but fell behind asAmazon.com and Microsoft gobbled up the majority of the now-booming market.
IBM’s counterpunch has been to court companies that want to use the cloud but keep their most sensitive data locked down on internal computers, a model dubbed the “hybrid cloud.”
“I view this as a defining moment in IBM’s cloud journey,” Ms. Rometty said. “This puts us in position in hybrid cloud.”

ICAP, the world’s biggest inter-dealer broker, won on Wednesday, July 10, another victory against a €14.9 million (US$16.8 million) fine from the EU’s antitrust regulator, when Europe’s top court threw out an appeal by the watchdog.
Two years ago, a lower tribunal dismissed part of the regulatory ruling and scrapped the fine, citing flaws in the European Commission’s decision.
The EU competition authority sanctioned ICAP in February 2015 for rigging the yen Libor financial benchmark in several cartels with Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and Citigroup at various periods.
ICAP denied wrongdoing while the banks admitted taking part in the cartels in return for lower fines. ICAP subsequently challenged the EU decision at the General Court which found in its favor.
The Commission then appealed to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).
Judges dismissed the action, marking the latest setback to the Commission in a string of appeals by companies against its tax rulings and other cases.

According to Reuters, Qualcomm asked a US appeals court to pause an antitrust ruling that could drastically alter its business model while it tries to overturn the ruling.
The filing with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals came after US District Judge Lucy Koh last week declined to put on hold her own ruling in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission against the San Diego company, which is the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks.
Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market. Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers, which include firms like Taiwan’s MediaTek. Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal, which could take more than a year.

700,"July 9, 2019",US: White House snubs Facebook at social media summit,"
Facebook said that it has not been invited to the White House’s social media summit being held later this week.
White House spokesman Judd Deere announced last month the meeting would “bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment,” and recently said that President Donald Trump will speak at the event.
While the White House hasn’t revealed who will be attending the July 11 event, a spokesman for Facebook said in an email that it had not been invited, according to Reuters.
Several conservatives on social media have said they will be attending the summit, including Bill Mitchell, an online show host and Trump supporter, as well as two social media users who posted photos of the invitation to the summit.
It might not be surprising that Facebook hasn’t been asked to attend. Trump has regularly attacked Facebook and Twitter, accusing the social media sites of being “biased” in favor of Democrats. He also claimed in an interview last month that Twitter has made it “very hard for people to join me at Twitter… and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.”
He took to Twitter in March, writing, “Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats. But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before!”

Navigating through Merger Control Review in China – Challenges for U.S. Companies during a Time of Uncertainty By Cheng Liu, Audrey Yumeng Li, and Jeff Liu (King Wood Mallesons)1
Escalating tensions between China and the United States (the “U.S.”) over the China-U.S. trade war since early 2018 have led to growing concerns that it may become more challenging now for deals involving US companies to obtain antitrust approval under China’s merger control regime.  Under these circumstances, parties involved in a global merger almost always ask whether the China merger control review is impacted by geopolitical factors, and if not, what are the issues which may lead to greater scrutiny. This article will try to answer these questions, and offer some practical guidance for U.S. companies to better prepare for their merger filings in China during this uncertain time of China U.S. trade tensions.
 
Background 
The China U.S. trade tensions have lasted for over 450 days.2  In the last round of tariff increases, the U.S. increased tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on May 20, 2019, following which China raised tariffs on US$60 billion worth of American goods from June 1, 2019.  Thus far, the U.S. has already slapped tariffs on US$250 billion worth of Chinese products, and has threatened tariffs on US$325 billion more, while China has set tariffs on US$110 billion worth of US goods.3
Tensions caused by trade has started to spread to other areas....

Novelis, a US unit of India’s Hindalco Industries announced a bid for Aleris in July last year to gain a foothold in supplying the aerospace industry and other value-added businesses globally.
One of the world’s biggest suppliers of aluminum sheets for beverage cans and car parts, Novelis is making its biggest acquisition as part of its diversification into premium markets.
EU antitrust regulators on Monday sent a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to the companies, setting out their concerns, particularly on the impact of the deal on carmakers, the sources. The companies have two weeks to respond.
The European Commission opened an investigation into the deal in March, worried that the deal may reduce competition in the supply of various semi-finished aluminum products, reduced choice in suppliers and higher prices for aluminum car body sheets.

703,"July 7, 2019",Letting the Internet regulate itself was good idea — in the 1990s,"
It’s time for lawmakers to step back in, carefully.
By Margaret O’Mara, New York Times
Tech regulation may be the only thing on which a polarized Capitol Hill can agree. “We should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, and perhaps we will,” President Trump recently declared. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has made the breakup of tech companies a central plank of her campaign. Even Silicon Valley-friendly contenders like Pete Buttigieg have called for curbs on the industry’s power.
If Americans buy into the idea that the tech industry is an entrepreneurial, free-market miracle in which government played little part, then the prospect of stricter regulation is ominous. But that isn’t what actually happened. Throughout the history of the tech industry in the United States, the government has been an important regulator, funder and partner. Public policies — including antitrust enforcement, data privacy regulation and rules governing online content — helped make the industry into the innovative juggernaut that it is today. In recent years, lawmakers pulled back from this role. As they return to it, the history of American tech delivers some important lessons.
Advocates of big-tech breakup often point to precedent set by the antitrust cases of the twentieth century. The three biggest were Microsoft in the 1990s, IBM in the 1950s through the 1980s, and the moves that turned AT&T into a regulated monopoly in 1913 and ended wit...

By Nicolas Petit (University of Liege)
This paper lays down the rudiments of a descriptive theory of competition among the digital tech platforms known as “FANGs” (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), amidst rising academic and policy polarization over the answer to what seems to be – at least at the formulation level – a simple question: are FANGs monopolies? With an open mind, this paper looks at whether the textbook monopoly model is the appropriate framework to analyze digital markets. It finds that observed average tendencies of FANGs expose the limitations of the textbook monopoly model (I), proposes an alternative theory of competition with uncertainty (II), and considers competition law and policy implications (III). This paper builds on draft sections of a forthcoming book on tech giants and public policy (OUP, 2010).

A former Deutsche Bank manager, who was extradited to Britain from Italy to face criminal charges that he had helped to manipulate global Euribor interest rates, has been cleared by a London jury, the British prosecutor said on Thursday.
Andreas Hauschild, who ran the German bank’s Frankfurt team responsible for rate submissions, was acquitted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court, a spokeswoman for the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) prosecutor said.
The case was the seventh rate-rigging prosecution brought by the SFO after a seven-year criminal investigation.
Prosecutors alleged the German national had conspired to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate) – a benchmark that helps determine rates on an estimated $150 trillion to $180 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide – between January 2005 and December 2009.
The acquittal of the 54-year-old, who had declined to appear in a London court to be formally charged in 2016, follows the conviction of four other former bankers on similar charges, including former Deutsche Bank star trader Christian Bittar and ex Barclays trader Phillipe Moryoussef.

707,"July 3, 2019",EU: EC investigates Apple’s GDPR compliance,"
Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) announced that it has launched a third privacy investigation into Apple.
The tech giant’s main regulator in the European Union (EU) stated it is looking into whether Apple has complied with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy law regarding an access request from a customer. Under GDPR, regulators can hit companies that do not comply with the regulations with fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue or €20 million (US$22 million), whichever is higher.
Last year, the DPC opened an investigation into how Apple processes users’ personal data for targeted advertising on its platform and whether its privacy policy on how that data is processed is transparent enough. The agency currently has 20 investigations into tech companies open, with Facebook in the lead with eight individual probes and with two into its WhatsApp subsidiary and one into Instagram.
In addition, Twitter is under three different investigations, while Google, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, and US digital advertising company Quantcast each have one probe.
Despite the scrutiny, Apple CEO Tim Cook called on the US government last year to embrace privacy laws similar to the EU. He said it was time “for the rest of the world” to take a page from the EU, and create a comprehensive framework to protect the personal information of consumers.

Mylan is urging a federal judge to reject rival drugmaker Sanofi’s claims the company engaged in a scheme to squelch competition to its EpiPen allergy treatment, which became the center of a political firestorm over price increases.
Mylan in a brief filed on Friday in federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, argued Sanofi lacked evidence to support claims it took actions to “crush” the competitive threat posed by Sanofi’s newer product, Auvi-Q.
The suit filed  in Trenton, NJ, Sanofi said Mylan caused it to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in sales by erecting barriers to US consumers’ access to and use of a rival product, Auvi-Q.
In particular, Sanofi said Mylan offered rebates to insurers, pharmaceutical benefit managers and state Medicaid agencies conditioned on Auvi-Q not being an epinephrine auto-injector device they would reimburse for use by consumers.

Facebook’s announcement of Libra late last month has spurred greater regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies, with a particular eye on who may be bringing those cryptos into the larger payments ecosystem.

As stated by Andreas Mundt, the president of the German regulatory watchdog, said that examination of cryptocurrencies “could become a topic for us.”
This would not be the first time the Federal Cartel Office has focused on Facebook. As recently as February, the regulator ruled that the social media giant had to reduce data collection protocols; upon appeal by Facebook, the issue is now being decided by the German legal system.
The antitrust issues may play out, as Facebook has said Libra may be used to expand into areas like credit. As has been reported, the Calibra wallet is envisioned to help spur commerce through apps such as Facebook Marketplace and Instagram Checkout.
Facebook Fines
And, you’d be forgiven for thinking that regulatory news tied to commerce and payments would be termed “all Facebook, all the time.” In Italy, the country’s data protection regulator fined Facebook the equivalent of $1.1 million for violating Italy’s data privacy laws in the wake of the Cambridge Analytics scandal.
That scandal, of course, wa...

EU antitrust regulators are set to approve without conditions a $35 billion bid by US financial services provider Fidelity National Information Services for payments company Worldpay, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The deal, announced in March, is the biggest in the fast-growing electronics payments industry which has seen a wave of consolidation recently.
A merger between the two companies would be the largest in the payments industry, which has experienced a boon in recent years as more people turn to the digital economy for online purchases.
Global digital payments are expected to top $3 trillion after topping out at about $137 billion in 2017, according to research company The Business.

712,"July 1, 2019",Vietnam: Watchdog appeals Grab-Uber antitrust ruling,"
Vietnam’s competition watchdog has appealed a ruling that Grab did not violate antitrust laws in its acquisition of Uber’s operations in the country.
The Vietnam Competition and Customer Protection Authority (VCA) said in a statement that it disagreed with the ruling of the Vietnam Competition Council (VCC) on June 17, saying the acquisition has led to Grab controlling Uber’s operations in the country, which is a violation of the law.
VCA is under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, while VCC is independent of the ministry. The Competition Law states that if any merger or acquisition leads to a 50 percent market share for a company, it can only be carried out with official approval.
VCA’s statement came after the Vietnam Competition Council had said the Grab-Uber deal in Vietnam did not involve equity. Grab did not have voting rights in Uber Vietnam after the transaction, it had said, adding that the Netherlands-based Uber B.V. continued to operate the Uber app after the deal, not GrabTaxi.

Donald Trump lanzó un ataque mordaz contra autoridades de Europa, diciendo que “nos tratan peor que a China” y que la jefa antimonopolio de la UE, Margrethe Vestager, “odia a los Estados Unidos tal vez más que cualquier persona que haya conocido”, informó el Financial Times.
Hablando con Fox el miércoles 26 de junio, el presidente de los Estados Unidos dijo que “las naciones europeas se crearon para aprovecharse de los Estados Unidos”. Tienen peores barreras comerciales que China ”.
“Ella odia a los Estados Unidos tal vez más que cualquier persona que haya conocido”, dijo el Sr. Trump. “Lo que ella le hace a nuestro país. Ella está demandando a todas nuestras compañías. Deberíamos estar demandando a Google y Facebook, y todo eso “. Añadió: “Están demandando a Apple. Están demandando a todos “.
La más reciente embestida del Sr. Trump llegó el mismo día en que la Sra. Vestager lanzó un caso antimonopolio contra el fabricante estadounidense de chips Broadcom, acusándolo de usar “restricciones contractuales” con los fabricantes de decodificadores de TV y módems para excluir a sus rivales. Broadcom es uno de los proveedores de componentes para dispositivos más grandes del mundo.

En el primer debate primario demócrata de 2020, la senadora Elizabeth Warren defendió su posición de que el gobierno debería separar Google, Facebook y Amazon, informó Venture Beat. El tema surgió el miércoles 26 de junio durante una discusión sobre la consolidación empresarial y las leyes antimonopolio.
“Hemos tenido las leyes vigentes durante mucho tiempo para poder defendernos”. Lo que se ha perdido es el valor en Washington para enfrentarse a los gigantes “, declaró. “Ha pasado demasiado tiempo en que los monopolios han estado haciendo las contribuciones para las campañaa, los ‘Super PAC’ han estado ahí afuera asegurándose de que su influencia sea escuchada y sentida en cada decisión que se tome en Washington. Donde quiero comenzar, quiero devolverle el gobierno al pueblo, y eso significa gritar los nombres de los monopolistas y decir “Tengo el valor de ir tras ellos”.
Warren respondió a una pregunta que los moderadores le plantearon al senador Cory Booker (demócrata – Nueva Jersey) acerca de su objeción previamente mencionada a que Warren nombrara compañías específicas que ella cree que deberían dividirse, “sin ningún tipo de proceso”.

715,"June 30, 2019",EU: Vestager announces “interim measures”,"
Margrethe Vestager announced a new methoc for the EU’s competition enforcer to crack down on technology groups by dusting off a powerful weapon, reported the Financial Times.
The investigation unveiled on Wednesday, June 26, by Ms Vestager into US chip manufacturer Broadcom seeks to overcome what she has come to see as one of the major challenges to competition policy in fast-moving technological markets, the years that can pass before an antitrust measure can be implemented. In the intervening period, the dominance of a deep-pocketed company over its rivals can be cemented, regardless of the outcome of a case.
“The technology cases the European Commission has recently pursued have all been for naught, as the decisions have come too late to have any real effect in the market,” said Thomas Vinje of Clifford Chance, who represented complainants in a case against Google for illegally favoring its shopping service, and also worked with Spotify in its recent complaint against Apple for allegedly abusing its power over the App Store to give Apple Music an advantage.
Ms Vestager is seeking to use interim measures “to order Broadcom to halt its behaviour while our investigation proceeds, to avoid any risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition.”
Interim measures were first established in EU competition law in 1980. But they have remained dormant since 2001, when a European court set a high legal threshold for their use. Now, however, Ms Vestager is building on simil...

Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Friday, June 28, that his hedge fund Third Point will vote against the planned merger of United Technologies and Raytheon, saying there is no “strategic rationale for this transaction,” reported Reuters.
“We have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,” Loeb wrote in a letter to the board of directors of United Technologies
On June 10, the industrial conglomerate and military contractor announced a US$120 billion merger, a deal that would intensify the pace of consolidation in the aerospace and defense industry and is expected to be completed in the first half of next year.
In his letter, Loeb criticized United Technologies management for turning its back on previous plans to break the company into three businesses—aerospace, Otis elevators, and Carrier air conditioners—and accused United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes of engineering the merger to secure his employment.

“We’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What’s been missing is courage in Washington to take on the giants,” she declared. “It’s been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, the Super PACs have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying ‘I have the courage to go after them.’”
Warren spoke in response to a question moderators posed to Senator Cory Booker (Democrat – New Jersey) about his previously stated objection to Warren naming specific companies she believes should be broken up, “without any kind of process.”

UTA filed an antitrust lawsuit Thursday against the Writers Guild of America, accusing the union of violating federal law by exceeding the scope of its authority to regulate agents, just days after WME filed a similar lawsuit against the guild. The moves signal a dramatic escalation of the bitter struggle between the WGA and the industry’s major talent agencies over packaging fees and affiliate production.
Both lawsuits allege that the guild is engaging in an illegal group boycott of agencies that refuse to sign onto the union’s Code of Conduct, introduced in April, that bars both disputed practices. At issue in the litigation is the scope of a union’s right to act anticompetitively — for instance, to call for a boycott — under two specific labor antitrust exemptions, the “statutory exemption” that is written into the law and a judge-made “non-statutory exemption.”
“WGA placed the interests of a few well-heeled individuals above the interests of its membership,” states UTA’s complaint, which argues that most writers benefit from not having to pay 10 percent commissions.

According to a report from Reuters, Canon was hit with a €28 million (US$31.8 million) fine on Thursday, June 27, for jumping the gun in its acquisition of Toshiba’s medical unit three years ago before securing EU antitrust clearance.
The European Commission stated Canon had breached EU merger rules by using a so-called “warehousing” two-step transaction structure involving an interim buyer to purchase the company prior to obtaining the relevant approvals.
The unorthodox method allowed Toshiba, which was struggling for cash after an accounting scandal, to book proceeds in time for the financial year-end in March.
“Our merger assessment and decision-making depends on the Commission being sure that companies are not jumping the gun and implementing mergers without our approval,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

721,"June 27, 2019",France: Macron sees no need to lower government’s stake in Renault,"
Renault hopes of resuming merger talks with Fiat Chrysler were dealt a blow Thursday after President Emmanuel Macron urged the French car maker to focus on generating cost savings with its partner Nissan Motor rather than reshaping their 20-year alliance.

Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday there was no need for the government to lower its stake in Renault and that he wanted the Renault-Nissan alliance to work on strengthening its synergies.
Fiat Chrysler withdrew its offer to merge with Renault earlier this month after the French government sought more time to ensure Nissan was on board with the deal. Nissan has indicated it would be willing to support the deal if there was an agreement in place for the combined company to reduce Renault’s stake in the Japanese car maker, The Wall Street Journal reported.


Mr. Macron told reporters in Tokyo, where he is on an official state visit ahead of the G-20 summit, that discussing the shareholdings was “off topic.” “We need to focus less on politics, less on finance and more on industry,” he said.
Mr. Macron said the alliance between Renault and Nissan faced a crisis when Carlos Ghosn, then-chairman of both companies, was arrested. But he referred to this as an individual situation that shouldn’t fundamentally alter the partnership between the car makers.
“Nothing in this situation justifies changing the cross-shareholdings, the rules of governance, and the state’s shareholding in Renault, which has nothi...

The European Commission has opened a formal investigation into US chipmaker Broadcom, which it suspects of restricting competition via a number of exclusivity practices in markets where it holds a leading position such as for systems-on-a-chip, front-end chips and wifi chipsets.
The FTC opened its investigation into Broadcom back in January 2018.
Commenting in a press release announcing the antitrust action against the chipmaker, the EU’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said, “TV set-top boxes and modems are part of our daily lives, for both work and for leisure. We suspect that Broadcom, a major supplier of components for these devices, has put in place contractual restrictions to exclude its competitors from the market. This would prevent Broadcom’s customers and, ultimately, final consumers from reaping the benefits of choice and innovation. We also intend to order Broadcom to halt its behaviour while our investigation proceeds, to avoid any risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition.”

UNITE HERE is worried that it will mean job cuts and a decline in gaming tax revenue. UNITE HERE represents approximately 25,000 workers at Caesars and Eldorado properties.
The union issued the following statement: “UNITE HERE has had a positive relationship with Caesars Entertainment over the years, and 25,000 union members have been excited to help the company reinvest and rebuild as it recovers from the disastrous leveraged buyout led by Apollo and TPG. It is in this context that we approach the proposed sale of the company with great concern.
Yesterday, Eldorado announced cost-savings of $500 million in the first year of the combined company. Where are they going to cut? We will not stand by idly if the proposed Caesars-Eldorado transaction will lead to significant job losses, worse wages and benefits for our members, and lower state gaming tax receipts in the many communities where members we represent work and live. Casinos operating under privileged licenses are meant to create significant benefits for host communities, including family-sustaining jobs and local government funding based on gaming taxes.
We will support changes at Caesars that preserve the company’s long-term financial health and provide a sustainable path to good jobs in vibrant gaming markets across the country.”

US drugmaker AbbVie has agreed to buy Allergan, the Irish-domiciled maker of Botox, in a US$63 billion that is the sector’s latest blockbuster transaction driven by the need to replenish drug pipelines.
AbbVie is betting the acquisition will improve its offering as Humira, the world’s best-selling treatment for inflammatory diseases, is set to face competition from generic versions as the drug goes off patent in the US.
Allergan’s portfolio is best known for Botox—a wildly popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment—but the company also makes drugs that are used in eyecare, gastroenterology, and to treat the central nervous system.
The deal, worth about US$80 billion including debt, is the second this year that would knit together two of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies. Earlier this year, Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay US$74 billion for rival cancer drugmaker Celgene.

“Technology has become so central that governments have to think: What does that mean about elections? What does that mean about bullying? What does it mean about wiretapping authorities that let you find out what’s going on financially or drug money laundering, things like that,” the Microsoft founder said at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, on Monday, June 24. “So, yes, the government needs to get involved.”
Gates discussed everything from the early days of Microsoft, to his investments in clean energy during the talk. But his thoughts on government interference in the tech sector were particularly relevant given recent government scrutiny of the size, influence, and privacy practices of tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google by both antitrust enforcement agencies and political candidates.
Gates said he expects “there will be more regulation of the tech sector,” particularly as it relates to privacy issues. The protection of user privacy and use of user data has been a flashpoint especially for Facebook, which has been criticized for multiple data scandals.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Qualcomm faces another European Union antitrust fine a year after being ordered to pay €997 million(US$1.13 billion) penalty for thwarting rival suppliers to Apple, according to three people familiar with the latest case.
The chip giant may be fined as soon as next month, said the people, who asked not to be named because the process isn’t public. That would make it the last US technology firm to get a large antitrust penalty from Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Vestager is due to step down later this year after punishing Google with more than US$9 billion in fines and ordering Apple to pay more than €14 billion (US$15.4 at the time) in back taxes. She warned in May she was “definitely not done yet” with big tech as she weighs potential new probes into Amazon, Google, and Apple.
The EU’s current Qualcomm investigation targets 3G chips for internet mobile dongles sold between 2009 and 2011. Regulators allege these were sold below cost in order to push Icera, now owned by Nvidia, out of the market. The EU took the unusual move of sending an extra antitrust complaint to Qualcomm last year to bolster its arguments of a “price-cost” test it used to show how far below cost the prices were.

Eldorado has made a series of acquisitions over the past few years including a US$1.85 billion deal for Icahn-backed Tropicana Entertainment in 2018 and a US$1.7 billion deal for Isle of Capri Casinos in 2017, strengthening its free cash flow and earnings per share.

In March, the FTC had sought additional information from the companies as it focused on their psoriasis treatments as part of its review of their planned merger.

732,"June 24, 2019",US: Facebook prefers more regulation over breakup,"
According to a report from Reuters, Facebook dismissed calls for a break-up of the world’s biggest social network and other big internet companies on Monday, June 24, stating this would not tackle issues such as privacy, attempts to influence elections or harmful content.
“Just because it is difficult to regulate the internet doesn’t mean policy makers should jump to the alternative of wishing these companies away,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s head of global affairs, said in a speech on Monday in Berlin.
Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has almost 2.4 billion monthly users, is firmly in the cross hairs of regulators and faces calls from some government officials for penalties or to be forcibly broken up.
“The internet does need competition and it does need regulation … we want to work with governments and policymakers to design the sort of smart regulation that fosters competition, encourages innovation and protects consumers,” Clegg said.
Last week, seven US Senate Democrats asked the Trump administration to disclose details of possible Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, and Apple.

733,"June 24, 2019",US: Apple says it collects fee on less than 1% of Spotify users,"
Music streaming service Spotify pays Apple a 15% fee on about 680,000 of its 100 million premium customers, Apple disclosed in a response to Spotify’s complaint with European antitrust regulators.
Premium customers pay a monthly fee or are in a free trial of Spotify’s premium service, which is ad free. Spotify has a total of 217 million customers, including users of its free service.
Apple competes directly with Spotify with its Apple Music service. In March, Spotify filed a complaint with European Union regulators claiming that Apple’s control of the App Store, including fees it charges for taking payments through the store, had made it unfairly difficult for rivals to compete for music subscribers.
Apple charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases made through the App Store, a fee that drops to 15% on subscription purchases after one year.
In exchange, Apple handles all the mechanics of billing and payments in more than 100 countries. But in Apple’s response to Spotify’s complaint, Apple stated that Spotify does not currently pay a 30% fee for any of its premium users and that only a small fraction are affected by its fees.

Italy’s UniCredit has put a possible bid for Commerzbank on ice as the German rival does not want to engage in negotiations so soon after the collapse of merger talks with Deutsche Bank, four sources told Reuters.
UniCredit had stepped up preparations for a potential takeover of Commerzbank by engaging Lazard and its banker Joerg Asmussen, a former German deputy finance minister, along with JP Morgan, people familiar with the matter said in May.
That raised the prospect of a deal that would allow Italy’s largest bank by assets to shift its focus away from its struggling domestic market, a key plank of Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier’s strategy.

736,"June 23, 2019","5 Lessons From Microsoft’s Antitrust Woes, by People Who Lived It","
By Steve Lohr, New York Times
The nation’s antitrust enforcers and Congress are stepping up their scrutiny of the tech giants. Disruptive investigations, federal lawsuits and new rules could loom for Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.
The companies and their executives don’t need to look far for guidance about how this could all play out. One of their top competitors, Microsoft, faced the government’s ire in the 1990s, leading to a bruising battle in federal court. The company was found to have repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws, and it agreed to change its corporate behavior as part of an eventual settlement.
“The Microsoft case is incredibly front and center, the road map, in all these discussions about big tech and antitrust,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University and co-author of “The Microsoft Antitrust Cases: Competition Policy for the Twenty-First Century.”

The all-stock merger will create the sixth-largest United States defense contractor, with a market value of US$34 billion at the time it was announced in October 2018.
The EU antitrust regulator found that the merger would have reduced competition in the European markets for image intensification night vision devices and image intensification tubes.
Harris offered to sell its night vision business before completing the deal, and the Commission accepted the remedy, Brussels said in a statement.

Four more US states joined an unusual effort by state attorneys general to stop T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint, a New York official said at a court hearing on Friday, June 21.
Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Nevada will be included in an amended complaint filed Friday, said Beau Buffier, chief of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general’s office.
Lawyers for the states and the companies also proposed October 7 for the start of a trial, which could last two to three weeks. The four states join 10 state attorneys general, led by New York and California and including the District of Columbia.
They filed a lawsuit on June 11 aimed at stopping the purchase by No. 3 US wireless operator T-Mobile of No. 4 Sprint, saying the deal would cost their subscribers more than US$4.5 billion annually. The attorneys general from all of the states involved are Democrats.

Seven US Senate Democrats asked the Trump administration on Friday, June 21, to disclose details of possible Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust investigations into Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet, and Apple. 
The senators, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, wrote in the letters to FTC Chairman Joe Simons and Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim that “given the silence of the FTC and the Justice Department, the truth is that we still do not know if these investigations have actually been initiated and neither do the American people.”
The letters were also signed by Patrick Leahy, Richard Blumenthal, Tammy Baldwin, Edward Markey, Tina Smith, and Cory Booker, who said they were encouraged by the media reports of investigations, “but also somewhat troubled that such inquiries were not already well underway.”
The senators noted that both agencies typically refrain from commenting on investigations that are not public, “but these circumstances are far from typical. The significant public interest in and allegations surrounding the business conduct of Big Tech and the leaks concerning the clearance process relating to potential investigations of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have made these matters highly unusual.”

Smaller tech companies, which often rely on the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for access to customers and the ability to reach them, are worried about helping in the government’s antitrust probe for fear of retaliation, according to the lawmakers who are spearheading the investigation.
Reuters is reporting that the head of the US House Judiciary subcommittee wants to question smaller tech companies, but it’s running into the fear obstacle when trying to do so. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee started its probe into antitrust and competition practices earlier this month, while the executive branch is also investigating the tech giants.
Representative David Cicilline said on Thursday (June 20) that smaller companies are so dependent on those big four for help that it “makes them concerned about raising their voice, raising concerns about the monopoly power of these platforms.”

T-Mobile is preparing an alternative plan if a deal to sell wireless assets to Dish Network Corp falls through, according to  Reuters.

Goldman Sachs, the investment bank that’s advising T-Mobile on the Sprint merger and sale of Boost Mobile, is planning to send books to prospective Boost buyers in two weeks, say sources speaking to Reuters. Dish is still the frontrunner to buy Boost, but Goldman Sachs has told other parties as recently as today that it’s getting ready for an auction of Boost Mobile. Dish is rumored to be speaking with other parties on possible Boost partnerships.
T-Mo has already agreed to sell Boost Mobile if its merger with Sprint is completed. This caused FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to come out publicly support the deal. However, the Department of Justice is still conducting its antitrust review of the merger, and rumors have said that it wants T-Mobile and Sprint to help create a fourth competitive U.S. carrier before it will approve the merger.

744,"June 20, 2019",US: FTC reportedly investigating YouTube over children’s privacy,"

YouTube may have a particularly strong incentive to change how it handles kids’ videos,  it appears to be under government scrutiny for its behavior. Sources for both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal assert that the FTC is in the “late stages” of an investigation into possible violations of kids’ privacy. Advocacy groups have reportedly maintained that YouTube is violating COPPA by collecting data for children under the age of 13, including through its dedicated Kids app.
The probe was initiated by a complaint last year from consumer groups that accused Alphabet Inc.’s Google of exploiting YouTube’s popularity with children to illegally amass data on minors under 13 without parental consent, the people said. The groups also alleged that the website subjected children to inappropriate content.
The company has said that in 2015 it created YouTube Kids, which doesn’t collect data on minors, in part to address concerns like those.

746,"June 19, 2019",Japan/US: Nissan and Renault close to resolve dispute,"
According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Nissan Motor and Renault are moving closer to resolving a standoff over corporate governance at the Japanese car maker, according to people familiar with their talks, nearing a compromise that could help ease one point of contention between the two alliance partners.
Tensions between them have escalated in the wake of busted merger talks between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. Those discussions foundered after Nissan withheld its support for a tie-up, and the French government asked for a delay until Nissan was onboard. Instead, Fiat pulled its offer.
The corporate governance issue has been a highly technical, but high-profile, standoff between Nissan and Renault. It revolves around whether Renault Chief Executive Thierry Bolloré should be given a post on a proposed audit committee on Nissan’s board. Renault threatened to abstain in a vote on governance changes at Nissan, effectively scotching them, unless it got its way. That prompted Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa to issue an uncharacteristic rebuke calling Renault’s stance “most regrettable.”
Under the proposed plan, Mr. Bolloré would get the committee seat, said people familiar with the discussions. They cautioned that the deal wasn’t final yet.

The broadcaster, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will have around 35% of the holding MediaforEurope (MFE) and just above 50% of voting rights.
Vivendi, Mediaset’s second-biggest shareholder, is set to have around 23 percent of MFE once the deal is signed off. However, most of that stake will be held in a trust reflecting the current set-up at Mediaset.

Vietnam’s Competition Council ruled Wednesday that Grab’s acquisition of Uber last year did not infringe the Competition Law. It dismissed the preliminary investigation results of the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s competition and consumer protection department, which found that Grab’s market share had exceeded 50 percent since the acquisition.
The Competition Law requires any merger or acquisition that results in a company gaining a 30 percent market share to be reported to competition authorities. If a company will gain a 50 percent market share after the deal, it can only be carried out with official approval.


The Competition Council, which is independent of the ministry, said it had heard the related parties on June 11 before making the ruling. The  competition and consumer protection department has 30 days starting Wednesday to appeal the verdict.

The US Department of Justice asserted StarKist’s investment in TechPack Solutions, an India-based can and bottle technology firm, was worth more than the potential US$100 million  fine StarKist faces for playing a part in a criminal price-fixing conspiracy.
StarKist’s own expert witness placed the value of StarKist’s holding in TechPack at US $155 million, and prosecutors said the holding gives StarKist “more than enough to pay for … the criminal fine and expected payouts in civil claims,” according to a summary of the June 12 hearing.
However, StarKist, which is pushing to have its criminal fine lowered to US$50 million, claimed it cannot sell its holding in TechPack due to loan agreements requiring the consent of its lenders. StarKist also argued selling its stake would be difficult.
As a result of the dispute, US District Court Judge Edward M. Chen postponed the sentencing hearing, in which he was to determine the amount of StarKist’s fine, until after a August 7 hearing on the TechPack issue.

Jimmy John’s is facing a class action lawsuit over the employee nonsolicitation and no-hire agreements between and among Jimmy John’s restaurant franchisees that the franchisor is purportedly requiring. The sandwich store chain has more than 2,700 locations in more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia, which means the class of affected workers is likely in the thousands.

751,"June 17, 2019",Just one agency should enforce antitrust law,"
By Sen. Mike Lee, Washington Examiner
Anonymous individuals at the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission have recently taken it upon themselves to leak to the media that their respective agencies will soon open investigations of the largest U.S. tech companies. Policing markets with the antitrust laws is key to ensuring that competition benefits consumers.
No industry should be free from antitrust scrutiny, including big tech. But the splitting of this tech antitrust review across two federal agencies, despite the many similar competition issues that will be investigated, illustrates the absurdity of having two federal agencies handling civil antitrust enforcement. It also shows why these investigations are likely to be less effective and coherent than they should be.
According to reports, the FTC will investigate certain conduct by Facebook and Amazon, while the Antitrust Division will look into whether Google and Apple have acted anti-competitively. These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground. For example, Facebook and Google are both alleged to have used their market power to monopolize digital advertising. Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies is just analytically inefficient.

Australia could soon levy a special tax on Netflix as traditional media platforms decline, the federal communications minister has revealed.
Speaking to The Australian newspaper, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said there was an argument that overseas streaming services should be paying tax in Australia because taxation from traditional broadcasters is dwindling.
“The more you can have companies that are in the same market subject to broadly the same set of regulatory requirements and obligations the better,” he said in the interview.
Fletcher made his comments just weeks before the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) releases the final report from its digital platforms inquiry.The ACCC is due to hand down its report by June 30.
The inquiry is looking at the impacts of digital search engines, social media and other platforms within the media landscape, with big tech companies like Google and Facebook in its sights.

Ulmer also said Turkish firms continued to produce components for the aircraft despite a row over Ankara’s plans to buy the Russian S-400 air defense system.
He said plans by the US government to start winding down Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program would not affect Lockheed’s production plan this year.

La FTC liderará una investigación en Facebook y el DOJ tomará la iniciativa en una investigación de Alphabet, la empresa matriz de Google. Las sondas serán sobre temas de competencia.
La investigación de Facebook investigará si ha participado en operaciones monopolísticas ilegales, mientras que la consulta del Alfabeto seguirá un camino similar. La FTC también tiene jurisdicción sobre una posible investigación en Amazon mientras que el DOJ tiene Apple.
Sin embargo, el acuerdo entre las dos agencias no significa que uno pueda manejar una compañía completa, sino que ambas agencias acuerdan manejar ciertos problemas. Tanto el DOJ como la FTC han supervisado a Google y Amazon en el pasado.

El Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes de EEUU sostuvo  el 11 de junio la primera de una serie de audiencias centradas en el comportamiento anticompetitivo de las grandes compañías con presencia en línea.
La audiencia se enfocará en la forma en que los medios informativos han sido moldeados por el surgimiento de las llamadas plataformas. como Facebook y Google.
La audiencia del comité se produce poco después que el mismo anunciara que deberán considerar si se deben aplicar reglas antimonopolio más estrictas a estas empresas. Como se expresó en una declaración el presidente del Comité Judicial, Jerrold Nadler, congresista demócrata de Nueva York, “hay cada vez más pruebas de que un puñado de guardianes ha llegado a capturar el control sobre las arterias clave del comercio, contenido y comunicaciones en línea. Dada la creciente marea de concentración y consolidación en nuestra economía, es vital que investiguemos el estado actual de la competencia en los mercados digitales y la salud de las leyes antimonopolio “. Por su parte, la Presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes Nancy Pelosi ha dicho que para las grandes empresas de tecnología “La era de la autorregulación ha terminado “.

756,"June 16, 2019",EU: Fiat Chrysler partners with Engie and Enel,"
Carmaker Fiat Chrysler (FCA) has signed an agreement with European utilities Enel and Engie to help offer its customers charging points for electric vehicles it is planning to roll out, reported The Financial Times.
FCA, which is lagging behind rivals in developing electrified vehicles, announced last June it would invest €9 billion (US$10 billion) over the next five years to introduce hybrid and electric cars across all regions.
Last month, the Italian-American carmaker proposed a merger with French rival Renault in part to share the costs of developing a new series of electric cars. Merger talks collapsed earlier this month. 
In a statement, FCA said the main aim of its partnerships with Enel and Engie was to be able to offer private and public charging stations to support the sales of its soon-to-be-launched fully electric Fiat 500 BEV and plug-in hybrid Jeep Renegade PHEV.
“We are assembling an eco-system of partners, products and services across multiple markets to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving expectations of our customers for electrified vehicles,” FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley said.

757,"June 16, 2019",US: DOJ may decide on T-Mobile/Sprint deal next week,"
The US Justice Department is set to decide as early as next week whether to approve the US$26.5-billion merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint, Reuters reported Friday, June 14.
Earlier last week, Dish Network executives met with the Justice Department’s antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai as part of the government’s review of the deal, which could dramatically reshape the US wireless market.
A federal filing Friday revealed Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen was among the executives who attended the meeting Tuesday, and the firm “discussed its opposition to the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile as currently constructed.”
Pai agreed last month to support the merger of the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers, in part because the firms agreed to divest the prepaid service Boost Mobile.
Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint control more than 98% of the US wireless market and have wireless service revenues of more than US$160 billion. T-Mobile and Sprint combined have more than 135 million customers, while Verizon and AT&T control two-thirds of the total US wireless market.

June 2019

Static vs. Dynamic Antitrust: A Reply By John M. Yun (George Mason University)1
Sanjukta Paul and Hal Singer (P&S) responded to my recent CPI Comment, “News Media Cartels are Bad News for Consumers,”2 which addressed the likely harm that would arise from the proposed Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, if passed. P&S criticize my conclusion that the legislation would likely harm competition and consumers on a variety of grounds. In this short reply, I address their central points and demonstrate that our disagreement largely, but not completely, arises from P&S restricting their analysis to a static view of markets and antitrust.3
First, P&S assert that “[h]istorically, a rigid stance against horizontal coordination beyond firm boundaries is relatively new.”4 P&S assert further that legislators at the time of the Sherman Act, and even Senator Sherman himself, all contemplated and supported some forms of coordination. Even taking these assertions at face value, this appeal to static, historical statements taken in the late 1800s is immaterial to the economic analysis and the fundamental question of whether or not legalizing a news media cartel — that is legislatively allowed to nakedly fix prices and exclude organizations and sites that are not deemed “news content creators” — would be beneficial to society.5
Further, this plea to legislative intent is in line with the latest version of old arguments to overturn the curr...

759,"June 13, 2019",US: Dual-agency big tech antitrust investigations questioned,"
A Republican senator isn’t happy with plans by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to divide a potential investigation into the biggest US tech firms.
Earlier this month, the DOJ and the FTC came to an agreement over the jurisdiction of potential antitrust probes into Facebook and Google. The FTC is going to lead a Facebook investigation, and the DOJ will take the lead in an investigation of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. The probes will be over competition concerns.
The Facebook investigation will look into whether it has taken part in illegal monopolistic operations, while the Alphabet query will follow a similar path. The FTC also has jurisdiction over a potential probe into Amazon while the DOJ has Apple.
The agreement between the two agencies, however, doesn’t mean that one gets to handle a whole company, but rather that both agencies agree to handle certain issues. Both the DOJ and the FTC have performed oversight of Google and Amazon in the past.
But in a statement announcing a hearing on antitrust enforcement, Senator Mike Lee, chair of the Judiciary Committee’s Antitrust Subcommittee, warned that dividing the work would cause a variety of problems.
“Given the similarity in competition issues involved, divvying up these investigations is sure to waste resources, split valuable expertise across the agencies, and likely result in divergent antitrust enforcement,” he said in a statement, according to Reuters.

Small businesses are raising concerns over a congressional probe of potential anticompetitive practices in the tech sector, a press release revealed Wednesday, June 12.
The Connected Commerce Council (3C), a small business advocacy group, has sent a letter to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law requesting that Congress consider the importance of technology giants including Facebook, Amazon and Google in the small business community.
“Digital tools and services developed by Facebook, Amazon and Google provide small businesses with an opportunity to succeed,” said Jake Ward, president of 3C, in a statement. “When considering the role of large tech companies in the market, it is essential Members of Congress think about small businesses’ deep connection to these companies.
“This market is interconnected and big companies power growing companies to compete and win,” he added.
The group stated it will provide the Subcommittee with analysis it conducted of the role that large technology conglomerates play in promoting the success of small businesses in the US. Twenty-four small business members of 3C across 19 states went to Washington, DC, to meet with members of Congress and discuss the topic, the announcement stated.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, June 13, a Fiat Chrysler-Renault merger remained an “interesting opportunity,” but added he would tell the French carmaker’s chairman that strengthening the Renault-Nissan alliance was the priority.
The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder and sources have said chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is furious over the government’s interference at the carmaker after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) withdrew its offer for a €35 billion (US$40 billion) merger with Renault.
Le Maire said he would meet Senard later on Thursday, with the chairman’s position seen weakened by the deal’s collapse and the ensuing fallout with President Emmanuel Macron’s government.
Le Maire told France Info radio he was not responsible for derailing the proposal that would have created the world’s third biggest carmaker behind Japan’s Toyota and Germany’s Volkswagen.
“It remains in interesting opportunity. But I have always been very clear: that it should be in the context of a strategy to reinforce the (Renault-Nissan) alliance.”
“As long as the French state is the main shareholder, its responsibility to the company, its employees, its factories and research centres is to fulfil its role with other shareholders in defining a strategy.”
The deal collapsed after Nissan stated it would abstain at a Renault board meeting to vote on the merger proposal, prompting Le Mair...

By Cecilia Kang, New York Times
A congressional investigation into the power of big tech companies began on Tuesday with bipartisan concern from lawmakers that the government’s lax oversight of the industry may be doing more harm than good.
In its first hearing about the power held by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, lawmakers focused on the decline of the news industry. They said they were troubled that the online digital advertising market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook, had siphoned off too much revenue from news organizations.
“Concentration in the digital advertising market has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction,” said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island.
The hearing was the start of the House Judiciary Committee’s inquiry into possible anticompetitive behavior by big tech companies, part of a rising wave of federal scrutiny of the industry.

According to a report from Politico, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sent top antitrust officials into the heart of Silicon Valley to seek out complaints about anti-competitive behavior, an unusual move that offers yet another hint about the government’s growing interest in policing the industry’s giants.
The weeklong tour included private meetings between leaders of the FTC’s new technology task force and more than a dozen industry players to discuss the state of their businesses and market competition challenges, an FTC official familiar with the issue told Politico.
The outreach comes as both the FTC and Justice Department have shown a surge of interest in taking a serious look at years of complaints about the dominant role that companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon are playing in big slices of the economy and Americans’ everyday lives.

Makan Delrahim, the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust chief, said that low prices and free products would not shield digital monopolists from scrutiny to group of tech experts, reported the Financial Times.
The remarks by Mr Delrahim at a conference in Israel followed moves by US antitrust enforcers to prepare competition investigations into Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. The speech, which referenced US trust busting from Standard Oil to AT&T and Microsoft, was the latest sign of the shifting attitude in Washington towards Silicon Valley.
“There are only one or two significant players in important digital spaces, including internet search, social networks, mobile and desktop operating systems, and electronic book sales,” he said. “This is true in certain input markets as well. For example, just two firms take in the lion’s share of online ad spending.”
Delrahim said the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department looks for rising prices, lower quality, loss of privacy, and collusion when looking to see if a company violated antitrust laws. He said it also looks for cases in which there are exclusive deals that hurt rival companies on purpose. The DOJ official also said tech companies need to stop getting bigger by engaging in mergers. “Acquisitions of nascent competitors can be pro-competitive in certain instances and anti-competitive in others,” he said. “I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition ...

767,"June 12, 2019",UK: CMA clears PayPal/iZettle $2b deal,"
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) gave its final approval to PayPal’s acquisition of point of sale terminal company iZettle, nine-and-a-half months after the deal formally closed.
Although the US$2 billion deal had already been completed, PayPal continued to work with UK authorities on their investigation and kept the business separate from the rest of its portfolio while the decision was pending.
The authority was assessing the impact of the deal on small- and medium-sized businesses in the UK.
In April, the CMA released provisional findings suggesting the deal would be cleared, but continued to investigate evidence collated since the start of its in-depth probe into the transaction, a process that started in November 2018.
Clearing the deal, the CMA stated, “While iZettle and PayPal are two of the largest suppliers of mobile mPoS [mobile point of sale] devices, their customers are also willing to switch to traditional PoS devices. The two largest suppliers of payment services to smaller merchants, Worldpay and Barclaycard, account for almost 60 per cent of the market at present and will continue to constrain the merged company.”
“The merged company will also face significant competition from other mPoS-only players, such as Square and SumUp, which have both grown significantly in recent years,” it added.

Get ready for the opening act of a what may be long-running show – focused on antitrust and on Big Tech.
The House Judiciary Committee had its first hearing June 11, as part of a series, focused on anticompetitive behavior among online companies.
The hearing will focus on the way the news media has been shaped by the advent of platform companies such as Facebook and Google.
The committee’s hearing comes in the wake of news last week that it would look into whether stricter antitrust laws should be in the offing. As had been relayed in a statement by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democratic congressman from New York, “there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.” And separately, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that for big tech firms “the era of self regulation is over.”
In an interview this week with CNBC, House Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, also of New York, said, “We’re at the beginning of a journey. We should hear from the CEOs of the big tech companies with respect to concerns that many people on both sides of the aisle have articulated.”

769,"June 12, 2019",Countervailing Coordination Rights in the News Sector Are Good for the Public (A Response to Professor Yun),"

By Sanjukta Paul & Hal Singer1
Professor John Yun’s recent CPI Column addressing Reps. Cicilline’s and Collins’ proposed Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (“JCPA”) as legalizing “news media cartels” is a virtually perfect document of the reflexivity of modern antitrust’s condemnation of horizontal coordination beyond firm boundaries. This rigidity results in an accommodation of dominance by a few powerful tech firms. If anything, the JCPA does not go far enough to liberalize coordination among newspaper publishers and other “news content creators” to benefit a healthy news ecosystem, although it would be a step in the right direction.
The key factual findings upon which the bill is based are three. First, according to a Pew survey, most Americans get news from a handful of online platforms, whether a search engine (Google) or a social media platform (Facebook or Google’s YouTube). Second, dominant platforms typically dictate the terms of the relationships between themselves and news content creators, both in terms of splitting advertising revenues and in terms of the conditions under which readers will see certain content in the first place. Third, newspapers’ and other news outlets’ revenues have fallen drastically during the same period that their audiences have increasingly transitioned to reading online. Except for whether online platforms are in fact dominant (on which, more below), Professor Yun does not contest these central facts.
A logical regulatory response to this situation is to permit joint bargaining among news creators in their dealings with the platforms, explicitly including price coordination. The bill would indeed permit joint bargaining among “news content creators” (newspapers and other news outlets) in their negotiations with “online content distributors,” principally powerful platforms like Facebook and Google — but only where those negotiations are “not limited to price” and only where they also “directly relate to the quality, accuracy, attribution or branding, and interoperability of news.”2 The problem with these conditions is that they are overly restrictive: the legislation would seem to require news outlets to prove, for any given instance of joint bargaining, that the negotiations at hand relate directly to news quality. This is an overly onerous burden, particularly for small publishers with little or no litigation budget, and it is also a waste of judicial resources.
The much better approach would be for Congress, having conducted appropriate investigation, to find that the relationship between content creators and platforms is generally lopsided and that this adversely affects news quality. Having drawn that conclusion, Congress ought to permit joint bargaining among content creators as to price negotiations. This finding is far better handled at the legislative level than at the level of episodic litigation, both in terms of legislative and judicial competencies and in terms of use of public resources.3 The findings already contained in the JCPA, along with the basic economic insight that paying content creators an amount that undervalues their actual contribution to generating that revenue will result in reduced output in a critical segment of our economy, justify this regulatory approach. For now, let’s put this issue with the bill aside and consider the merits of straightforwardly permitting joint bargaining among publishers/creators as to price, in their dealings with the dominant platforms.
Historically, a rigid stance against horizontal coordination beyond firm boundaries is relatively new. When the Sherman Act was passed, legislators explicitly discussed coordination among small producers or among economic actors forced to deal with one or a few dominant players, and they were quite united in supporting such coordination. In fact, there is good evidence that they rewrote the bill that became the Sherman Act precisely to avoid the conclusion that all price coordination among producers, regardless of market conditions, would be prohibited.4 When confronted by one of his colleagues with the proposition that an earlier version of the bill could be interpreted to prohibit price coordination among farmers, laborers, or other small producers, Senator Sherman replied: “That is a very extraordinary proposition,” adding “I desire to say distinctly that is not my idea or the idea of any one of the committee.”5
Moreover, economic coordination of some kind is always necessary; antitrust law decides what kinds of coordination will take place, and how concentrated or democratic that coordination will be.6 Numerous exceptions to antitrust’s putative anti-coordination stance, both explicit and tacit, already exist. It is unclear why we ought to allow Google and Facebook to serve as de facto market coordinators for huge swaths of socially significant economic activity while condemning limited, countervailing coordination rights for newspapers. Some of this coordination by dominant platforms entails actually mandating that news publishers “port content to Facebook’s website,” on pain of much slower download speeds, thus ensuring that more advertising dollars flow to Facebook rather than news publishers.7 Facebook’s algorithm perversely rewards click-worthy (but often unreliable) stories by moving them to the top of users’ news feed, and co-mingles sponsored content or ads alongside user-generated content in its news feed, thereby equating the quality of legitimate news and potentially fake news (not all sponsored content is fake news). This sort of anticompetitive conduct is tolerable for Professor Yun because it occurs inside the (colossal) firm boundaries of the tech platforms.
Antitrust condemns the type of coordination sought by the JCPA as a per se violation, Professor Yun argues, because “there is little to no redeeming social value from allowing competitors to jointly set the terms of trade in a market.” Yet we explicitly allow for workers to be shielded from antitrust scrutiny in collective wage-setting, out of a recognition that workers are atomistic relative to employers and therefore workers could be exploited if forced to bargain individually. The principles animating this exemption naturally extend to atomistic news publishers in their dealings with Facebook and Google. More generally, antitrust law already contains numerous other exemptions, including those relating to professional sports, agricultural cooperatives, and health insurance. Antitrust grants the biggest exemption of all to the business firm itself, one which has been effectively expanded by the regulatory tolerance for market dominance by one or a few powerful firms.
In deploring the possibility that larger media outlets could avail themselves of the protections of the JCPA, Professor Yun understates the dominance of Google and Facebook, and overstates the countervailing power of even well-established newspapers like the New York Times. Even the New York Times is small in content space relative to Facebook’s footprint in the online distribution space. Facebook accounts for over half of all social media site visits in the United States,8 and Facebook and Google combined account for over 60 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market according to eMarketer.9 Facebook can live without the New York Times, but the New York Times cannot live without Facebook-generated traffic. As Professor Yun acknowledges, the New York Times depends on social media and search engines for an impressive 11 and 30 percent of its traffic, respectively. Because the New York Times is larger than most news publishers, it follows that the dependence of typical news outlet on Facebook and Google is even greater. Indeed, analytics consultancy Parse.ly estimates that in the last twelve months, Facebook and Google generated more than 80 percent of external traffic to Parse.ly’s network of online media sites.10 In the absence of coordination among news publishers, the online ad duopoly will appropriate most of the value created by news sites, leading to reduced news output and edge innovation. Larger news outlets should be included in the JCPA protections because their presence at the negotiating table will benefit smaller news outlets — an aspect that Professor Yun ignores.
Finally, Professor Yun’s argument in the context of online news fails to recognize the “zero-price” nature of tech platforms. The antitrust establishment often condemns economic coordination among input suppliers on the ground that it would raise consumer prices. Putting aside the merits of that argument as a general matter, it is entirely inapposite here — because the consumer price for accessing news via the dominant platforms is already zero. (Some news sites charge a subscription, but even they offer a few articles per month for free.) Permitting coordination among publishers in their dealings with Facebook and Google would affect the distribution of ad revenue between original publishers and the dominant platforms; it would not affect the price to consume news.
Now, the nature of this distribution of advertising revenue does affect consumers, but in a different way than Professor Yun implies. The current highly lopsided power balance between platforms and original publishers means that platforms gobble up ad revenue and add to their already enormous profits, which has no discernible consumer benefit. However, as newspapers and other news outlets are continually squeezed on their margins, if they can survive at all, they are decreasingly able to invest in quality news reporting — not to say investigation — and are forced to churn out quick “click-bait” in order to break even, if they’re lucky. Allowing news outlets to capture a larger proportion of ad revenue would permit investment in quality reporting and investigation, with obvious consumer benefits and indeed, sorely needed social benefits in terms of democratic functioning.

The Delrahim-Pai lunch meeting was held at Washington, DC, restaurant Central Michel Richard. People with knowledge of the meeting say it’s unclear if Delrahim was persuaded by Pai’s arguments in support of the merger.
But analysts say the fact that the two met at this critical time shows that the timetable for DOJ approval has been expedited.
“I believe the decision will come in less than 10 days,” said long-time telecom entrepreneur Peter Adderton, the founder of prepaid wireless company Boost, which is now part of Sprint and will be sold to meet the FCC concessions if the merger moves forward.

771,"June 11, 2019",EU: Brussels blocks Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel deal,"
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel’s plan to form a landmark joint venture was rejected by EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday, concerned that the deal would have pushed up prices and reduced competition.
The European Commission said the companies, which had looked to the deal as one way to tackle overcapacity and other challenges in the steel industry, had not done enough to allay its concerns.
“Steel is a crucial input for many things we use in our everyday life, such as canned food and cars. Millions of people in Europe work in these sectors and companies depend on competitive steel prices to sell on a global level,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

772,"June 11, 2019",US: States sue to stop $26.5B Sprint-T-Mobile deal,"
A group of state attorneys general led by New York and California are filing a lawsuit to block T-Mobile’s US$26.5 billion bid for Sprint, citing consumer harm.
According to Bloomberg, the state AGs say the merger would hurt competition and drive up prices for cell phone service.
“When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “This is exactly the sort of consumer-harming, job-killing mega-merger our antitrust laws were designed to prevent.”
The states’ challenge is a major setback to T-Mobile’s and Sprint’s plan to combine and take on industry leaders AT&T and Verizon Communications. Last month, the carriers cleared a key hurdle when they won support for their deal from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
The all-Democratic attorneys general are taking the rare step of suing to block the US$26.5 billion deal while the Justice Department is still reviewing the merger. State enforcers have the authority to go to court to block a merger even if federal officials at the Justice Department and the FCC approve it. Sprint shares dropped 6.4% at 12:15 p.m. in New York trading on Tuesday, June 11. T-Mobile fell 1.7%.

Issuance of the Second Request is part of the regulatory review process. The effect of the Second Request is to extend the waiting period until 10 days after Roche has substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC or the parties have entered into a timing agreement with the FTC. The parties remain committed to the transaction and are working cooperatively with the FTC in connection with its review.

President Donald Trump thinks “obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly” regarding major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, he said during an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday, June 10.
Initially asked if he thought Facebook, Google, and Amazon are too big now and should be broken up, Trump said, “Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me.” Trump then veered away from potential antitrust actions against the companies and into his campaign’s use of the platforms.
“You know people talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies, cause they were so against me during my election run, everybody said if you don’t have them, you can’t win,” Trump said. “Well I won, you know, and I’ll win again, because we’re doing well, and we’re not the fools anymore, we’re not the foolish country that does so badly.”
Google, Facebook, and Twitter have come under increasing scrutiny from conservatives who claim that the platforms discriminate against them and their politics. The companies have in recent months taken steps to crack down on hate speech and white supremacist content, adding to previous efforts to limit the spread of misinformation.

The 5G standards body has warned that a ban on Huawei could have “a dramatic impact” on future standardization, while analysts believe it could lead to a split in the development of the technology.
Last month, the Trump administration added the Chinese telecom company to a blacklist, which means it won’t conduct trade with the company, and will make it difficult for Huawei to do business with companies in the US As a result, Google is reportedly halting a business relationship with Huawei, which means the smartphone company will lose access to updates to the Android operating system, as well as access to the Google Play Store, YouTube and Gmail.
“We cannot speculate on what will happen, but if the current situation prevails, this could have a dramatic impact on future standardization,” said Adrian Scrase, who leads 3GPP’s support team, according to the Financial Times.
In addition, analysts see several risks in the ban, including a break of the global standard system. In fact, Edison Lee, analyst at Jefferies, warned that there is a chance that U.S. companies will pull out of standards body if the Huawei ban remains in effect.
“If Chinese companies are prohibited from licensing technologies that they have already seen (and which, in many cases, they have heavily influenced), [the risk is] they could just use it,” he said.

Según un informe del New York Times, cuatro de las mayores compañías de tecnología están reuniendo un ejército de cabilderos (conocidos como “Lobbyists” en inglés) mientras se preparan para lo que podría ser una lucha épica para determinar su futuro.
Inicialmente lentos para desarrollar una presencia en Washington, los gigantes de la tecnología Amazon, Apple, Facebook y Google, se han convertido rápidamente en algunos de los jugadores más grandes en la industria que mueve la influencia y el acceso político al enfrentar las amenazas de la administración Trump y ambas cámaras del Capitolio de EEUU.
Las cuatro compañías gastaron un total de US$55 millones en cabildeo el año pasado, duplicando su gasto combinado de US$27.4 millones en 2016, y algunas están gastando a una tasa más alta en lo que va del año, según el Centro para la Política Responsiva, que rastrea el cabildeo y Aportaciones políticas. Eso los pone a la par con las grandes fuerzas del cabildeo establecidas desde hace mucho tiempo, como las industrias de defensa, automóviles y banca.
De las 238 personas registradas para cabildear por las cuatro compañías en los primeros tres meses de este año, aproximadamente el 75% se desempeñó anteriormente en el gobierno o en campañas políticas, según un análisis de los registros de cabildeo y empleo. Muchos trabajaron en oficinas o para funcionarios que podrían tener la responsabilidad de decidir el curso del nuevo escrutinio gubernamental.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have joined a group of states probing T-Mobile’s plan to buy rival Sprint for US$26 billion, which is believed to be nearing the end of a regulatory review, reported Reuters.
The state attorneys general made the filings this week, telling the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) they planned to join a Justice Department probe and need access to documents.
The deal won FCC support last month. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday, June 6, he planned to circulate a proposed order asking his fellow commissioners to approve the deal in the coming weeks, but officials said it might not be finished until early July.
The final decision on whether to allow two of the four nationwide wireless carriers to merge will be made by the Department’s political appointees, headed by Antitrust Division chief Makan Delrahim.

778,"June 6, 2019",US: Tech Giants amass a lobbying army NYT,"
According to a report from the New York Times, four of the biggest technology companies are amassing an army of lobbyists as they prepare for what could be an epic fight over their futures.
Initially slow to develop a presence in Washington, the tech giants, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, have rapidly built themselves into some of the largest players in the influence and access industry as they confront threats from the Trump administration and both parties on Capitol Hill.
The four companies spent a combined US$55 million on lobbying last year, doubling their combined spending of US$27.4 million in 2016, and some are spending at a higher rate so far this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying and political contributions. That puts them on a par with long-established lobbying powerhouses like the defense, automobile, and banking industries.
Of the 238 people registered to lobby for the four companies in the first three months of this year, about 75% formerly served in the government or on political campaigns, according to an analysis of lobbying and employment records. Many worked in offices or for officials who could have a hand in deciding the course of the new governmental scrutiny.

Republicans are split over a new Democrat-led antitrust investigation of the tech industry, highlighting tensions between the GOP’s growing criticism of companies like Google and Facebook and the party’s traditional aversion to regulating business, reported Politico.
The House Judiciary Committee launched the probe Monday, June 3, to look at whether Silicon Valley’s tech titans have engaged in anti-competitive conduct and some Republican lawmakers were quick to cheer their Democratic colleagues on.
“I’m all for it,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (Republican – South Carolina) said of the House probe, while fellow Senate Judiciary member John Neely Kennedy (Republican – Louisiana) told reporters that it’s about time for Congress to examine how the online industry’s growing power affects consumers.
“Antitrust is a highly technical inquiry, not something that lends itself to easy generalizations or blanket condemnations,” said a statement from Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel that would be in a prime position to oversee a probe. “This is why such investigations are best left to the antitrust agencies rather than Congress.”

He made the comments to CBS News (see the video below) as Apple unveiled a range of new products and services at its developers conference in San Jose on Monday, June 3. On the same day, the House Judiciary Committee announced an investigation of tech giants, a move that followed reports of a Department of Justice probe of Google and a Federal Trade Commission investigation of Amazon.
In a segment of an interview slated to run in full on Tuesday’s CBS Evening News, anchor Norah O’Donnell asked Cook if he felt that Apple has grown too big.
“I don’t think so,” he replied. “But with size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized. But if you look at our – any kind of measure about is Apple a monopoly or not, I don’t think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple’s a monopoly.”

A compromise over French influence could clear the way for Renault’s board to approve a framework deal and begin the long process of a full merger.

According to a report from Bloomberg, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave a speech where she criticized the European Union’s merger rules for failing to take into account growing Chinese dominance.

“How can you say that China won’t engage in Europe in the next five years? I think such a claim is rash,” Merkel said on Tuesday, June 4, to the BDI industry group. She called again for the EU to alter the rules “in order to be truly competitive.”
Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust chief who is bidding to head the next Commission, has deflected these calls by pointing to tougher screening for foreign takeovers. She’s instead been pushing for changes to allow regulators to chase down big technology firms, backed by the Netherlands.

By Dr Andrea Coscelli, CMA
Like many agencies around the world, the CMA has had a growing focus on digital commerce, reflecting changes in the economy and consumer behaviour. Much of our recent casework has had a strong digital flavour, and our policy and advocacy work is increasing in this area too.
But the effectiveness of merger control in digital markets has been the subject of particular discussion and attention recently and I want to focus on that today. Over the last decade, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft combined – the so called GAFAM quintet – have made over 400 acquisitions globally, with more than half of these – close to 250 – just in the most recent 5 years. Some of these acquisitions have had exceptionally high valuations.
However only a handful of these mergers have been scrutinised by competition authorities, and none have been blocked. As an economist, these statistics naturally lead me to question whether we as competition authorities have got the balance right. Is it right that across all 400 of these acquisitions, there has not been a single prohibition? On this basis, is it possible to argue that we’ve correctly balanced the risks of under- and over-enforcement?

After a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potential antitrust investigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon.
Lawmakers in the House said on Monday that they were looking into the tech giants’ possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that didn’t exist when antitrust laws were written.

The House Judiciary Committee announced Monday, June 3, it is launching a “top-to-bottom” antitrust investigation of the tech industry, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, deepening a crisis for Silicon Valley’s largest players as they face mounting scrutiny in Washington over their power and influence.
The Democratic-led investigation comes as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are taking their first steps toward a potential probe of their own into Google, according to three people familiar with the matter. Regulators have negotiated to divide oversight of the tech industry between the two agencies in recent weeks, these people said. The two agencies have also reportedly split up oversight of Amazon, Apple, and Facebook.
Long the darling of investors and politicians, the tech industry has come under intense pressure amid an array of privacy missteps, disinformation scandals, and allegations of anti-competitive behavior. Industry critics such as Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, have called for tough new regulations and demanded that the companies be broken up.

The Federal Trade Commission will be in charge of any antitrust investigations into Facebook, according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal Monday.
It’s part of an arrangement that permits the Justice Department to investigate Google while handing over Facebook and Amazon to the FTC. On Friday, reports surfaced that the Justice Department was preparing to open an antitrust probe into Google. It wasn’t immediately clear exactly what part of Google’s business that the Department would be investigating, but shortly after the news broke, The Washington Post confirmed that The FTC would be at the reigns of any investigations into Amazon.
Both the FTC and the Justice Department have the authority to enforce antitrust laws, but the agencies work out agreements over which one will investigate specific companies.
The FTC has spent over a year now looking into Facebook’s privacy practices following the company’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, but that specific investigation doesn’t extend into questions on antitrust. Since the FTC is now charged with the authority to investigate Facebook’s market power, it could mean that the agency will pursue an antitrust probe into the company.

It’s not yet clear what actions the Justice Department is taking with Apple or what an antitrust case would focus on.
Apple is currently facing investigation in the European Union, where streaming music provider Spotify accused the company of favoring its own music app and driving up Spotify’s prices with App Store fees. The Supreme Court also ruled last month that it will have to face an antitrust lawsuit brought by iPhone app buyers. It was also involved in an ebook price-fixing antitrust case several years ago, ultimately refunding customers who were found to have over-paid for books.

792,"June 3, 2019",US: Corteva completes separation from DowDuPont,"

Corteva successfully completed its separation from DowDuPont, becoming a global pure-play agriculture company that offers complete solutions farmers need to maximize yield and profitability. Corteva Agriscience launches today (June 3, 2019) with global scale and a balanced offering across seed and crop protection.
The seed-and-pesticide maker, formed from the 2017 merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday as an independent entity. Corteva’s shares fell 7.7% in their first morning of trading to $24.89 while shares in competing seed and pesticide makers climbed and major US stock indexes declined slightly.
Corteva’s debut follows Bayer AG’s $63 billion purchase last year of Monsanto, the biggest seed company, and Syngenta AG’s $43 billion sale to China National Chemical Corp., commonly known as ChemChina, in 2017.

793,"June 2, 2019",US: CBS board plans merger talks with Viacom,"

The CBS board is preparing for merger talks with Viacom, people familiar with situation said, reported CNBC.
The long-anticipated talks between the two companies controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements are expected to begin in mid-June, though discussions could begin even sooner, the sources said. Viacom CEO Robert Bakish would likely run the combined entity.
The CBS board met on Wednesday, May 29, to review strategic options that included an unofficial offer it made to buy Lions Gates Entertainment’s Starz cable network for US$5 billion, one source briefed on the meeting said.
As a condition of the September 2018 settlement that led to CBS dropping a lawsuit against its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone and her family’s National Amusement, Redstone agreed not to raise the possibility of a merger between CBS and Viacom, which she also controls, for about two years. But it left open the possibility of independent members of the CBS board proposing a combination.
Sources close the companies have said CBS’ independent board of directors is reviewing a variety of options to protect itself against potential shareholder lawsuits that will likely come regardless of the outcome.

794,"June 2, 2019",US: CVS heads to court Tuesday to defend Aetna deal,"

According to the Wall Street Journal, CVS will defend its acquisition of insurer Aetna in two high-profile settings Tuesday, June 4, seeking to sell a federal judge on the nearly US$70 billion deal.
CVS lawyers will be in a DC, federal court for the start of a three-day proceeding in which US District Judge Richard Leon is considering whether the Justice Department adequately protected competition when it approved the deal last year.
The deal, reached in November, combined CVS’s sprawling network of pharmacies and pharmacy-benefit-management business with Aetna’s health-plan assets.
The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division approved the merger after the companies agreed to sell off Aetna’s Medicare Part D drug business to WellCare Health Plans. The Department stated the divestiture was needed because Aetna and CVS had been important competitors in selling Medicare drug plans to seniors in 22 states.
Groups like the American Medical Association claimed the divestiture didn’t do enough to protect competition for prescription-drug plans, and they argued the Department didn’t address broader concerns about healthcare industry consolidation.
The criticism caught the attention of Judge Leon, who is considering whether to approve the settlement between the companies and the Justice Department.

795,"June 2, 2019",US: Judge indicates Uber class action suit will likely advance,"
According to Courthouse News, a federal judge indicated Thursday, May 30, he will likely advance a class action that could make Uber change the way it classifies drivers as independent contractors in California.
US District Judge Edward Chen refused to accept Uber’s argument that it cannot be sued by a competitor for allegedly misclassifying drivers as contractors because such conduct is not considered an antitrust violation.
“They don’t have to allege a specific antitrust act,” Chen said in court Thursday. “You can violate the spirit of the law or policy of the law.”
Los Angeles-based Diva Limousine sued Uber in September 2018, claiming the company’s flouting of state labor laws gives it an unfair advantage in the marketplace, allowing Uber to offer predatory prices that harm competition. By classifying workers as contractors, Uber avoids paying overtime wages, providing health insurance, or reimbursing job-related expenses, among other employee benefits.

796,"June 2, 2019",US: Heritage Pharmaceuticals admits to price fixing and fined,"

Heritage Pharmaceuticals, a generic pharmaceutical company headquartered in Eatontown, New Jersey, was charged for conspiring with its competitors to fix prices, rig bids, and allocate customers, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Friday, May 31.
According to a one-count felony charge filed May 30 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, from about April 2014 until at least December 2015, Heritage participated in a criminal antitrust conspiracy with other companies and individuals engaged in the production and sale of generic pharmaceuticals, a purpose of which was to fix prices, rig bids, and allocate customers for glyburide, a medicine used to treat diabetes.
The Antitrust Division of the DOJ also announced a deferred prosecution agreement resolving the charge, under which Heritage admits that it conspired to fix prices, rig bids, and allocate customers for glyburide.
“American consumers have the right to generic drugs sold at prices set by competition, not collusion,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division.  “It is particularly galling that, when healthcare prices in the United States are already high, certain generic pharmaceutical companies and executives engaged in collusive conduct at the expense of individuals who depend on critical medications.  Heritage and its co-conspirators cheated and exploited vulnerable American patients to pad their bottom line.”

According to an exclusive report by Reuters, multiple sources close to the negotiations have confirmed that Amazon is currently interested in purchasing Boost Mobile from T-Mobile and Sprint.
One source confirms if the deal goes through, Amazon would gain access to T-Mobile’s new wireless network for a minimum of six years.
T-Mobile and Sprint have already pledged to sell Boost as part of measures to reduce their market share in the prepaid wireless business and gain regulatory approval for their planned US$26 billion merger. 
The carriers are also considering divesting wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in order to push the merger through.

The approval is subject to certain conditions. The approval means that T-Mobile and Sprint have 18 out of 19 public utility commission approvals now. The two companies only need approval from California and the US Department of Justice to complete the deal.T-Mobile’s US$26.5 billion takeover of Sprint has faced a number of regulatory hurdles, with US antitrust officials possibly still wanting to see four nationwide wireless carriers.

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has asked for more details on the planned merger of the Asian telecommunications operations of Norway’s Telenor and Axiata on concerns over potential job losses.
Telenor and Axiata, Malaysia’s biggest wireless carrier, announced the move earlier this month to create a company with 300 million customers in nine countries. A representative for Dr Mahathir’s office confirmed the prime minister’s concerns over job cuts after Bloomberg sought comment. The representative, who asked not to be named citing policy, didn’t provide further details.
The deal, which would be the country’s biggest since Dr Mahathir took office a year ago, is still progressing as planned despite the queries, according to people with knowledge of the matter, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

According to Reuters, Nissan sees no major downside to partnering with a combined Renault and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), it stated on Wednesday, May 29, in a lukewarm endorsement of the proposed US$35 billion tie-up.
The leaders of Nissan Motors, France’s Renault, and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors gathered at Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama for a scheduled alliance meeting which was overshadowed by FCA’s proposal this week for a merger-of-equals with Renault.
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan on Tuesday to discuss with Nissan the FCA-led proposal to create the world’s third-largest automaker. The plan raises difficult questions about how Nissan, which is 43.4% owned by the French automaker, would fit into a radically changed alliance.
“Overall, we don’t see any particularly negative aspect” to the planned merger, which was for Renault and FCA to decide, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Wednesday.

Italian television group Mediaset announced Wednesday, May 29, it has acquired 9.6% of German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 as it seeks European expansion to counter the rise of global streaming giants such as Netflix.
Mediaset, which is owned by the family of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, will become the largest shareholder in the German channel, which also has a presence in Austria and Switzerland.
“The friendly acquisition of a stake in ProSiebenSat.1 is a long-term choice, aimed at creating value with an increasingly international outlook,” Pier Silvio Berlusconi, the son of Italy’s three-time premier, said in a statement.
“Mediaset is proud to invest in the future of free-to-air European television,” he said, adding that the acquisition confirms the company’s “esteem for the current management” of ProSiebenSat.1.

802,"May 29, 2019",US: FTC approves conditions on merger of  Tronox and Cristal,"
Following a public comment period, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved a final order settling charges that the acquisition by Tronox Limited of competitor Cristal would violate the antitrust laws by significantly reducing competition for chloride process titanium dioxide in the United States and Canada.
According to the complaint, which was first announced in December 2017, Tronox’s proposed acquisition of Cristal, for US$1.67 billion and a 24% stake in the combined entity, would increase the risk of coordinated action among the remaining competitors and the likelihood of future anticompetitive output reductions by Tronox.
Under the settlement, which was reached after the FTC won key victories before a federal court and an Administrative Law Judge in its case to block the transaction, Tronox and Cristal must divest Cristal’s North American titanium dioxide assets, thereby preserving competition in the market for this important and widely used compound.

803,"May 28, 2019",US: FTC split over Facebook settlement delays decision,"
With a reported split between the Democrats and Republicans on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an anticipated settlement between Facebook and federal regulators related to privacy issues has been delayed. The social media company announced in late April that it expected to have a fine of up to US$5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.
At the time, observers watching the talks thought a settlement would be expected in a matter of days. Republican Chairman Joseph Simons, however, has been grappling with the challenge of winning support from a minimum of one of the two Democrats on the panel, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who don’t think the settlement goes far enough. Observers believe the official wants a bipartisan decision to serve as a warning to other firms.
Consumer Reports’ Director of Consumer Privacy and Technology Policy Justin Brookman said, according to the report, “Joe is trying in good faith not to make it 3-2. I think Joe’s got a tough job and I give him credit for trying to bridge [differences]. That probably explains some of the delay.” Another observer noted Simons might worry that a split decision could impact the reputation of the FTC as a bipartisan commission.

804,"May 28, 2019",Australia: Vodafone network “will suffer without TPG merger”,"
According to the Australian Financial Review, Vodafone Hutchison Australia stated its 5G network will be smaller, slower, and worse than those of its competitors Telstra and Optus unless it is allowed to merge with TPG, in a document filed with the Federal Court.
The statement of claim was the first shot fired in the company’s legal challenge against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s surprise decision this month to block the proposed US$15 billion merger. Vodafone is the lead applicant in the claim, with TPG the second respondent.
Vodafone’s central argument was that without the merger it would not have access to TPG’s radio spectrum or the improved access to financial resources, limiting its ability to compete with Optus and Telstra, both of which have considerably more licensed spectrum. The more spectrum a mobile operator has, the less likely it is to suffer congestion and the resulting slower speeds for customers.

The EU competition enforcer decline to comment on the reason for the extension. Vodafone, the world’s second-largest mobile operator, stated discussions with the Commission were ongoing.
Earlier this month, Vodafone offered to grant rival Telefonica Deutschland access to its enlarged high-speed broadband network to allay competition concerns about the deal.
However, rivals and customers have provided negative feedback to the Commission, suggesting Vodafone may need to improve its proposal in order to win regulatory approval for the deal, sources said.

France’s government has also weighed in, stating on Wednesday, May 22, that the status quo was weakening the alliance and could not continue.
But given Nissan’s current focus on improving corporate governance and recovering from a run of poor results, Keiko Ihara, who has been overseeing efforts to overhaul governance, told Reuters in an interview that the issue of a merger was not on the table at the moment.

809,"May 22, 2019","US: Qualcomm violated antitrust laws, judge rules","

Qualcomm, the world’s largest maker of smartphone modems and microchips, illegally charges companies sky-high prices to license its technology, Judge Lucy Koh ruled Tuesday.
In a case brought to court in 2017 by the US Federal Trade Commission, District Court Judge Lucy Koh said Qualcomm should not receive a percentage of sales of each phone a company sells; instead, it should receive a much smaller amount based on what Qualcomm technology exists inside the phone. It also must license its patents to rival chipmakers.
“Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition” in key parts of the modem chip market for years, “and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process,” the judge wrote. She added that the company’s lead in developing modem chips for smartphones using 5G, the new generation of cellular technology, madeit likely that behavior would continue.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Qualcomm is expected to appeal the decision. If it is upheld, that could upend the way Qualcomm does business. The tech company, based in San Diego, California, receives several dollars for each phone its technology is in, based on the total price of the phone. Judge Koh ruled that violates US antitrust law.
In addition to the FTC case, Qualcomm faces a class-action lawsuit from consumers asserting similar antitrust claims and seeking billions in damages.

Two federal agencies reviewing the US$26 billion Sprint/T-Mobile deal appear split in their thinking about the transaction. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is leaning against approving T-Mobile’s proposed takeover of Sprint as the remedies proposed by the companies do not resolve antitrust concerns, reported the Washington Post. Ajit Pai, from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) however said on Monday, May 20, that he backs the deal on Monday.
T-Mobile’s US$26 billion acquisition of rival Sprint won the support of the head of the FCCederal Communications Commission, Reuters reported on Monday. Chairman Ajit Pai said the telecom tie-up would benefit consumers by speeding up the nationwide deployment of new, ultra-fast mobile broadband service. Pai also received the backing of the FCC’s two other Republicans, positioning the merger to win the FCC’s final approval in the coming weeks.
On the other hand officials in the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, led by Makan Delrahim, remain skeptical that allowing the number of top wireless carriers to drop from four to three will help consumers, who now benefit from the pressure these rivals exert on each other to improve their prices and service offerings, reported the Washington Post.

The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says he plans to recommend the agency approve the US$26.5 billion merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile US and Sprint, saying it’ll speed up 5G deployment in the US he expressed in a statement on Monday, May 20.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai also said Monday that the combination will help bring faster mobile broadband to rural Americans, reported CNBC.
“Two of the FCC’s top priorities are closing the digital divide in rural America and advancing United States leadership in 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity. The commitments made today by T-Mobile and Sprint would substantially advance each of these critical objectives,” he said in a statement.
Pai said the companies have committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of the US population within three years of the closing of the merger and 99% of Americans within six years. In addition, 85% of rural Americans would be covered within three years and 90% covered within six years. T-Mobile and Sprint also guaranteed that 90% of Americans would have access to mobile broadband service at speeds of at least 100 Mbps and 99% would have access to speeds of at least 50 Mbps.
Pai said T-Mobile US and Sprint would suffer “serious consequences” if they don’t meet their FCC commitments, including the possibility of having to pay billions to the Treasury Department.

“Amundi would not necessarily buy all [of DWS] and would be ready to leave a stake of DWS listed on the stock market, but there is no point in being a minority partner,” the source said.
However, several sources familiar with Deutsche Bank’s plans told Reuters that the German lender is unwilling to sell a controlling stake in DWS.
A partial sale of DWS would have helped Deutsche Bank finance its proposed merger with Commerzbank, but now that those talks have collapsed, the urgency to do an asset management deal has fizzled out.

815,"May 19, 2019",EU: Netherlands wants EC to regulate Big Tech startup acquisitions,"
The Dutch government reiterated a European desire for tougher rules for big technology companies like Apple and Google to acquire small competing startups, reported Bloomberg.
Mona Keijzer, the Dutch State Secretary for Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, has proposed implementing three measures on a European level to prevent large technology companies from becoming too dominant, she wrote in a letter to the national parliament on Saturday, May 18. The State Secretary said she is already in talks with other member states on the policy.
“It is desirable to be able to intervene earlier and in a more targeted manner,” she wrote.
The European Commission has sought tougher scrutiny of acquisitions in the past. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced similar plans last year. Keijzer said she sees the upcoming appointment of a new European Commission as a “suitable moment” to argue for adjustments in antitrust policy.

816,"May 19, 2019",EU: Vestager says breaking up Facebook would be a last resort,"
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said breaking up social media giant Facebook would be a last resort, according to a report by Reuters.
Vestager made her comments on Friday, May 17, at the VivaTech technology conference in Paris, after being asked about the subject following US politicians and a Facebook co-founder speaking out in favor of dismantling the company.
“Of course it would be a remedy of very last resort. I think it would keep us in court for maybe a decade. It is much more direct and maybe much more powerful to say we need access to data,” Vestager said.
Earlier in the week, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, voiced his support for breaking up Facebook, according to reports, something fellow candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called for as well.
Sanders shared his thoughts with Politico, and when asked if he supports Warren’s proposal for antitrust actions against Facebook, he responded, “The answer is yes of course.”
“We have a monopolistic — an increasingly monopolistic society where you have a handful of very large corporations having much too much power over consumers,” Sanders said.
His comments came on the heels of a much publicized New York Times op-ed piece by Facebook Co-Founder Chris Hughes (who no longer works for the social media giant) also calling for the breakup of Facebook.
“The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook’s explosive growth and overlook...

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) on Friday, May 17, announced it has agreed to purchase supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc.
The transaction is valued at approximately US$1.3 billion, according to a press release from Cray.
The acquisition aims to accelerate HPE’s strategy to tackle customers’ most data-intensive challenges by combining deep supercomputing talent and cutting-edge technologies, the release stated.
The group expects growth in the high performance computing segment of the market and storage services to grow from US$28 billion in 2018, to US$35 billion in 2021.
Cray was founded in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, with business headquarters in Minneapolis, according to the company’s website. The company also moved one of its offices to Bloomington across from Mall of America in 2017.

818,"May 16, 2019","EU: EC fines Barclays, Citi, JP Morgan, MUFG and RBS US$1.2B for FX rigging","
Barclays, Citigroup, JP Morgan, MUFG, and Royal Bank of Scotland were fined a combined €1.07 billion (US$1.2 billion) by the European Union on Thursday, May 16, for rigging the multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange market, reported Reuters.
Banks have been hit with billions of dollars in penalties worldwide over the last decade for the rigging of benchmarks used in many day-to-day financial transactions, further damaging the industry’s fragile reputation after the financial crisis.
The European Commission stated that individual traders at the banks involved formed two cartels to manipulate the spot foreign exchange market for 11 currencies, including the dollar, the euro, and the pound.
“These cartel decisions send a clear message that the Commission will not tolerate collusive behavior in any sector of the financial markets,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Citigroup was hit with the highest fine of €311 million, while Swiss bank UBS was not fined as it had alerted the two cartels to the European Commission.
The EU competition enforcer said most of the traders knew each other on a personal basis and set up chatrooms such as “Essex Express ‘n the Jimmy”, which was given this name because all of them except “James” lived in Essex, to the east of London, and met on their train commute to the British capital.
The five-year investigation found nine traders spread across the banks exchanged sensitive information and tr...

819,"May 16, 2019",Australia: ACCC calls for merger law review,"
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman Rod Sims said the handling of mergers needs a “rethink,” a week after knocking back the TPG-Vodafone merger because of dubious claims over competition.
Mr Sims told the Australian Financial Review “we need a real rethink on how merger issues are dealt with in Australia,” after the competition watchdog lost yet another battle in the courts on May 15.
Mr Sims maintains there’s nothing wrong with the Commission’s legal strategy, telling the AFR the system is responsible for the fact its “record is lousy” on mergers.
“About 85 to 90 per cent of cases we take to court are successful in cartels, competition and consumer law,” Mr Sims said.
“When you are winning the cases all of the time in all other areas of the law but not in mergers, it is clear there is a problem with the merger regime in Australia.”
The loss in a case brought by freight operator Aurizon comes after TPG and Vodafone announced they would challenge the Commission’s decision to block a AU$15 billion (US$10.3 billion) merger between the two companies.

820,"May 16, 2019",US: Buffett’s Berkshire buys $860m of Amazon shares,"
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed in a regulatory filing that it owned US$860.6 million of Amazon shares at the end of March.
The filing includes investments by Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. While it doesn’t reveal who bought and sold which shares, Buffett admitted earlier this month that the Amazon investment, which would now be worth US$904 million, was made by either Combs or Weschler. He added that he had been “an idiot” for not investing in the eCommerce giant on his own, according to Reuters.
Berkshire has teamed up with Amazon and JPMorgan on Haven, an independent healthcare company that is aiming to fix the nation’s healthcare system, with a focus on reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.
“We want to change the way people experience healthcare so that it is simpler, better and lower cost,” Dr. Atul Gawande, Haven’s CEO, said in a statement back in March. “We’ll start small, learn from the experience of patients, and continue to expand to meet their needs.”
Berkshire also invests in JPMorgan, increasing its holdings by 19% in the first quarter to 59.5 million shares, which is now worth US$6.02 billion.
Combs and Weschler’s initial investments have signaled Berkshire commitments directed by Buffett, such as its US$32.1 billion acquisition in 2016 of industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, as well as a stake in Apple worth almost US$48 billion. Berkshire also owns more than...

Judge Richard Leon US District Court for the District of Columbia set a hearing to start on June 3 and to run a maximum of three days, according to the court filing.
The deal prompted criticism as soaring healthcare prices have sparked outrage and investigations in the United States. The criticism of rising drug prices has come from across the political spectrum, from US President Donald Trump, a Republican, to progressive Democrats like US Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president.

822,"May 14, 2019",US: Joe Biden says he’s open to breaking up Facebook,"
According to CNBC Joe Biden said Monday that he would be open to breaking up Facebook, a sign of the deep skepticism among many Democratic presidential contenders about the power of massive technology firms.

Asked during an interview with The Associated Press about breaking up tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon or Google, as 2020 rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has championed, Biden said, “I don’t think we spend nearly enough time focusing on antitrust measures. And the truth of the matter is I think it’s something we should take a really hard look at.”
Warren has been the most outspoken Democratic presidential candidate to press for greater regulation of Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies.
Regardless of whether Facebook is ultimately broken up, Biden told the AP, the Trump administration hasn’t done enough to enforce antitrust laws in a variety of industries.

823,"May 14, 2019",US: Salmon price fixing cases consolidated,"
North Atlantic fisheries accused of conspiring to fix the price of farm-raised salmon by rigging its cash price in Oslo will go to Miami federal court to defend themselves, reported Bloomberg Law.
Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida consolidated two proposed class actions May 10. Altonaga said she would also oversee other lawsuits claiming the top producers of farmed salmon propped up the Oslo “spot price,”
The original lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, 23 April, alleges the major players in Norway’s farmed salmon industry exchanged competitively sensitive information among themselves, with the aim of artificially controlling the price of farm-raised salmon bought by U.S. seafood buyers, a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
The lawsuit is largely based on an ongoing investigation by the European Commission into “suspected anti-competitive practices” in the farmed Atlantic salmon sector in Europe, first made public in February 2019.

The Supreme Court on Monday, May 13, ruled 5-4 against Apple, saying iPhone users can pursue their antitrust lawsuit involving the tech giant’s signature electronic marketplace, the App Store
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by the court’s liberal justices.
The iPhone users argued that Apple’s 30% commission on sales through the App Store is an unfair use of monopoly power that results in inflated prices passed on to consumers.
Apple argued that only app developers, and not users, should be able to bring such a lawsuit. But the Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Kavanaugh, rejected that claim.
“Apple’s line-drawing does not make a lot of sense, other than as a way to gerrymander Apple out of this and similar lawsuits,” Kavanaugh wrote.
The result of the iPhone users’ litigation could affect the way that Apple, as well as other companies that operate electronic marketplaces like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, structure their businesses. For Apple, hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties could hang on the outcome.

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is pushing back against the Justice Department’s request to be heard on any potential sanctions against Qualcomm in a pending anti-monopoly case in San Jose federal court.
In a two-page filing on Thursday, May 9,, the FTC called the Justice Department’s efforts last week to intervene in the case “untimely.” The agency noted that it did not “participate in or request” that the Department of Justice weigh in.
“Among other things, the (DOJ) submission ignores this court’s prior orders and the parties’ briefing on remedy and misconstrues applicable law and the record,” wrote FTC lawyers.
Last week, the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department requested that if Judge Lucy Koh rules that Qualcomm violated antitrust law, she hold an additional evidentiary hearing before requiring changes to Qualcomm’s business practices.

826,"May 9, 2019",It’s Time to Break Up Facebook,"
By Chris Hughes, New York Times









The last time I saw Mark Zuckerbergwas in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. We met at Facebook’sMenlo Park, Calif., office and drove to his house, in a quiet, leafy neighborhood. We spent an hour or two together while his toddler daughter cruised around. We talked politics mostly, a little about Facebook, a bit about our families. When the shadows grew long, I had to head out. I hugged his wife, Priscilla, and said goodbye to Mark.
Since then, Mark’s personal reputation and the reputation of Facebook have taken a nose-dive. The company’s mistakes — the sloppy privacy practices that dropped tens of millions of users’ data into a political consulting firm’s lap;the slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news; and the unbounded drive to capture ever more of our time and attention — dominate the headlines. It’s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility.
Mark is still the same person I watched hug his parents as they left our dorm’s common room at the beginning of our sophomore year. He is the same person who procrastinated studying for tests, fell in love with his future wife while in line for the bathroom at a party and slept on a mattress on the floor in a small apartment years after he could have afforded much more. In other words, he’s huma...

Chevron abandoned its takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum on Thursday, May 9, outmaneuvered by Occidental Petroleum’s higher, US$38 billion offer that included more than three times as much cash, reported Reuters.
With a financing assist from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Occidental, which is one-quarter the size of Chevron, is the likely victor in a contest that again proved the allure of US shale field.
Occidental has stated it plans to shed most of Anadarko’s non-shale properties in a deal that would cement its position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the top US shale field.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said the company decided at a board meeting on Wednesday to walk away from the takeover battle, even though it could have matched or beaten Occidental’s offer and saw Anadarko as a strategic fit.
“Make no mistake. We have the financial capacity to outbid Occidental, but we concluded that an increased offer would have eroded value to our shareholders, and it would have diminished returns on capital,” Wirth said. “The bar is high. We don’t have a need to do anything. We are not desperate to do a deal.”

According to The Financial Times a European proxy adviser has backed a shareholder protest vote against Deutsche Bank’s chairman and three of the lender’s senior executives at its annual meeting later this month.
The move by ECGS, a European proxy vote adviser, heaps more pressure on Germany’s biggest bank ahead of what looks set to be an uncomfortable annual meeting on May 23 only weeks after it broke off merger talks with rival Commerzbank. 
The merger talks had briefly offered the promise of salvation for an institution that has lurched from scandal to scandal in recent years and lost more than half its market value since the start of 2018.
Two of the biggest proxy advisers, Glass Lewis and ISS, have already advised investors to vote against motions that endorse the performance of the bank’s supervisory and management boards, citing its scandal-littered recent past and weak profitability.

Australian regulators on Wednesday, May 8, blocked the multi-billion-dollar merger between Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom, reported The Financial Times.
The two firms announced in August a deal to form a AU$15 billion (US$10.5 billion) unit to take on Telstra and Optus in an increasingly competitive telecoms sector. But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the merger “will reduce competition and contestability”.
The ruling is the second setback for Vodafone in the region after a NZ$2.4 billion (US$1.6 billion) merger with Sky in New Zealand was blocked by regulators in 2017. The UK telecoms company has been unwinding its global empire by merging or selling off local networks while investing in cable assets in Europe. It has struggled to get deals away in Australasia, however.
The ACCC did not give reasons why it had blocked the AU$15 billion (US$10.5 billion) combination of TPG and Vodafone Hutchison Australia after it was forced to rush out a statement, admitting that it “inadvertently published online.” However, the watchdog stated the proposed merger would have reduced competition in the sector as it would preclude TPG from entering as the nation’s fourth mobile operator.

Visa, the payments company, announced Wednesday, May 8, that it has acquired Earthport, a cross-border payment company catering to banks, money transfer services providers and businesses around the world. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
In a press release, Visa stated that with the acquisition it will be possible for Visa clients to enable individuals, businesses and governments to use Visa to send and receive money through banks accounts. Earthport operates one of the biggest independent ACH networks in the world. Visa stated that before the deal, Visa enabled payments to be sent to and from other Visa cards. Via Earthport Visa said it expects to be able to reach most of the banked population across the globe, enabling them to send money worldwide more quickly and easily. According to the payments company, while close to US$80 trillion is sent via wire transfer or bank account, the process is complex, with money in some cases taking days to arrive.
“Visa is modernizing the way we move money by making it quicker, safer and easier to pay and be paid than ever before,” said Bill Sheley, head of global push payments at Visa, in a press release announcing the deal. “The acquisition of Earthport unleashes the power of Visa by taking us ‘beyond the card,’ empowering us to enable our clients to make payments through bank accounts around the world.”

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a Liberal candidate to be the next Commission President, believes the key to improving Europe’s environment and fighting climate change will be implementing the laws already on the books.
During her time as the head of the EU’s competition watchdog over the past five years, Margrethe Vestager has shown she’s not afraid to take on powerful corporate and government interests. Some decisions have angered Silicon Valley and Washington, while others have angered Paris and Berlin.
In an interview with EURACTIV, Vestager said she’s ready to take the fight to national governments in the EU to make sure the bloc’s already-passed environment and climate legislation is being implemented.
“Fighting climate change is a given, it’s not something where you can choose whether you want to do it or not,” she said. “It will happen, and we can figure out how to deal with it.”
“There’s going a big task for the next Commission to work with member states to take action in real life to implement what we have decided already. There’s a number of areas where existing legislation could easily be pushed and be useful for some of the things we want to do.”
She cites as an example the current Commission’s work to redesign the European energy market design, to make it more efficient and less emissions-intensive.
“This may sound technical and remote from climate change, but it’s one of the keystones for enabling the transition...

Germany’s Commerzbank on Wednesday, May 8, played down the prospects of an immediate takeover approach by a foreign bank following failed merger talks with Deutsche Bank, reported Reuters.
Commerzbank’s finance chief Stephan Engels, speaking to journalists after a sharp fall in first-quarter profit, said he didn’t hear anyone knocking at the door, as he put it.
Both Italy’s UniCredit and Dutch ING Groep have expressed interest in Commerzbank, which is Germany’s second largest lender and 15% owned by the government, sources have said. Unicredit and ING have declined to comment.
A strategy of continuing as a standalone bank remains an alternative, Engels said. “It was before and it is now. I can’t say if it always will be.”

833,"May 8, 2019",A Tax That Could Fix Big Tech,"
Putting a levy on targeted ad revenue would give Facebook and Google a real incentive to change their dangerous business models.







By Paul Romer







It is the job of government to prevent a tragedy of the commons. That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies.
What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model — in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads — new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model.
The tax that I propose would be applied to revenue from sales of targeted digital ads, which are the key to the operation of Facebook, Google and the like. At the federal level, Congress could add it as a surcharge to the corporate income tax. At the state level, a legislature could adopt it as a type of sales tax on the revenue a company collects for displaying ads to residents o...

Two US senators on Monday, May 6, criticized reported plans for a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement with Facebook Inc for misuse of consumers’ personal data, saying that top officials, potentially including founder Mark Zuckerberg, must be held personally responsible, reported Reuters.
In a letter to the FTC, Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, told the agency that even a US$5 billion civil penalty is a “bargain for Facebook.
The agency is also reportedly contemplating a settlement that elevates oversight of privacy policies and practices to Facebook’s board of directors and requires the social media giant to be more aggressive in policing third-party app developers.
“It should consider setting rules of the road on what Facebook can do with consumers’ private information, such as requiring the deletion of tracking data, restricting the collection of certain types of information, curbing advertising practices, and imposing a firewall on sharing private data between different products,” the senators wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joe Simons.
The FTC has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.

835,"May 7, 2019",US: Anadarko favors Occidental US$55B bid over Chevron,"
Anadarko Petroleum’s board of directors said on Monday, May 6, that Occidental Petroleum’s buyout offer is superior to its agreement to sell its business to Chevron, putting the deal with the oil giant in jeopardy.
The reversal marks the latest twist in a rare bidding war in the oil and gas sector. Chevron now has four days to counter Occidental’s latest bid for Anadarko, an oil and gas driller with prized assets in the US Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Africa.
Chevron reached an agreement last month to buy Anadarko for US$33 billion, or US$65 a share. Shortly after, Occidental offered US$55 billion, or US$76 a share, reported The Financial Times. Occidental on Sunday sweetened its bid by offering to pay mostly cash for Anadarko, after earlier structuring the transaction as a 50-50 cash-and-stock deal.

836,"May 7, 2019",EU: BMW hurts as US$1.8B is set aside for possible EU fine,"
BMW’s first-quarter operating profit fell 78% to €589 million (US$658.4 million), reported Reuters. This was not helped by BMW being compelled to set aside €1.4 billion (US$1.6 billion) to cover a possible fine from EU antitrust authorities.
The European Commission last month told German carmakers they face hefty fines for alleged collusion in the area of emissions filtering technology. BMW denies participating in antitrust activities and is contesting the allegations.
BMW’s first-quarter earnings before interest and taxes were below the €666 million (US$744.3 million) forecast in an analyst poll. A contribution of €648 million (US$724.2 million) from financial services only partially offset a €310 million (US$346.5 million) loss before interest and taxes at the automotive division.
Analysts said BMW’s results were underwhelming; “As most companies have done, BMW points towards a stronger second half this year. We remain skeptical regarding this optimism as we don’t see much stronger end-markets,” analysts at Evercore ISI said, citing trade tensions and emissions rules as risks.

According to Vodafone stepped up its battle to gain regulatory approval for its Liberty Global deal on Tuesday by offering rival Telefonica Deutschland access to its high-speed broadband network.
The world’s No.2 mobile operator agreed a year ago to pay $22 billion for Liberty’s cable networks in Germany and central Europe, seeking increased fixed-line heft to better compete with German market leader Deutsche Telekom.
Seeking to increase competition in the German market and defuse criticism of the deal, Vodafone on Tuesday said that Telefonica Deutschland would be able to offer super-fast services over Vodafone and Liberty’s Unity media cable networks in Germany if the deal is approved.

838,"May 6, 2019","US: FTC split on size, scope of Facebook fine","
With Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission in the final stages of settlement talks, disagreements between the five-member FTC panel are complicating the discussions.
The New York Times, citing three people with knowledge of the talks, reported that while the five FTC commissioners agreed months ago to fine Facebook a record amount, they can’t agree on how much and how severe the punishment should be for the social media giant. Facebook is in talks with the FTC to settle a lawsuit stemming from its scandal with Cambridge Analytica. In that case, the now defunct political consulting company was able to access information on more than 87 million Facebook users without their consent. When Facebook reported quarterly earnings in late April it said it was setting aside $3 billion to $5 billion to cover a settlement with the FTC.
According to The New York Times, the disagreements between the five commissioners is hurting the talks as they enter the final stages. One of the deepest disagreements between the commissioners is reportedly over Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s personal responsibility. The question is if he should be personally liable for violations of an accord Facebook reached with the FTC in 2011. The FTC is looking into violations since the agreement was inked. The report noted Facebook has been arguing that Zuckerberg shouldn’t be legally responsible since he can’t control the actions of all his employees. While talks may still fall apart, the paper report...

840,"May 6, 2019",US: Sanders announces a farmers’ right-to-repair and antitrust proposal,"
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday, May 5, proposed a sweeping agriculture and rural investment plan to break up big agriculture monopolies and shift farm subsidies toward small family farmers.
“I think a farmer that produces the food we eat may be almost as important as some crook on Wall Street who destroys the economy,” Sanders said during a campaign event in Osage, a town of fewer than 4,000 people. “Those of us who come from rural America have nothing to be ashamed about, and the time is long overdue for us to stand up and fight for our way of life.”
Sanders’ plan expands on themes that have been central to his presidential campaign in Iowa since the start, including his emphasis on rural America and pledge to take on and break up big corporations.
During his Sunday speech, Sanders outlined the dire circumstances confronting rural America: population decline, school and hospital closures, and rising addiction and suicide rates in many rural counties nationwide as the impetus for his policy.
Sanders is the second candidate, following Senator Elizabeth Warren, to get serious about trying to win over traditionally red regions by rolling out comprehensive policy plans that seek to restructure government programs and step up antitrust enforcement.

“Nuestros niños dependen de Internet y cada día serán más dependientes de él”, agregó.
La Unión Europea ha estado a la vanguardia de los esfuerzos para reforzar el control sobre la forma en que las compañías de medios sociales manejan los datos personales de los consumidores, con las normas introducidas en mayo pasado que otorgan a los reguladores el poder de imponer multas de hasta el 4 por ciento de los ingresos globales por violaciones.

The world needs to be wary of the rise of tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, comparing their powers to those of countries such as China, European Council President Donald Tusk said in Warsaw on Friday.
“In the East, we see the rise of those capable of controlling everyone’s behavior, and in the West we’ve seen the rise of an uncontrolled, spontaneous empire,” Tusk said in Warsaw in reference to the companies during a speech marking Constitution Day.
“Our children are dependent on the internet and everyday will become more dependent on it,” he added.
The European Union has been in the forefront of efforts to tighten control on how social media companies handle the personal data of consumers, with rules introduced last May giving regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is backing 2020 presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to break up big tech companies, reported The Washington Times.
“The idea itself is something that I am supportive of because taking an antitrust approach I believe is absolutely relevant and it’s appropriate to take,” the progressive House freshman said in an interview with Politico this week.
Warren’s proposal would break up companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, targeting firms that both own an online platform and participate in its marketplace. Ocasio-Cortez echoed criticisms of such arrangements, arguing that in the case of Amazon, its role as “both the marketplace, producer, seller … creates an antitrust issue.”
The New York Democrat was an outspoken critic of Amazon’s plans to open a headquarters near her district in Queens, N.Y. And last month, she announced she had quit Facebook and called social media a “public health risk.”

A European Union antitrust crackdown on big technology firms is “definitely not done yet,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg TV, citing probes into Amazon.com Inc. and Google.
“We have a probe into the Amazon use of data because they both host a lot of businesses but they also compete against those businesses themselves. We want to figure out if this a fair use of data,” she said in an interview. On Google, “we’re still looking into the question” of searches for jobs and local services.
Vestager shut down her last big Google case in March with a 1.49 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine that helped to pull down owner Alphabet’s earnings. She’s fined the US giant 8.2 billion euros and demanded changes over how it displays rival shopping search results and how it distributes its apps for Android mobile phones. Google risks more fines if it doesn’t make changes that trigger more competition.

On May 1, the Federal Trade Commission registered for the International Competition Network’s Framework for Competition Agency Procedures (CAP), making it a founding member of the ICN’s most recent initiative to promote fair and informed competition enforcement procedures around the world.
The CAP is a non-binding, voluntary framework aimed at encouraging implementation of basic procedural principles, including through agency-to-agency cooperation provisions that encourage agencies to discuss their processes and procedural issues. The CAP also allows Framework participants to review the progress of the CAP regularly.
The CAP is the ICN’s third opt-in implementation framework for competition agencies, following earlier ones on merger and cartel enforcement cooperation. The framework model provides participating agencies with an opportunity for targeted cooperation and implementation of ICN principles.

846,"May 2, 2019",US: Apple to pay Qualcomm over US$4.5B in past licensing fees,"
According to Qualcomm’s latest earnings report released this week, Apple will pay the company between $4.5 and $4.7 billion as part of the settlement the two firms made last month.
Last month, Qualcomm and Apple put to bed a massive, long-running patent and antitrust case that started when Apple sued the other company for alleged unfair patent licensing practices for $1 billion and escalated when Qualcomm filed a countersuit for $7 billion. Qualcomm came out the apparent victor, scoring a six-year licensing deal and a chip supply agreement as well as the massive one-off payment.
That multibillion dollar payment is a big deal for Qualcomm, reported The New York Times. The company estimated in its quarterly earnings report that it expects to take in a total of $4.7 billion to $5.5 billion in regular revenue, before the payment is factored in, during the upcoming quarter. However, the company also said its legal war chest isn’t necessarily an immediate game changer, even if the deal positions it to be Apple’s sole 5G modem supplier in the wake of Intel’s withdrawal from the market.


The Times noted that Qualcomm’s Q3 2019 forecasts, which fell on the slightly lower side of analyst expectations of $5.29 billion, “suggested that Apple’s licensing fees will not substantially increase revenue as Apple catches up on royalties it didn’t pay while the two companies were feuding.”

Chinese regulators have requested information from German car makers regarding a European Union probe into possible collusion on the development of emissions technology, a sign that they may be considering launching their own probe, reported Morningstar.
The Chinese Competition Authority requested information from Volkswagen  and its Audi and Porsche AG subsidiaries in March, VW said in its first-quarter report on Thursday. A BMW spokesman said Thursday that “there has been contact with the Chinese antitrust authorities,” but declined to comment further citing continuing internal and external investigations.
A Daimler spokeswoman said the company is fully cooperating with the Chinese authorities. China’s Ministry of Commercedidn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.
Last month, the European Commission said BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen may have breached antitrust rules by allegedly colluding to restrict competition on the development of emissions-cleaning technology for gas and diesel cars.

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims expressed his concern that Facebook and Google are responsible for the content they publish, at a CPI conference at Melbourne Law School  Tuesday.
“They have created this machine … I don’t think you can absolve yourself of responsibility for what happens on the platforms … I find that extraordinary and totally unacceptable.” Sims said.
Bank of England deputy governor Philip Marsden, who sat on the UK’s recent digital platform review, also backed calls for a dedicated regulator to limit the power of the digital giants,  reported Patrick Durkin from the Australian Financial Review.
Professor Marsden also urged competition experts to overcome their resistance to the creation of a bespoke regulatory regime for the tech giants at the conference.
“There is no way it is not going to happen; we are riding a wave of digital regulation,” Professor Marsden told the conference.
Sims defended criticism over Facebook buying Instagram for $US1 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2012, saying that regulators still needed to rely on the evidence.
But said more needed to be done to protect against further consolidation by the tech giants, despite critic Mr Manne claiming that “a presumption against any vertical integration is front and centre in the ACCC report”,.

The UK’s antitrust watchdog has provisionally cleared PayPal’s US$2.2 billion takeover of Swedish start-up iZettle after an in-depth probe, reported the Financial Times.
The Competition & Markets Authority had been concerned over the overlap between the two companies, which both make mobile point of sale devices enabling businesses to take “offline” payments through a card reader which can be plugged into tablets or smartphones.
It had referred the deal to a Phase 2 investigation last December after PayPal failed to offer what it termed “acceptable ways” to address its concerns.
Kirstin Baker, who chaired the inquiry, said it had been “particularly important… to verify in detail what could have happened had iZettle not been taken over” given iZettle is a “relatively recent entrant to payment services, and PayPal had pre-existing plans to invest in its product offering.”

Sprint and T-Mobile have announced an agreement to extend the deadline for their proposed US$26 billion merger deal to July 29, reported Reuters.
The extension was revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and means that the two carriers now have more time to get the proposed merger approved by both the Federal Communications Commission and the US Department of Justice.
The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has been exploring whether the deal would result in a major threat to competition. Earlier this month, Justice Department staff members reportedly told Sprint and T-Mobile that their planned merger is unlikely to be approved as it is currently structured.
However, in an interview on CNBC, Justice Department Antitrust Division chief Makan Delrahim said he had not made a decision regarding the T-Mobile and Sprint merger and is waiting for more information from the two companies.
“I have not made up my mind,” he told CNBC. “The investigation continues. We’ve requested some data from the companies that will be forthcoming. We don’t have a set number of meetings or a time-line.”
“If the case is there for us to challenge a transaction or suggest changes, we will do that,” he said. The Division is reviewing the argument that the deal would allow the combined company to produce a better, faster 5G, the next generation of wireless, he added.

The competition watchdog stated it had granted the extension to give Telecom Italia (TIM) more time to organize its defense.
The investigation began almost two years ago after TIM, then headed by former CEO Flavio Cattaneo, announced plans to roll out fast broadband in uneconomic areas before later scrapping them.
TIM had initially announced it would not roll out fiber in such areas, forcing Rome to step in with state subsidized tenders.

New York’s attorney general is launching an investigation into Facebook after it was reported last week that the company had scraped the email contacts of 1.5 million users without their consent, reported The Hill.
“It is time Facebook is held accountable for how it handles consumers’ personal information,” state Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumers’ information while at the same time profiting from mining that data.”
James added that the incident is the “latest demonstration that Facebook does not take seriously its role in protecting our personal information.”

A spokesperson for Facebook said it was “in touch with the New York State attorney general’s office” and that it would be “responding to their questions on this matter.”
The incident is just the latest in a series of crises for Facebook which is still facing regulatory blowback from its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was revealed a year ago.
On Wednesday, the company revealed that it had set aside $3 billion for a potential settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over the debacle, and that it anticipated a fine as high as $5 billion.

A new report from The New York Times notes of Apple’s continued efforts to push users towards its first-party time tracking feature.
The report details that over the past year, Apple has “removed or restricted” at least 11 of the 17 most popular screen time and parental control applications on the App Store. In some cases, the apps were completely removed from the App Store, while some developers were forced to remove key features.
“They yanked us out of the blue with no warning,” said Amir Moussavian, chief executive of OurPact, the top parental-control iPhone app, with more than three million downloads. In February, Apple pulled the app, which accounted for 80 percent of OurPact’s revenue, from its App Store.
“They are systematically killing the industry,” Mr. Moussavian said.
Following Apple’s harsher stance on these parental control applications, developers of two of the most popular apps have filed a complaint with the European Union. Kidslox and Qustodio filed a complaint with the EU on Thursday, today’s report says. This comes following an antitrust complaint in Russia from Kaspersky Labs last month, which also centered on Screen Time in iOS 12.

858,"April 25, 2019",UK: CMA blocks Sainsbury/Asda deal,"
Britain’s competition regulator has blocked Sainsbury’s proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Walmart owned Asda.  

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in its final report on Thursday that the deal would lead to increased prices in stores, online and at many petrol stations across the UKSainsbury’s, Walmart and Asda said they had mutually agreed to terminate the transaction. Sainsbury’s and Asda agreed the deal in April last year. As well as overtaking market leader Tesco, it also would have given Walmart a way to exit Britain, one of the weakest performers in its global portfolio.
However in its final report the CMA found that UK shoppers and motorists would be worse off if Sainsbury’s and Asda merged.
It concluded that the deal would result in a substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level.
It said this would mean shoppers right across the UK would be affected, not just in the areas where Sainsbury’s and Asda stores overlapped.
“We have concluded that there is no effective way of addressing our concerns, other than to block the merger,” said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA inquiry group.

859,"April 25, 2019",Germany: Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank call off deal talks,"
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank announced Thursday, April 25, that they have ended talks about a combination.
In a statement on its website, Commerzbank wrote the two sides discontinued talks about a combination after careful analysis determined it would not be in the interest of either bank’s shareholders to combine.
“It made sense to evaluate this option for domestic consolidation in Germany. However, we were always clear: we needed to be convinced that any potential combination would generate higher and more sustainable returns for shareholders and allow us to enhance our value proposition to clients,” said Martin Zielke, CEO of Commerzbank, in the statement. “After thorough analysis, we have concluded that this transaction would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the additional execution risks, restructuring costs and capital requirements associated with such a large-scale integration.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have been in deal talks since the middle of March after Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing confirmed it in a memo. Rumors had been swirling for months about a potential deal between the two German banks. In the memo, Sewing said that while Deutsche had been making progress during the last couple of months in its turnaround, it had also been assessing its opportunities as they come up. With a stated mission to remain a global bank with a big capital markets business, Sewing said it’s important to pursue options that make economic ...

Keurig Green Mountain must face most of a consolidated antitrust lawsuit accusing the “K-Cup” maker of monopolizing the market for single-serve coffee machines and pods. reported Bloomberg.
Two competing coffee makers and a proposed class of direct purchasers—distributors and retailers, can proceed with their antitrust claims under the Sherman Act and the laws of more than 20 states,a Manhattan federal judge ruled in an opinion unsealed April 24. A sealed version of the 114-page opinion was issued April 3.
Food and beverage distributor McLane and other distributors claimed that because of Keurig’s anticompetitive behavior, it was overcharged on more than US$1.5 billion worth of K-Cups it purchased from Keurig and its licensees; J.M. Smucker and Starbucks Coffee.
In late 2017, a federal court rejected a request by Keurig to dismiss multiple lawsuits charging that it had unfairly monopolize the market for single-serve “K-Cups” used in its popular coffee brewing machines.

The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on Thursday affirmed dismissal of LLM Bar Exam’s $50 million antitrust suit, which claimed Barbri colluded with law schools to keep the plaintiff off campuses, dominate the LL.M. bar prep market and eventually drive it out of business.
The appellate court found in a seven-page opinion that LLM Bar Exam’s allegations of Sherman Act and RICO violations failed to state a plausible claim to relief, and concluded that the lower court was correct to dismiss the plaintiff’s remaining claims in 2017.
LLM Bar Exam’s attorney, Judd Spray, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the company’s founder Emanuele Tosolini.
“Barbri is pleased that the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s judgment to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim,” said Barbri president Mike Sims on Thursday.

863,"April 25, 2019",Facebook faces a huge fine. Critics want more.,"
By Andrew Harnik/New York Times
Facebook said yesterday that it expected the Federal Trade Commission to fine it up to $5 billion for privacy violations, Mike Isaac and Cecilia Kang of the NYT report.
That would be a record penalty for a tech company, way beyond the $22 million Google had to pay in 2012 for misleading statements about online tracking. But it’s in line with recent E.U. punishments, like Google’s $5 billion antitrust fine last year and the $15.3 billion tax evasion penalty given to Apple in 2016.
Both the F.T.C. and Facebook have reasons to celebrate. The regulator looks strong. The tech giant looks accountable, without having to remake its business.
But critics say it’s “a slap on the wrist.” That’s how Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of the House’s antitrust subcommittee, told the NYT he would characterize “a fine in the low billions of dollars.” The F.T.C. “must pursue strong structural remedies and impose managerial accountability” on Facebook, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, tweeted.

864,"April 25, 2019",News Media Cartels are Bad News for Consumers,"
April 2019

News Media Cartels are Bad News for Consumers By John M. Yun (George Mason University)1
Antitrust has two legal standards by which to assess firm conduct. The first is the rule of reason, which applies to the majority of antitrust matters that appear before competition agencies. The second standard is per se condemnation, which is reserved for conduct that is deemed so plainly harmful that the act itself is sufficient to find liability — the canonical example being cartel price fixing. The reason why cartels are condemned under a per se standard is because there is little to no redeeming social value from allowing competitors to jointly set the terms of trade in a market. Put simply, cartels are the antithesis of competition. They collectively negotiate on behalf of their members in order to extract a greater share of the market surplus while also damaging the market through higher prices, lower output, and/or lower quality.
This takes us to the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act.2 This bill was introduced with the professed objective of allowing small newspaper publishers to band together in negotiations with Facebook and Google in order to secure a more fair and equitable distribution of profits from online advertising.3 As virtuous as that may sound, the reality is quite different. The bill would allow all online newspaper publishers (including conglomerates such as the News Corporation, AT&T, and Viacom) to form a cartel to fix prices and other terms of trade. This is not a bill aimed at small publishers, nor is it a bill aimed at ensuring “quality”4 (which is often a red herring in antitrust as it invokes a desire for incumbents to create artificial barriers to entry). Rather, the bill would create antitrust immunity for colluding media conglomerates.
In this short article, we first describe precisely what is in the bill. Next, we describe the structure of the online news market, and the role that online platforms play in distributing news content. Finally, we detail the impact that such collusion would have on the market.
What actually is in the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act?
The bill would create a “safe harbor” for four years to “any print or digital news organization [emphasis added]” (that creates “original” news and is commercially marketed) to jointly negotiate terms of trade with “online content distributor[s]” that “displays, distributes, or directs users to news articles” and “has not fewer than 1,000,000,000 monthly active users, in the aggregate, of all its websites.” Thus, despite a press release that contends the act “will allow small publishers to band together in negotiations with Facebook [&] Google,”5 the bill is clearly not limited to small publishers as there is no discussion that places a limit on the size of the covered entities. Thus, conglomerates and large operations such as the News Corporation, AT&T, Viacom, the Walt Disney Corporation, the Fox Corporation, The New York Times Company, Bloomberg, the Gannett Company, and the Washington Post will be allowed to collude. Relevantly, according to Wired, the “prime driver of the bill is the News Media Alliance,”6 a trade association comprised of 2,000 newspapers across the U.S. and Canada.
The bill clearly targets Facebook and Google, as they both have more than a billion monthly users; although, given that the bill offers four years of antitrust immunity, it is possible that other online platforms will fall under its scope before expiration.7 Specifically, the bill expressly allows media companies to “collectively withhold content from” Facebook and Google in order to extract better terms of trade.8 Importantly, the bill expressly allows price fixing — although, the price fixing must be directly related to “the quality, accuracy, attribution or branding, and interoperability of news.”9 The bill’s sponsors represent that this price clause does not “allow publishers to collude on price.”10 Yet that answer is misleading, as the sponsors’ full answer reveals that collective negotiation over price is allowed (as stated expressly in the bill) as long as it is, again, directly related to “the quality, accuracy, attribution or branding, and interoperability of news.”11 The plasticity of this clause suggests there is no real hinderance to price fixing.
Another key clause is that the media cartel must negotiate terms that are “non-discriminatory as to similarly situated news content creators” and, likewise, must negotiate “terms that would be available to all news content creators.” This “non-discriminatory” provision can be read a number of ways. At first blush, this clause would appear to protect news media organizations and sites who choose not to join the cartel — as the terms of trade that the cartel negotiates with online platforms would be “available to all news content creators.” The relevant phrase in the bill, however, is “similarly situated.” Even if this phrase were not in the bill, it seems plausible that the cartel would negotiate different terms of trade for different “tiers” of news organization (i.e. “similarly situated”). The overall deal, however, would be available to all news creators. For instance, inter alia, the News Corporation, The New York Times, and the Washington Post would be part of a top tier, which gets the most favorable terms of trade as it would be given some type of “A+” rating on “quality,” while smaller, local newspapers would be part of some lower tier — yet, overall, there would still be one ratified agreement. Thus, there would technically be no “discrimination” under the provision of the bill since the overall terms of trade are available to all news organizations. Moreover, there is nothing in the bill that prohibits the cartel from including a most-favorable nations (MFN) clause that would effectively limit the ability of individual news organizations, whether part of the cartel or not, from cutting side deals with online platforms. This would contractually, and legally, limit the fundamental feature that makes cartels vulnerable: defections.12 Rather than being an actual non-discrimination provision, it is more accurately a uniformity provision.
The Role of Facebook and Google in News Distribution
As justification for antitrust immunity, the bill states that “some dominant platforms serve as a de facto gateway to all online content for many web users, wielding an enormous amount of control over how readers find and interact with content produced by the press.”13 Yet, an examination of publicly available data indicates that Google and Facebook do not account for the majority of traffic to news sites. Hence, the bill is built on a false premise.
In order to be a “gateway,” a platform must be responsible for the overwhelming majority of traffic to a website, and there must be no viable alternative outlets. While a systematic empirical assessment of this question is beyond the scope of the article, there are a multitude of sources that are in conflict with this assertion. Focusing on The New York Times’ website, statistics from SimilarWeb, which is an online analytical tool, show that all search engines account for 30.5 percent of traffic to nytimes.com.14 While this is certainly a significant percentage, the most common search terms are “new york times” and “nytimes.”15 This means users are, in effect, directly going to the New York Times website; they are merely using search engines as a method to “bookmark” the site. In terms of social media, according to SimilarWeb, all social media sites account for 11.2 percent of traffic to nytimes.com. For CNN, while the search engine statistics are similar to the New York Times, the importance of social media is much lower at 5.5 percent.16 While these are just examples, a systematic study would likely show a distribution where some sites receive a great deal of referral traffic from search engines and social media, while others receive relatively little. Yet the point remains that there is little support for the notion that Facebook and Google are monopolistic gateways to news sites. For instance, Allcott & Gentzkow (2017) find top U.S. news sites received only 10.1 percent of their traffic from all social media sites and 30.6 percent from all search engines.17
Similarly, another justification for the bill involves a reference to a Pew Research Study to support the assertion that “the majority of Americans access news through only two platforms—Facebook and Google.”18 Yet, according to the cited Pew Research study, Facebook is not unique in the percentage of users who consume news while on any given social media platform (68 percent).19 For instance, both Twitter (74 percent) and Reddit (68 percent) have similar levels of news readership among their users. Additionally, the study states, “Getting news on social media doesn’t mean that other more traditional pathways to news are ignored.”  Additionally, “Facebook news users are more likely to often get news from local TV than those on YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat.” The fundamental error that is being made is to suggest that, because users of social media and search engines get news from those sites, that it is the only source of news for these users — or even that it is the most important source of news for these users. It ignores the reality of multi-homing — not just in terms of online sites (which is typically how multi-homing is considered) but in terms of across online and offline sources. Another Pew Research report indicates that, in 2017, 50 percent of Americans often get news from television, 43 percent from online, 25 percent from radio, and 18 percent from print media.20 Thus, again, the evidence does not support the assertion that Facebook and Google are monopolistic gateways for news outlets.
The Impact of Providing Antitrust Exemption to the Media Cartel
Put simply, the impact of the bill is to legalize a media cartel. The bill expressly allows the cartel to fix the price and set the terms of trade for all market participants. The clear goal is to transfer surplus from online platforms to news organizations, which will likely result in higher content costs for these platforms, as well as provisions that will stifle the ability to innovate. In turn, this could negatively impact quality for the users of these platforms.
Furthermore, a stated goal of the bill is to promote “quality” news and to “highlight trusted brands.”21 These are usually antitrust code words for favoring one group, e.g. those that are part of the News Media Alliance, while foreclosing others who are not “similarly situated.”22 What about the non-discrimination clause? Will it protect non-members from foreclosure? Again, a careful reading of the bill raises serious questions as to whether it will actually offer protection. The bill only ensures that the terms of the negotiations are available to all “similarly situated” news organizations. It is very easy to carve out provisions that would favor top tier members of the media cartel.
Additionally, an unintended consequence of antitrust exemptions can be that it makes the beneficiaries lax by insulating them from market competition and, ultimately, can harm the industry by delaying inevitable and difficult, but necessary, choices. There is evidence that this is what occurred with the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which provided antitrust exemption to geographically proximate newspapers for joint operations.23
There are very good reasons why antitrust jurisprudence reserves per se condemnation to the most egregious anticompetitive acts including the formation of cartels. Legislative attempts to circumvent the federal antitrust laws should be reserved solely for the most compelling justifications. There is little evidence that this level of justification has been met in this present circumstance.

22 For example, the agreement could exclude certain sites or organizations that do not meet some strict definition of “original” news or, similarly, sites that the cartel deems as purveyors of “fake news.” On its face, this could be justified as ensuing quality—yet, we should always be weary of quality measures defined and imposed by competitors.

865,"April 24, 2019","US: Academy leaves door open to Netflix, following DOJ warning","
Netflix and other streaming platforms won’t be banned from the Oscars as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has rejected calls from Steven Spielberg and others to restrict eligibility for the annual awards.
The Academy’s Board of Governors approved rules for the February 2020 Oscars and left the eligibility requirement unchanged. Just as before, feature-length films must be shown for at least one week in a Los Angeles County theater to be eligible, a requirement Netflix-backed movies such as Roma met on their way to winning awards. Proposals to require theater runs of at least four weeks were rejected.
The Academy was under pressure from the federal government to leave the rule unchanged. The US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division warned the Academy in a letter last month that shutting out streaming-only movies may violate antitrust law.
“In the event that the Academy—an association that includes multiple competitors in its membership—establishes certain eligibility requirements for the Oscars that eliminate competition without procompetitive justification, such conduct may raise antitrust concerns,” DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim told the Academy at the time.

Ianniello’s tenure has been marked by speculation the company would combine with Viacom, years after they were split apart. Both companies are controlled by the Redstone family, which has voiced on-again, off-again interest in merging the companies. Ianniello took over after longtime chief Les Moonves was ousted over allegations of sexual misconduct in September.

Antitrust Policy for Two-Sided Platforms: The Failure of American Express and the Path Forward
By John B. Kirkwood (Seattle University)
Two-sided platforms serve two sets of customers and enable them to interact with each other. The five most valuable corporations in America – Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft – all operate two-sided platforms. But despite their growing power, the Supreme Court made it more difficult to stop them from stifling competition. In American Express, the Court dismissed a challenge to Amex’s anti-steering provisions, which preclude merchants from steering their customers toward cheaper credit cards. Although these provisions suppress price competition on their face, the Court held that the plaintiffs had not shown that Amex had market power or that its conduct harmed consumers in the aggregate.
This article, the first comprehensive analysis of the decision, exposes the flaws in the Court’s reasoning. It shows that Amex did possess market power. Using a method I proposed in a recent article, it establishes that Amex’s conduct almost certainly enabled it to maintain its fees above the competitive level. It also shows, contrary to the Court’s analysis, that Amex’s repeated fee increases demonstrated market power. Finally, the Court was incorrect to insist that in a two-sided platform case, the relevant market must encompass both sides of the platform. That approach systematically unde...

Economists have long recognized that advertising has two main functions: To inform and to persuade. In the information age, the information function is obsolete, because consumers can get all the product information they want from a quick Google search. That makes virtually all advertising today purely persuasive in function. The courts have long recognized that purely persuasive advertising is anticompetitive, because it induces consumers to buy products that they do not really prefer, harming consumers and placing sellers of consumers’ preferred products at a competitive disadvantage.

Sainsbury’s attempt to buy the grocer , which would create the biggest UK supermarket chain, looked close to collapsein February after the regulator said in a provisional report that even with substantial store sales, the deal would likely mean higher prices and worse choice for shoppers. Sainsbury shares plunged the most in a decade on the report.
Since then, Sainsbury has offered to sellbetween 125 and 150 stores to a rival as it seeks to overcome the regulator’s hostility. If approved, the transaction would give the merged company more purchasing power to compete with the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as online upstarts.

870,"April 22, 2019",Don’t Break Up Big Tech Firms: Former Antitrust Regulator,"
By John Pecman, (former CCB Commissioner of Competition)
“The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.” That Japanese proverb — typically used to teach conformity — seems similar to the approach advocated by U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren in her recent call to “break up our biggest tech companies,” including Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
The Internet has been the foundation for those and some other tremendously successful companies. Consumer demand for innovative products and services has allowed these technology giants to realize rapid growth and also market preeminence.
Recent times have featured populist backlash against the scale and power of these data monopolies, concern over harmful online content or behavior, cybercrime, and political misinformation.
But breaking up large tech companies, as advocated by Sen. Warren and others, is a flawed solution. It overstates the consequences of being “big,” politicizes the role of competition regulators, and ultimately will hinder innovation and harm consumers.
Internationally, too, there is a growing call for government action to curb the strength of the tech giants. Most advanced economies are studying the adequacy of competition law over concerns about increasing market concentration in digital network sectors.

871,"April 22, 2019",Japan: Nissan to reject new Renault proposal?,"

Nissan Motor will reject a management integration proposal from French partner Renault and will call for an equal capital relationship, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, April 22, citing sources.
Nissan’s management feels the Japanese company has not been treated as an equal of Renault under existing capital ties, and a merger would make this inequality permanent, Nikkei wrote.
The outlook for the alliance, one of the world’s top automaking partnerships, has been in focus since the arrest in November of its main architect, Carlos Ghosn, for financial misconduct. The former Nissan and Renault chairman has denied the charges against him and has said he was the victim of a boardroom coup by Nissan executives opposed to closer ties.
Renault saved Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago and under their current capital alliance, the French company holds greater control over its much larger partner.

872,"April 22, 2019",US: Warren faces pushback over calls to break up Big Tech,"
Elizabeth Warren’s call to break up giant tech companies like Google and Facebook is facing some opposition in California, reported wbur.com.
This time, however, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate’s proposal to check Big Tech may complicate her relationship with a state that has traditionally been a cash cow for her. California is home to three of the four companies Warren has explicitly targeted in her plan: Apple, Facebook, and Google. The state is also rich in wealthy political donors and primary delegates alike.
The Massachusetts senator has sworn off courting wealthy donors in the Democratic primary. Although delegates are awarded proportionately, the rewards in terms of momentum for the presidential candidates are potentially huge, especially as California has bumped up its primary date to early March of 2020.
Lisa Gritzner, a Los Angeles political consultant who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Uber, says Warren’s proposal might play well with some on the “extreme ends” of the Democratic Party. But, she says it’s unlikely to do well with the majority of Californians who fall on both sides of the political spectrum.
“This is where people come to start their companies, their startups, their dreams,” Gritzner says. “And so the idea that all of a sudden somebody decides you’re too big or they don’t agree with the way you’re conducting your business and the government comes in and takes over — that’s not exactly the kind...

873,"April 22, 2019",US: Rent-A-Center settles with Vintage Capital,"
Rent-A-Center said Monday, April 22, it will be paid US$92.5 million as part of an agreement to end litigation over the Plano-based rent-to-own retailer’s surprise termination of its pending merger with Vintage Capital last year.
The agreement in principle to settle litigation with Vintage Capital and its financial partner B. Riley Financial will end a dispute that started last December.
Rent-A-Center terminated a pending merger after Vintage didn’t present it with an extension letter. The battle quickly moved into court. A Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in March that Rent-A-Center’s merger termination was valid even though Vintage showed that the two had agreed that the merger wouldn’t be completed until 2019 due to the both sides continuing to work on the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust review.
“We are pleased to finally conclude this matter, avoiding further litigation and providing certainty regarding payment of the termination fee,” Mitch Fadel, Rent-A-Center CEO, said in a statement. “We look forward to turning our sole and undivided attention to executing our strategic plan focused on growing our business and enhancing value for our stockholders.”

874,"April 21, 2019",UK: Ex-financial ombudsman Walter Merricks on why he took on MasterCard,"

Walter Merricks decided to take on the biggest class action in British history, believing millions of consumers had paid higher prices in shops for 16 years because of allegedly excessive transaction fees. “I thought, ‘Right. You’re on’,” the former financial ombudsman said.
Last week Merricks’s ambition was vindicated when the court of appeal ruled in his favor, meaning the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which had previously thrown out his claim, will have to reconsider it. The £14 billion (US$18.2 billion) claim is enormous – and could net about £300 (US$389.80) each for 46.2 million adults in the UK.
In 2007, the European Commission ruled that Visa and Mastercard had breached competition law by inflating charges on card transactions. Visa accepted the decision and, in one case in 2016, settled a £1.2 billion claim made by Tesco out of court.
But between 1992 and 2008, it is alleged that Mastercard imposed unlawful fees on transactions, which were then passed on to consumers via higher retail prices. Merricks calculated the total value of commerce in the UK in those 16 years and then worked out the difference, plus interest, had Mastercard been operating its scheme as instructed by the European commission.
As for what happens next with Mastercard, he is simply waiting. It is expected the company, which has a stock market valuation of US$246.9 billion, might offer a settlement rather than drag the case out for another four or five years. Merricks’s action w...

875,"April 21, 2019",Japan: Regulator plans periodic reviews of tech giants,"
The Japanese government intends to use antitrust law to require major tech players to submit to regular reviews, reported Nikkie. All this as part of an effort to keep them from taking advantage of the smaller companies they do business with, Nikkei has learned.
Currently, while the Japan Fair Trade Commission can conduct reviews of technology companies such as Amazon.com, these are sometimes hindered by such obstacles as nondisclosure agreements with third-party sellers. But Japan’s antimonopoly law lets the watchdog compel companies to cooperate, with financial penalties if they fail to comply or provide false information.
The government plans to use this provision to periodically examine the practices and services of big companies that operate e-commerce websites, app stores, and other platforms. Likely targets include Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, along with domestic players such as Rakutenand Yahoo Japan.
The move comes amid growing concern in Japan and abroad about potential harm to consumers and the competitive environment if tech giants are allowed to grow unchecked. The European Union has used antitrust law to tighten scrutiny of these companies, and Japan is following suit.

Technology groups such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.com will face stricter rules on handling personal information in Japan, which looks to use antitrust law to stop unfair trade-offs between privacy and free services, Nikkei has learned.
The government aims to draw up a plan for stronger regulation of so-called platform providers as early as midyear.
The policy will incorporate the concept of “abuse of a superior bargaining position,” which Japan has so far applied only to business-to-business relationships.
The government sees a broader interpretation of this feature of antitrust law as affording protection to consumers who lack the information or knowledge to engage fairly with Big Tech.

877,"April 18, 2019",US: Apple likely paid $6b in Qualcomm settlement,"
Apple probably paid Qualcomm between $5 billion and $6 billion to settle the litigation between the two companies, reported CNBC.
Apple probably also agreed to pay between $8 and $9 in patent royalties per iPhone, estimated UBS, based on Qualcomm’s guidance that it expects earnings per share to increase by $2 as a result of the settlement.
The UBS estimate suggests that Apple paid a high price to end a bitter legal battle that spanned multiple continents and threatened Apple’s ability to release a 5G iPhone and put pressure on Qualcomm’s licensing business model that contributes over half of the company’s profit.
The companies, which announced the settlement on Tuesday as a trial in one of their many legal disputes got underway, said that the settlement included a one-time payment from Apple to Qualcomm as well as a chipset supply agreement that suggested that future iPhones would use Qualcomm modem chips.

Apple’s and Qualcomm’s decision to end all litigation between them now raises the stakes in the Federal Trade Commission’s suit against against the chip manufacturer, reported Bloomberg Law.
A jury trial had started between the two companies April 15 in a federal court in San Diego but will no longer proceed since Apple agreed April 16 to give Qualcomm a one-time payment to settle a two-year dispute over patent royalty rates. Apple didn’t disclose the payment amount.
The next legal battle for Qualcomm is set to unfold in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide if Qualcomm violated antitrust laws by forcing companies to pay steep patent royalty rates.
US District Judge Lucy Koh’s opinion will play an even more critical role now that Apple and Qualcomm have settled, Eleanor Tyler, Bloomberg Law’s senior legal analyst, said.  “Every case that drops out makes her take on the issue more important,” she said.
Koh can now issue her opinion without fearing a clash with Qualcomm’s litigation with Apple , Thomas Cotter, professor at the University of Minnesota Law school, said. “The settlement now removes the possibility of conflicting opinions,” he said.

About 83pc of Commerzbank employees who took part in a staff survey are against a merger with Deutsche Bank, according to preliminary results of the poll seen by Reuters yesterday.
Germany’s two largest banks announced in March that they were in talks to merge, a tie-up that unions have said could result in the loss of 30,000 jobs.
Opposition to the proposed deal is stronger at Commerzbank than Deutsche Bank, where a similar survey showed nearly 70pc did not favour a tie-up. “Distance yourselves from the merger plans,” Commerzbank’s works council wrote in an open email to the bank’s management board with the results of the survey, taken during the fifth week of merger talks.
Employees’ opinions count in Germany because workers make up half of companies’ supervisory boards that usually are required to sign off on mergers.

ING Group has approached Commerzbank about a possible tie-up, a German magazine reported on Tuesday, April 16. Manager Magazin, citing unnamed sources, reported that ING made the approach to the German government, which owns a stake in the German lender, and to Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke. But Zielke declined to engage in formal talks, the report stated.
ING is the second European lender to show appetite for Commerzbank. In early April, the Financial Times reported that Italian rival UniCredit was preparing a rival bid to take control of Commerzbank should merger talks with Deutsche Bank collapse.
A person close to a large shareholder of Deutsche Bank told the Financial Times on Tuesday that the odds of a merger with Commerzbank were shrinking, given the complexity of a potential deal, resistance form staff unions, and the potential need to raise up to €10 billion (US$11.3 billion) of fresh equity. “The odds that a merger will happen have fallen from 80 to 60%,” that person said.

On Tuesday, April 16, the White House rejected requests from the House Judiciary Committee to submit documents regarding any discussions the administration had with the Justice Department over the AT&T-Time Warner merger, according to Bloomberg.
In a letter, White House counsel Pat Cipollone told Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (Democrat – New York) and Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Representative David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island) that the White House would not be supplying the documents that the lawmakers requested in a letter to the administration early last month.
Cipillone also wrote in his letter that “the president has an important role in the antitrust area” because of his constitutional duty to ensure the faithful execution of laws.
In a statement on Tuesday, Nadler and Cicilline said Cipollone “has made a blanket claim that all White House communications, regardless of whether they contain evidence of improper or even unlawful activities, are protected by a cone of secrecy.”

The concept of big data has captured the public’s attention primarily in regards to its privacy implications. However, the significance of big data in the competition sphere can no longer be ignored. Europe has been taking an increasingly aggressive stance in the big data realm — with multiple recent antitrust investigations into large technology companies and the passing of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation in 2018 — but companies in the United States must now pay attention. This article takes a multi-layered approach to analyzing the competition ramifications of big data, asserting that big data itself has developed into a competitive force within firms. Big data has become, for many firms, a product in and of itself, separate from the firms’ traditional products or services, and firms often believe that any big data they come to possess they can utilize without consideration.

I discuss the idea that digital advertising has evolved technologies that are intended to dismantle many early network effects in online advertising. I then discuss how new digital technologies have evolved to reduce switching costs for advertisers. Last, I discuss briefly the question of whether data can be thought of as an essential facility for advertising.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the most rapid shifts in the digital economy has been a shift in the regulatory approach of many governments, from a focus on protecting consumers from false claims in advertising to considering digital advertising in the context of antitrust discussions and policy.2
Given the fact that online advertising companies are in the “crosshairs” of antitrust authorities, it is important to examine where their market power (if any) originates. Critics suggest that a combination of network effects, switching costs, and access to large amounts of data would give economics-based explanations for the rise of digital advertising platforms, and that the combination of these factors means that such markets will not “self-correct.”3 In this essay, I evaluate the extent to which such claims hold up from an economics perspective.

885,"April 17, 2019",Advertising as Monopolization in the Information Age,"
By Ramsi A. Woodcock 
Economists have long recognized that advertising has two main functions: To inform and to persuade. In the information age, the information function is obsolete, because consumers can get all the product information they want from a quick Google search. That makes virtually all advertising today purely persuasive in function. The courts have long recognized that purely persuasive advertising is anticompetitive, because it induces consumers to buy products that they do not really prefer, harming consumers and placing sellers of consumers’ preferred products at a competitive disadvantage. Antitrust enforcers must respond to the obsolescence of the information function of advertising by treating advertising as a per se illegal form of monopolization under the Sherman Act.

CBS and Viacom have for over a year now been in on and off talks to once again merge according to a report from Fox Business. The two companies use to be one, but broke up into two companies in 2006, at the request of both boards. It is important to remember that both Viacom and CBS have the same controlling family: the Redstone family. Talks broke down last year, but since that happened the former CBS CEO has left and six board members have been replaced,
Now it looks like the Redstone family has cleared the way for a possible CBS and Viacom merger once again. Last year CPI reported that the Redstone family had dropped a condition to make Viacom’s current CEO the number 2 in control of the company after a merger. That reportedly cleared a major obstacle to the merger now with new CBS board members it once again looks like a merger may happen.
This push to make media companies like Viacom and CBS larger is not just about cord cutting. There is a growing number of content providers such as Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Amazon creating original programs enjoyed by cord cutters and cable subscribers alike. To help fight back from a shrinking viewership content, companies are hoping to grow their footprint through mergers like this one.

According to Reuters, the eCommerce giant would offer the free music service through its Echo speakers, and it could launch as early as this week. Amazon already offers its Prime Music service as part of its Prime subscription service at US$119 per year, as well as Amazon Music Unlimited subscriptions for US$9.99 a month, or US$7.99 per month for Prime members.
Earlier this month, Apple Music surpassed Spotify in the number of paid subscribers it has in the United States, with Apple Music boasting 28 million paid subscribers compared to Spotify’s 26 million, as of February.
Apple Music also has a growth rate of around 2.6% to 3% to Spotify’s monthly rate of about 1.5% to 2%. Spotify still has more paid subscribers worldwide, and users in general, as it has a free option that’s ad-supported. Apple Music does not offer a free option.

The Kuala Lumpur High Court had, in December last year, reinstated the Commission’s decision to impose the fine on the two airlines after allowing MyCC’s judicial review to challenge the decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which had earlier set aside myCC’s fine on the two airlines.
At the time, High Court Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan said the CAT’s decision of allowing the appeal by Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia to set aside MyCC’s fine was tainted with error of law and unreasonableness.
Following the High Court’s ruling, the two airlines filed an appeal to the appellate court. The hearing date on their appeal was fixed by the Court of Appeal’s registry on Tuesday, April 16, said MyCC’s lawyer Datuk Lim Chee Wee.

Publicis is set to buy data-driven marketing agency Epsilon in the French ad giant’s biggest acquisition to date.
The deal with Alliance Data Systems Corporation will entail Publicis acquiring its Epsilon business for a net purchase price of US$3.95 billion after a tax step-up, with a total cash consideration of US$4.4 billion. Publicis will form a strategic partnership with Alliance Data’s remaining business.
The deal comes as the advertising industry reckons with the huge growth of digital advertising and the emergence of players like Facebook and Google. Digital ad spending was expected to surpass traditional ad spending in the US for the first time this year, according to eMarketer, which also expects digital to account for more than two-thirds of all media spending by 2023.
The acquisition gives Publicis access to Epsilon’s data capabilities. The company reports, for example, it has more than 250 million unique consumers identified in the US. The company states says it can build on top of a client’s first-party data with its own assets, like behavioral and transactional data.

German prosecutors have brought charges against former Volkswagen (VW) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn over his role in the diesel emissions-cheating scandal. Four other managers were also indicted in the case.
They “are accused of multiple crimes realized in a single criminal action, especially a particularly serious case of fraud and an infraction of the law against unfair competition,” prosecutors in Braunschweig said.
They have accused Winterkorn, 71, of a “particularly serious” fraud. The prosecutors said he failed to stop the practice, resulting in “significantly higher” fines against Volkswagen in Europe and the United States. He was also charged with embezzlement and violating competition law.
Winterkorn, who became VW’s chief executive in 2007, resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles broke in 2015. VW admitted four years ago that it had fitted as many as 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide with the software that could cheat emissions tests. In 2016, the company agreed to a US$14.7 billion settlement with the US.
The automaker’s former boss claims that he was unaware of the issue until shortly before it became public. If found guilty, he could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years.

892,"April 15, 2019",Japan: Gov against Renault-Nissan merger?,"
The Japanese government intervened to block any potential merger plans between Nissan Motor and Renault in spring last year, French newspaper Journal Du Dimanche (JDD) reported on Sunday, April 14, citing email messages between executives and state officials.
The emails dating from April 23 to May 22, 2018, show that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry weighed in to stop any merger discussions between the two carmakers, JDD reported, without saying how it got access to the messages, which were either addressed directly to former Renault-Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn or in which he was copied as one of the recipients.
JDD reported that the first of the emails came from Nissan executive Hari Nada following a meeting in which his Renault counterpart Mouna Sehperi, and Martin Vial, the head of France’s public body for state holdings APE, were also present.
Nada’s email said that Nissan favors a status quo in the alliance, and would later prefer a “re-balancing of the shareholding” with Renault decreasing its stake in Nissan and Nissan boosting its own in Renault, while the French state would ultimately pull out of the alliance completely. APE’s Vial is reported as signaling that the French government couldn’t accept “too big a sacrifice for Renault” unless a merger is set in motion, JDD reports.

893,"April 15, 2019",US: Jury selection begins in Apple and Qualcomm antitrust suit,"
Jury selection began Monday, April 15, in a case between technology giants Apple and Qualcomm, with Apple seeking billions over what it claims are exorbitant and unfair fees Qualcomm allegedly charged for the use of Qualcomm chips in iPhones.
The trial slated to begin this week in San Diego federal court is the latest in a string of legal battles between the two companies.
Apple is accusing Qualcomm of charging excessive royalties for Qualcomm’s hardware featured in older iPhone models. The iPhone maker says that despite Qualcomm supplying only some components used in iPhones, the San Diego- based mobile chip company has sought money based on the total cost of each phone.

894,"April 14, 2019",China: Ericsson confirms it’s under antitrust investigation,"
Sweden-based telecoms manufacturer Ericsson confirmed to the Global Times on Sunday that it is being investigated by Chinese market regulators over complaints against its intellectual property rights (IPR) licensing practices in the country.
Ericsson said that it is fully cooperating with the investigation and will refrain from further comment while the probe is ongoing.
“We license our industry leading patents portfolio on FRAND (Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory) terms and conditions and have always been committed to these FRAND principles,” Ericsson said.
The response came after ijiwei.com, an industry website, reported on Sunday that China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) recently launched a “surprise investigation” at Ericsson’s Beijing office, as Chinese mobile phone makers have complained that Ericsson violated the anti-monopoly law in the 3G and 4G standard essential patents (SEPs) licensing market in China.

895,"April 14, 2019",US: Apple and Qualcomm’s global fight heads to court,"

Monday, April 15, Apple and Qualcomm will face off in San Diego federal court. About US$30 billion will be at stake in what could be one of the biggest US corporate lawsuits, reported the Financial Times. 
Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, is expected to give testimony in a four-week trial in a federal court in which the iPhone maker and four companies in its supply chain are suing Qualcomm for up to US$27 billion in damages for overcharged chip royalties. Qualcomm, which has denied wrongdoing, is seeking at least US$7 billion in back-payments from Apple and its suppliers in addition to billions in damages.
According to the Wall Street Journal, there isn’t much of a personal relationship between the CEOs of both firms. As a result of the animosity between Apple’s Tim Cook and Qualcomm’s Steve Mollenkopf, there seems to be no common ground for settlement talks.
Apple states Qualcomm should also repay US$3.1 billion associated with patents whose rights Apple claims are exhausted. It has already won a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm should pay nearly US$1 billion in withheld rebates.
Qualcomm, in return, estimates that Apple’s partners—Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal Electronics—owe more than US$7.5 billion in unpaid royalties. And it contends that Apple, which reimburses the manufacturers’ royalty payments, should be liable for a doubled penalty that would take the total to US$15 billion or more.

Merck announced Friday, April 12, it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Versum Materials in a deal with an enterprise value of US$6.6 billion, according to a MarketWatch news release.
Merck will pay US$53 per Versum share in cash, the company said in a statement. Versum’s board has terminated its merger agreement with Entegris on the grounds that the Merck offer is superior.
The deal will be financed with cash on hand and debt via a facilities agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas Fortis, and Deutsche Bank.
The company initiated a hostile takeover after Versum initially stated it wasn’t interested in a deal. Shares in Versum have consistently traded above US$48, signaling that investors were expecting a higher price.

897,"April 14, 2019",What Democratic Contenders Are Missing in the Race to Revive Antitrust,"
By John Newman (Former attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division)
Antitrust law has recently emerged as a critical issue among Democratic presidential contenders. Senator Elizabeth Warren threw down the gauntlet with her ambitious plan to overhaul antitrust law’s treatment of technology platforms and appoint enforcers who would break up tech giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Senator Amy Klobuchar quickly responded with her own call to investigate whether such breakups are warranted. Retweeting Warren, Representative Tulsi Gabbard promised to introduce similar legislation in the House of Representatives. Pressed for a response to Warren, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg conceded that high levels of market concentration should “set off alarms.”
But every proposal to date—from Buttigieg’s comparatively tepid observation to Warren’s more sweeping plan—overlooks a key fact. At the end of the day, legal decisions are made by judges.
The new ideas being promoted by Democratic contenders are, to be sure, a breath of fresh air. Antitrust may seem an unlikely candidate for the spotlight, but its growing popular appeal reflects mounting concern over corporate power and consolidation. The U.S. antitrust community has long been insular and homogenized, its thinking dominated by the conservative Chicago School of law and economics. Today, we are left with a narrow, technocratic status quo that assumes markets usually work and antitrust enforcem...

Italy’s biggest commercial broadcaster Mediaset agreed on Friday, April 12, to cancel the sale of pay-tv assets to Sky’s Italian unit following a probe from the country’s antitrust regulator that showed the deal could affect competition, reported Reuters.
Mediaset announced in November it was selling its digital terrestrial pay-tv platform, known as R2, to Sky as part of a broader content agreement between the two broadcasters. A source close to the deal said Sky paid €23 million (US$26 million).
But the deal was subject to unconditional approval from Italy’s competition watchdog, which last month announced it was looking into the accord as it could affect competition in the domestic pay-TV market, where Sky is already the dominant player.
The companies said in a joint statement they considered it unlikely the watchdog would approve the deal without setting conditions and therefore the platform would return to Mediaset.

899,"April 14, 2019",Germany: Regulator probes more Mercedes emissions software,"
Germany’s motor vehicle authority KBA is investigating Daimler on suspicion that 60,000 Mercedes cars were fitted with software aimed at tricking emissions tests, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday, April 14.
A spokesman for Daimler, owner of Mercedes-Benz, said the carmaker was reviewing the facts and fully cooperating with the KBA.
Bild am Sonntag reported the KBA was looking into suspicious software in Mercedes-Benz GLK 220 CDI cars produced between 2012 and 2015, after tests showed they only meet emissions limits when a certain function is activated.
Since rival Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating US emissions tests, the scandal has spread to other carmakers. Daimler has ordered the recall of 3 million vehicles to fix excess emissions coming from their diesel engines.

Newspapers are fundamental to the functioning of American democracy and they’re under threat like never before, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said Friday.
That’s why he’s calling on Ohio’s congressional delegation to support a bill that would grant the industry “temporary cartel” status to negotiate rates with massive social media platforms that now are using newspaper content for free.
“In the marketplace of ideas, big tech is going behind the counter and taking the product off the shelf and walking out the door without paying for it,” Yost said.
The proposal is sponsored by US House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Dave Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, and House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Georgia. It would create a four-year window for newspapers to combine for the purpose of negotiating rates to change the tech giants to use newspaper content.

CVC Capital Partners and Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos Itau are among the groups interested in an LPG distribution unit put on the block by Brazil’s Petrobras, reported Reuters.
Petroleo Brasileiro, as the state-controlled oil company is formally known, expects interested parties to sign confidentiality agreements, the first step to participate in the sale process of Liquigas Distribuidora, by April 19.
Petrobras had agreed in 2016 to sell Liquigas Distribuidora to local rival Ultrapar Participacoes in a 2.8 billion-real ($720 million) deal, that was blocked by Brazil’s antitrust watchdog CADE in February 2018.
The rules, revised earlier this week, demand from rivals with more than 10% of market share in the Brazilian LPG distribution market cannot have a stake in the consortium that is higher than 30% of Liquigas’ revenue.

The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) announced on Thursday, April 11, that it will investigate whether Apple abuses its position in the App Store by, for example, giving preferential treatment to its own apps.
The ACM suggested the investigation may be expanded to Google’s Play Store in future because of similar business practices by the company, reported Reuters. Both services are lucrative businesses for Apple and Google.
The investigation was triggered by Dutch apps for news media which provided indications of possible anti-competitive behavior by the iPhone maker during the agency’s study into app stores, the ACM stated.
“ACM will investigate, among other aspects, whether Apple acted in violation of the prohibition of abuse of dominance, for example, by giving preferential treatment to its own apps,” the Dutch enforcer said in a statement.

Tronox has reached a settlement with US antitrust enforcers that will allow it to move forward with its purchase of much of Cristal’s titanium dioxide business, the Federal Trade Commission announced on Wednesday, April 10.
The company valued the deal at US$1.673 billion when it was announced in February 2017. Under the terms of the settlement, Tronox has agreed to sell facilities in Ashtabula, Ohio which make titanium dioxide. It had previously valued the assets at US$700 million, and a British company, INEOS Enterprises AG, agreed to buy the plants.
The FTC stated in December 2017 that it would go to court to block the deal, arguing that the companies are two of the three top suppliers of chloride process titanium dioxide.
“(Titanium dioxide) is an ingredient in many products used by consumers,” said Bureau of Competition Director Bruce Hoffman. “This agreement will preserve a competitive marketplace, which ultimately benefits consumers in the form of lower prices and higher quality products.” reported Reuters.

Japan’s trade watchdog is investigating the operators of three travel booking websites on suspicion that they pressured hotels and other accommodations they deal with to offer prices that were equal to, or lower than, those on other websites.
The subjects of the investigation are the Japanese units of the US-based Expedia and the Dutch-based Booking.com, as well as Japanese IT firm Rakuten, which operates Rakuten Travel.
The Japan Fair Trade Commission suspects that the practices could constitute unfair transactions in violation of the Antimonopoly Act.
Rakuten issued a statement saying it is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Earlier, the commission began investigations of the global tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, looking into whether the firms that operate service platforms for information networks and e-commerce are forcing domestic businesses into unfair deals.

Filmmakers Collaborative SF launched a new film highlighting a successful antitrust action brought by the US Department of Justice against Google, Apple, eBay, and other major technology companies in 2009.
Entitled, “When Rules Don’t Apply,” the 28-minute free film explores the “no-poach” wage suppression agreement that swept Silicon Valley from 2005 to 2015, and the legal battles that challenged these practices. The practice involved leading tech CEOs, including Apple’s Steve Jobs and Google’s Eric Schmidt, who secretly agreed not to recruit one another’s employees, thus restricting employee job opportunities and limiting employee wages. The 2013 class action lawsuit brought on behalf of 64,000 employees resulted in a US$435 million settlement in 2014.
This project was made possible by a grant from the eBay Settlement Fund. Created as a result of antitrust litigation pursued by the Attorney General of the State of California, the purpose of the Fund is to enhance Californians’ ability to gain technology related skills, education, and employment.

According to the Financial Times, Manfred Weber, a German MEP and “lead candidate” for the European People’s Party wants the next European Commission to behave “more politically” when making key decisions over merger rules and state-aid.
Brussels should be ready to make “political” use of its powerful competition rules to foster the creation of European industrial champions, according to the center-right candidate who is running to be the next European Commission president.
“We have to behave more politically because China is behaving more politically”, Mr Weber said at an event in Brussels, co-hosted by the Financial Times and the Bruegel think-tank. The German conservative said he would propose a change to EU competition rules to create exemptions in “special cases” where mergers would result in the creation of European champions.
His comments come after Margrethe Vestager, Brussels’ current competition chief, blocked a tie up between Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom rail manufacturers earlier this year.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), The Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC), the Association of in-house competition lawyers (ICLA), and the United States Council for International Business (USCIB) have announced approval of the International Competition Network (ICN) Framework for Competition Agency Procedures (CAP).
ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said, “Robust procedural guarantees are an essential part of any antitrust enforcement regime.  For many years ICC has promoted strengthening of due process principles. The CAP initiative is a great step in the right direction.”
The CAP highlights and reinforces important due process principles in competition law investigations such as transparency and predictability, confidentiality, conflict of interest, representation by counsel, appropriate notice, privilege, independent review, and reasonable time period for investigations. Competition agencies, businesses, and consumers around the globe, all stand to gain from reinforcement of these core principles.
The CAP’s endorsement of non-discrimination in antitrust enforcement is key in today’s global marketplace and addresses a pertinent issue at the interface of competition law and trade law.

Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (known as Petrobras) released new rules for companies that intend to bid for its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidiary Liquigas Distribuidora, reported Reuters.
Hoping to increase the number of companies bidding, Petrobras reduced the amount of revenue a rival can have compared to Liquigas sales, when in a consortium.
Two weeks ago, Petrobras announced that rivals with more than 10% of market share in the Brazilian LPG distribution market cannot have a stake in the consortium that is higher than 40% of Liquigas’ revenue.
But according to new rules included in the documents filed on Tuesday, rivals may not have a stake in the consortium higher than 30% of Liquigas revenue, in an attempt to lure more participants to any potential consortium.
Restrictions for rivals are aimed at keeping antitrust authorities from blocking a deal, which happened in Petrobras’ first attempt to sell Liquigas in 2017.

According to a report from Reuters, Qualcomm lost its EU General Court bid challenging a regulator request for more information related to an antitrust probe.
The world’s no. 1 chipmaker had already provided the information after being ordered to pay a daily fine for withholding it, but the Luxembourg-based General Court’s ruling is expected to strengthen the Commission’s hand in future similar cases.
Qualcomm has been under the EU spotlight since 2015, when it was accused of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 aimed at forcing out British phone software maker Icera, subsequently bought by Nvidia Corp.
As part of the investigation, the Commission in January 2017 told Qualcomm to provide more information. The company said the request went beyond the investigation’s scope and took its grievance to the General Court.
While waiting for a judgment, Qualcomm however acceded to the EU demand to avoid a daily €580,000 (US$655,000) penalty for its delayed response.
The Luxembourg-based court on Tuesday, April 9, dismissed the company’s case.

Lawyers from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan are fighting an attempt by their former client, Uber, to disqualify the firm from pursuing antitrust claims against it by a former rival ride-hailing app, reported Law.com.
Uber’s current lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher filed a motion in February to disqualify Quinn Emanuel from representing SC Innovations, the successor to the defunct Sidecar ride-sharing company. Uber contends that Quinn Emanuel represented it in at least 20 cases from 2012 to 2016 that delved into competition issues like the Sidecar case. The company also claimed that Quinn Emanuel lawyers had access to confidential Uber information.
But in opposition papers filed March 15, Quinn Emanuel lawyers said that there was no evidence that the firm’s prior work for Uber was “substantially related” to its work for Sidecar and that the firm has never been in possession of confidential information that would bar its participation in the antitrust suit against Uber.
“When the actual evidence is examined, the only reasonable conclusion is there is no basis to deprive Sidecar of its chosen counsel,” wrote the Quinn lawyers, including Robert Feldman and Claude Stern in the firm’s Redwood Shores, California, office, and Ethan Glass and Michael Bonanno in Washington, DC.
The Quinn Emanuel lawyers filed suit on behalf of Sidecar’s successor late last year, claiming that Uber is a “monopolist” in the ride-hailing market. They claimed that Uber stol...

German electronics company Bury has asked European Union antitrust regulators to investigate Nokia’s licensing practices on patents essential to car communications, the second such complaint after Daimler.
While companies with key patents are expected to offer these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, the lack of clear rules on calculating license fees and terms inevitably lead to disputes when companies fail to agree on the charges reported Reuters.
Bury, a family-owned company with production plants in Germany, Poland, and Mexico, announced it had filed a complaint to the European Commission.
“Nokia refuses to license mobile components. Instead, Nokia insists on indirect licensing of the entire vehicle,” Bury said in a statement.

Europe needs to decide on a digital tax and should lead the way if there is insufficient consensus globally, the EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said on Monday, 8 April.
There is still disagreement among EU members over how to implement a so-called “GAFA tax”—named after Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon—to ensure the global internet giants pay a fair share of taxes on their massive business operations in Europe.
“Europe wants to do this together but we haven’t been able to agree,” the Danish commissioner told French radio station France Inter in Paris. “And I find it’s important that each member state that wants to do something, now do something.”
Several EU countries like France and Britain have moved on with plans to launch a digital tax at the national level, prompting pushback from the United States. Talks on a joint approach have moved to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with a goal of reaching a global solution by the end of 2020.

913,"April 8, 2019",EU: EC fines General Electric in LM Wind merger case,"
The European Union announced Monday, April 8, it has fined US engineering giant General Electric €52 million (US$58.6 million) for providing incorrect information during a probe into its merger with LM Wind Power.
But the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, stated the decision, taken under competition rules, has no impact on its 2017 approval of the merger with the Danish supplier.
“The fine imposed today on General Electric is proof that the Commission takes breaches of the obligation for companies to provide us with correct information very seriously,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The Commission stated said “an overall fine of USD 58.4 million is both deterrent and proportionate” calling GE’s breach of its obligations a “serious infringement.”
In January 2017, when GE notified the Commission of its merger plans, it stated said it was not developing any offshore wind turbine more powerful than an existing six megawatt turbine.
But the Commission announced it had learned from a third party, which it did not identify, that GE was offering a 12-megawatt offshore wind turbine to potential customers. General Electric subsequently withdrew its notification and resubmitted its plans with “complete information,” the Commission stated.

914,"April 8, 2019",Saudi Arabia: Gov denies it threatened to strip the US dollar from oil trading,"
Saudi Arabia on Monday, April 8, denied a report that the kingdom is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the US dollar if American lawmakers pass legislation targeting OPEC.
Reuters reported last week that the Saudis had raised the issue within OPEC and with US officials. Most crude oil is traded in US dollars, and selling crude in other currencies could chip away at the greenback’s dominant role in the international financial system.
On Monday, the Kingdom called the report inaccurate, saying it does “not reflect Saudi Arabia’s position on this matter.”
“The Kingdom has been trading its oil in dollars for decades which has served well the objectives of its financial and monetary policies,” the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources said in a statement.
According to Reuters, the plan to marginalize the dollar in oil trading was a response to potential passage of the bipartisan No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act in Congress. The so-called NOPEC legislation would enable the Justice Department to sue OPEC for coordinating production.

915,"April 8, 2019",UK: CMA clears RWE purchase of stake in E.ON,"

Britain’s Competition Markets Authority (CMA) announced on Monday, April 8, it had cleared German utility RWE’s purchase of rival E.ON’s renewables business and nuclear electricity generation assets, reported Reuters.
Under the deal, RWE will take a 16.7% minority stake in E.ON.
“The CMA has decided, on the information currently available to it, not to refer the following merger to a Phase 2 investigation under the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002,” the CMA said in a statement. When a merger is referred for a Phase 2 investigation, the CMA has to decide whether the merger could result in a substantial decrease in competition.
In February, RWE won antitrust approval from the European Commission for the deal, after it found the transaction would not raise competition concerns.

916,"April 8, 2019",US: Apple Music subscriptions surpass Spotify,"
Apple Music has overtaken Spotify in the number of paid subscribers it has in the United States, according to reports.
Apple Music had 28 million paid subscribers to Spotify’s 26 million, as of February 2019. Apple Music also has a growth rate of around 2.6% to 3%, compared to Spotify’s monthly rate of about 1.5% to 2%.
Spotify still has more paid subscribers worldwide, and users in general, as it has a free option that’s ad-supported. Apple Music does not offer a free option.
Spotify has 207 million users worldwide, 96 million of which pay for the service. Apple Music has 50 million worldwide.
However, Apple Music is also growing faster globally at 2.4% to 2.8% versus Spotify’s 2 to 2.3%. Apple Music’s biggest momentum comes in other English-speaking places where iPhone use is high and iTunes was popular. It’s also available on Android devices, and it’s been installed 40 million times from the Google Play store, according to app-tracking firm Sensor Tower.
The figures of paid subscribers do not count those in trial offerings, either. Apple was predicted to surpass Spotify about six months ago, but Spotify started aggressively pushing back  to maintain its lead. It pushed out a few different promotions, including a partnership with Hulu and discounted pricing.
The company also filed an antitrust complaint against Apple over what it calls abusive control of the App Store, and claimed that it uses the store to its own advantage.

The pizza chain filed a series of motions April 5 urging a Kentucky federal judge to toss three proposed class actions seeking to invalidate the provisions, which prohibit franchise operators from soliciting or hiring employees working for Papa John’s or another one of its franchises.
In September, Papa John’s stated it will no longer enforce “no-poaching” pacts that require their franchisees not to hire away each other’s employees, under the terms of settlements filed in court by Washington State’s attorney general.

La senadora estadounidense y aspirante a la presidencia Elizabeth Warren anunció una nueva propuesta de ley que facilitaría la acusación penal de ejecutivos y empresarios cuando sus compañías violen los datos personales de ciudadanos estadounidenses.
La Ley de Responsabilidad del Ejecutivo Corporativo es otro impulso de Warren, que ha centrado gran parte de su campaña presidencial en responsabilizar a las corporaciones y a sus líderes por su dominio del mercado y la corrupción percibida. El proyecto de ley, si se aprueba, ampliará la responsabilidad penal de los ejecutivos “negligentes” de corporaciones (que ganan más de $ 1 mil millones) cuando cometen delitos, violan las leyes federales repetidamente o dañan a un gran número de estadounidenses por violaciones a los derechos civiles, incluidas Su privacidad de los datos.
“Cuando un criminal en la calle le roba dinero de su billetera, van a la cárcel. Cuando los propietarios de pequeñas empresas engañan a sus clientes, van a la cárcel ”, escribió Warren en el Washington Post publicado el miércoles por la mañana. “Pero cuando los ejecutivos corporativos de las grandes empresas supervisan los enormes fraudes que afectan a decenas de miles de personas, a menudo consiguen salirse con pagos multimillonarios”.

Two years after the EU began investigating whether Valve uses regional pricing and geo-blocking practices in its Steam store, the European Commission has formally charged the distributor and five game publishers.
The Commission released its “preliminary view” thatValve, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax prevented consumers from purchasing videogames cross-border from some Member States. That’s considered geo-blocking, and it violates EU competition rules.
“In a true Digital Single Market, European consumers should have the right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where they live in the EU. Consumers should not be prevented from shopping around between Member States to find the best available deal. Valve and the five PC video game publishers now have the chance to respond to our concerns,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Valve responded to the statements of objections in a new press release. According to Valve, the Commission’s charges do not relate to the sale of PC games on Steam and instead hinges on their activation keys. Specifically, that said keys “enabled geo-blocking by providing Steam activation keys and upon the publishers’ request locking those keys to particular territories.”
However, Valve asserts that they provide Steam keys for free and do not receive any share of the purchase price when a game is sold by third-party re-sellers.

Judge Richard Leon is reviewing a DOJ settlement last fall that allowed the merger after the companies agreed to sell off assets related to Medicare drug coverage.
“This is a matter of great consequence to a lot of people,” Judge Leon said during a brief court hearing. Health care “is a high priority issue for tens of millions of families,” he added. The judge, a George W. Bush appointee, last December said he was concerned the department hadn’t adequately addressed broader potential competitive harms raised by the merger.

The European Commission has formally accused BMW, VW, and Daimler of colluding to impede the rollout of emissions limiting technology. These companies—whose car brands include Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche, and BMW—are said to have limited and delayed the use of tech that would have reduced the emissions of diesel and petrol cars.
Regulators accused the carmakers of colluding at their annual “circle of five” technical meetings, which are attended by BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and its subsidiary brands Audi and Porsche.
The Commission claimed that one of the technologies affected by the scheme would have reduced harmful nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars.
The Statement of Objections issued Friday, April 5, comes a year and a half after EU authorities first raided the offices of the three companies over reports of possible collusion.
The EU’s Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that while collaboration to improve products is allowed, “EU competition rules do not allow [companies] to collude on exactly the opposite: not to improve their products, not to compete on quality.”
With this statement of objections now released, BMW, VW, and Daimler will have a chance to review the European Commission’s findings and respond to them before the authority comes to a final decision.

The kingdom stated the option had been discussed internally by senior Saudi energy officials in recent months. Two of the sources said the plan had been discussed with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil policy said Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior US energy officials.
The chances of the US bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through, reported Reuters.

Under the plan, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and LATAM Airlines Group would buy Avianca Brasil’s airport rights, known as slots, in three high-traffic terminals in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Gol and LATAM already control over two-thirds of the slots in each of those airports.

924,"April 7, 2019",Why antitrust relief can help newspapers,"
By The News Media Alliance
News consumption is growing exponentially, but for the past decade, the revenue to news publishers has been on a decline. This is, in large part, because of the unbalanced relationship between news publishers and tech platforms. But that relationship could be changing thanks to the recent re-introduction of the “Journalism Competition and Preservation Act” by House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, and House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Gainesville.
The bill, which would provide news publishers a safe harbor in which to collectively negotiate with platforms like Google and Facebook, could help news producers receive the fair distribution and monetization terms we’ve long been fighting to get from the duopoly.
Because of their market dominance – and access to billions of users – the major tech platforms set the rules for news publishers and determine how journalism is displayed, prioritized and monetized. They also capture the vast majority of all digital advertising dollars because of their unique ability to collect consumer data across the web.
All of this has degraded the relationship between news readers and publishers and rewarded low quality “clickbait” over quality information from real journalists. It has also greatly reduced the financial ability of publishers to invest in newsrooms at a time when our society most needs great, substantive reporting.
It is simply not possible ...

925,"April 4, 2019",EU: Changes to antitrust enforcement on Big Tech urged bu report,"

According to a report from the Financial Times, Google, Amazon, Facebook and other major technology companies could face fresh antitrust challenges after an EU report recommended sweeping changes to how the bloc enforces its competition rules.
The report, published on Thursday, April 4, could also lead to more companies being deemed “dominant” and therefore subject to stricter rules about the services they provide and the prices they charge.
It was commissioned by EU competition enforcer Margrethe Vestager and written by three academics known as “special advisers.”
The 133-page report, titled “Competition policy for the digital era,” stated, “There is a reasonable concern that dominant digital firms have strong incentives to engage in anti-competitive behaviour . . . They require vigorous competition policy enforcement and justify adjustments to the way competition law is applied.”
The academics—Heike Schweitzer, professor of law at the Humboldt University of Berlin, Jacques Crémer, professor of economics at the Toulouse School of Economics, and Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, assistant professor of data science at Imperial College London— said Europe’s antitrust law framework is “sound and sufficiently flexible,” but recommended applying the rules differently in the future in order to act more quickly in fast-moving markets.
Ms Vestager said the report was “full of important insights into the way markets are changing,  and full of valuable ...

926,"April 4, 2019",US: Warren bill would jail execs for consumer data violations,"
On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced a new piece of legislation that would make it easier to criminally charge company executives when Americans’ personal data is breached.
The Corporate Executive Accountability Act is yet another push from Warren who has focused much of her presidential campaign on holding corporations and their leaders responsible for both their market dominance and perceived corruption. The bill, if approved, would widen criminal liability of “negligent” executives of corporations (that make more than $1 billion) when they commit crimes, repeatedly break federal laws, or harm a large number of Americans by way of civil rights violations, including their data privacy.
“When a criminal on the street steals money from your wallet, they go to jail. When small-business owners cheat their customers, they go to jail,” Warren wrote in a Washington Postop-ed published on Wednesday morning. “But when corporate executives at big companies oversee huge frauds that hurt tens of thousands of people, they often get to walk away with multimillion-dollar payouts.”
One of Warren’s first significant policy proposals focused on the market power of big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, and she suggested that, if elected president, she would work to break up the companies through antitrust law.

According to the Financial times, 250 Commerzbank staff gathered in central Stuttgart, brandishing placards in protest against the lender’s talks to merge with its rival Deutsche Bank. “We are convinced that we can thwart the merger,” Stefan Wittmann, a union representative and member of Commerzbank’s supervisory board, said at the protest.
Led by Germany’s 2m-member service sector union Verdi, the 78,000 domestic employees of both lenders are cranking up resistance to a deal that could put almost half of those jobs on the line.
Due to the crucial role unions play in Germany’s consensus-driven corporate culture, the workers’ protests are more than merely background noise to a transformative deal that would create the eurozone’s second-biggest bank with €1.8tn in assets and €845bn of deposits.
Over the coming days, Verdi will stage one-day walkouts in all major German cities including Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt and Cologne. Formally, the temporary strikes are about the unresolved wage negotiations in the sector, according to the FT.

Attorney General Bob Ferguson  announced the process for consumers to obtain their share of a nearly $40 million recovery. The recovery is a result of the Attorney General’s price-fixing lawsuit against seven manufacturers of cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, which is the technology common in televisions and computer monitors prior to the introduction of LCD flat screens.
Hundreds of thousands of Washingtonians are eligible for restitution because they purchased old box-style television and computer monitors during the period of the conspiracy.
Individuals who lived in Washington from 1995 to 2007 and purchased a CRT television or computer monitor were likely harmed by the alleged price-fixing scheme and will receive restitution if they file a valid claim. Businesses headquartered in Washington during the conspiracy period may also be eligible.
To file a claim, visit www.crtsettlement.atg.wa.gov to fill out a form, or call 800-332-9084. All claims must be submitted on or before May 16, 2019.
The amount consumers and businesses could expect to receive will vary depending on the products purchased and the total number of claims filed. The maximum is $20 per CRT monitor and $6 per CRT television. Consumers who purchased multiple CRT monitors and televisions during the conspiracy can receive restitution for each device.

According to a report by CNBC, the EU aims to announce whether Amazon’s data practices will be investigated further in the coming months, the institution’s competition chief said.
In September, Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in Europe, opened a preliminary probe into Amazon’s use of data on its third-party merchants. The idea was to assess the dual role of the e-commerce giant, given that it hosts, but also competes against these other merchants. There are concerns that Amazon could be using sensitive information about its competitors’ products to its own advantage.
Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Vestager said that the investigation is now at an “advanced” stage. “A lot of businesses have taken time and effort to give us data to answer our questions. So, we very carefully go through this. But as I said we are advanced, and I hope that we can sort of conclude the first phase within this mandate,” she said.
Vestager is due to end her mandate as the EU’s competition chief in October.

Local publishers of online news would gain an ability to band together to negotiate with dominant online platforms such as Facebook and Google under a legislative proposal introduced Wednesday, April 3, by US Representative David N. Cicilline.
The proposed “safe harbor” aims to improve the accessibility and quality of online news by giving small publishers a period of four years to collectively negotiate with online giants under a specific set of conditions, according a news release issued by Cicilline’s office. The legislation provides an opportunity for the publishers to collectively negotiate the terms under which their content is distributed.
“The free press is a cornerstone of our democracy,” said Cicilline. “Journalists keep the public informed, root out corruption, and hold the powerful accountable. This bill will provide a much-needed lifeline to local publishers who have been crushed by Google and Facebook. It’s about time we take a stand on this issue.”
To qualify for the safe harbor, states the news release, the negotiation must relate “directly” to the quality, accuracy, attribution, branding, or “interoperability” of news; provide a benefit for the entire industry rather than just a few publishers; and must be reasonably necessary for the intended purposes of the “safe harbor” rather than for other purposes.

From Facebook posts to The Washington Post.
The big tech landscape is one that continues to be populated by regulators, by disparate voices calling for more oversight, more laws, more mandates spelling out what is private and what is not.
To the growing chorus … add Facebook.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in blog posts and an op-ed in The Washington Post this past weekend that there should be heavier regulations on his industry (on the internet in general) and that, with a nod to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), a common framework is to be desired.
The blog post offered up four areas for “more active” oversight and more government participation. Elsewhere, Zuckerberg said a benefit of updating rules would be the protection of elections, where new rules for online political ads would “reflect the reality of the threats” with which social media companies grapple.
“Every day, we make decisions about what speech is harmful, what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks,” wrote Zuckerberg. “These are important for keeping our community safe. But if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn’t ask companies to make these judgments alone.”

The Australian competition regulator has chosen not to pursue a Labor-backed probe into possible illegal collusion between the big four consulting firms Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC, stating that “conflicts alone” were not enough to be considered a breach of competition law.
“On the information before it, the ACCC has not found evidence that provides a basis to take further investigative action with respect to the allegations at this time,” wrote Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), in a letter sent on Tuesday, April 2, to the two Labor members who made the original written request.
“As you are aware, such evidence is necessary to put matters before a court.”
The ACCC’s decision to end the preliminary probe comes as the UK Parliament heard separate allegations this week that the British arms of the big four firms operate in an “anti-competitive” manner by deliberately underpricing audit work to make it “very difficult for challenger firms to compete.”

Antitrust regulators said at the time they were concerned the deal would damage competition in Germany and the Czech Republic.

The recommendations are a combination of legislative and policy instruments meant to protect our economies, societies and democratic systems. With worldwide 5G revenues estimated at €225 billion (US$252 billion) in 2025, 5G is a key asset for Europe to compete in the global market and its cybersecurity is crucial for ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union.

935,"April 1, 2019",EU: Vestager closes in on Amazon investigation,"
The European Commission is nearing a decision on its investigation into Amazon, with the European Union competition chief saying over the weekend that the Commission has gathered a lot of information on the eCommerce company.
According to a report in Seeking Alpha, EU Competition Chief Margrethe Vestager said the Commission gathered “a lot of data” in its investigation into Amazon. The report noted the EU sent out 1,500 questionnaires to businesses as part of the investigation.
The comments out of the EU’s Vestager come as industry watchers expect Facebook to pay for the social media company’s data scandals and questionable business practices. With more than 2 billion active monthly users, Facebook has been accused of spreading fake news and inflammatory content that has impacted elections in the US. In 2018, Facebook was at the center of a scandal with Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political consulting firm, which accessed data on more than 87 million Facebook users without their permission.
Expectations are that Facebook could face a huge fine by the EU as a result of the data breaches. According to media reports during the past few months, the fine may be as high as US$1.63 billion if regulators find the company violated the bloc’s strict new data privacy law. Under its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies that fail to safeguard their users’ data could face a maximum fine of €20 million (US$23 million), or 4% of a firm’s global annual...

936,"April 1, 2019",Why Breaking Up Big Tech Could Do More Harm Than Good,"
By Herbert Hovenkamp
Earlier this month, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren solidified her party’s growing disenchantment with Big Tech by proposing to break up companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,” the 2020 presidential candidate wrote in a March 8th blog post. “They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.”
Clouding the issue of breaking up Big Tech is that these firms arguably make consumers’ lives better by offering such things as free Google searches, social media connections on Facebook and low prices with fast, free shipping through Amazon. But Warren argues that they are impeding competition by buying up or squashing smaller rivals — and ultimately harming consumers. She cited the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s that tamed its ways and made room for an upstart — Google — to rise. “Aren’t we glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?”
But experts from Wharton and elsewhere challenge some of the basic premises of her proposal and warn that breaking up these three companies could result in unintended consequences that ultimately would harm consumers. The presence of Amazon, Google and Facebook in the market, they ...

937,"March 31, 2019",US: Delrahim praises blocking of Siemens-Alstom merger,"
According to a report from MarketWatch, days after Delrahim is said to be “open” to hearing arguments from T-Mobile and Sprint, the antitrust chief made a case for potentially blocking the merger.
In February, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager blocked a merger between German conglomerate Siemens and France’s Alstom which would have created the world’s second largest rail company.
Makan Delrahim, who heads the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, applauded Vestager’s decision to block the merger from occurring. Speaking alongside Vestager on a panel of international antitrust enforcers in Washington, DC, Delrahim commended her for withstanding political pressure to focus purely on competition issues in regard to the railway merger.
“It’s really important, and it sends a strong signal I think to the broader competition community, that that’s what we do and that’s what we really should do,” he said. “Obviously there’s national security and other considerations that factor in, but with respect to that [the Siemens-Alstom merger], creating a national champion even if you would harm consumers is not the way to do it.”
Delrahim’s remarks were made three days after a report from Fox Business revealed that he is “open” to listening to arguments made by T-Mobile and Sprint in regards to their pursuit to merge.

938,"March 31, 2019",US: Dem nominees agree on breaking up Big Ag,"
Democratic presidential contenders Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar expressed support Saturday, March 30, for strengthening antitrust laws and enforcement to break up big agriculture monopolies, reported the Boston Herald.
“You’ve got these giant corporations that are making bigger and bigger profits … and they’re putting the squeeze on family farms and small farms,” Warren said at the Heartland Forum, which was focused on rural issues.
The US senator from Massachusetts called for breaking up some of the biggest farming corporations “so that they not only do not have that kind of economic power, so that they’re wiping out competition, so they’re taking all the profits for themselves … but also so that they don’t have that kind of political power.”
While supporting an antitrust approach, Klobuchar, a senator and Minnesota Democrat, also proposed putting a fee on corporate mergers to help investigate noncompetitive practices.
“If we stifle competition through monopolies, we’re not just going to bring up the prices for consumers, we’re going to stifle entrepreneurship,” she said.

A federal judge has tossed a property owner’s lawsuit claiming real estate website Zillow violates antitrust law by making deals with some companies to hide its property value estimates.
The plaintiff, who was attempting to sell an eight-bedroom house in Cresskill, New Jersey, with Manhattan views for US$7 million, said in the suit that buyers were put off by Zillow’s US$3.3 million estimate of the property’s fair market value, displayed next to the list price. The company’s approximations of market value, calculated by an algorithm based on publicly available data, are called Zestimates.
The suit claimed Zillow had illegal agreements with certain real estate companies—such as Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Sotheby’s International, The Corcoran Group, and Weichert Realty—to move its Zestimates to a less-prominent place on their listings. When the plaintiff contacted Zillow and asked to move the Zestimate for the property to a less-prominent spot, Zillow refused.
But US District Judge John Michael Vazquez dismissed the suit without prejudice Thursday, March 28.

Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Wednesday took aim at big agriculture and called for a break up of some recent industry mergers, charging “consolidation is choking family farms.”
Lax merger enforcement has threatened the livelihoods of farmers and allowed agribusiness companies to become too large, the Democrat claimed in a policy post on Medium. It comes ahead of the Iowa Farmers Union’s Democratic presidential candidate forum set for Saturday.
“I will appoint trustbusters to review anti-competitive mergers, including the recent Bayer-Monsanto merger that should never have been approved,” Warren wrote.
Warren also criticized the Dow-Dupont and Syngenta-ChemChina deals, which involve mergers of companies supplying seeds and other products to farmers. She said industry consolidation and expansions of agribusiness giants have resulted in companies having “immense market power.”

941,"March 28, 2019",UK: Second ex Barclays banker convicted in London Euribor re-trial,"
A second former Barclays banker has been convicted of conspiring to manipulate global Euribor interest rates, bringing to nine the number of people found guilty in six rate-rigging trials.
The jury of nine men and three women on Thursday found Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old veteran banker, guilty by a majority verdict after a two-month re-trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) at Southwark Crown Court.
Co-defendant Carlo Palombo, a 40-year-old Anglo-Italian former derivatives trader, was convicted by a majority verdict on Tuesday while Sisse Bohart, a 41-year-old Dane, was acquitted. She was not in court to hear her verdict.
Euribor is the average interest rate at which European banks are prepared to lend to one another and is based on daily submissions by a number of “panel banks”.
The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution, had alleged that between 2005 and 2009 the trio of former Barclays employees had conspired with two star traders at Deutsche Bank and Barclays, Christian Bittar and Philippe Moryoussef, and others to fix the rate.

In a bid to end discussions about whether Deutsche Bank has sufficient capital to pull off the potential merger the bank is looking to bring in between €3 billion and €10 billion, according to the Financial Times.
Deutsche Bank strongly denied the reports. “To be clear, there have been no discussions in the Management Board of Deutsche Bank about a capital increase in relation to the potential Commerzbank transaction. Any speculation of this kind is wrong. Furthermore, we have not even decided whether to do a transaction with Commerzbank at all,” the bank said in an emailed statement.
The capital raising is designed to prevent the bank having to return to markets following the deal, if successful. Deutsche’s current market capitalization sits at around €17 billion, meaning the raise would be a huge undertaking for the German lender.

Germany acted legally when it exempted heavy industry from a green energy surcharge in 2012, the European Union’s top court said on Thursday, overturning a decision by the EU antitrust regulator and annulling EU orders to recover the aid.
The European Commission, which is responsible for competition policy, had ordered Germany in 2014 to recoup some of the multi-billion euro reductions on the green surcharge it granted in 2013 and 2014 to some 2,000 heavy energy users.
They include chemical giant BASF and steelmaker ThyssenKrupp.
The Commission’s decision was backed by the EU general court in a ruling in 2016. But the European Court of Justice on Thursday overturned that verdict, saying Brussels had not proved the exemptions offered were illegal state aid.

According to Bloomberg, the European Commission won’t shy away from using European Union antitrust rules to go after tech giants when their collection of personal data harms competition, Vestager said.
“Data accumulation in the hands of a single firm may raise competition concerns,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in response to a question by a member of the European Parliament.




“When firms collect personal data, a degradation of data protection may result in harm to competition that can be addressed by EU competition law. Data accumulation and data protection have already been taken into account in EU competition cases, such as the recent Apple/Shazam and Microsoft/LinkedIn merger cases. The Commission will continue investigating any such data-related concerns in future merger and antitrust cases.”

T-Mobile US’s proposed merger with Sprint may be getting closer to approval from the US Department of Justice (DOJ). According to a report from Fox Business, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim is “open” to the companies’ argument that the merger would help the US compete in the global race to lead 5G.
Delrahim’s apparent willingness to be persuaded by the central argument made by company executives is seen as a positive development in favor of the deal receiving regulatory approval, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Fox. The DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must both approve the merger.
People close to Delrahim told Fox Business that the antitrust chief has not made up his mind on the transaction, and a formal decision could be months away. This leaves the chance for new factors to also persuade him to move against approving the merger. A DOJ antitrust spokesman had no comment.
T-Mobile stated said in late February that it still expects to get regulatory approval for the takeover of Sprint by the end of June. However, the FCC again suspended its review of the deal in early March to collect more information; it’s expected to resume the clock on its deadline in early April.

The orders were sent to AT&T, AT&T Mobility, Comcast Cable, Google Fiber, T-Mobile US, Verizon and Verizon Wireless. The FTC is the main competition regulator in the US, as well as consumer protection issues. In this case, the FTC noted that it has the power to act against unfair and deceptive practices involving internet service providers.
The information sought includes what kind of personal information ISPs collect about consumers or their devices, including the purpose for which the information is collected or used; the techniques for collecting such information; whether the information collected is shared with third parties; internal policies for access to such data; and how long the information is retained. The companies must submit copies of their notices and disclosures to consumers about the data collection practices and outline whether they give customers any choice in the information collected or the ability to see or delete information held.

The Financial Times reported that Renault wants to begin merger talks with Nissan in the next 12 months. Assuming a merger gets completed, the plan is for the combined company to then pursue another merger, with Fiat Chrysler a prime target.
Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have been busy since cutting ties with ex-alliance boss Carlos Ghosn. They formed a new alliance board with Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard at the helm, Renault has shrunk the size of its board while Nissan added more outside directors, and the two agreed to a new governance structure to ease operational decision making. All three automakers have walked away from Ghosn-era goals to sell 14 million cars and find €10 billion (US$11.2 billion) in savings by 2022. New strategic plans for all three car companies are in the works.
The combined company would then pursue a further acquisition that would bulk up the business for a fight for global dominance with the likes of Volkswagen and Toyota. Two people familiar with the matter said Mr Ghosn held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, but the proposal was scuppered by opposition from the French government.

On Tuesday a US administrative-law judge believes that Apple Inc. infringed a Qualcomm Inc. patent and that certain iPhone models should be banned from entering the US, but a final ruling from the International Trade Commission in a separate case went Apple’s way, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Apple gained a win with a ruling by members of the US International Trade Commission that the iPhone maker didn’t violate a patent held by its former chip supplier. That ruling effectively overturned an ITC administrative judge’s finding in September that Apple had violated a Qualcomm patent related to power efficiency in mobile phones.
Hours earlier a US trade judge recommended Qualcomm be granted a request for an import ban on some iPhones sold by Apple. An administrative law judge of the US International Trade Commission said the basis for the ban was a finding that Apple infringed a Qualcomm patent relating to smartphone technology.
“We appreciate Judge McNamara’s recognition of Apple’s infringement of our hardware patent and that she will be recommending an import ban and cease and desist order,” Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement.
“Qualcomm is using these cases to distract from having to answer for the real issues, their monopolistic business practices,” Apple said in a statement.
In both cases Qualcomm sought to have imports of Apple Inc iPhone 7, 8 and X models containing chips made by Intel Corp banned. Because iPhones are made o...

The Raiders and NFL are asking a judge to toss out a lawsuit filed by Oakland, arguing the city’s claims “turn antitrust on its head” and are a “striking perversion of antitrust law.”
Attorneys for the team, league and its 31 other franchises laid out their legal arguments for the first time in court papers filed March 1. Spero is expected to rule on June 7 whether to dismiss the lawsuit. Both sides met for the first time in San Francisco before U.S. District Judge Joseph C. Spero on Friday afternoon.
Oakland filed suit in December, alleging the NFL and Raiders violated antitrust laws by approving the move to Las Vegas, and said doing so amounted to a group boycott of Oakland. Outside attorneys have taken the city’s case on a contingency basis, meaning it comes at no cost to the city. The city also alleges in its suit that the Raiders violated the league’s relocation policy by not seriously negotiating with Oakland and Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott’s group, which proposed to help finance a new stadium at the Coliseum.
But attorneys for the Raiders and NFL wrote that the competition between Las Vegas and Oakland was not a violation of antitrust laws, which are designed to promote competition and prohibit monopolies. The city did not suffer antitrust injury, the attorneys said, but rather “the injury flows from an increase in competition” and “another community’s willingness to make an offer better than Oakland’s.”

A proposed merger between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank seems to be more and more likely to occur. Yet the deal has faced stiff opposition from different figures within and outside the company, reported Bloomberg.
At the beginning of March, for instance, two labor representatives on Deutsche Bank’s board said openly that they do not want the deal to take place, with one of them calling the prospective merger “economic nonsense.”

Now some major shareholders at the German banking giant have also expressed concerns about a deal with Commerzbank. According to Bloomberg, investors from the Gulf nation of Qatar want some reassurances and compensation if a merger does go ahead.
Qatari investors plowed money into Deutsche Bank five years ago. According to a January report by Reuters, the Qatari royal family – led by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani – controls 6.1 percent of the German firm.

Guitar supplier Fender Europe has been fined £25,000 by the CMA for hiding relevant documents during an inspection of its UK headquarters.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued the fine against Fender Europe after discovering a senior officer had concealed notebooks during an inspection at its offices in East Grinstead, West Sussex, as part of a competition law investigation.
When deciding on the level of the fine, the CMA took into account that Fender Europe had come forward and handed over the notebooks, just over three weeks after the inspection had taken place.
Ann Pope, the CMA’s Senior Director of Antitrust, said “This fine sends a very clear signal to companies that they need to comply fully with their legal obligations when the CMA conducts investigations. Hiding documents is a serious matter and the decision to issue Fender Europe with a fine reflects this.”

Macron, who invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to talks with Xi Jinping in Paris, said he wanted to build a fairer, more balanced multilateral trade framework with China.
Macron urged his Chinese counterpart to “respect the unity of the European Union and the values it carries in the world.”
“We would like to make progress renovating multilateralism. We have divergences, obviously in the history of humanity power does not go without rivalry, none of us are naive,” Macron said.
A prosperous Europe corresponded with China’s “vision for a multipolar world,” Xi said, adding that the EU and China were “advancing together” despite “suspicions.”

The European Commission has approved Marsh & McLennan Companies’ (MMC’s) acquisition of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group (JLT), conditional on the divestment of JLT’s global aerospace practice.
The companies now expect the US$6.4 billion deal to close on April 1, subject to a court’s approval. A hearing at the UK High Court has been set for March 29.
The move comes shortly after MMC agreed to sell JLT’s aerospace business to Arthur J Gallagher to address a potential overlap identified by the European Commission’s Phase 1 review of MMC’s acquisition of JLT.
The Commission was concerned that the transaction would have negatively affected competition in the insurance brokerage markets for the specialties of aircraft operators and aerospace manufacturing, and could have led to higher prices, less choice, and lower quality of services in these markets.
The deal received US approval in October of 2018.

956,"March 25, 2019",US: Uber buys Careem For US$3B,"
Uber, the ride-hailing startup, is reportedly gearing up to make a US$3 billion bid for Careem Networks, the Dubai-based ride-hailing company.
According to a report in Reuters, citing sources familiar with the deal, Uber could make the offer during the early part of the week. Uber is offering US$1.4 billion in cash and US$1.7 billion in convertible notes, which can be converted to Uber shares at a price of US$55 per share. Neither side commented on the report.
Uber’s revenue was US$11.3 billion in 2018, while its gross bookings from rides totaled US$50 billion. However, the company lost US$3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.
The potential move comes as Uber is gearing up to launch an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the ride-hailing startup as high as US$120 billion, and as rival Lyft is also gearing up for its own IPO. According to recent reports, Lyft is set to launch its roadshow ahead of an IPO, and could get a valuation of between US$21 billion and US$23 billion. Lyft aims to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market with the symbol LYFT by the end of March.
Citing sources, Reuters reported at the time that Lyft will present itself to investors as a better bet than its chief ride-hailing rival Uber, which has branched out into areas such as food delivery and freight hauling. As part of the IPO, Lyft will offer one-time cash bonuses to drivers, who can use them to buy shares if desired. The company is set t...

El presidente ejecutivo de JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, dijo que los gigantes de la tecnología deben prepararse para una serie de regulaciones más estrictas,  similares a las que los grandes bancos enfrentaron después de la crisis financiera.
“Todavía no se han beneficiado de todo el dinero”, dijo Dimon a la CNBC, y agregó que “si yo fuera ellos, me estaría preparando para eso”.
Las grandes empresas tecnológicas como Facebook, Google y Amazon han sentido presión por parte de los legisladores en años recientes. La candidata presidencial demócrata, Elizabeth Warren, incluso propuso un plan para partir las grandes empresas de tecnología en partes más pequeñas, diciendo que “tienen demasiado poder”.
Además, Google acaba de ser golpeado con su tercera multa antimonopolio por los reguladores de la Unión Europea (UE). Esta vez, la compañía recibió una multa de 1,490 millones de euros (US$ 1,700 millones de dólares) por limitar la forma en que algunos sitios web utilizan anuncios gráficos vendidos por los competidores. Esta multa es más pequeña que los $ 7,670 millones combinados que la UE multó a Google en los últimos dos casos.

959,"March 25, 2019",The Warren Campaign’s Antitrust Proposals,"
By Herbert Hovenkamp

Antitrust policy promises to be an important issue in the 2020 presidential election, and for good reason. Market power as measured by price-cost margins has been on the rise since the 1980s. Unreasonably high margins reduce output, causing higher prices for consumers and fewer jobs for labor.
Responding to concern about increasing market power, presidential candidate U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has recently offered two proposals directed at large tech platforms.
One proposal would designate large platform-based companies such as Amazon as “platform utilities” and prohibit them from selling their own merchandise on the platform in competition with other sellers. This “structural separation” rule would apply to platforms that exceed $25 billion in annual revenue, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Smaller platforms would not be required to separate structurally but would be placed under a standard of “fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing” with third-party merchants. These rules could be enforced by both government agencies and private parties.
Senator Warren’s second proposal would reverse “illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,” focusing on large platform acquisitions of smaller firms. Her statement identifies Amazon and Whole Foods as such a merger, as well as Facebook’s acquisition of messaging company WhatsApp.
Both Warren proposals express concerns about privacy as well as competition. The proposals...

Antitrust expert Hal Singer thinks there’s a better way to knock down the internet giants. (Except for Facebook.)
By Joe Nocera, Bloomberg
Hal Singer makes his living as an expert witness in antitrust cases and teaching at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. In recent years, he’s also become one of the handful of economists who are trying to shake up the once-staid world of antitrust theory. He’s testified before Congress, participated in a symposium held by the Federal Trade Commission, and made speeches in which he’s offered his own solution for how to reignite competition in the face of the power of Big Tech. Whether you agree with him or not, his ideas are being taken seriously in the halls of Congress, and have helped spark a debate that could have enormous consequences. What follows is a lightly edited and condensed version of a recent conversation we had about his ideas.
Joe Nocera: I wanted to do this interview because you’ve been very vocal about ideas for preventing the big technology companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google — from abusing their immense power. Before we get to that, let’s talk a little bit about the current antitrust standard: the so-called consumer welfare standard. Can you start by just explaining what it is?
Hal Singer: The essence of the consumer welfare standard is that antitrust should be motivated to do good by the consumer. So if we see conduct that doesn’t hurt consumers in the short run, then why...

961,"March 24, 2019",US: NCAA appeals antitrust ruling,"
The NCAA announced on Saturday, March 23, that it was appealing a Federal District Court’s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.
“We believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that NCAA member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,” Donald Remy, the NCAA’s chief legal officer, said in a statement.
Remy said the decision to appeal, by the NCAA and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.
The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the NCAA than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and football players, had hoped.

J Sainsbury and Asda have offered to dispose of between 125 and 150 supermarkets in an attempt to secure regulatory approval for their proposed £12 billion (US$15.8 billion) tie-up, according to documents filed by the grocers with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The proposed disposal is only half of the roughly 300 stores the CMA stated would need to be offloaded if it were to approve the deal.
The two grocers also said they would be willing to offload some convenience stores and petrol filling stations, but that they considered that divestiture of the online delivery operations of either company was “not necessary or proportionate.”
The pledges come on top of public commitments, made earlier last week, to reduce the prices of everyday items by an aggregate £1 billion (US$1.3 billion) no later than three years after completion, and to accept a margin cap on fuel sold by Sainsbury’s.

“One could think in the direction of an unbundling on a product level at Amazon,” Wambach said. “Amazon Prime connects different services as well,” he said, referring to the company’s membership program. Germany’s Monopolies Commission is an expert panel that advises the country’s federal government.
Last year, the European Union fined Google €4.3 billion (US$4.86 billion) for breaching antitrust rules as the US giant imposed restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.

“You learn more from losing than from winning,” Delrahim said in a speech at a Washington conference put on by America’s Communications Association, formerly known as the American Cable Association. “There are many lessons to be learned from the US v AT&T. ” Delrahim’s remarks were taken from an audio recording of the event made available by conference organizers.
The ACA conference was a welcoming place for Delrahim to offer some of his most extensive public reflections on the case since the appellate ruling. The association wrote an amicus brief supporting the DOJ and one of its members appeared as a government witness at trial.

According to a report by Reuters, South Korea’s antitrust regulator has lowered a decade-old penalty imposed on US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc by 18% to US$200 million, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) announced on Thursday.
The reduction comes after the Supreme Court overturned in January one of several lower court rulings against the US firm for abusing its dominant market position.
In 2009, the KFTC fined Qualcomm 273 billion won (US$242.6 million) for abusing its market power in CDMA modem and radio frequency chips, which were then used in handsets made by South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc.
The KFTC stated said it had reset the penalty to reflect the Supreme Court’s ruling, adding however that a “monopolist enterprise’s abuse of its market position cannot be tolerated.”

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said tech giants need to brace themselves for a similar slew of tough regulations to what big banks faced after the financial crisis.
“They haven’t had the benefit of the full monty yet,” said Dimon to CNBC, adding that “if I were them, I’d be getting prepared for it.”
Big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon have been feeling the wrath of lawmakers in recent years. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has even proposed a plan to break up large tech firms, saying they “have too much power.”
In addition, Google was just hit with its third antitrust fine by European Union (EU) regulators. This time, the company was fined €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion USD) for limiting how some websites used display ads sold by competitors. This fine is smaller than the combined $7.67 billion that the EU fined Google in the past two instances.
It was also recently reported that France is looking to levy a 3 percent digital tax on revenues derived from business done in that country by global tech firms with certain revenue levels. Facebook, Google and Amazon would be subject to the tax, as would a few dozen companies operating in France.
“When you get attacked by someone, you get one group, it could be every country, every AG, every regulator, all at the same time,” Dimon noted. He added that, “they should really gear up and look at it as a very broad-based, extensive type of thing they have to deal with, and listen car...

A political rift has emerged in Berlin over whether Germany should put its financial muscle behind a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, politicians and officials said, complicating a bid to create Europe’s third-largest bank and fund it.
Germany’s two top banks have struggled to recover since the financial crisis and government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, are pushing for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over their future.
But a dispute is unfolding between the two political parties who govern Germany in coalition, a row that could reduce political momentum for a deal and derail any future agreement on whether or how Berlin should financially underpin a merged group.
One senior German official said that Scholz, a Social Democrat, had “gone it alone” in pushing for the deal without first securing the backing of Christian Democrats (CDU) in the coalition.

Disney will now control Fox’s movie and television production studios, as well as its FX cable network, Fox Searchlight label, and National Geographic properties.
The deal, which stemmed from talks about 18 months ago in Los Angeles by Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch, closed following approval in several foreign markets. After quickly getting approved by the US Justice Department last year, the deal was slowed by the partial government shutdown earlier this year. The deal also received EU approval after concessions were offered and agreed on.
Disney has launched one streaming service, tied to its ESPN programming, and is planning a family-oriented one for later this year. To prepare for that launch, it already has started removing its movies and television shows from Netflix’s library.
Edgier Fox fare, such as FX shows like “American Horror Story” or “Pose” and movies like “Deadpool,” will appear on streaming service Hulu, over which Disney will assume majority control now that the deal has closed, reported the Wall Street Journal.

According to a report by the Financial Times, a top Democratic lawmaker has called for an antitrust investigation into Facebook, in the latest sign of the political pressure on the social media giant and the government agencies that regulate it.
David Cicilline, who chairs the House of Representatives’ antitrust subcommittee, on Tuesday, March 19, sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) five commissioners, writing that the agency should investigate Facebook’s acquisitions of rivals Instagram and WhatsApp, its “exclusionary conduct” in relation to former competitors like Vine, and alleged abuses of its monopoly power connected to Facebook’s “widespread commercial surveillance” of its users.
“The FTC is facing a massive credibility crisis,” said Mr Cicilline in an accompanying New York Times op-ed, arguing that the agency had “enabled Facebook to extend its dominance” by failing to take action in the past.
Earlier this month, Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator and presidential candidate, vowed to break up Facebook, along with Amazon and Google, if she prevailed in the 2020 election.

“We have to examine the role of Apple and Apple’s app store,” she was quoted as saying. “If we conclude that they have a market-dominating position, then the case would be comparable to our proceedings against Google.”
The EU’s consideration of a possible probe of Apple comes after music streaming service Spotify filed a complaint against the iPhone maker, saying it was unfairly limiting rivals to its own Apple Music streaming service.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it is planning to steadily develop a system of rules to regulate financial technology (FinTech) in the country.
According to Reuters, China’s central bank also revealed that it intends to completely utilize the technology to enhance the flow of credit and reduce financing costs for businesses, as well as improve the ability to prevent risks.
China has become an emerging FinTech market due to its expanding middle class, rapid digitization and electronic payments adoption. And the country has recently seen a surge in companies using the tech to attract the country’s millions of previously unbanked consumers. However, while the technology is fine, the financial services (FinServ) offerings concern the president of Chinese financial investment platform Phoenix Finance.
Vince Zhang said at last year’s East Tech West conference in China that many FinTech firms don’t have the controls to make them safe investments for both consumers and the nation’s economy.
“A lot of companies are not [there] in terms of their business plan, in terms of their risk management process, in terms of their overall management,” he said. “A lot of these corporate control mechanisms are not in place.”

A merger of Deutsche Bank and its rival Commerzbank could result in as many as 30,000 job cuts over the long term, a representative of German union Verdi who is a Deutsche supervisory board member told n-tv broadcaster.
The fierce opposition from the union and shareholder reservations come after both banks on Sunday confirmed talks about a merger and underlines the obstacles to efforts to combine Germany’s two biggest banks.
Most of the 30,000 positions at risk are based in Germany, Verdi’s Jan Duscheck said, according to comments published by the TV station on Monday. Over the short term there are 10,000 jobs under threat, Duscheck added.
The German government has pushed for a combination given concerns about the health of Deutsche, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis.

The European Union’s competition watchdog is considering opening a probe of Apple over allegations that it uses its app store to gain an advantage on its own services over rivals’, the authority’s chief said on Thursday.
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, told German newspaper Tagesspiegel her watchdog would examine if there were parallels with Google, which in 2017 was fined over 2 billion euros for unfairly disadvantaging rivals on its platform.
“We have to examine the role of Apple and Apple’s app store,” she was quoted as saying. “If we conclude that they have a market-dominating position, then the case would be comparable to our proceedings against Google.”

Sutter Health failed in its attempt to persuade a San Francisco Superior Court judge to dismiss key claims in the antitrust lawsuit that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed about a year ago.

“Yesterday’s court ruling is a giant step in the right direction,” Becerra said. “Hospitals that participate in anti-competitive practices to the detriment of their patients must be held accountable.”
Lisa Page, vice president of communications and public relations at Sutter, said: “Although we regret the court’s decision to deny the motion, the decision has no bearing on the ultimate resolution of the lawsuit. Whether the lawsuit is decided through additional motions or at trial by a jury, Sutter will continue to vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims.”

On Friday, March 15, Qualcomm won a legal victory against iPhone maker Apple, with a jury in federal court in San Diego finding that Apple owes Qualcomm about US$31 million for infringing three of its patents, reported the New York Times.
Qualcomm last year sued Apple alleging it had violated patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life. During an eight-day trial, Qualcomm asked the jury to award it unpaid patent royalties of up to US$1.41 per iPhone that violated the patents.
“The technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. “We are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple’s strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP.”
In a statement, Apple said it was disappointed with the outcome.
“Qualcomm’s ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in US federal court, and around the world,” Apple stated. It declined to comment on whether it would appeal.

On Wednesday, March 13, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Union, alleging that Apple uses unfair practices in the App Store. Specifically, Spotify is upset at the 30% that Apple charges developers for subscriptions, and it claims that it’s designed to give Apple Music an unfair advantage in the marketplace.
Apple pushed back on Spotify’s claims on Friday, stating saying that Spotify “wants all the benefits of a free app without being free,” that it conveniently left out that Apple’s 30% cut drops to 15% after a year, and that only a “tiny fraction” of subscribers sign up via the App store.
In its latest statement, Spotify stated that “every monopolist will suggest they have done nothing wrong and will argue that they have the best interests of competitors and consumers at heart,” and went on to reiterate that Apple’s policies hurt consumers. “This is evident in Apple’s belief that Spotify’s users on iOS are Apple customers and not Spotify customers, which goes to the very heart of the issue with Apple.”

Retailer Rent-A-Center was within its rights to back out of a US$1.36 billion merger deal with private equity firm Vintage Capital Management last year, a Delaware state court ruled Thursday, March 14.
Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III of the Delaware Chancery Court said that Vintage’s failure to inform Rent-A-Center that it was extending the merger deal by an agreed-upon date triggered Rent-A-Center’s right to call it off under the two parties’ contract.
Rent-A-Center is a “rent-to-own” business, allowing customers to rent furniture, electronics, and other goods with the option of eventually purchasing them.
“We are pleased that the court has affirmed the validity of our termination of the merger agreement with Vintage Capital,” Rent-A-Center CEO Mitch Fadel said in a statement. “Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on executing our strategic plan to grow our business and enhance value for our stockholders.”

985,"March 17, 2019",Warren’s Populist Puritanism – Andy Kessler – WSJ,"
By Andy Kessler
H.L. Mencken defined puritanism as the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. Remember that amid the deluge of demands to break up Facebook , Google, Amazon and Apple .
Columbia law professor Tim Wu insists that bigness is bad. “We’ve let Facebook have their ride, they’ve made their money and they’ve been very successful,” he told the American Enterprise Institute last month. “I just think there’s a very good track record in tech of trying to put pressure on the monopolist and break things up a little bit.” Basically, Facebook got big and now it’s someone else’s turn.
Wannabe president Elizabeth Warren wants to “break up Big Tech” and split the companies into heavily regulated “platform utilities.” She told crowds at South by Southwest: “The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits. Boohoo.” The politics of envy is the populist playbook.
Yet the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits two specific types of business practices: anticompetitive agreements, or collusion, and conduct to limit competition. Judges define these violations by a consumer-welfare standard, assessing whether consumers are harmed by a lack of competition. “Innocent monopolies” earned by merit are not illegal. Antitrust says nothing about bigness.
No matter. The calls are getting louder for Facebook to split off Instagram and WhatsApp. Same for Amazon carving out Whole Foods. Or Google divesting its 2007 acquisition DoubleClick. Or spinning out t...

According to a report from Bloomberg, Sainsbury and Asda are arguing that officials got their math wrong and were duped about a rival’s intentions.
Sainsbury stepped up its push to salvage the deal on Thursday, March 14, before the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which stunned the supermarkets on February 20 by announcing harsher-than-expected findings on the £7.3 billion (US$9.6 billion) transaction. The CMA claimed its initial view was that the deal, —even with substantial store divestitures, —would likely bring higher prices and worse choice for shoppers.
Sainsbury is arguing that officials made basic counting errors in their analysis of the companies’ store networks, according to people familiar with the situation. The company also claims says Marks & Spencer Group Plc misled the regulator about a pending online-grocery agreement with Ocado Group Plc that changes the competitive landscape in the supermarket business, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.

A US judge who has been asked to sign off on a government agreement that allowed CVS Health to buy health insurer Aetna ordered a hearing for April 5 on the matter.
Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the order on Thursday, March 14, saying that he wanted the hearing to discuss which witnesses—if any—should testify before he decides whether to approve the government’s deal with the companies.
The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a US pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans.
Judges usually approve merger agreements that the government strikes with companies with little fanfare, but Leon has balked. In December, he said he was “less convinced” than the government that the asset sale to WellCare would resolve antitrust concerns.

990,"March 13, 2019",UK: Panel calls for new antitrust regulator targeting giant tech,"

A government-appointed panel of experts on Wednesday released a carefully calibrated proposal designed to contain big tech’s threat to competition while keeping the government’s hand on the industry and the internet as light as possible.
Led by Jason Furman, a Harvard University economist who previously chaired President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, the panel doesn’t tackle big tech’s effects on privacy, democracy and free speech. Instead, it sticks to the key economic test: Do digital markets naturally “tip” to monopolists, who must therefore be broken up or regulated like utilities, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) proposed last week.

According to the Wall Street Journal they conclude no: Treating them as utilities would take monopoly as a foregone conclusion. Instead, the Furman report recommends giving “every chance for competition to succeed in digital markets, tackling the factors that lead to winner-takes-most outcomes and to that position becoming entrenched.”
The authors recommend antitrust authorities, when evaluating digital mergers, assign more weight to future, not just current, consumer welfare. Presently, U.K. regulators decide such cases based on a “balance of probabilities,” meaning a merger must be more than 50% likely to substantially lessen competition to be blocked. Instead, the report recommends a “balance of harms” test: a small probability (say, 20%) that the target could one day be a significant innovator and ...

Antitrust Returns to American Politics
By Tim Wu
Senator Elizabeth Warren’s announcement on Friday of a plan to break up major tech monopolies like Facebook and Google was critically important — not just as a policy proposal, but also as a sign of the return of antitrust to politics.
In the United States, economic policy is ostensibly a matter of democratic governance, but for too long antitrust has been viewed as a technocratic matter best left to experts. This is a mistake: Excessive corporate size and power can be linked to many voter concerns, including stagnant wages, the invasion of privacy, the rise of fake news, the demise of the middle class and an unresponsive democracy.
Antitrust is especially salient today because we witness the tremendous power of the tech monopolies firsthand, in our daily lives. Nearly everyone uses Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, and nearly everyone can see how smaller businesses have been hurt by their dominance. Nearly everyone has an opinion about whether they are too powerful, whether they know too much, whether they ought to be admired or feared.
Add to these concerns the dangers of agricultural monopolies, rising costs for cable and broadband, and anticompetitive drug pricing, and it is clear that for Ms. Warren and other presidential hopefuls in the Democratic field, the problem of monopoly power should be a central issue — perhaps the central issue — in the 2020 campaign.

Amazon, worried that it could run afoul of antitrust laws, will stop preventing third-party sellers from hawking their products on other websites for a lower price.
According to a report in CNN, Amazon confirmed that the new policy kicked off this week, but declined to comment further. CNN reported that Senator Richard Blumenthal had reached out to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into whether or not the eCommerce giant was violating antitrust rules by requiring merchants to match the price on all the websites it sells on. The rule was called price parity by Amazon.
In a letter to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission which Blumenthal penned in December, he said, “Amazon’s price parity provisions may raise prices for consumers both in the short term and in the long run,” reported CNN. The letter went on to say that “Amazon’s price parity provisions may work to block the emergence of more efficient online marketplaces that might offer consumers lower prices on their favorite goods.” Blumenthal told CNN he was glad Amazon made that decision but remains “deeply troubled” that federal regulators failed to stay on top of anti-competitive practices that hurt American innovation and consumers.
Although Blumenthal welcomed Amazon’s move, the eCommerce company still has to contend with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president. She has called for technology companies including Am...

The Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) budget would increase by US$2.6 million under President Donald Trump’s fiscal 2020 government spending plan, released March 11, reported Bloomberg.
The Commission would receive US$312.3 million under the White House budget proposal, compared with the agency’s current funding level of US$309.7 million.
The proposed increase comes as the FTC faces pressure to enforce competition and consumer protection laws more vigorously, particularly when it comes to tech giants such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google.
The FTC has also published an addendum to its strategic plan. The addendum removes one performance measure from the plan and replaces it with two new performance measures. The FY 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is the FTC’s road map of goals, objectives, and strategies that guides the agency’s work and serves as the basis for reporting the agency’s performance results.

According to TechCrunch the European Union’s  competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager,  has suggested that breaking up tech giants should be a measure of last resort,
“To break up a company, to break up private property would be very far reaching and you would need to have a very strong case that it would produce better results for consumers in the marketplace than what you could do with more mainstream tools,” she warned this weekend, speaking in a SXSW interview with Recode’s Kara Swisher. “We’re dealing with private property. Businesses that are built and invested in and become successful because of their innovation.”
While would-be US presidential candidates are now advocating regulating big tech, the European commissioner advocates taking a scalpel to data streams rather than wielding a break-up hammer to smash tech giants.
“When it comes to the very far reaching proposal to split up companies, for us, from a European perspective, that would be a measure of last resort,” she said. “What we do now, we do the antitrust cases, misuse of dominant position, the tying of products, the self-promotion, the demotion of others, to see if that approach will correct and change the marketplace to make it a fair place where there’s no misuse of dominant position but where smaller competitors can have a fair go. Because they may be the next big one, the next one with the greatest idea for consumers.”

According to an interview by the The New York Times, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Joseph J. Simons agrees with FTC critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech.
“We have this over 100-year-old statute that is our main authority,” Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. “And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.”
In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration, Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government’s hand.
Simons has urged Congress to expand the FTC’s privacy-enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules, and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits, not just technology companies, collect and handle people’s digital data.
On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren (Dem – Massachusetts), who is running for president, announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies.
“The FTC has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past, which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist,” freshman Senator Josh Hawley (Rep – Missouri) said in an interview.
