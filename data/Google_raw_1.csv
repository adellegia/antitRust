On Tuesday UK watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority launched a new probe into Apple and Google’s control of the mobile browser market.
The regulator said it will explore the companies’ “stranglehold” over browsing, as well as Apple’s control over cloud gaming through the App Store, it said in a release. The CMA said Google and Apple powered 97% of all web browsing that took place in the UK in 2021.
Big tech rivals such as web developers, cloud gaming service providers and browser vendors have offered “substantial support”  to move along the probe, according to the results of a June consultation released by the authority.

Among the list of complaints is that Apple’s restrictions make it difficult to build innovative new apps for UK consumers, and that they are forced to contend with glitches and bugs while building webpages.
Sarah Cardell, interim chief executive of the CMA, said  “Many UK businesses and web developers tell us they feel that they are being held back by restrictions set by Apple and Google,” she said. “We plan to investigate whether the concerns we have heard are justified and, if so, identify steps to improve competition and innovation in these sectors.”
A Google spokesperson said “Android gives people a greater choice of apps and app stores than any other mobile platform. It also enables developers to choose the browser engine they want, and has been the launchpad for millions of apps. We’re committed to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers build successful businesses.″

Despite Google’s vehement denials of any wrongdoing, the conservative media watchdog believes Google “does change its algorithm to benefit certain political candidates,” and is focused on the Senate because its “search bias” didn’t carry over to House races where the GOP is already favored.

The latest study focused on 10 key races in the House and Senate involving sitting lawmakers who have spoken out against Big Tech. MRC said its findings indicated Google “severely buried or did not even display several Republicans’ campaign websites” if they have acted aggressively toward Big Tech.
“In fact, the search giant completely hid six of 10 Republicans’ campaign websites from the first page of results,” MRC associate editor Brian Bradley wrote.
“Google did not show Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s campaign website on its front page of search results but showed his Democrat challenger Charles Booker’s campaign website as the first result. Paul, who is up for re-election, has been a frequent critic of Big Tech,” Bradley added. “Google buried [Colorado] Rep. Ken Buck’s campaign website as the 15th result out of 20 on the first page, while elevating his challenger Democrat Ike McCorkle’s campaign website to the No. 3 spot in the search results.

Tech industry players are concerned that the Supreme Court could impose new rules that upset the internet economy.
That’s according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, which looks at the court’s upcoming ruling on Section 230, a federal law that guards sites such as Facebook or YouTube against lawsuits over harmful content posted by third parties.
The case originated with a lawsuit against YouTube owner Google by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, who was killed in the 2015 Islamic State terrorist attack in Paris. They argue that YouTube aided ISIS by recommending the group’s videos to users. Google says that Section 230 guards it against liability for content added to its site by users.

The tech industry has already begun to try to figure out its response to an unfavorable ruling, including petitioning Congress to pass legislation to rewrite Section 230 with more obvious liability protections, said Matt Schruers, president of the trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association.
“I could foresee an outcome where the litigation and compliance risks stemming from an ill-considered decision are so great that many small firms exit the market,” which would lead to foreign-based services picking up market share, he said. “To say that another way, US competitiveness is potentially at risk here, and we have the most to lose from getting this wrong,” Schruers said.

The rulings come as Google faces increased antitrust scrutiny across the world. Last month, it suffered a major setback when a European court upheld a 2018 ruling saying it was largely confirming a decision that the company imposed “unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices.” Google plans to appeal the decision, where it faces a record $4.1 billion fine.
The Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) Android ruling, despite involving a smaller $162 million fine, has worried Google since it seeks wider ranging remedial measures, three sources aware of company’s thinking said.
One of the sources said that Google was concerned that the CCI’s decision could increase regulatory pressures in other jurisdictions and a legal appeal to block implementation of the antitrust directive was being planned within weeks.
Google declined to comment on its legal plans, reiterating its statement from last week that the CCI order was “a major setback for Indian consumers and businesses, opening serious security risks … and raising the cost of mobile devices for Indians.”

Calling it “a big deal” for creators, Google parent Alphabet said Tuesday it will pay top creative talent to post videos on its new YouTube Shorts platform as it aims to grab a bigger slice of a shrinking ad-spend pie while slowing the advance of rival TikTok.
By introducing the new revenue sharing plan, which it says will kick in early next year, Google becomes the fourth major player this month to announce a big move to boost the creator economy at a time when the real economy is, by most accounts, headed into recession.
“This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on the company’s third quarter earnings webcast Tuesday (Oct 25) evening.
Related: Google & Youtube Hit With Patent Fine Over Video Sharing
The monetization move not only comes in the wake of related initiatives launched recently by Walmart, Meta and Instagram’s Reels, as well as a new payment program from Visa, but also reflects the changing media consumption habits that increasingly tight-fisted advertisers are looking to capture.
Given that 80% of Alphabet’s revenues come from advertising, and three-fourths of that come from Google Search alone, it’s fair to say that the company’s $54 billion exposure to online ad spend in Q3 — and in turn, the pulse of the global economy — is second to none.
As a result, news that the search giant saw its Q3 sales growth slow to 4% from a blistering 43% pace a year ago did not sit well with already-weary investors, who are growing tired of seeing sales and profits decline while costs and headcount continue to rise — all while the stock has lost more than 30% so far this year.
Officially, Alphabet said its employee base rose about 25%, ending the quarter at 187,000 from 150,000 in 2021.
“In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads,” Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told investors Tuesday (Oct 25) evening, pointing to weak spending in financial services generally — and a pullback in insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories specifically — as indicative of the broader trend.
“There’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways,” Schindler added, noting that alongside Shorts, the company’s YouTube TV unit was adding subscribers and viewing hours at an unmatched — and almost unfathomable — clip.
On average, Schindler said, global viewers are watching more than 700 million hours of YouTube content on TV daily, with another 30 billion daily views on Shorts via a base of 1.5 billion monthly active users.
“TV is a big area for us,” Pichai said. “Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the US in September for the first time,” he added, speaking to what Schindler characterized as strong engagement driven by a “streaming boom.”

More than 40 European rivals to Google’s shopping service urged EU antitrust regulators to use newly adopted tech rules to ensure the Alphabet unit complies with a 2017 EU order to allow more competition on its search page.
The European Commission fined Google 2.4 billion euros ($2.33 billion) five years ago and told the firm to stop favouring its shopping service.
The company subsequently said it would treat its own shopping service the same as competitors when they bid in an auction for adverts in the shopping box that appears at the top of a search page.
But in a letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the 43 companies – which include British firm Kelkoo, France’s LeGuide Group, Sweden’s PriceRunner and Germany’s idealo – said the proposal was legally insufficient and had not led to them benefitting from the advert auctions.
“The Commission needs to re-open space on general search results pages for the most relevant providers, by removing Google’s Shopping Units that allow no competition but lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers and an unfair transfer of profit margins from merchants and competing CSSs to Google,” the companies said in the letter seen by Reuters. CSSs refer to Comparison Shopping Services.
They said Google’s mechanism breaches the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Vestager’s new rules aimed at reining in the power of tech giants, which will apply in May next year.

This remains true despite the company’s efforts over the past decade to push into selling hardware, subscription services, and cloud computing technology.

Epic Games and Match are attempting to expand their lawsuits against Google to include additional allegations against the search giant. In a motion filed on Friday with a federal court in the Northern District of California, the two companies accused Google of paying off developers that had the means and ability to create competing Android app stores.
Specifically, Epic and Match point to agreements like Project Hug. The initiative, later called the “Apps and Games Velocity Program,” saw Google spend millions of dollars to keep some of Android’s most popular developers on the Play Store, according to a complaint filed by Epic last year.
“Some of these agreements were intended to, and did, stop developers from launching competing app stores,” the motion states, adding Google committed a “per se” violation of the Sherman Act, the primary US antitrust law. Under the Sherman Act, per se violations don’t require a plaintiff to show how a certain behavior negatively affected the market since it’s generally accepted such actions reduce competition.
Google told Engadget it would oppose the motion. “Epic and Match are adding more inaccurate claims to their failing lawsuits and we’re looking forward to setting the record straight in court,” a company spokesperson said.
“The program on which Epic and Match base their claims simply provides incentives for developers to give benefits and early access to Google Play users when they release new or updated content; it does not prevent developers from creating competing app stores, as they allege,” they added. “In fact, the program is proof that Google Play competes fairly with numerous rivals for developers, who have a number of choices for operating systems and app stores.”

By Damien Geradin (TILEC) & Stijn Huijts (Geradin Partners)
Cloud gaming represents a new model of video game distribution. It involves playing games that are streamed from a remote server (the cloud), and has the potential to revolutionize gaming as it is, at least in theory, device-agnostic, allowing AAA games to be played on any device with a connection to the internet. However, Apple blocks the emergence of cloud gaming apps on its Apple App Store, and Google, although not completely blocking them, still imposes restrictions on them. Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps has led the UK Competition and Markets Authority to make a Market Investigation Reference, which could lead to the authority imposing remedies on Apple.
This paper provides an introduction to cloud gaming and explains why it is an important development that offers huge potential for competition and innovation in digital markets. It then discusses Apple’s prevention of cloud gaming apps and examines Apple’s stated rationale for this policy, after which it also touches on Google’s restrictions. This is followed by a section that sets out other reasons why it may be in Apple’s commercial interest to block the emergence of cloud gaming apps, looking in particular at whether this may be linked to a desire to protect its position in the distribution of apps on iOS devices and its revenues from the sale of hardware. After this, the paper discusses how these restrictions have led to the UK Market Investigation Reference, and how they may be treated under the forthcoming EU Digital Markets Act.

Britain’s media watchdog agency Ofcom announced the investigation and said it will look into whether the two companies and Microsoft may have an unfair competitive advantage in the cloud services industry.

Specifically in the crosshairs of the inquiry are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which dominate global cloud storage services — a powerful tool that allows businesses to store data on remote servers accessible from anywhere as opposed to localized hard drives.
Depending on the findings of the investigation, the agency could take further action to rein in the corporate behemoths.
Other popular digital tools are also on the watchdog’s radar, including Meta’s WhatsApp, Apple’s Zoom and FaceTime and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa — services that so far have seen little, if any, regulatory oversight.

HR analytics software company Visier sued Google for trademark infringement in San Francisco federal court on Monday, claiming Google’s Vizier machine-learning software is likely to confuse potential consumers.
Vancouver-based Visier told the US District Court for the Northern District of California that the similarity of the companies’ names and products could mislead consumers into thinking that Google’s software uses Visier’s technology, or that Visier is “simply reselling or repackaging Google technology.”
Visier asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages and an order to block Google from using the Vizier name.
Google had no comment on the lawsuit. Visier and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Visier said in the lawsuit that its “people analytics” platform takes data and “applies cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to deliver insightful predictions.”
The company, founded in 2010, said one in three Fortune 500 companies use its software.
Google’s Vizier is a service for optimizing machine-learning models. Visier’s lawsuit said the internal Google software had been “relatively obscure” before being integrated with its Vertex AI machine-learning platform for developers last year.
Visier said it has discussed its infringement concerns with Google multiple times but was unable to resolve the claims.

Google has been asked by the Indian government and the central bank to introduce more stringent checks to help curb the use of illegal digital lending applications in India, according to sources.
Even though Google doesn’t fall under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ambit, the US tech giant has been called several times in the last few months to meetings by the central bank and the Indian government and urged to introduce tougher checks and balances that can help in weeding out such apps, according to four sources.
Indian regulators have already asked lenders to step up checks against illegal lending apps, which became popular during the pandemic. Regulators seek to control the proliferation of such apps that engage in unscrupulous activities such as charging excessive interest rates and fees or in recovery practices which are not authorised by the central bank or violate money laundering and other government guidelines.
Google said that last year it revised its Play Store developer program policy for financial services apps, including requiring additional requirements for personal loan apps in India effective September 2021.
“We have removed over 2,000 personal loan apps targeting India from the Play Store for violation of the Play policy requirements,” a Google spokesperson said, adding that such steps are taken if its policies are violated.

27,"September 19, 2022","Publishing Class-Action Cases May Mean Trouble For Google In UK, EU","


UK newspapers have this week been reporting that the law firm Humphries Kerstetter is planning to bring a class action case against Google in the next month, with a similar lawsuit being filed in parallel by lawyers in the EU.
The allegations against Google will be familiar to followers of the tech giant’s antitrust woes in the US, where the state attorney general office in Texas has been in protracted legal battles with Google since it first launched an investigation in 2020. 
That investigation threw light on the shady deal Alphabet made with Meta known as Jedi Blue, and is likely to have contributed toward decisions in the EU and the UK to launch similar probes this year.
Digital advertising is extraordinarily complex but the fundamentals are pretty easy to grasp. Websites possessing a few square inches of digital real estate need to match with advertisers willing to pay for the space. But publishers rarely negotiate directly with advertisers. Instead, intermediaries known as ad exchanges sit between buyers and sellers to match supply with demand.
The accusation against the current system is that Google has set itself up as buyer, seller, and marketplace, and is able to extract value from the whole process at each step of the way, often muscling out competitor services and driving prices up or down to increase its own profits.
In one notorious email unearthed by Texas investigators, a Google employee wrote that: “the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the New York Stock Exchange.”

Google Cloud has penned a multiyear strategic partnership with the healthcare company LifePoint Health in order to implement Google Cloud’s healthcare data engine in its hospitals.
LifePoint will utilize Google’s HDE to improve community-based healthcare delivery in the 29 states where the company operates. Clinicians will gain near real-time, globalized views of patients’ records as opposed to isolated data sets, according to a press release. With LifePoint’s far reach into rural communities, the partnership is expected to improve quality of care in historically marginalized populations, executives said. 
“LifePoint Health is fundamentally changing how healthcare is delivered at the community level,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, in a press release. “Bringing data together from hundreds of sources and applying AI and machine learning to it will unlock the power of data to make real-time decisions—whether it is around resource utilization, identifying high-risk patients, reducing physician burnout or other critical needs.”
Previously, LifePoint utilized myriad disparate electronic medical record systems. Google Cloud says its healthcare data engine offers a holistic view of patients provided by combining medical records, clinical trials and research data, along with other informational sources, in order to avoid gaps in knowledge.

By PYMNTS
It has not been a good news week for Google’s European business.
In a significant setback for Google’s attempts to overturn a 4.34 billion euro ($4.33 billion) antitrust fine, on Wednesday (Sep. 14), the European Union’s general court upheld a 2018 ruling against Google’s parent company, Alphabet, for unfairly taking advantage of the dominance of its Android operating system.
To make matters worse for the search giant, in the next big antitrust case on the horizon, the Guardian reported this week that Google’s practices in the ad tech industry could end up costing the company a further 25 billion euros ($24.96) billion in compensation thanks to class action lawsuits being brought in the Netherlands and the U.K.

Indonesia’s anti-trust agency (KPPU) said on Thursday it is investigating potential unfair business practices by Google over the use of proprietary payment services for its software distribution platform Google Play Store.
The move follows similar investigations by antitrust regulators globally involving Google.
“KPPU suspects that Google has conducted an abuse using its dominant position, conditional sales and discriminatory practices in digital application distribution in Indonesia,” it said in a statement.
An initial investigation found that since June 1 Indonesian app developers had been required to use Google’s payment system, which charges a 15% to 30% fee, the KPPU said.
The amount charged by Google Pay Billing is much higher than other services, which cost under 5% before the requirement took effect, it said.
If apps did not comply, they risked being removed from Google Play Store, it added.
KPPU said Google controlled a 93% market share in the country of 270 million people which has a fast growing digital economy.

A $37 billion lawsuit facing Google in the EU and UK over alleged anticompetitive conduct in digital advertising is being monitored by the Australian competition regulator as it finalises recommendations for new regulation of digital markets.
Google, a key player in digital advertising and provider of the ‘adtech’ which coordinates the sale of online advertising around the world, has again been accused of abusing its dominant position at the expense of online publishers.
On Tuesday, Belgian law firm Geradin Partners said it would lead actions on behalf of publishers for damages it estimates are up to €17 billion in the EU and up to £7 billion in the UK – around A$37 billion combined.
Google intends to fight the allegations it labelled as “speculative and opportunistic”.

South Korea has fined Google and Meta Platforms more than US$71 million collectively for gathering users’ personal information without consent for tailored ads, regulators said yesterday, the country’s highest-ever data protection fines.
Investigations into the two US technology giants found they had been “collecting and analyzing” data on their users, and monitoring their use of Web sites and applications, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission said.
The data was used to “infer the users’ interests or used for customized online advertisements,” the commission said.
Neither Google nor Meta had clearly informed South Korean users of this practice or obtained their consent in advance, the commission added.
As a result, Google was fined 69.2 billion won (US$49.7 million) and Meta 30.8 billion won.
“It is the largest fine for the violation of the Personal Information Protection Act,” the commission said in a statement.
Regulators said that the majority of the users in South Korea — 82 percent for Google and 98 percent for Meta — had unknowingly allowed them to collect data on their online use.
“It can be said that the possibility and the risk of infringement of the rights of the users are high,” the statement said.

The European Union’s General Court on Wednesday upheld an antitrust ruling against Google’s parent company, Alphabet, but reduced its fine to 4.125 billion euros ($4.12 billion) from 4.34 billion euros.
The dispute between Google and the EU courts is over whether it uses the Android operating system to quash competition, and was initiated against the company in 2015.
The court said it “largely confirms the European Commission’s decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine.”
In a statement provided to CNBC, Google said: “We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full. Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world.” 
The initial fine was issued by the European Commission in 2018 and was the largest ever for Google. It said that around 80% of Europeans used Android and that Google gave an unfair advantage to its apps, such as Chrome and Search, by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install them in a bundle with its app store, Play.

A US federal judge ruled on Tuesday that online search engine giant Google must face all but one of the numerous antitrust accusations regarding its online advertising business that were brought in a lawsuit by attorneys general for Texas and 16 other states.
In 2018 Google filed and subsequently won a motion to dismiss allegations that a cooperation agreement it struck with Facebook in 2018 was an unlawful restraint of trade, with US District Judge P. Kevin Castel saying the companies had valid business reasons for the deal.

Furthermore, they say the company used a deal with Facebook – known as ‘Jedi Blue’ –  to maintain its dominance when the publishers tried to develop an alternative system.

35,"September 13, 2022",US Inks Deal With Google To Make Chips,"


The United States Department of Commerce announced on Tuesday that its National Institute of Standards and Technology has signed a research and development (R&D) deal with Google to create and manufacture semiconductors.
According to the department’s written statement, those chips will be used by researchers “to develop new nanotechnology and semiconductor devices,” and made by SkyWater Technology at their manufacturing facility in Bloomington, Minnesota.
“This is a great example of how government, industry and academic researchers can work together to enhance US leadership in this critically important industry,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio commented.
Modern microelectronic devices are made of components that are stacked like layers in a cake, with the bottom layer being a semiconductor chip. The NIST/Google collaboration will make available a bottom-layer chip with specialized structures for measuring and testing the performance of the components placed on top of it, including new kinds of memory devices, nanosensors, bioelectronics and advanced devices needed for artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
NIST anticipates designing as many as 40 different chips optimized for different applications. Because the chip designs will be open source, researchers will be able to pursue new ideas without restriction and share data and device designs freely.
“Google has a long history of leadership in open-source,” said Will Grannis, CEO of Google Public Sector. “Moving to an open-source framework fosters reproducibility, which helps researchers from public and private institutions iterate on each other’s work. It also democratizes innovation in nanotechnology and semiconductor research.”

Google is being sued in the UK and the Netherlands where two suits have been announced today seeking damages on behalf of publishers who claim they have been harmed by anti-competitive adtech practices.
Per Reuters, publishers are seeking up to €25 billion in damages from Google for lost ad revenues via the litigation.
Google’s adtech has recently drawn scrutiny from antitrust regulators following complaints from publishers.
The French competition watchdog imposed a 220-million-euro fine on the company last year while the European Commission and its UK peer are investigating whether Google’s adtech business gives it an unfair advantage over rivals and advertisers.
“It is time that Google owns up to its responsibilities and pays back the damages it has caused to this important industry. That is why today we are announcing these actions across two jurisdictions to obtain compensation for EU and UK publishers,” Damien Geradin at law firm Geradin Partners said in a statement on Tuesday.

The US International Trade Commission said on Friday it would probe allegations brought by Alphabet’s Google against Sonosclaiming the home-audio company infringed on Google patents by importing certain audio components.
The agency did not say what specific products were allegedly imported in potential violation of US trade law. It said it had not yet made any decision on the merits of the case.
The new complaints add to an ongoing patent fight between the former partners over audio and smart-speaker technology, including lawsuits in California, Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
Sonos won an import ban on some Google devices from the trade commission in January. Last month, Google filed lawsuits in federal court in California saying Sonos’ new voice-assistant technology violates several Google patents. Sonos has called those lawsuits an “intimidation tactic.”

EU antitrust regulators have broadened the scope of their investigation into Google’s digital advertising business by taking over the Portuguese competition watchdog’s probe into the same issue.
While the European Commission kicked off its investigation in June last year, the Portuguese Competition Authority (AdC) only opened a probe in May this year following a complaint.
The Portuguese watchdog said the EU competition authority took over its case on July 27 in view of the scope and impact of the matter in question.
The Commission said it took note of the AdC’s announcement. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
AdC said its investigation focused on the market for publisher ad servers and the market for supply-side platforms, which allow publishers to manage the advertising space on their websites and to sell it through auctions or agreements with advertisers.
“There are indications that Google has used information not accessible by competitors on online advertisement auctions in order to change the outcome of those auctions in Google’s favour, and has possibly limited the development of competing auction technologies, among other competition restricting behaviours in the context of negotiations with publishers,” AdC said.

Google’s answer to enabling third-party payment options in the Google Play Store — User Choice Billing — is now being piloted in more countries to let developers of non-gaming Android apps test offering payment alternatives.
Developers will see the typical 15% to 30% service fee charged by Google drop by 4% when users opt to use a third-party billing option, according to multiple media outlets on Friday (Sept. 2). App developers who go that route will then have to deal with customer billing disputes.
Registered developers from the European Economic Area (EEA), India, Japan, Indonesia and Australia can participate in User Choice Billing as of Thursday (Sept. 1), according to Google’s enrollment page.
“Android has always been a uniquely open operating system and we continue to evolve our platform and increase the choices available to developers and users while maintaining our ability to invest in the ecosystem,” a Google spokesperson said.
“With this next phase of Google Play’s user choice billing pilot, all non-gaming developers can offer an additional billing choice alongside Play’s billing system for their users in Australia, Japan, India, Indonesia, and the European Economic Area.

This week the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling in favor of Google in an antitrust case brought by a would-be competitor in the online advertising market. 
The panel rejected the lower court’s September 2021 finding that Inform Inc.’s amended complaint was a “shotgun” pleading and that the company lacked standing to bring the suit, while remanding on the issue of sufficiency as to its seven antitrust causes of action.
The 18-page opinion recounted that Inform is a “digital media advertising company” that “manages the distribution and delivery of video advertisements from content creators into articles on newspaper, magazine, radio, and television websites.” At its peak, Inform reportedly managed ad space for approximately 5,000 publishers.
On This Topic: Data Privacy in Adtech: Boon or Bust?
U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee threw outInform’s amended complaint last year, determining that the lawsuit included“numerous conclusory, vague and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of action.”
Inform claims that Google uses its dominance in overlapping markets to “wipe out competition and drive its online ad sales.”
At the heart of the complaint were decisions Google and YouTube made in 2015 to switch the software used to play videos on websites from proprietary digital software developed by Adobe, Flash, to HTML5. Despite the latter being open-source, the change allegedly handed Google more control over “how, when, and what videos are played.”

Australia’s highest court overturned on Wednesday a ruling that had found Google engaged in defamation by supplying a link to a contested newspaper article, throwing the spotlight again on how online libel cases are handled in the country.
The seven-judge panel of the High Court of Australia voted 5-2 to throw out an earlier finding that the Alphabet unit played a part in publishing the disputed article by acting as a “library” housing it, saying the website had no active role.
The decision brings fresh confusion to a question that has been simmering in Australia for years about where liability rests for online defamation. A years-long review of the country’s libel law is yet to give a final recommendation on whether large platforms like Google and Meta Platforms’ Facebook should be accountable.
The case stems from a 2004 article which suggested that a criminal defence lawyer had crossed professional lines and become a “confidant” of criminals, according to the published judgment. The lawyer, George Defteros, found a link to the story in a 2016 Google search of his name and had Google remove it after it was viewed by 150 people, the judgment said.
Defteros sued in a state court which found Google was a publisher and ordered it to pay him A$40,000 ($28,056). Google appealed the judgment, culminating in Wednesday’s decision.
“The Underworld article was not written by any employee or agent of the appellant,” two of the panel judges wrote in Wednesday’s ruling, the appellant being Google.
“It was written by a reporter with no connection to the appellant, and published by an independent newspaper over which the appellant had no control or influence.”

Google has failed to take down scam ads that violate its policies, according to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., chair of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection.
In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, Blumenthal wrote that Google’s policies about deceptive ads “often appear to be dead letter law” because of its lack of enforcement.
“I am deeply concerned that Google appears unwilling to protect consumers and small businesses on Google Ads, and has demonstrated inadequate due diligence against fraud and abuse,” he wrote.
Blumenthal’s letter cites a 2021 article from The Markup that found Google ran ads made to look like government websites in violation of its own policies. At the time, a Google spokesperson told the publication it removed the violating ads.
But Blumenthal said his office recently found deceptive ads using the same keywords mentioned in the article. His staff also found ads for misleading health treatments, he added.
Google has in the past added verification processes meant to limit impersonation of government services, like getting a passport.
But Blumenthal charged that the continued existence of deceptive ads burdens small businesses by making it harder and more expensive for their sites to surface in search results, while padding Google’s pockets.

Google again postponed deprecation of the third-party tracking cookie, this time until the second half of 2024. While Apple blocked third-party cookies several years ago, Google has postponed the process for the Chrome browser numerous times as it works with digital advertisers and technology vendors to agree on a replacement for anonymized audience tracking it calls the Privacy Sandbox.
Google is likely to be sued by the US Department of Justice in September on the grounds that its advertising network is a monopoly. What that means for marketers isn’t yet clear, but there are steps they can take to prepare for disruptions.
EU antitrust authorities have kept watch on how Google handles third-party cookie deprecation and display advertising practices for more than a year, voicing concerns that Google’s ad network may control too much of the European market.
Google’s cookie delays and the impending DoJ antitrust suit likely are unconnected, even though they happened close together, said Liz Miller, Constellation Research analyst. Google is caught in a riptide between two factions of government regulators: Those who want to protect consumer privacy, and those who want to level the playing field for small and midsize businesses that have been priced out of search engine exposure.

“Our investigation found that there are a number of alternative suppliers of cybersecurity and cloud platform products.

Google announced its intention to acquire all of the issued shares in Mandiant, Inc. on March 7, 2022. The tech company is known for supplying software and internet-based products globally and in Australia.
Meanwhile, Mandiant provides cybersecurity consulting services and other internet security products such as software and managed services globally and in Australia. Both companies are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.

Google may soon be facing its second antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice. According to Bloomberg, the DOJ is gearing up to sue the tech giant as soon as September after a year of looking into whether it’s been using its dominant position to illegally control the digital ad market. 
The Justice Department’s lawyers have reportedly been conducting another round of interviews to glean additional information that could help make their case stronger. These new interviews are expected to build on previous ones conducted much earlier on in the investigation. 
The Justice Department first filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company back in 2020, accusing it of having an unfair monopoly over search and search-related advertising. For that particular case, the agency argued that forcing Android phone manufacturers to set Google as the default search engine prevents rivals from gaining traction and ensures that the company will earn an enormous amount of money from search-related advertising.

EU antitrust regulators have asked app developers whether Alphabet unit Google’s threat to remove apps from its Play Store if they use other payment options instead of its own billing system has hurt their business, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Questionnaires were sent to developers last month, the people said. Of the 16 questions in the document, some covered the period 2017-2021 and others 2019-2021. The European Commission declined to comment. Google did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The US tech giant has said apps would be removed from its app store starting June this year if developers do not use its billing system.

52,"August 3, 2022",Brussels Is Investigating Google Play Store: Reports,"


The European Commission’s antitrust enforcers are investigating Google’s app store rules, according to two people close to the matter. 
Google’s rivals have received confidential questionnaires from Brussels, probing billing terms and developer fees for the U.S. tech giant’s Play Store, the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
An investigation in the Netherlands into Google’s Play Store rules will likely be closed to make way for the EU examination, the people added, as concerns of anticompetitive conduct will need to be examined on an EU-wide scale. The United Kingdom’s competition watchdog has also an open investigation into Google Play Store.

53,"August 2, 2022",Judge Rules Rumble’s Antitrust Suit Against Google Can Proceed,"


A California judge says video service Rumble can proceed with the early stages of an antitrust suit against Google. Rumble sued Google in 2021, alleging that it favored its own YouTube video platform in search results and the Android operating system.
Google urged the court to split the suit’s arguments and dismiss substantial parts of the reasoning as well as strike parts of the suit related to Android app preinstallation. Judge Haywood Gilliam declined to do so late last week, putting the case on track to proceed — although it could still be dismissed before it reaches trial.
Rumble’s suit overlaps with several ongoing Big Tech controversies. The company takes aim at Google’s deals with Android phone makers, who typically agree to preinstall bundles of Google apps and limit non-Google app pre-installations or changes to the operating system, sometimes in ways that antitrust watchdogs have found unlawful. It also alleges that Google unfairly loads the top results of searches for videos with YouTube links, burying Rumble results — similar to complaints made by “vertical” search engine providers over the past decades.
“Rumble’s success … has been far less than it could and should have been as a direct result of Google’s unlawful anticompetitive, exclusionary and monopolistic behavior,” the complaint asserts.
Rumble is also part of a conservative-friendly web ecosystem that has catered (with varying levels of exclusivity) to right-leaning users who claim they’ve been censored on larger platforms like Google. It filed its suit around the same time alternative social network Parler attempted to sue Amazon on antitrust grounds, but while that suit made some fairly tenuous claims about competition, Rumble’s plays on widely acknowledged concerns about Google’s ecosystem. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have both pushed for legislation that could limit the kind of “self-preference.

Google was among the last remaining tech platforms yet to comply with Indonesia’s new licensing rules late on Wednesday, hours from a deadline to sign up and avoid having its services blocked in the country.
Registration is required under rules released in late 2020 that would give authorities broad powers to compel platforms to disclose data of certain users and take down content deemed unlawful or that “disturbs public order” within four hours if urgent, and 24 hours if not.
With a young, tech-savvy population of 270 million, Indonesia is a top-10 market in terms of user numbers for a host of social media companies.
“We are aware of the regulation’s requirements, and are in the process of taking appropriate action towards compliance,” a Google representative said, without elaborating.
The communications ministry has said firms that do not register before midnight Wednesday will be reprimanded, fined, and then blocked – a decision that will be reversed once they sign up.
While the ministry did not say when the block would take effect, it is unlikely to be immediate.
Twitter was among the latest companies to be added to a communications ministry list of foreign providers that have signed up.
In a statement on Wednesday afternoon the company said it had “taken appropriate steps to comply”.

New internal documents released by the US House Judiciary Committee have revealed how Amazon, Facebook and Google favoured their own products and abused their dominance to suppress competition from their rivals.The new documents include internal Facebook documents, showing the company views itself as dominant in the social networking market and insulates itself from competitive threats.“Other newly-released documents include Google internal communications demonstrating how it leverages its control over the Android mobile operating system to prevent smartphone manufacturers from introducing products or services that compete with Google’s family of mobile apps,” the House Judiciary Committee said in a statement on Tuesday.Internal Amazon documents demonstrate how Amazon’s abuses its dominance over e-commerce to coerce third-party sellers to purchase other services from Amazon, such as fulfillment and distribution.“From Amazon and Facebook to Google and Apple, there’s no question that these unregulated tech giants have become too big to care and too powerful to ever put people over profits,” said House Antitrust Subcommittee Vice Chair, Pramila Jayapal (D-WA).“This report is clear: it’s time for Congress to act to protect consumers and promote competition.

58,"July 19, 2022","New Documents May Aid Antitrust Case Against Google, Amazon","


Internal documents from Google and Amazon provided to Politico, show new examples of how the companies favor their own products over competitors’,  adding ammunition to the push for Congress to toughen antitrust laws.
The documents,  which include emails, memos and strategy papers, were shared by the House Judiciary committee, which obtained them as part of its long-running antitrust investigation of Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta that wrapped in October 2020 with a 450-page staff report. The documents were cited in the report, but had not previously been made available.
The documents bolster the committee’s claims that the internet giants illegally favor their own products, a practice that pending legislation to update antitrust laws would make more difficult.
“It is time for Congress to act,” Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David N. Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement.
Heavily redacted internal Google documents appear to show, for example, how Google pressured mobile phone makers including Samsung to prioritize its own apps on their devices.
In a January 2014 email about recent meetings in South Korea with Samsung and LG, a Google executive describes “grave concerns” about a new Samsung service “competing with our core search experience.” Yet Google appeared open to Samsung launching a “smart assistant” service in China, where Google’s offerings are not available.
The newly released material, which also include emails and other documents from Amazon and Meta-owned Facebook, arrives as pressure is building on Congress, and in particular Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to pass a bill that would block the internet giants from favoring their own products and services over those of competitors who rely on their platforms.

59,"July 19, 2022",Google Faces $1B Suit In UK Over App Store Practices,"


Google is facing trial in a $1.1 billion class-action lawsuit in the U.K. over claims that the company overcharged 19.5 million customers for app store purchases.
As Reuters reported Tuesday (July 19), the suit alleged Google abused its position by charging users commissions of up to 30% on apps such as Candy Crush and Tinder.
The suit, which is not expected to go to court before 2024, was brought by Liz Coll, a former digital policy manager at the non-profit group Citizens Advice. She alleged the Play Store commission is unlawful and in violation of British and European competition laws, and that Google had exploited its dominant position at the cost of U.K. Android users.
This case is one of many instances of regulators and consumers taking steps to rein in Big Tech companies like Google and Apple over alleged anti-competitive practices. The European Union alone has fined Google more than 8 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in the past few years over anti-trust tactics.
The past few weeks have seen the company make a series of concessions to regulators, such as offering to break up its ad business, in hopes of fending off court action.
The suit comes one day after the filing of an American lawsuit that accuses Google rival Apple of violating antitrust laws by using its Apple Pay to illegally profit from payment card issuers, making $1 billion a year in fees.
That case, filed Monday (July 18) by Hagens Berman and Sperling & Slater, seeks to represent a class of credit unions and financial institutions in the U.S. that issue cards designed to be used in tandem with Apple Pay.
“In the Android ecosystem, where multiple digital wallets compete, there are no issuer fees whatsoever, ” read the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. “The upshot is that card issuers pay a reported $1 billion annually in fees on Apple Pay and $0 for accessing functionally identical Android wallets. If Apple faced competition, it could not sustain these substantial fees.”

Russia imposed a nearly $365 million fine (21.1 billion rubles) on Google for failing to delete YouTube videos that go against the country’s laws, as reported earlier by Reuters. 
In a translated press release, Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor states that YouTube didn’t follow orders to remove “prohibited content,” which includes videos “promoting extremism and terrorism,” as well as supposedly false information about the war in Ukraine.
In March, the Roskomnadzor threatened to charge Google over its failure to remove “illegal” YouTube videos, stating the fee would start at 8 million rubles (~$94,675 USD at the time), with the possibility to climb to 20 percent of Google’s annual revenue. 
The 21.1 billion rubles reflects a chunk of Google’s yearly turnover in the country, but it’s unclear if Google will actually go through with paying the fine. Google didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.
Google announced its plans to shut down its Russian operations in May, stating that government authorities seized its assets in the country and that it would be “untenable” to keep the branch functional. The search giant’s Russian subsidiary officially filed for bankruptcy last month.

61,"July 17, 2022",DOJ To Reject Google Concessions: Report,"


According to reports, the DOJ is getting ready to sue Google again for antitrust violations related to claims that its advertising technology division is restricting competition. 
The Google ad tech platform is a market for buying and selling advertising on websites and mobile applications. But since it controls the market, it has been under investigation lately. As a result, officials will likely revoke the search engine giant’s prior concessions to avoid a legal dispute.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday (July 8), citing individuals familiar with the situation, that Alphabet Inc.’s Google has provided concessions to prevent this U.S. antitrust lawsuit accusing the firm of abusing its weight in the advertising technology industry.
Google said earlier this week to Android Central that it has been collaborating with authorities to alleviate their worries. A corporate spokesman insisted that Google had no intentions to divest itself of its troubled advertising division.
The antitrust case might be filed soon. If granted, Google will face another antitrust complaint. Additionally, the Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether Google unlawfully blocks external ad servers.
Last month, European Consumer Organization (BEUC), a consumer rights organization in Europe, filed a wave of privacy complaints against Google, charging the advertising behemoth with misleading account creation design that they claim leads users to consent to intrusive and excessive data processing.
Google seems to depend on user permission as its legal justification for profiling account users for ad targeting reasons. 
The GDPR regulations in Europe are meant to make it simple for users to choose privacy-protecting settings. Still, according to the complaint, Google allegedly breaks this guideline when you establish an account. Additionally, it highlights that Android users must have a Google account to download programs from Google Play.

Italy’s competition authority AGCM said on Thursday it had launched an investigation against Google for suspected abuse of its dominant position in data portability, an accusation the Alphabet unit denied.
The watchdog said in a statement that Google allegedly hindered interoperability with other platforms, particularly with Weople, an app by Italian operator Hoda, which could “constrain the economic benefits that consumers can derive from their data” and limit competition.
Giving such access, it said, would mean “putting people’s privacy at risk, as well as encouraging fraudulent activities. There are already ways for companies to increase direct portability of data in their services.”
Under Italian law, Google faces a fine of up to 10% of its annual global sales if found guilty of abusing its position.

South Africa’s Competition Commission, which has been probing online markets for the past 14 months, has provisionally found that Google’s search-engine practices distort competition in the company’s favor.
Paid-for results that typically appear at the top of a Google search should be prominently labeled as advertising and the top of the page reserved for results based on relevance only, the antitrust group said in a statement. 
The inquiry also recommended the U.S. giant — part of Alphabet Inc. — allows competitors to compete for prominence in a search by having their own specialist units and with no guaranteed positions for Google’s own products. It’s also exploring whether Google Search should remain the default position on South African mobile devices.
Google will review the report, and work “constructively” with the Competition Commission to answer their questions, the company said in an emailed response to questions.  
“Our mission is to organize information and make it universally accessible and useful,” Google said. “That’s why we invest in products like Search, Gmail and Maps to help people in South Africa every day.”

Lawyers for Google questioned the DOJ’s and state plaintiffs’ bid to conduct new depositions of senior executives who have already spoken with government attorneys as part of their antitrust lawsuit over the tech companies’ search practices.
Google’s lawyers argued in a court filing in Washington, DC, federal court that the federal and state antitrust lawyers leading the case against the tech company had not justified their effort to open up new depositions.
The dispute marks a new flashpoint in the case, as the sides have quarreled for months over access to documents and other information. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday before US District Judge Amit Mehta.
The government said it wanted to speak again with, among others, Prabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president for Google search, and Philipp Schindler, chief business officer. Neither immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The DOJ’s attorneys and lawyers for the states, including a team from the Colorado Attorney General’s office, said the new round of questioning was warranted because Google only recently turned over new documents that the company previously had said could be kept from the plaintiffs.
“Google improperly withheld thousands of documents under false claims of privilege,” DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer told the court in a new filing. “Google’s withholding of these documents was the culminating effort — following years of intentionally mislabeling documents — to hide significant information from civil discovery.”

66,"July 11, 2022",Google May Break Up $209B Ad-Tech Unit To Appease Regulators,"
As one of the most powerful companies in online searches and digital advertising, Google is accustomed to regulatory risks stemming from new legislation, antitrust probes or litigation. However, for the last few months, the company seems to have adopted a more collaborative approach with regulators and policymakers to manage, and eventually reduce, these regulatory risks. 
The latest example is the concessions offered by the company to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fend off a possible U.S. antitrust lawsuit aimed at its ad-tech business, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
One of these commitments is a proposal to split off the part of its business that auctions and places ads on websites and apps, although the new entity would still be kept under the Alphabet umbrella. Google holds a strong position in most of the different parts of the ad-tech business, from the supply side to the demand side — and the marketplace where the orders from both sides are exchanged. However, it is unclear whether any commitment that falls short of selling part of the business to a third party would satisfy DOJ officials.  
DOJ could be readying a lawsuit against Google alleging that the company’s ad-tech practices are anticompetitive. This wouldn’t be the first time that the company has faced antitrust issues for its ad-tech business. In 2019, the U.K. Competition Market Authority (CMA) launched a market study in digital advertising, and it found that “competition in these markets was not working well.” The report showed that because of the position of Google (and Facebook) on the ad-tech chain, the market was not competitive, and prices were higher than could have been otherwise. As a result, the CMA recommended the government to pass new legislation to address this issue. 
In Europe, Google also faces another ad-tech investigation. The company also made an offer to settle the allegations that is using its strong position on YouTube to force advertisers to use Google’s ad-buying tools to access the video sharing platform. With its latest concessions, Google would allow competitors to access YouTube directly — but it didn’t offer to sell parts of the business to third parties. 
The ad-tech business is not the only area of the business where Google is offering concessions to defuse antitrust risks. For instance, on June 30 the company announced in its blog an agreement with a group of U.S. developers to avoid costly and lengthy litigation about terms and conditions of the Google Play Store, including the fees charged. Google not only offered economic relief as part of the settlement, but it also offered app developers more powers to reach customers and allowed developers to install other app stores in Android devices. 
The concessions in Europe and the U.S. show that the company may be willing to increase the scope of potential remedies to appease regulators and avoid lengthy antitrust probes and litigation.  
Offering concessions isn’t new for Google. It has done it in the past, even in the investigations that concluded with an antitrust fine. The difference, arguably, is that the company is now willing to offer a more comprehensive package to appease regulators and eventually avoid a probe or litigation where it is more difficult for Google to control the outcome and negotiate a remedy. 
Additionally, Google, as well as other Big Tech firms, is facing new antitrust bills that will regulate online platforms and limit to a certain extent some of their practices. In Europe, these bills were approved last week, and they may be fully implemented in 18 months. In the U.S., the proposed legislation is on the Senate, and it could be voted on soon.

A new U.S. antitrust bill targeting Big Tech companies might be doomed to stay in the Senate if it doesn’t pass before Congress’ summer recess, Seeking Alpha reported Sunday (July 10).
Called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, it was intended to cut back on tech giants’ ability to favor their own services over those of competitors. The legislation, which has backing from the U.S. Justice Department, could impact companies like Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon.
The act, sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, could end up delayed as a previously waylaid reconciliation package takes over everyone’s attention, according to a CTFN report cited by Seeking Alpha.
According to Klobuchar, the bill has the 60 votes it needs to pass the Senate. However, the office of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said it’s trying to still get the correct support for the bill in the Senate.
Per prior reports from CTFN, the decision for a floor vote for the bill will come down to whether Schumer will put the time into it or not. The report also noted that Republican senators could be looking at adding more amendments to the act to “complicate and delay” things, according to CTFN.
The debate over how to rein in Big Tech has been going on for some time, with much of the debate devoted to the American Choice and Innovation Online Act.
PYMNTS wrote that a big part of this debate is the question of how companies should or should not use their data — including things like not using the data to favor their own products or hurt competitors’. There are also questions over who will have access to the data and where it should be shared.

69,"July 5, 2022",Google Opens Up Google Play Store Ahead of Potential Legislation,"


On June 30, Google announced in its blog an agreement with a group of U.S. developers to avoid costly and lengthy litigation about terms and conditions of the Google Play Store, including the fees charged. The proposed settlement, which still has to be approved by a court, will establish a $90 million fund to support U.S. developers who earned $2 million or less through Google Play during each year from 2016 to 2021.
But more important than the monetary relief, at least for the regulatory community, is the other commitments that Google is offering in the settlement that come at a crucial moment when important antitrust bills are discussed at Capitol Hill, namely, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act.
The former, which seeks to impose restrictions on how online platforms may display search results or how they rank their products in their online marketplaces seem to have gained momentum and different lawmakers have claimed that the bill could be sent to a Senate vote soon.
The Open App Markets Act, which will largely affect Google and Apple’s app stores, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee vote in February but the bill hasn’t enjoyed the same push in recent months and it is yet unclear when it will be sent for a full Senate vote. If approved, it would give app developers more power to reach their customers without the control of Google and Apple. The bill would allow app developers to directly reach users, to communicate with them to offer them products or sales, to offer alternative payment methods, circumventing the Big Tech’s own in-app payment systems, which in turn, it could affect the commissions paid to Apple and Google.
However, the settlement reached by Google and a group of U.S. developers included a few commitments that already go in that direction, and it could also signal how far Google is willing to go to minimize the impact of any potential legislation affecting its Google Play store in the U.S.
For instance, according to the announcement, Google will continue with a tiered pricing model, maintaining its 15% commission frate for the first $1 million in annual revenue from the app store, rather than the original 30%. It is worth noting that Google and Apple have already offered a reduced 15% commission to small developers that generate less than $1 million in revenue from Google Play.
A second commitment is that Google will change its Developer Distribution Agreement, which has been challenged in many courts around the world, “to make it clear that developers can continue to use contact information obtained in-app to communicate with users out-of-app, including about subscription offers or lower-cost offerings on a rival app store or the developer’s website. This means that, for instance, Spotify or Epic could reach its users to offer them subscriptions at a lower price in their own websites or app stores. The commitment doesn’t seem to go as far as offering developers the option to communicate with users in Google’s app. This is something that the Open App Markets Act could change.
Another important commitment offered by Google is the possibility for people to use other app stores on their android devices. This seems to open Android to other app stores. Yet, Google added that this would be possible “while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place,” which may translate into a limitation to download certain apps.
While this settlement is only binding for a group of developers, and needs to be approved by the court, it may show the way for both Google and developers moving forward if the Open Markets App Act doesn’t become law or until it is applicable.

They are increasingly the main way we interact with friends and family, access news, play games, buy products and services online – and now pay for them in shops. Love it or loathe it, our phones have become a key gateway for people and UK businesses alike. Moreover, for some of the poorest households in the country they are the only way to get online and a vital lifeline to essential public resources and services.  This makes the fact that the systems upon which these devices rely are almost entirely controlled by just 2 companies – Apple and Google – concerning. Apple and Google are the gatekeepers to everything coming through our phones, creating a digital stranglehold that is only getting stronger over time.
The problems uncovered in our Mobile Ecosystems Market Study
The powerful position Apple and Google have in these markets, and their impact on competition, has been the subject of our year-long study into mobile ecosystems covering operating systems, browsers and apps on our mobile devices. We concluded that it is extremely difficult for rivals such as other browsers or alternative app stores to compete. Tens of thousands of small businesses reliant on these ecosystems, such as app and web developers, are entirely at the whim of the rules and processes set by these 2 companies.

Consumer groups in Europe have filed complaints against Google for using “deceptive design, unclear language and misleading choices” in its sign-up process, the European Consumer Organization (BEUC) said in a press release. 
“Contrary to what Google claims about protecting consumers’ privacy, tens of millions of Europeans have been placed on a fast track to surveillance when they signed up to a Google account,” said BEUC deputy director Ursula Pachl.
Europe’s GDPR rules are supposed to make it easy to choose settings that protect your privacy, but Google violates that principal when you create an account, it claims. It also emphasizes that having a Google account is a must for the Android users if they want to get apps from Google Play.
Signup is the critical point at which Google makes users indicate their ‘choices’ about how their Google account will operate. With only one step, the consumer activates all the account settings that feed Google’s surveillance activities. Google does not provide consumers with the option to turn all settings ‘off’ in one click,” the BEUC wrote.
If you do want more privacy-friendly options, you have to use manual personalization involving “five steps with nine clicks and grappling with information that is unclear, complete and misleading,” it added.

73,"June 29, 2022",Apple & Google Hit With Class Actions By Australian Apps,"


Apple and Google Android users in Australia are suing the California-based technology giants, alleging they used their market power to force app developers to use their payment systems, resulting in higher prices for consumers.
Twin legal actions allege Apple and Google have “a substantial degree of power in the markets for the purchase” of apps via the App Store and Google Play Store respectively, and the in-app purchase of content.
The two tech giants allegedly used their market power in the distribution of apps in Australia to force developers to use Apple and Google payment systems for apps and in-app purchases, then charged commissions of 30 per cent, or in some limited cases 15 per cent.
The class actions on behalf of consumers alleged this conduct breached Australian Consumer Law and resulted in higher prices than if competition was allowed in payment methods for apps and in-app purchases.
It is alleged Apple and Google had superior bargaining positions to app developers; took advantage of that position to breach consumer law; required developers to enter into non-negotiable, standard contracts that the tech giants would unilaterally amend; and the conduct was not necessary to protect their business interests.
The lawsuits include estimates that 55 per cent of the 20.6 million smartphones in Australia are iPhones and 45 percent of people use phones with the Android operating system.

74,"June 27, 2022",Google Endorses Bill To Limit White House Data Demands,"
Big Tech companies have been embroiled in legislative discussions in Washington D.C. for more than a year. Most of their attention has been devoted to discussing the pros and cons of a particular piece of proposed antitrust legislation: the American Choice and Innovation Online Act. 
At the center of the debate surrounding this bill, and around similar bills that seek to regulate how Big Tech firms operate their platforms, is how companies should use their data — or rather, how not to use it (for instance, not using the data to favor its own products in detriment of its competitors) — and who has access to it, like how much data from online advertising or data from the app stores should be shared with third parties.  
But on Thursday, June 23, Ken Walker, Google’s president of Global Affairs, wrote an opinion on the company’s blog sending a message to the government that citizens should know who has access to their data, even if it is the government who demands access to it. 
In the post, Walker commended the bipartisan House passage of the NDO (non-disclosure orders) Fairness Act, a bill sponsored by Chairman Nadler and Representative Fitzgerald that would make improvements to the Stored Communications Act. 
The Stored Communications Act sets the rules that control government demands to providers to disclose information about their users. One of those rules lets the government seek orders to prevent providers like Google from telling users about the demands for data. These so-called NDO or “gag orders” have become commonplace, Walker said. 
According to Walker, the company has seen an increased use of NDOs, what means that providers can’t notify users their data has been shared until long after compliance, if ever, and people don’t have the opportunity to go to court to contest disclose orders. NDOs can cover requests for data of well-established reputable organizations, even though notifying the company is highly unlikely to do harm, Walker argued: “It is time to reform this practice, requiring more robust review before gag orders are issued.”
By endorsing the NDO Fairness Act, Google is seeking more transparency for users and the public, the company said. The proposed bill would provide for strict scrutiny analysis to grant a gag order request, it would establish time limits to the order (30-day limit) and it would require firms to notify the customer within 72 hours of the expiration of the delay, including what information was disclosed. Additionally, providers like Google could contest gag orders in court. 
Public demands for data and adequate protection of citizens’ data against abuses may acquire a new dimension in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v Wade. As many as thirteen states have trigger bans in place that will outlaw abortion. Big Tech firms may find themselves in the middle of legal battles about how their data may be used to track and locate abortion clinics, individuals or other providers that could facilitate an activity that will now be illicit. The Supreme Court ruling didn’t change the rules for data collection, but it surely added more food for thought about how to assess government and public prosecutors demands for citizens’ data.

Google faces an antitrust complaint on Monday by Danish online job-search rival Jobindex, which told European Union regulators the Alphabet-owned business had allegedly unfairly favoured its own job-search service.
The complaint could reinvigorate EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s scrutiny of the service, Google for Jobs. Three years ago, Vestager said she was looking into the issue but she has yet to take any action.
The European Commission said it would assess the complaint according to the standard procedures. Jobindex’s action comes four years after German media group Axel Springer’s jobs portal Stepstone filed a similar complaint against Google.
Google, which has been fined more than 8 billion euros ($8.4 billion) by Vestager in recent years for various anti-competitive practices, says it partners with job providers to direct people to websites with job listings relevant to them.
“Any jobs provider, big or small, is able to take part and companies are seeing increased traffic and job matches as a result of this feature,” a Google spokesperson said.
Launched in Europe in 2018, Google for Jobs triggered criticism from 23 online job-search websites in 2019. They said they had lost market share after the online search giant had allegedly used its market power to push its new service.

76,"June 26, 2022",Italian Data Protection Authority Latest to Rule Against Google Analytics,"


To add to its antitrust headaches, EU-wide pressure on website operators to restrain their usage of Google continues to put pressure on the company.
The Italian data protection authority, the GDPD, has ruled that the use of Google Analytics by Caffeina Media Srl is in breach of the EU’s GDPR legislation.
The issue relates to the way Google Analytics transfers browser data to the U.S. for processing. The authority makes the case that the wholesale export of data including IP address, browser information, OS, screen resolution, language selection, plus the date and time of the site visit, does not offer the necessary level GDPR mandated protection against surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.
In a statement, the GDPD said it “draws the attention of all Italian managers of websites, public and private, to the illegality of transfers made to the United States through GA.”
The decision follows a similar ruling by the French data protection watchdog, the CNIL, on June 8. The CNIL has issued its own updated guidance cautioning against uses of Google Analytics that would send personal data to the U.S.
Legal issues centered on Google Analytics have been brewing since a 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield. Intended as a legal framework for data-sharing between the European Union and the United States, the ECJ struck the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield down over the risk of unlawful access to Europeans’ data by U.S. intelligence agencies.

The ongoing battle between Google and Russian regulators continued on Wednesday, as the country’s communications agency said the tech giant could be fined again for not deleting banned content, according to Reuters.
Regulator Roskomnadzor said that Google’s YouTube video-sharing site has “deliberately” promoted content it says is “misleading information about the progress of the special military operation in Ukraine,” while adding that it is “discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation.”
In late February, Russia invaded Ukraine, an action it calls a “special military operation.” Roskomnadzor added that a second fine could result in a levy of between 5% and 10% of annual turnover in Russia, with the exact amount determined by a court.
Google has already been fined once in Russia, receiving a levy of more than 7B roubles ($143M) for failing to delete illegal content late last year.
Last week, it was reported that Google’s Russian subsidiary had filed for bankruptcy. Despite the bankruptcy filing, free Google services, such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and Google Play will remain accessible in Russia,.
Separately last week, a Russian government official said that he expected Google to remain in the country.
The official who made the comments, Anton Gorelkin, the deputy head of the State Duma committee on information policy, added that Moscow did not intend to block its video-sharing site, YouTube.
Google parent Alphabet recently allowed advertising rivals to place ads on YouTube – a concession that offered a path to settle an EU antitrust investigation without a fine.

Google has committed to resolving a copyright dispute in France over online content, the country’s antitrust authority said on Tuesday.
Google, owned by Alphabet, also dropped its appeal against a 500 million euro ($528 million) fine, the authority said. The fine was paid last year.
The decision ends the authority’s investigation into Google, which has agreed to talk with news agencies and other publishers about paying them for using their news on its platform.
Google will commit to a remuneration proposal within three months of the start of negotiations, and if no agreement can be found, the matter will be settled by a court.
The US company will also ensure the negotiations will have no impact on the way the news is presented on its search pages.
The ruling comes as international pressure mounts on online platforms such as Google and Facebook to share more revenue with news outlets.
“The authority believes that the commitments made by Google have the characteristics to address the competition concerns,” France’s Autorite de la Concurrence said in its ruling.
The head of the antitrust authority, Benoit Coeure, said the ruling would be closely examined by other European countries.

Google is under investigation by Germany’s antitrust watchdog amid concerns over potentially illegal terms for the use of its maps platform.
The Federal Cartel Office said Tuesday it opened a formal probe after initial findings suggest that the US giant is limiting options to use alternative map providers when app developers and other businesses seek to combine their offerings with maps. The regulator is also looking at the terms for Google’s Automotive Services, according to the statement.
Andreas Mundt, president of the watchdog, said it had reason to believe that Google “may be restricting the combination of its own map services with third-party map services, for example when it comes to embedding Google Maps location data, the search function or Google Street View into maps not provided by Google”.
The move comes after the Federal Cartel Office in January classified Google´as a company of “paramount significance across markets”, paving the way for the authorities to clamp down on any potentially anti-competitive activities.
Parallel proceedings are already ongoing to examine Google’s terms and conditions for data processing and its news offer Google News Showcase.
An amendment of the German Competition Act came into force last year, allowing the authority to intervene earlier, particularly against huge digital companies.
The watchdog has also classified Meta, the company that owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, as a company of “paramount significance across markets”.

The Japanese government is set to levy fines against 48 tech companies including Twitter, Facebook- owner Meta Platforms and Alphabet Inc’s Google for failing to register their headquarters in the country, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
In early June, the Ministry of Justice reiterated its request that some companies register their global headquarters in Japan by June 13. The ministry said that it would ask courts to fine the companies if they still have no intention of registering.
If IT companies have their headquarters registered in Japan, consumers would have an easier time filing lawsuits when problems, such as defamation on social media websites, occur. The government believes proper registration is essential to protect consumers.
Japan’s corporate code requires overseas companies doing business in the country on a continuous basis to register a headquarters in Japan. Overseas IT companies maintain that they are providing their services through the internet and are not continuously developing their business by establishing bases in Japan. These companies also appear to have insisted they believe it is enough to register their Japan-based units, such as those handling marketing operations.

82,"June 15, 2022",Why Tech Regulators Need to Think Like Google,"
As many of the world’s largest companies are platform-based technology companies, there has been a growing push worldwide to regulate these companies to address issues arising from economic, political and communications power. At the same time, their distinctive platform business models raise new challenges to regulators, such as what industries they are in, what problems connect to which regulatory authority, and who has jurisdictional authority and regulatory capacity. The paper argues that regulators increasingly need to “think like Google”: they need to be able to adopt holistic strategies that can apply across industry silos and different regulatory responsibilities. There is also a need to empower the notion of regulation in the public interest, to challenge the ideational power of tech companies that they are superior stewards of public good to government agencies.

I. The Challenge of Platform Business Models
The 2020s have been a period where the policy spotlight has been thrown upon the power of Big Tech. The reasons are not surprising. Platform-based technology companies experienced phenomenal growth during the 2010s and early 2020s, to become the world’s largest companies and most valuable brands.
According to Kantar BrandZ, the seven most valuable brands in 2021 were platform-based technology companies (in order): Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tencent, Facebook, and Alibaba.[2] They sit alongside a slew of other tech-base...

84,"June 6, 2022","Google Is Liable for Content Posted Online, Australian Court Says","


An Australian court found search engine giant Google liable for defamatory videos posted on its YouTube platform that targeted a senior politician, a reminder that social media companies could be held responsible in some jurisdictions for what users put online. 
The ruling revives the question of how much culpability technology firms have for defamation conveyed by users on their websites in Australia, one of few Western nations where online platforms have the same legal responsibility as publishers.
Australia is reviewing what legal exposure platforms should have for defamatory posts. A landmark case in 2021, where a newspaper was found liable for defamatory reader comments below an article posted on Facebook, drove global firms to reduce their social media presence in the country.
The judgment showed Google had denied the videos carried defamatory imputations, and said the YouTuber had the right to an honestly held opinion and should be protected by the right to criticise a politician.”They (Google) were advised that those defamatory videos were there, they looked into it, they decided for themselves that they weren’t, and left them up,” said Prof David Rolph, a specialist in media law at the University of Sydney Law School.
The conflict over defamation and liability adds to the already fraught relationship between Google and Australia’s media and regulators. The country has been at the forefront of confronting the dominance of Big Tech in journalism, with a landmark ruling last year forcing Google and Facebook to pay news organizations for using their content, one of the main drivers of traffic to these platforms.

Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Friday it had opened administrative cases against Google and six other foreign technology companies for alleged violations of personal data legislation.

The UK’s competition regulator has opened a fresh investigation into Google, taking aim at the company’s role in the advertising technology market.
It’s the second major antitrust probe to target Google’s ad practices in the UK The Competition and Markets Authority launched a separate investigation with the European Union into Google and Facebook parent company Meta earlier this year over concerns that a 2018 pact between the two companies known as “Jedi Blue”  restricted competition in digital advertising.
The CMA said Thursday it was assessing whether Google’s role in the ad tech industry may be distorting competition. The internet giant is a dominant player in the online ad market.
Google acts as both a demand-side platform, which offers publishers’ ad inventory to marketers, and an ad exchange, which lets advertisers compete for advertising space on publishers’ websites, the CMA said. It also runs ad servers which manage publishers’ inventory.
Regulators are concerned Google may have illegally favored its own ad exchange services to the detriment of rivals. The CMA is also worried Google limited the compatibility of its ad exchange with third-party ad servers to make it harder for competing ad servers to compete.
“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind paywalls,” Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said in a statement.
“It may also be raising costs for advertisers which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services.”
It comes after an earlier competition probe from both the UK and EU into “Jedi Blue.” The deal allegedly involved Google and Meta rigging auctions for online ads and illegally fixing prices.

Google’s Waze and Samsung convinced a US appeals court Monday to move separate patent lawsuits against them over map technology from East Texas federal court to Northern California.
Chief US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap should have granted the companies’ request to transfer AGIS Software Development’s lawsuits because the California court was a more convenient place to try them, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said.
AGIS’ attorney Fred Fabricant of Fabricant said he and the company were “very disappointed.” He said it “strains all logic” to transfer the cases, which were set for trials in June and August, based on convenience.
Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the company was pleased with the decision. He added that Google has called for the end of forum shopping by parties looking to sue in jurisdictions seen as friendly to their patent claims, “which only furthers abusive and costly litigation.”
AGIS sued the three companies in Marshall, Texas in 2019, arguing user-communication technology in Google and Waze’s map apps violated its patents. Samsung’s devices that work with Google’s apps also infringe, AGIS said.
Gilstrap rejected the defendants’ request to move the cases to Google’s home district in Northern California. The judge said court congestion and judicial economy favored keeping the cases in Texas, and noted that he had already presided over a case involving the same patents.

Legislation introduced in the US Senate would force Google to break up its online advertising business marking one of the most aggressive attempts to rein in big technology companies by lawmakers, reported CNBC. 
The Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act is targeting conflicts of interest in ad technology, and would block companies that process more than $20 billion a year in digital ad transactions from taking part in more than one part of the digital ad ecosystem.
The bill would ban companies that process more than $20 billion annually in digital ad transactions from participating in more than one part of the digital ad process, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Google infamously has a hand in multiple steps of the digital ad process, a business that has become the focus of a state-led antitrust lawsuit against the company. Google runs an auction, or exchange, where ad transactions are made and also runs tools to help companies sell and buy ads. If the new legislation passed, it would have to choose in which part of the business it would want to remain.
“When you have Google simultaneously serving as a seller and a buyer and running an exchange, that gives them an unfair, undue advantage in the marketplace, one that doesn’t necessarily reflect the value they are providing,” Lee told the Journal in an interview. “When a company can wear all these hats simultaneously, it can engage in conduct that harms everyone.”

92,"May 16, 2022","Google, Meta Dodge UK’s Plan to Force Fairer Deals With Publishers","
The United Kingdom was about to join a list of countries including Australia, Canada, France and Spain that imposed limits on the negotiations between Big Tech firms and publishers to use news and content on tech platforms, but a change of heart in the U.K. government may delay this plan at least for a year. 
On Friday (May 6), the telecommunication regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published their joint advice to the U.K. government on how Big Tech companies should arrange “fairer deals” with online publishers in order to use their content. 
As in many other countries around the world, people have turned to online sources for their news, either through social media, search engines or apps provided by Google and Facebook, among other tech firms. Ofcom and CMA argue that “consumers and content providers, including newspapers, could benefit if the bargaining power of the biggest tech firms is properly managed.” 
The advice was set out in the form of a code of conduct that would mean that Big Tech firms with significant bargaining power would have to agree fair and reasonable terms for the content they use on their platforms. This code identifies a number of ways to do that, such as by addressing concerns about how algorithms work, and which factors are used to determine where different publisher’s content appears in searches, or by providing a framework for fair financial terms for the publisher’s content.
The code would also establish that in the event of a dispute between a platform and a publisher about the application of a code, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) would have the role of deciding whether a contract or action by the firm was compliant. As proposed in other countries, the code would also give the DMU enforcement power to impose binding arbitration to ensure code breaches do not persist for long periods. 
Notably, the U.K. law would differ from other countries because the code would be a set of legally binding obligations for the biggest tech firms. Additionally, unlike Australia, the proposal in the U.K. has a broader focus: it was intended to shape the behavior of the Big Tech companies and reduce the imbalance of bargaining power across a range of digital markets. 
However, the biggest challenge was that the new code had to first be passed into law. The government would also have had to legally authorize the DMU to be fully operational and with statutory powers.
According to current news reports, U.K. ministers said neither the code nor the DMU will be part of the Queen’s Speech to be delivered Tuesday (May 10), when Queen Elizabeth will announce new laws for the next Parliamentary session. This means that while regulators can still work on a draft for the code and the DMU will continue assisting the CMA in existing investigations, the chances of publishing a legally binding code by the end of the year are slim. Accordingly, at present Google and Meta may not need to worry about legal restrictions when negotiating with publishers.

However, this doesn’t prove to be authentic according to some advocates. Google’s Privacy Sandbox feature did receive the approval of UK’s competition watchdog. Alongside that, it is notable how Google is taking so long to phase out the third-party cookies on their Privacy Sandbox website. It is estimated that the third-party cookies will be removed completely in a period of three months but it is much longer than anyone expected.

Google on Wednesday laid out plans to bridge the real world and its digital universe of search, Maps and other services using new advances in artificial intelligence.
At its annual Google I/O developer conference, the company previewed a feature that would let users take video of shelves of wine bottles at a store and ask its system to automatically identify options from Black-owned wineries.
“This is like having a supercharged Ctrl+F for the world around you,” said Prabhakar Raghavan, a Google senior vice president, referring to the keyboard shortcut for finding something in a document. “You can search your whole world, asking questions any way and anywhere.”
Later this year, Maps will launch an immersive view for some big cities that fuses Street View and aerial images “to create a rich, digital model of the world,” Google said.

Google has signed deals to pay more than 300 publishers in Germany, France and four other EU countries for their news and will roll out a tool to make it easier for others to sign up too, the company told Reuters.
The move to be announced publicly later on Wednesday followed the adoption of landmark EU copyright rules three years ago that require Google and other online platforms to pay musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists for using their work.
News publishers, among Google’s fiercest critics, have long urged governments to ensure online platforms pay fair remuneration for their content. Australia last year made such payments mandatory while Canada introduced similar legislation last month. 
“So far, we have agreements which cover more than 300 national, local and specialist news publications in Germany, Hungary, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Ireland, with many more discussions ongoing,” Sulina Connal, director for news and publishing partnerships, said in blogpost seen by Reuters and expected to be published later on Wednesday. The blog did not say how much publishers were being paid.
Two-thirds of this group are German publishers including Der Spiegel, Die Zeit and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
“We are now announcing the launch of a new tool to make offers to thousands more news publishers, starting in Germany and Hungary, and rolling out to other EU countries over the coming months,” Connal said in the blogpost.
The tool offers publishers an extended news preview agreement that allows Google to show snippets and thumbnails for a licensing fee.

96,"May 10, 2022",Google Stops Paid App Sales In Russia,"


Google won’t be offering paid apps or app updates for Russian users — but that’s not because the company wanted to exit the market, a report from Ars Technica said Monday (May 9).
A new support page pointed at by the tech-focused website says Google Play is “blocking the downloading of paid apps and updates to paid apps in Russia starting May 5, 2022.” Google has said that the blocking of paid apps is part of the tech giant’s “compliance efforts,” though after the big four credit card companies pulled out of Russia in March following their invasion of Ukraine, Google could no longer offer paid apps.
The page says users won’t be able to buy apps and games, make subscription payments or buy anything in-app using Google Play. There will still be free apps available, and paid apps users already bought will be able to be downloaded and used. However, according to the page, subscriptions won’t be renewed and will be canceled. Google is dealing with credit card processing, meaning it is expected to  still be able to give payouts to Russian developers.
The report noted Google’s blog post about what it has been doing in Ukraine. However, its continuing business in Russia has made it an outlier among the other big tech companies. That led to Google being accused by Forbes of being “Putin’s Most Compliant U.S. Tech Censor.”
Google’s activities in Russia have caused much friction with authorities in the context of the Ukraine war, with the country criticizing and accusing the company’s  YouTube video-sharing platform, which has shut out Russian state-funded media globally, of becoming “one of the key platforms spreading fakes (fake images) about the course of (Russia’s) special military operation on the territory of Ukraine…”

The DOJ’s top antitrust official, Jonathan Kanter, has been barred from working on monopoly investigations of Alphabet’s Google as the department wrestles with whether he must recuse himself because of his previous work for the search giant’s rivals, according to people familiar with the matter.
Jonathan Kanter, a longtime advocate for antitrust enforcement against Google, was brought in by the Biden administration to tackle difficult antitrust investigations into tech giants like Google and Apple Inc. that began under former President Donald Trump.

Dating apps maker Match sued Google on Monday, calling the action a “last resort” to prevent Tinder and its other apps from being booted off the Play store for refusing to share up to 30% of their sales.
Match’s lawsuit is the latest to target Google’s allegedly anticompetitive conduct with the Play store, joining ongoing cases brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games, dozens of US state attorneys general and others.
Google did immediately respond to a request for comment on the new filing. But it has said that developers have the option to bypass the Play store and that it has lowered fees and created other programs to address antitrust concerns.
The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets announced a preliminary investigation into Alphabet’s Google last week, over possible anti-competitive practices in its Play store. Match group had asked the regulator to assess whether Google is abusing a dominant position in the dating app market.

99,"May 9, 2022","Google, Meta Avoid UK’s Publishers Deal For Another Year","


The United Kingdom was about to join a list of countries including Australia, Canada, France and Spain that imposed limits on the negotiations between Big Tech firms and publishers to use news and content on tech platforms, but a change of heart in the UK government may delay this plan at least for a year. 
On Friday (May 6), the telecommunication regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority(CMA) published their joint advice to the UK government on how Big Tech companies should arrange “fairer deals” with online publishers in order to use their content. 
As in many other countries around the world, people have turned to online sources for their news, either through social media, search engines or apps provided by Google and Facebook, among other tech firms. Ofcom and CMA argue that “consumers and content providers, including newspapers, could benefit if the bargaining power of the biggest tech firms is properly managed.” 
The advice was set out in the form of a code of conduct that would mean that Big Tech firms with significant bargaining power would have to agree fair and reasonable terms for the content they use on their platforms. This code identifies a number of ways to do that, such as by addressing concerns about how algorithms work, and which factors are used to determine where different publisher’s content appears in searches, or by providing a framework for fair financial terms for the publisher’s content. 
The code would also establish that in the event of a dispute between a platform and a publisher about the application of a code, the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) would have the role of deciding whether a contract or action by the firm was compliant. As proposed in other countries, the code would also give the DMU enforcement power to impose binding arbitration to ensure code breaches do not persist for long periods. 
Notably, the UK law would differ from other countries because the code would be a set of legally binding obligations for the biggest tech firms. Additionally, unlike Australia, the proposal in the UK has a broader focus: it was intended to shape the behavior of the Big Tech companies and reduce the imbalance of bargaining power across a range of digital markets. 
However, the biggest challenge was that the new code had to first be passed into law. The government would also have had to legally authorize the DMU to be fully operational and with statutory powers. 
According to current news reports, U.K. ministers said neither the code nor the DMU will be part of the Queen’s Speech to be delivered Tuesday (May 10), when Queen Elizabeth will announce new laws for the next Parliamentary session. This means that while regulators can still work on a draft for the code and the DMU will continue assisting the CMA in existing investigations, the chances of publishing a legally binding code by the end of the year are slim. Accordingly, at present Google and Meta may not need to worry about legal restrictions when negotiating with publishers.

Apple and Google, and the Australian industry group advocating for tech giants have unsurprisingly raised concerns about the proposed measures that were outlined in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) discussion paper for the Digital Platforms Services inquiry.
In its discussion paper that was published in February, the country’s competition watchdog put forward a slew of legislative measures that took aim at big tech issues, including anti-competitive conduct, bargaining imbalances, insufficient consumer and business user protections, and more.
In response to those proposals, Apple expressed its discontent, describing in its submission that the proposed reforms would result in Australian consumers being “net worse off” and that it is “puzzled” about why the agency would “prioritise purported competition concerns”, which it believes “lack cogent evidence of harm, over clear and present severe damage to users that they experience every day”.
“That is not what consumers want to see as outcomes of legislative reform — they want stronger, not weaker, protection — from the unlawful conduct which affects the hundreds of thousands of Australians every year whose information is stolen, scammed, traded and exploited to their detriment,” Apple wrote.
The Cupertino company also criticised the ACCC’s reforms as being directed at addressing hypothetical, rather than existing problems, and that the changes would “regrettably” change iPhone and other Apple services, including iOS and the App Store, and result in changes to Apple’s privacy and security standards and leave existing users exposed to less secure and private environments.
“Much of the discussion paper appears to proceed on the assumption that there is a relevant market failure arising from Apple’s purported market power,” Apple said.

The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets announced on Wednesday a preliminary investigation into Alphabet’s Google for possible anti-competitive practices in its Play store.
Tinder owner Match group had asked the regulator to assess whether Google is abusing a dominant position in the dating app market.
“Dating-app providers allegedly are no longer able to use a payment system other than Google’s payment system,” ACM spokesperson Murco Mijnlieff said in an email.
In a response, a Google spokesperson said the company charges customers 15% commissions for subscriptions via Google Play, which it said was “the lowest rate among major app platforms.”
It said app distributors can also avoid Google Play entirely by distributing their apps via other stores or websites.
The Dutch ACM remains locked in a two-year fight with Google competitor Apple over alternative means of payment for dating apps on the App Store.
Apple has received 50 million euros in fines, the maximum possible under a current court decision, for failure to comply with an ACM order to make it possible for dating app developers to offer customers non-Apple payment methods. 
On Monday the ACM said the most recent proposals by Apple to remedy the situation, on March 30, were still not sufficient and it is preparing a new order with new payment penalties.
“Once we have published this new order subject to periodic penalty payments, we can comment on the contents thereof as well as on the points on which Apple is still in non-compliance. That may take several weeks,” the ACM said.

102,"May 2, 2022",Google Asks Court To Dismiss $1.6B EU Antitrust Fine,"


Alphabet unit Google on Monday urged Europe’s second-highest court to dismiss a 1.49-billion-euro ($1.6 billion) fine imposed by EU antitrust regulators three years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, reported Reuters. 
The case is one of three that has resulted in a total of 8.25 billion euros in European Union antitrust fines on the world’s most popular internet search engine.
The European Commission in its 2019 decision said Google had abused its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than its AdSense platform which provided search adverts. The Commission said the illegal practices occurred from 2006 to 2016.
Google subsequently challenged the EU finding in the Luxembourg-based General Court. The company will set out its case during a three-day hearing starting on Monday.
The EU competition enforcer’s assessment of Google’s dominance and the Commission’s decision that search ads and non-search ads do not compete were wrong, Google said in a court document.
It also took issue with the Commission for saying the company’s exclusivity, premium placement and minimum Google ads clauses were abusive.
Google suffered a setback last year when it lost its court fight against a 2.42-billion-euro antitrust decision over the use of its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.

103,"May 2, 2022",Google Fires Another AI Researcher,"


Google is still firing AI researchers amid criticism of its work. The New York Times has learned Google fired machine learning scientist Satrajit Chatterjee in March, soon after it refused to publish a paper Chatterjee and others wrote challenging earlier findings that computers could design some chip components more effectively than humans. The scientist was reportedly allowed to collaborate on a paper disputing those claims after he and fellow authors expressed reservations, but was dismissed after a resolution committee rejected the paper and the researchers hoped to bring the issue to CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet’s board of directors.
The company hasn’t detailed why it fired Chatterjee, but told the Times he’d been “terminated with cause.” It also maintained that the original paper had been “thoroughly vetted” and peer-reviewed, and that the study challenging the claims “did not meet our standards.”
Whether or not the science holds up, the exit underscores the ongoing clash between Google’s management and the AI teams that drive many of its projects. The problems began in earnest when Google fired ethicist Timnit Gebru in 2020 following a dispute over a paper, with two others following suit. The matter escalated when the internet giant terminated Margaret Mitchell in early 2021. While Google claimed Mitchell violated data confidentiality policies, she also publicly criticized executives and the decision to fire Gebru. These firings led veteran engineers to leave the firm and demand reforms, and that’s not including company-wide protests over military contracts. Google investigated Gebru’s firing and promised changes, but the Chatterjee firing might not ease tensions.

104,"May 1, 2022",Bandcamp Joins Epic Games Case Against Google,"


Epic and Google are gearing up for another legal battle. You might recall that Google has an in-app billing crackdown coming to the Play Store soon. The new rules require all apps selling digital goods to use Google Play Billing by March 31, so Google gets a cut of the sales. Any app in non-compliance has been unable to ship updates since March 31, but the real deadline is June 1, when these apps will be removed from the Play Store. Epic Games bought the popular independent music site Bandcamp in March, and it’s already taking Google to court over its newest acquisition. Bandcamp isn’t in compliance with the billing rules, so it’s due for a ban in June. As part of its antitrust case against Google, Epic is filing a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Bandcamp’s de-listing from the Play Store.
Epic has gone afterGoogle and Apple over their app store rules and what Epic says are excessive fees. In March, there were a lot of questions surrounding why the creator of Fortnite and the Unreal Engine would buy an independent music site. One line of commentary from Music Business Worldwide founder Tim Ingham seems to have nailed Epic’s strategy. Ingham notes that Epic failed to get Apple to reduce its 30 percent app store cut, in part because the alternative model Epic could demonstrate to the court, the Epic Games Store and its 12 percent fee, wasn’t profitable. Apple’s lawyers argued the unprofitability of Epic’s Games Store justified Apple’s 30 percent fees.
Bandcamp is a profitable digital content business, though. Bandcamp has a searchable content store, and it hosts and delivers the content by charging artists a 10 to 15 percent commission. Ingham predicted Epic would hold up Bandcamp’s business model as a viable alternative to Apple and Google’s app store fees, and that Epic would use its new acquisition to attack app store owners. It looks like we’re seeing the first actions of that plan.

A Russian court has threatened US Internet giant Google and Wikipedia owner Wikimedia Foundation with fines for failing to delete what it said was “fake” information about the Ukraine conflict, Interfax news agency reported on Friday.
Russia’s communications watchdog said on Thursday that Google would face fines over its failure to delete from video sharing site YouTube content that Moscow considers illegal.
The developments come after Russia had warned Wikipedia to take down “material with inaccurate information of public interest” on the Ukraine war on April 5. Roskomnadzor had claimed that the internet open-source website was hosting untrue data on what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Subsequently, Wikipedia was allegedly disseminating wrong details about the Russian troops’ actions in its embattled ex-Soviet neighbour.
This is not the first time Moscow has slapped strapping fines on US-based internet and social media companies, accusing them of violating online media regulations in Russian. Last December, Facebook’s parent company Meta received a 1.9 billion rouble ($27 million) court fine for “systematic failure to remove banned content” from its platform. 
At the time, the Tagansky District Court too ruled that Google had neglected the provisions of Russian media laws, leading them to face an administrative penalty worth 7.2 billion roubles (approx. $98.4 million). Earlier Russia had imposed fines on social media companies but December 2021 was the first time the penalties were based on the revenues of the defendants.

107,"April 14, 2022",Google Faces Antitrust Suit Over Waze Acquisition,"


Alphabet is facing federal antitrust litigation in San Francisco over claims that it leverages its dominance of the GPS navigation market—through Google Maps, Waze, and related services—to lock app developers into the “Google ecosystem” and hit them with “egregious” price hikes.
The lawsuit accuses Google of capturing 81% of the market by offering Maps for free, exploiting its data “treasure trove” to cement its monopoly, placing restrictive terms on developers that incorporate its functions, and using other services like search and YouTube to favor Maps by “self-preferencing.”
After Google’s control of the “digital-mapping stack” was complete following its 2013 acquisition of Waze—the only rival offering a full suite of competing services—it began jacking up prices, which have risen by 1,400% since 2018, according to the proposed class action brought by three businesses.
The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, also indirectly challenges the Waze deal—which has recently come under belated scrutiny from antitrust regulators—although it doesn’t seek to unwind the transaction.
The tech giant “bought out one of the few companies in the world making navigable maps while also providing turn-by-turn navigation service” and “bureaucratized” it “into a failing subsidiary” that could be used as a “guinea pig” for monetizing GPS services through advertising, the complaint says.

Fuchs now plans to also approach Facebook, which like Google has its German headquarters in Hamburg – bringing the company under his remit.
Google’s step comes in response to massive criticism and fines. The US giant’s previous argument that consenting to cookies with a single click requires far less effort than rejecting them is not in line with data protection law requirements.
Google said that by 2023 it would give up the use of cookies from third-party providers. Instead, the company is working on Topics API, where no more data will be transferred to third-party providers or Google’s servers.
Europe’s recent changes to privacy policies has brought many of the Big Tech companies that dominate the internet into hot water due to their policies for handling data, with France slapping Google and Facebook with significant fines over its Cookies policies earlier this year, in what may eventually be used as precedent for any upcoming German challenges.

Canada’s government announced a new legislative proposal on Tuesday (April 5) that would compel platforms like Facebook and Google to negotiate with news publishers and pay them for using their content. 
By enacting this new legislation, Canada joins other countries, including Australia, France and Spain, that require Big Tech to negotiate with news publishers and pay for their content. Other countries like the UK could adopt soon similar legislation.
Under the new “Online News Act” firms like Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook parent Meta, would be required to pay Canadian media publishers for permitting connections to news content on their platforms. Canadian publishers have long lobbied the government for such a move, claiming that the advertising revenue that used to be the lifeblood of their operations has disproportionately migrated to global web behemoths.
The proposed legislation, according to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, would be comparable to Australia’s law, but would include public reporting requirements and give an independent committee, rather than the minister, the power to choose which enterprises are eligible for payments.
Read On: The European and U.S. Approaches to Antitrust and Tech: Setting the Record Straight
Australia was one of the first countries to adopt a law forcing Alphabet and Meta to pay media companies for content on their platforms, and it has been used by other countries as a model to follow. However, the Australian law goes somewhat further than other legislations, including Europe’s. For instance, in European countries like in France or Spain, Alphabet and Meta can negotiate with individual publishers, but it is up to the parties to reach an agreement and set the terms.
In contrast, Australia’s law kicks in only when negotiations between the tech giants and media companies fail. The legislation establishes an arbitration system that may impose binding rulings on the prices Google and Facebook must pay news publishers for content hosted on their platforms. Additionally, before updating algorithms that have an influence on traffic to news websites, the platforms are required give at least 14 days’ notice. Last, if any corporation violates non-discrimination terms, financial penalties may be applied.
The Canadian law seeks to replicate this model, but if negotiations between platforms and news publishers fail, a binding arbitration process will determine the compensation, rather than the government. The new law would exclude YouTube as this fall under the country’s broadcasting laws. The law will not apply either to Apple News that already license articles from publishers.
More countries around the world are trying to “level the playing field” between Big Tech and media companies. The U.K. announced in January that it is drawing up laws to require Alphabet and Meta to pay newspapers and media for their stories. Similar to the Canadian law, an independent arbitrator would step in to set a fair price if an agreement cannot be reached.

A French court of appeals upheld a 150 million euro fine levied against Alphabet’s Google for abusing its power over the treatment of advertisers, a spokesperson for the U.S. firm said on Thursday.
France’s antitrust watchdog, which levied the fine in 2019, said in its decision then that Google applied opaque advertising rules and changed them at will. 
It was the first penalty imposed by the competition authority against Google. 
“Following the (French competition authority’s) original decision we already made some changes to make these policies even clearer and will now study the court’s ruling in detail and consider our next steps,” Google’s spokesperson said.
Two of the watchdog’s orders that accompanied the 150 million-euro fine were overturned, Google said. 
The first revoked an order that compelled it to put in place a tool allowing French consumers to file complaints. The second overturned order made it compulsory for Google to issue an annual report detailing the number of websites whose Google Ads accounts were suspended for breaching its rules and the nature of the rules that were breached.

Search engine behemoth Google was hit with federal antitrust litigation in DC, over claims the tech giant leverages its market dominance to block most major electronic devices from simultaneously running multiple apps that use different voice assistant “wakewords,” reported Bloomberg.
The lawsuit accuses the company of erecting “artificial” barriers—through its Android operating system, pacts with manufacturers, and a side deal with Apple—restricting “concurrent wakeword” technology that could lead consumers to search engines other than Google.
Google has told device makers that it won’t allow them to run the company’s Google Assistant if they simultaneously offer access to competing voice assistants. For Sonos, this means that its customers have to choose between making Amazon’s Alexa or the Google Assistant the default voice assistant for its microphone-equipped smart speakers.
 Sonos has developed technology that allows the concurrent use of multiple voice assistants, effectively leaving it to end users to choose whether they call on Alexa or the Google Assistant to handle certain tasks. That way, someone could ask Google for the weather, and then tell Alexa to add something to their Amazon shopping list, simply by using different wake words.
In January 2020, Sonos sued tech giant Google for allegedly copying its wireless speaker design, urging the International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban Google products like laptops, phones and speakers.
It’s worth noting that not all tech companies are as protective of their voice assistants as Google. Amazon in particular has been a proponent of a more open approach; the company founded the Voice Interoperability Initiative to promote solutions similar to that developed by Sonos.

113,"April 6, 2022",South Korean Regulator Concerned Over Google’s Latest App Store Payment Policy,"


Last year, South Korea became the first country to approve legislation changing Google and Apple Inc.’s policies on how apps on their platforms sell subscriptions, in-game items, and other online content. 
The law forbids Google and Apple from forcing apps to use their own in-app payment systems, giving developers more options and potentially avoiding service fees of up to 30%. The law governing app stores went into effect in September of last year. 
However, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) did not issue definitive enforcement instructions until March. Google and Apple are still working on a regulatory compliance strategy to satisfy the Korean authorities. 
Google had recently attempted to prohibit app developers from giving an in-app link to an external website to purchase digital goods. This practice is known as “outlinking,” and it avoids Google’s fees. According to Google, those that provided external links would be unable to update their apps starting this month, and their apps may be removed from the Google Play Store by June 1. 
However, the KCC released legal guidance stating that Google’s actions would violate South Korea’s app payment law by forcing apps to utilize a single payment method and making it difficult to provide alternative options. 
In South Korea, Google and its Android operating system have a substantial market share. According to Counterpoint Research, a digital industry research organization, Samsung Electronics Co., the hometown brand that runs Android, controls 72 percent of the local smartphone market, compared to Apple’s 21 percent. 
According to Google, the company is studying the KCC guidance and will look for ways to continue investing in the Android ecosystem while working with local app developers to improve customer choice. The tech company previously stated that it would continue to charge 4 percentage points lower costs on in-app payments handled via third-party payment providers to help them with the additional costs that developers incur to support their billing systems. 
According to Google, the commission may be as low as 6% for eBook providers when users choose alternative systems, instead of 10% using Google’s Billing system, and as high as 26% for popular mobile game apps. 
Nevertheless, according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple, which charges a 30% fee for in-app purchases around the world, has yet to implement policy modifications compliant with South Korean legislation. According to the KCC, Apple has expressed a desire to cooperate. Apple has yet to respond to the KCC’s new legal instructions.

114,"April 3, 2022",Indian Suit Claims Google Unfairly Blocked Rival Payments,"


The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday released early findings of an investigation into Google’s app store and its payment system, Google Pay. As Bloomberg reported, it found that Google’s Play Store billing system for app developers is “unfair and discriminatory”. 
Back in 2020, Google decided to delay enforcing its 30% commission for app developers in India following an outcry from the country’s startup community. The tech giant agreed to defer the policy until this month. 
But in the interim, Indian developers lobbied the nation’s government to stop Google from enacting what they felt was an unfairly high fee. 
Developers also believed that Android phones, which are preloaded with the Play Store, give Google an unfair advantage over rival payment systems that have found it hard to find a footing in the digital ecosystem dominated by big players.Of particular concern in India is whether Google Pay will undercut rival United Payments Interface (or UPI) apps, which allow users to directly debit payments from their bank accounts using just a virtual address. UPI payment apps like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm are currently the most popular way for Indians to make payments online. 
Critics have alleged that Google’s control of the Play Store and the Android operating system gives it an unfair amount of control over India’s digital payment ecosystem. A two-year probe concluded last year by the Competition Commission of India found that Google had abused the dominant position of its Android operating system, using its “huge financial muscle” to illegally hurt competitors.India’s antitrust regulator echoed similar concerns over Google Pay. “Google’s conduct is also resulting in a denial of market access to competing UPI apps since the market for UPI enabled digital payment apps is multi-sided, and the network effects will lead to a situation where Google Pay’s competitors will be completely excluded from the market in the long run,” wrote CCI in documents viewed by Bloomberg.

The US Justice Department (DOJ) has honed in on its investigation of Google Maps to determine if bundling the service together with other Google software illegally stifles competition, reported Reuters. 
The probe of the Alphabet unit first came to light in late 2020 and had been quiet until recent months when investigators again began making inquiries, the sources said.
Google said it cooperates with regulators and welcomes their questions. The Justice Department declined to comment.
The probe has two components. One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided through infotainment screens in vehicles. In its Google Automotive Services package for automakers, the search company bundles together Maps, the Google Play app store, Google Assistant and other services. Car companies are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps with voice assistants developed by smaller rivals, one source said.
In response, Google said the integration provides the best user experience, and that in some instances a rival voice assistant can function with Google Maps.
The other component focuses on app and website developers. Specifically, the department is looking at Google’s requirement that if a website or app uses one Google technology, say Google’s location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other technologies developed by Google’s rivals, the two sources said.

116,"March 29, 2022",French Watchdog Fines Google Over App Store Practices,"


A French court has fined Google $2.2 million (€2 million) for what the country’s government has described as “abusive” dealings with developers on its app store.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday (March 29), the Paris Commercial Court has also ruled Google must also update seven clauses from its contracts that included a 30% commission on revenues generated by developers on Google’s Play store.
The case stems from 2018, when Google and Apple made price and contract changes on developers selling software in their stores and the French Ministry of Finance decided to take action against the tech giants.
“I will therefore be taking Google and Apple to the Paris commercial court for abusive trade practices,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said then. “As powerful as they are, Google and Apple should not be able to treat our startups and our developers the way they currently do.”
A spokesperson for Google told Bloomberg the company was disappointed in the ruling, but said it was too early to determine whether Google will appeal.
“We are always looking to provide more support for developers and help them build sustainable businesses, including recently decreasing our service fees to 15% or less for 99% of developers,” the spokesperson said.
The case against Apple is still pending, although the iPhone maker has been dealing with its own headaches in Europe over its handling of its app store.

The Competition Commission of India, the country’s chief competition regulator, has ordered an investigation into the “abuse of dominance” by tech giant Google, the Indian Newspaper Society has said in a statement. The outfit, representing various Indian journalism enterprises, has promoted the Commission’s actions.
The INS  sought fair value for content hosted on Google, stating that news publishers are not being properly compensated for the content they generate.
“The News Media Houses are completely kept in the dark on the total advertising revenue collected by Google and what actual percentage of the advertising revenue is being transferred to media organizations. The European Publishers Council had also filed a competition complaint against Google alleging that Google has achieved end to end control of the ad tech value chain, thus abusing its dominant position,” the statement released on Friday said.
The society has also alleged that Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc, along with Google LLC, Google India Private Limited, Google Ireland Limited, and Google Asia Pacific Pvt Ltd are “abusing their dominant position related to News Referral Services and Google Ad Tech Services in the Indian online news media market, which is in violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002”.
The complaint echoes a case heard earlier this year by the CCI, where the Digital News Publishers Association, which comprises the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media companies, stated Google denied fair advertising revenue to its members.
News organizations, which have been losing advertising revenue to online aggregators such as Google, have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment.
Google has had previous run-ins with Indian competition authorities, including accusations over the company’s Android operating system, claiming the company was using its “huge financial muscle” to illegally hurt competitors,

Alphabet’s Google urged a judge hearing a US antitrust case against it to reject the Justice Department’s request that it be sanctioned, saying it had not abused attorney-client privilege, reported Reuters. 
The department had asked Judge Amit Mehta to sanction Google, saying the company’s “Communicate with Care” program was sometimes a “game” to shield communications that did not genuinely fall under attorney-client privilege.
In a filing dated Thursday, Google said that “allegations of sanctionable misconduct are baseless” and a misreading of a small number of slides used to train employees.

Google also said it was conferring with the government on which emails that are indicated as potentially falling under attorney-client privilege genuinely do. It said it had given the government some of the affected documents.
“Plaintiffs come nowhere close to proving the bad-faith misconduct that is required to strip a party of its privilege protections,” Google said in its filing.
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit against Google in 2020, accusing it of violating antitrust law in its handling of its search business. Trial was set for September 2023.

119,"March 23, 2022",Google Play Allows Spotify To Use Third-Party Payments,"


Google and Spotify said on Wednesday that a future version of the Spotify app will allow users to sign up inside the app to pay Spotify directly for a subscription.
The move is the most significant concession so far from a major mobile app store to allow third-party billing systems inside apps, which has become a major focus for regulators around the world.
Shares of Spotify popped about 4.5% in after-hours trading on the news.
Historically, on Google Play, as well as Apple’s App Store, developers usually can’t solicit credit card numbers directly from their customers to bill them for digital goods or services. Instead, they have to bill users through Google’s system, which takes at least 15%, and as much as 30%, of total sales.
But there are caveats: Google’s announcement on Wednesday calls the move a “pilot” and doesn’t offer a timeline for wide implementation or specify which countries will first get the feature. The announcement suggested that only a “small number” of app makers will be allowed to offer their own billing, to start.
“This pilot will allow a small number of participating developers to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play’s billing system and is designed to help us explore ways to offer this choice to users, while maintaining our ability to invest in the ecosystem,” Google said in a blog post.
Spotify will still pay a fee to Google for payments it processes on its own, Google confirmed. Google said it would “build on” a policy that it introduced in South Korea where it continues to take an 11% fee on subscription purchases made through alternative billing, which became required by a recent law passed in the country.
The move also puts pressure on Apple, which is firmly against third-party billing on its iPhone App Store for digital goods, and argues that its App Store competes with Google Play, especially when it comes to app distribution terms and fees.

Google employees have been improperly using attorney-client privilege to shield documents from discovery in litigation and government investigations, the Justice Department says in a court filing.
In a court filing, the Justice Department asked for Google to be sanctioned for creating a Communicate-with-Care program that trains workers to include an attorney and a request for advice when writing about sensitive business matters. 
Often, knowing the game, the in-house counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not respond at all, the department said, adding that many of the emails had to do with revenue share agreements that Google had struck with other companies.
A Google spokesperson said that the company had given the government more than 4 million documents. “Our teams have conscientiously worked for years to respond to inquiries and litigation, and suggestions to the contrary are flatly wrong” the spokesperson said.
The allegations are the latest in a series of challenges against Google and other Tech Giants.

The European Commission has formally opened an antitrust probe into a 2018 deal between tech giants Google and Facebook allegedly aimed at cementing their dominance over the online advertising market, reported Bloomberg. 
The EU’s executive said it was investigating the so-called “Jedi Blue” agreement to see if it had been used to “restrict and distort competition in the already concentrated ad tech market.”
The European Commission announced its formal antitrust investigation in a press release in which it voiced its concerns that an agreement between the two companies in 2018 may have breached EU competition rules. 
Meanwhile, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that the deal may have restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services.
The Jedi Blue agreement came under fire in the United States in September 2021, after four members of Congress asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into whether the pact violated federal antitrust laws.
Header bidding is a service that allows sellers like news publishers to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time as opposed to doing so on an individual basis. This makes it so that buyers (or in this case advertisers) must compete against each other for ad space while publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers at the same time.

123,"March 11, 2022",CMA Probes Google & Facebook Over Ad Tech,"
The UK’s CMA is taking a closer look at Google and Meta’s conduct over concerns that they hampered competition in markets for online display advertising services.
CMA Chief Executive said “We will not shy away from scrutinising the behaviour of big tech firms while we await powers for the Digital Markets Unit.”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is focusing on whether the companies restricted or prevented the uptake of header bidding services and whether Google also affected the ability of other firms to compete with its products in this area.
Header bidding is a service which allows sellers, such as news publishers, to offer their online advertising space to multiple buyers at the same time, rather than receiving offers one by one. As a result, buyers – or advertisers – compete against each other for ad space and publishers can compare bids from multiple buyers simultaneously. This competition between buyers can make auctions more competitive.
As part of its investigation, the CMA will consider whether an agreement between Google and Meta (previously Facebook) – which Google internally codenamed “Jedi Blue” – broke the law. This secret pact was the focus of an investigation in the United States looking into the claim that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising.

124,"March 8, 2022",Google In Deal To Buy to Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant For $5.4B,"
Alphabet’s Google has a $5.4 billion deal in place for the acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant, a move intended to complement Google Cloud’s security strengths and better protect customers.  
The $23 per share, all-cash deal included Mandiant’s net cash and is expected to close later this year. Upon closing, Mandiant will be folded into Google Cloud to create an “end-to-end security operations suite,” according to a Mandiant press statement on Tuesday (March 8). 
“This is an opportunity to deliver an end-to-end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world. Together we can make a profound impact in securing the cloud, accelerating the adoption of cloud computing, and ultimately make the world safer,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud.
Founded in 2004, Mandiant’s more than 600 cybersecurity consultants respond to thousands of breaches annually. Research from over 300 intelligence analysts power Mandiant’s security tools, delivered across Mandiant Advantage, a multi-vendor XDR platform.
“Cyber security is a mission, and we believe it’s one of the most important of our generation. Google Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization,” said Kevin Mandia, CEO, Mandiant. 
“Together, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio. These efforts will help organizations to effectively, efficiently and continuously manage and configure their complex mix of security products,” Mandia said. 
Google has been increasing its presence in cloud computing and cybersecurity in recent years by acquiring providers, such as Israeli startup Siemplify in January,  and expanding its in-house capabilities as well. The move appears geared towards increasing Google’s clout in the growing e-finance business, with financial institutions increasingly turning to the Cloud for their operations.

A court ruling has temporarily suspended the Korean Fair Trade Commission’s order that Google fix its unfair market practices, reported KBS World. 
The Seoul High Court on Monday sided with the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by Google, Google Asia Pacific and Google Korea against the trade regulator. The decision is an important, if temporary victory for the internet giant, which has faced a series of challenges from National Competition Authorities in recent years. 
The commission last year ordered corrective measures and imposed fines on the global tech giant for forcing smartphone makers to only use its Android mobile operating system. The decision in this case echoes similar findings in other jurisdictions, including the European Union, the UK, and Turkey.
Google then filed the lawsuit in January to overturn that decision and separately applied for an injunction with the Seoul High Court.
The court has decided to suspend the KFTC’s order until August 31, saying a deferment is necessary to prevent irreparable damage to the plaintiffs.
The court did rule, however, that the 224-point-nine-billion-won fine imposed on Google remains valid. In addition to the operating system, Google is also accused of requiring smartphone makers to enter into an “anti-fragmentation agreement” when they sign key license contracts with Google.
The KFTC had determined that Google was abusing its market dominance and hampering competition.

Confidential data reviewed by POLITICO has revealed gatekeeper search engines are funneling low-value ads to smaller search partners.
The report alleges Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft Corp. are using the online advertising market to the detriment of smaller rivals. The action threatens to establish a new antitrust clash in Europe, reported PMNTS. 
These two tech giants appear to be inundating smaller search engine partners with spam ads while keeping the most valuable adverts for themselves, the report found.
The report comes a week after the European Publishers Council (EPC) — an association that includes The New York Times, Germany’s Axel Springer and the UK’s Guardian — filed a complaint with the European Commission against Google, asking the regulator to restore conditions for effective competition in the AdTech value chain.
The European Commission has been investigating Google’s advertising practices since last year, when it sent questionnaires to publishers and advertising companies asking them about the role of Google as middleman in the AdTech value chain.
In addition, the US Department of Justice has been expediting its investigation of Google’s alleged antitrust practices.
Last fall, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, said the European Parliament and European Council should approve legislation regulating Big Tech as soon as possible.

Google is expanding its Privacy Sandbox to Android devices and the UK’s antitrust watchdog is set to play a crucial role in ensuring that the tech giant does not abuse its market dominance in the process, reported EurActiv. 
On Wednesday (16 February), Google presented a multi-year initiative to introduce to Android its Privacy Sandbox, an initiative aimed at “building a more private, open web.”
Until now, the Privacy Sandbox initiative was limited to the web, with a view to restricting cross-site tracking performed by third party cookies via Google’s web browser Chrome. The move to Android is explicitly building on this experience.
“Google appears to follow a similar philosophy for the app ecosystem: replacing existing identifiers that power digital advertising (the Android Advertising ID) with alternative solutions that are said to improve privacy,” said Damien Geradin, founding partner at Geradin Partners.
The blog post announcing the change noted that more than 90% of the apps available on the Google Play app store are free, also thanks to digital advertising. However, the announcement added that the app ecosystem remains healthy, “the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy.”

South Korea’s antitrust regulator said Tuesday it has raised the fine slapped on Google over alleged anti-competition practices by 17.5 billion won (US$14.63 million) to 224.9 billion won.
In mid-September, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) decided to fine the global tech giant for forcing smartphone makers into only using its Android mobile operating system. The amount was provisionally set at 207.4 billion won.

The regulator said it had adjusted the penalty to 224.93 billion won before notifying Google of the decision at the end of last year.
The initial fine was calculated with the period of Google’s law violations set from January 2011 to April 2021, the last month for which its sales data was available at that time.

The CMA has accepted a revised offer from Google of commitments relating to its proposed removal of third-party cookies from the Chrome browser, known as the Privacy Sandbox proposals.
The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) competition investigation was launched in January 2021 over concerns that the proposals would cause online advertising spending to become even more concentrated on Google, weakening competition and so harming consumers who ultimately pay for the cost of online advertising.
The CMA was also concerned that Google’s proposals could undermine the ability of online publishers, such as newspapers, to generate revenue and continue to produce valuable content in the future – reducing the public’s choice of news sources.
Related: UK To Probe Google’s “Privacy Sandbox’” Changes
The final commitments accepted by the CMA today are a result of an in-depth investigation and extensive engagement with Google and market participants, including 2 formal public consultations.
They address the CMA’s competition concerns and Google has also said that the commitments will be rolled out globally.
The CMA is working closely with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to oversee the development of the proposals, so that they protect privacy without unduly restricting competition and harming consumers.
Google’s third party cookies currently play a fundamental role online and in digital advertising. They help businesses target advertising effectively and fund free online content for consumers, such as newspapers. But there have also been concerns about their legality and use from a privacy perspective, as they allow consumers’ behavior to be tracked across the web in ways that many consumers may feel uncomfortable with and may find difficult to understand.

Google is asking a judge to reverse the fine it received last year from South Korea’s competition regulator after the tech giant tried to force the country’s phone makers to use its Android operating system, according to PYMNTS.
The lawsuit, filed last month, seeks to cancel a 207.4 billion won ($173 million) penalty imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). The sanction is among the largest ever issued by the agency.
Regulators allege Google has hurt competition by requiring smartphone makers to sign anti-fragmentation agreements (AFAs). Under the terms of the contract, Google prevents South Korean manufacturers, including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, from making changes to the Android OS.
Google has insisted that its AFAs are necessary to ensure that apps work across the Android phone network.
In a separate case, Google appealed that decision. The Seoul High Court is expected to consider the appeal Feb. 25.
The decision by the KFTC prohibited Google from forcing manufacturers to sign AFAs, and the court ordered existing agreements be amended.
Korea has been among the first nations to legislate against the alleged monopolies by Google and Apple in downloading mobile apps to their mobile operating systems.

The European Publishers Council (EPC), a group of Chairmen and CEOs of the continent’s leading media groups including MailOnline’s owner Daily Mail and General Trust, has today revealed it is complaining to the European Commission about the tech giant’s digital advertising practices.
They say Google’s advertising platform is ‘rife with conflicts of interests’ because it is acting as buyer and the seller in the same transaction, while also operating the auction house in the middle in a monopoly that harms publishers and consumers across Europe.
The Silicon Valley firm’s position has been compared to ‘Goldman or Citibank owning the New York Stock Exchange’ because it controls both buy-side and sell-side advertising brokers.
Figures show that one of Google’s advertising auction programs dropped publisher revenue by 40%, and there are fears changes to its cookie technology could hit revenues by up to 70%.
Meanwhile it takes advantage of its dominant position to increase its market share at the expense of customers who are locked into Google products.

“There is therefore a risk for French website users who use this service and whose data is exported.”

Google faces a fine after Russia’s antitrust watchdog said the US tech firm had breached rules related to suspending and blocking accounts on its YouTube video service, reported Reuters. 
Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on Thursday the fine would be determined during an administrative investigation, adding Google’s conduct had infringed users’ interests and restricted competition.
“Google is waiting for the full text of the decision in order to examine it,” the company, a unit of Alphabet, said. Russia has handed Google several small fines in the last year for failing to delete content Moscow deems illegal, part of a wider campaign critics characterize as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet.

It upped the ante in December by imposing a 7.2 billion roubles ($97 million) penalty for what it said was a persistent failure to remove banned items. Google has appealed that ruling.
“(The FAS) found that the rules related to creating, suspending and blocking accounts and handling of user content on YouTube were non-transparent, biased and unpredictable,” the FAS said in a statement.
YouTube was also the subject of a protracted dispute with Tsargrad TV, a Christian Orthodox channel, which Google blocked as the account was owned by a Russian businessman targeted by U.S. sanctions.
According to Reuters, Konstantin Malofeev claimed victory in that case in December, saying Google faced a potentially heavy fine.

I explore how these concerns might apply in the Metaverse and other emerging technologies, and argue that applying the type of self-preferencing and interoperability rules that are currently under consideration to these emerging markets will protect potential competition, provide helpful certainty for investors, and help to build an innovative but more decentralized next generation of technologies.

136,"February 9, 2022","Facebook Hit Hard By New Rules, Google Spared","


Facebook’s owner is alleging Google, which also sells personalized ads on iPhones, has an unfair advantage under Apple’s new policies, reported Bloomberg.
Apps including Facebook have to ask users if they consent to being tracked, but Google’s search results and browser don’t — causing some advertisers’ budgets to shift to Google for more effective targeting.
Meta only started critiquing other tech giants by name in recent years. The social media behemoth, now facing antitrust scrutiny around the world, stands to benefit from framing itself as an underdog, threatened by larger forces.
Still, Meta told investors it expected to miss out on $10 billion in ad revenue in 2022 because of Apple’s changes, making it clear the company is more severely impacted than others. Facebook had relied on data from other apps and websites to make its ads effective. Without it, advertisers need to spend more money to achieve the same results.
Facebook ads are “still important, just costing a heck of a lot more,” said Doug Zarkin, chief marketing officer of Pearle Vision, which relies on Facebook and Instagram to drive people to its eye-care website and stores. He estimated that campaigns are 15% to 30% more expensive than last year.
Last year, Google said it wouldn’t prompt consumers about data collection because, after Apple’s change, it decided not to use any of the data on iPhones that would require permission.
According to Bloomberg, Google also doesn’t need the kind of data Facebook does from third parties in order to make its ads work. It runs its own mobile operating system, Android, and its own ad exchanges.
“Google just happens to be in the right place at the right time,” said Rick Watson, chief executive of RMW Consulting. “They were the biggest recipient of the ad dollars that were shifted because of effectiveness.”

137,"February 7, 2022",Swedish PriceRunner Sues Google For $2.4B Over Antitrust Breach,"


A Swedish price comparison website is suing Google for 2.1 billion euros over allegations that it manipulated search results in favor of its own competing shopping service, reported Reuters.
PriceRunner said Monday that it plans to take Google to court in Stockholm. It’s seeking compensation for damages in relation to a 2017 ruling from the European Commission that Google breached antitrust laws by giving preference to its own shopping comparison product, Google Shopping, through its popular search engine.
After a seven-year investigation into the practices, the EU executive body dealt Google a historic $2.7 billion fine. Google appealed the penalty, but in November 2021, the decision was upheld by the EU’s General Court. The verdict can still be appealed and taken to the EU’s highest court.

PriceRunner CEO Mikael Lindahl said the company launched its lawsuit following “extensive and thorough preparations.”
“We are of course seeking compensation for the damage Google has caused us during many years, but are also seeing this lawsuit as a fight for consumers who have suffered tremendously from Google’s infringement of the competition law for the past fourteen years and still today,” Lindahl said in a statement.
“This is also a matter of survival for many European entrepreneurial companies and job opportunities within tech.”

138,"February 6, 2022",Google May Be Luckier on Media Competition Bill Than on App Store Bill,"


By PYMNTS
Google just completed a week with more news headlines than it probably wanted. Some of them were very positive, like earnings in the last quarter going up 32% year-over-year. Some of them were less positive, like the approval by the Senate Panel of the Open App Market Act that will now pass to the Senate floor for a vote. 
Then, there was another legislative development whose fate is still unknown, but from which Google may still escape unscathed. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights held a hearing to debate the benefits and risks of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA). 
This bill, introduced in both chambers last year, essentially establishes a temporary four-year antitrust immunity for news outlets to come together and negotiate collectively with Google and Meta. 
By enabling news outlets and publishers to collectively negotiate with the tech giants, including small companies that otherwise wouldn’t have any bargaining power, they could increase their revenues and guarantee the continuation of high-quality journalism and local news.

Google’s lawyers argued in a filing in Manhattan federal court that the plaintiffs have asked for “irrelevant” records outside the scope of court orders in the advertising multidistrict litigation and that the company has already turned over about 850,000 documents, reported Reuters.
The filing from Google’s attorneys at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was a response to assertions on Monday, January 31, in a filing from the plaintiffs’ lawyers accusing Google of “gamesmanship and delay.”
The plaintiffs contend Google has not provided all the documents that the company, in related litigation, gave to a group of states, including Texas, that sued in 2020 over alleged antitrust violations concerning advertising technology, widely known as “ad tech.”
A lawyer for the advertiser class, Jordan Elias of San Francisco’s Girard Sharp, told Reuters on Thursday that “there is no burden to Google from giving private plaintiffs access to the documents it previously produced to government enforcers.”
The plaintiffs’ attorneys said in their filing that court orders “did not permit Google to comb over and reexamine its production to the state of Texas to decide for itself what was and was not ‘related to ad tech.'”

140,"February 1, 2022","80% Of App Developers Support Bill To Rein In Google, Apple: Poll","


84% of app developers support an antitrust bill aimed at curtailing the market power of Apple’s and Google’s app stores, according to a poll from the Coalition for App Fairness released Monday, January 31.
The industry group for app developers is pushing Congress to pass the Open App Markets Act, a bipartisan Senate bill that would block app stores from favoring their own in-house apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and preventing users from downloading apps from third-party stores.  
Developers surveyed by the group complained about exorbitant fees charged by the largest app stores — Apple charges a 30% commission on app store sales for large developers — and expressed how they’d experienced difficulty getting their apps featured or accepted by app stores. Just 13% of app developers surveyed oppose the bill.
“The evidence is clear – app developers want the Open App Markets Act to pass so that they can have the opportunity to compete in a fair digital marketplace,” Meghan DiMuzio, executive director of the Coalition for App Fairness, said in a statement.
“For too long, developers have been harmed by gatekeepers’ monopolistic practices, and consumers have suffered from less choice and innovation.”

141,"January 31, 2022",Senator Lee To Introduce Bill To Break Google’s Hold On Advertising,"


Lawmakers from both parties are set to introduce bills that could break Google’s stranglehold on the advertising business and start to chip away at Big Tech monopolies, The Post has learned.
Senator Mike Lee (Republican – Utah) is set to introduce a bill within weeks that would bar Google and other large tech firms from controlling multiple parts of the online ad supply chain.
According to The New York Post, while Lee’s bill appears to be aimed squarely at Google, it could also affect Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, which makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising. 
The bill would put an end to a company’s ability to act as a broker for a buyer or seller of ad space while simultaneously owning the exchange where ad space is traded, a source with knowledge of the proposed legislation said. Passage of the bill would represent a potentially multibillion-dollar blow to Google’s current model, which critics say allows the tech giant to charge unfairly high commissions.
Critics say that Google often plays the roles of buyer, seller, and middleman in the online ad market — a position that one of the tech giant’s own employees compared to Goldman Sachs owning the New York Stock Exchange, according to an ongoing lawsuit from Texas and 14 other states.
“A $100,000 stock trade will cost you a few dollars in exchange fees paid to the NYSE,” Notre Dame antitrust law professor Roger P. Alford said during a Senate hearing last month. “But a $100,000 ad campaign will cost you $20,000 in fees paid to Google’s exchange.” 
Senator Lee’s bill would also give Google a fiduciary duty to its advertising clients, similarly to how a financial adviser is legally required to act for the sole benefit of their clients.

142,"January 25, 2022",Google Overhauls EU Cookie Replacement Plan,"


Google is overhauling its plans for targeted online advertising after pushback from privacy advocates, aiming to give marketers less-granular information about web users than under the tech giant’s initial proposal, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The Alphabet unit said Tuesday that the new system it is proposing, Topics, would allow web advertisers to target broad categories of users—those interested in “fitness” or “travel,” for example—instead of grouping them into thousands of cohorts with similar browsing histories.
The company’s Chrome browser will distill a shortlist of interests based on a user’s recent browsing history, the company said. Users will be able to see and delete interests the browser assigns to them, or turn the system off entirely.
The proposal is an outgrowth of Google’s plan to phase out a user-tracking technology called third-party cookies in 2023. Millions of marketers currently rely on third-party cookies, unique snippets of code to identify individual browsers, to target online advertisements based on users’ specific browsing histories. The practice has led to complaints from activists and privacy regulators in Europe and the US.

German media companies want the European Union to prevent Google from removing third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, claiming the move will eat into critical ad revenues for news organizations.
Axel Springer and hundreds of other publishers, advertisers, and content providers claim that Google parent Alphabet is breaking European antitrust laws with its plan to gradually phase out cookies from its signature web browser.
If Google were to follow through on the plan, it could result in revenue losses of up to 70% for media entities that rely on the search engine’s cookies to generate clicks through analyzing user preferences.
The complaint was filed with EU antitrust regulators in Brussels on Monday, according to the Financial Times.
While Google claims the move is being done to safeguard users’ privacy, the publishers claimed that Google will still be able to use alternative methods to collect data that will benefit its own advertising service while leaving competitors in the lurch.
“Publishers must remain in a position where they are allowed to ask their users for consent to process data, without Google capturing this decision,” according to the complaint.

The attorneys general of three states and Washington, DC, are filing suits Monday alleging that Google deceived consumers into giving up their location data, reported The Hill. 
The suits allege that the search giant made misleading promises about how much privacy it could guarantee users dating back to at least 2014.
Google also allegedly used “dark patterns”, user interface tricks employed by websites to get individuals to do things against their will,  to inadvertently make consumers share more data, the attorneys general claim.
“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” DC Attorney General Karl Racine (D) said in a statement.
The attorneys general of Texas, Washington and Indiana are expected to file lawsuits in their own states as well.
“Google’s founding motto is ‘Don’t Be Evil,'” Texas’s Ken Paxton (R) said. “And yet it systematically lies to millions of consumers in order to stack billions of dollars into its coffers.”

Google on Thursday appealed an EU court decision to uphold the bloc’s EUR 2.4 billion fine for abusing its search engine dominance, reported Reuters.
The tech giant said it would go to the European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court, after the General Court confirmed in November a decision by the European Commission in 2017. At the time, the fine was the European Union’s biggest ever. 
“After careful consideration, we have decided to appeal the General Court’s decision because we feel there are areas that require legal clarification from the European Court of Justice,” a short statement by the company said.
The case centers on Google’s shopping service and is one of three against the search engine giant currently moving through the EU’s drawn-out appeals system.
The new appeal could take up to two years to reach an outcome, stretching the case out to well more than a decade after the commission launched its investigation in 2010.

Google wrote in a filing that the state had failed to show that it engaged in anticompetitive behavior and hadn’t proved that an agreement between Facebook and Google, a core part of the case, violated the law.
“We’re confident that this case is wrong on the facts and the law, and should be dismissed,” said Adam Cohen, the company’s director of economic policy.

The Texas lawsuit argues that Google has obtained and abused a monopoly over the labyrinthine set of systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. The states argue that Google misled publishers and advertisers about the nature of the ad auctions, allowing it to pocket more of the money flowing through its ad systems. And they say the company used a deal with Facebook to maintain its dominance when the publishers tried to develop an alternative system.
“Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” Google said in its filing.
Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement: “Google’s motion attributes their monopoly status to pure success on the merits. The company whose motto was once ‘Don’t Be Evil’ now asks the world to examine their egregious monopoly abuses and see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil.”

Apple and Google argued to lawmakers Tuesday, January 18, that bipartisan antitrust legislation aimed at curbing the power of big technology companies would harm the privacy and security of users if it becomes law, reported the LA Times.
Escalating its opposition to the legislation, Apple sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Richard J. Durbin; the panel’s ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley; Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar; and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee. The letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg News, underscores Apple’s push to protect its App Store from government oversight and changes that would disrupt its business model.
“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Tim Powderly, Apple’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the letter. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”

Chief executives of Google and Facebook personally oversaw a 2018 deal that advantaged Facebook on Google’s ad auctions, a group of state attorneys general alleged in court documents Friday.
The complaint also alleges Google manipulated its ad pricing tiers under a secret program called Project Bernanke that removed second-place bids on ad auctions. It allowed Google to pocket part of the difference between first and third-place bids while also harming publishers that rely on ad revenue and who could have made more from higher bids.
Under the agreement with Facebook, Google and Facebook illegally collaborated to decrease prices paid to publishers, cut out rival ad networks and manipulate ad auctions operated by publishers, the complaint says.
The new filing shows just how far up the arrangement, alleged in earlier filings, went. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, whose name is redacted in the complaint, called the agreement “a big deal strategically” in an email including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose name was also redacted. Sandberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai signed off on the deal’s terms, the states allege, noting Sandberg was previously a high-ranking executive in Google’s advertising business.

Google’s bid to overturn a €100 million (US$114.4 million) French fine hit a snag after an aide to the nation’s top court backed accusations against the search engine over its cookies policy, reported Bloomberg.
The Alphabet unit has been embroiled in a court fight over the then-record fine in 2020 for targeting users with cookies without their consent and failing to offer a simple way to reject the tracking devices. Google was hit with a new record €150 million (US$171.6 million) penalty last week for still not allowing users an easy way out of its cookies.
But court adviser Laurent Domingo said at a hearing Wednesday, January 12, that the initial penalty was justified because Google “failed to abide” by its “obligations, even though these were clear.” 
He criticized Google for failing to seek the consent of google.fr users to place cookies on their computers or informing them adequately, and for having an inefficient mechanism to block these tracking devices.
European Union data protection regulators have gained unprecedented fining powers since the bloc’s so-called General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May 2018, which allows them to levy penalties of as much as 4% of a company’s annual global sales. The latest Google fines are based on yet another set of rules regulating the use of online tracking devices and come amid a much fiercer climate of regulatory scrutiny of tech giants worldwide.

The German Federal Cartel Office, the Bundeskartellamt, is launching a consultation with the press publishing industry to assess the measures taken by Google to smooth out competition concerns with regards to Google News Showcase.
The Federal Cartel Office started a proceeding against Google to investigate Google News Showcase under antitrust laws in response to the complaint made by Corint Media last June.
The examination is largely based on the authority’s competences under the new rules for large digital companies. The investigation follows the authority’s most recent decision determining Google’s “paramount significance for competition across markets” within the meaning of Section 19a(1) German Competition Act (GWB). Google is thus subject to special abuse control by the Bundeskartellamt pursuant to Section 19a(2) GWB, which is relevant in this proceeding.
Google News Showcase is a news service offered by Google giving publishing companies the opportunity to present their contents in prominent “story panels”. The publishers’ “story panels” are displayed under Google News and Google Discover.
Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt said, “Google has proposed measures to respond to our competition concerns relating to Google News Showcase. The company no longer plans to include Showcase content in the general search results. The conditions for participating in Google News Showcase are not intended to prevent publishers from enforcing their general ancillary copyright. Access to Google News Showcase is based on objective criteria. We rely on the assessment of the market players affected to ensure that the measures proposed by Google are effective. In view of the wide variety of interests the publishers may have we are thus conducting broader consultations in the sector.”
Google has already changed some of the practices under examination and declared its willingness to address any remaining ambiguities and concerns by modifying the Showcase contracts and providing clarifying statements.

“In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined,” the CCI order stated. “It appears that Google is using its dominant position in the relevant markets to enter/protect its position in the market for news aggregation service.”
News organizations, which have been losing advertising revenue to online aggregators such as Google, have complained for years about tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment.
The CCI order also mentioned new rules in France and Australia – fueled by media lobbying and public pressure – that have led to licensing deals around the world collectively worth billions of dollars.

According to Reuters, France’s data privacy watchdog CNIL has fined Alphabet’s Google a record 150 million euros ($169 million) for making it difficult for internet users to refuse online trackers known as cookies.
Facebook was also fined 60 million euros for the same reason, the CNIL said.
Internet users’ prior consent for the use of cookies — tiny snippets of data that help build targeted digital ad campaigns — is a key pillar of the European Union’s data privacy regulation and a top priority for the CNIL.
“When you accept cookies, it’s done in just one click,” said Karin Kiefer, CNIL’s head for data protection and sanctions. “Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them”.
In its statement, the watchdog said it had found that the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites didn’t allow the refusal of cookies easily, citing Google’s video-streaming platform.
The CNIL said the two companies had three months to comply with its orders or face an extra penalty payment of 100,000 euros per day of delay.
These include the obligation for Google and Facebook to provide French internet users simpler tools for refusing cookies, in order to guarantee their consent.
The CNIL said that while Google and Facebook provided a virtual button to allow the immediate acceptance of cookies, there was no equivalent to refuse them as easily.
“People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision,” a Google spokesperson said. France Google Facebook Fine

Germany’s antitrust watchdog paved the way Wednesday, January 5, for extra scrutiny of Google by designating it a company of “paramount significance,” the first to get that label since regulators got more power to curb abusive practices by big digital companies.
The Bundeskartellamt stated its decision comes after rules were introduced last year that allow it “to intervene earlier and more effectively” to ban companies from using anti-competitive practices. The regulator’s decision, which lasts five years, gives it extended powers to supervise Google for “abuse control.”
The watchdog stated Google has “significant influence” over other companies’ access to its users and advertising customers through search, YouTube, Android, and its online Play Store “and can set rules and conditions for other businesses across markets.”
It’s the latest example of how big tech companies are facing pressure over concerns their dominance stifles competition and hurts consumers. Europe has led the global move to crack down on tech giants, but early efforts drew criticism that investigations took too long, with some stretching on for years — a problem the German rules aim to address.
“This is a very important step, since based on this decision, the Bundeskartellamt can now take action against specific anti-competitive practices by Google,” said the watchdog’s president, Andreas Mundt.
Google is not appealing the decision. It noted the decision doesn’t take a position on the company’s conduct.
“We are confident that we comply with the rules and, to the extent that changes are necessary, we will continue to work constructively with the (Federal Cartel Office) to find solutions that enable people and businesses in Germany to continue to use our products,” Google said in a statement.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapa told Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday, January 5, to stop trying to “bully” Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter into recusal, they shared with CNBC.
“Google should focus on complying with antitrust law rather than attempting to rig the system with these unseemly tactics,” the lawmakers wrote.
Following Kanter’s confirmation in the Senate in November, Google requested the DOJ review whether he should be recused from cases and investigations involving its business. Google cited Kanter’s prior work for its rivals like Yelp in antitrust matters involving its business, and pointed to previous statements about Google’s alleged dominance to argue he’d already made up his mind on its liability.Related: Google Seeks Recusal From Kantner Over Yelp & Microsoft Cases
Kanter has not committed to recusing himself from matters involving Google, but told lawmakers ahead of his confirmation that he would consult DOJ ethics officials about whether he should do so. A recusal would bar Kanter from involvement in the department’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Google and likely any future investigations, though responsibility would fall to his deputies.
Warren and Jayapal wrote that Google’s argument “distorts federal ethics requirements, improperly claiming that because Mr. Kanter has worked to enforce antitrust law against Google in the past, he cannot do so on behalf of the federal government now.”They wrote that under federal ethics law and regulations, recusal is required when a person has a financial interest involving certain parties, worked for an employer or client in the past two years that is a party in a particular matter, or would be deemed potentially impartial by a reasonable person with the relevant facts.
The Democrats said that since Kanter has not represented Google or the US, the two parties that would be named in any federal lawsuit against Google, that should not be a basis for his recusal.

159,"December 8, 2021",200 US News Publishers Sue Google & Facebook Over Market Dominance,"


A group of 30 newspaper publishers, including Seattle-based Robinson Newspapers, have sued Google and Facebook over the way the social and search giants profit from news content at the expense of the publications that produce it.
The lawsuits, outlined in a story by Axios, involve more than 200 individual publications and are based on a central antitrust premise: that the two tech companies are so pervasive in online advertising that they illegally siphon up revenue that would otherwise go to local news.
The litigation’s goal, according to the Axios report, is “to recover past damages to newspapers” caused by Big Tech companies, according to a lawyer representing the newspapers.
Filed in September, the Robinson lawsuit blames the two tech companies for a sharp decline in revenue. “Defendants’ anticompetitive and monopolistic practices have had a profound effect upon our country’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry,” the lawsuit states.
“Since 2006, newspaper advertising revenue, which is critical for funding high-quality journalism, fell by over 50%.”

Russia fined Google 9 million roubles ($121,000), a Moscow court said on Tuesday, in the latest in a string of penalties against the technology giant for failing to delete content the government deems illegal, reported Reuters. 
Moscow has increased pressure on foreign tech companies this year in a campaign that critics characterize as an attempt by the authorities to exert tighter control over the Internet, something they say threatens to stifle individual and corporate freedom.
Google and Meta Platforms both face court cases this month for repeated violations of Russian legislation on content and could be fined a percentage of their annual revenue in Russia. 
Moscow’s Tagansky District Court on Tuesday said Google had been fined a total of 9 million roubles in three separate administrative cases for not deleting content.
The court cited legislation which said this may include posts containing extremist activities, child pornography or the promotion of drug use.
Google has paid more than 32 million roubles in fines this year and has significantly reduced the number of posts prohibited by Moscow, the company and Russia have said.

161,"December 1, 2021","The General Court in Case T‑612/17, Google Shopping: the rise of a doctrine of equal treatment in Article 102 TFEU","
By: Pablo Ibañez Colomo (Chilling Competition)
The General Court’s judgment in Google Shopping (available here) is finally out. There is much to unpack, and much that will be debated in the coming days and weeks. In this regard: the Journal of European Competition Law & Practice is planning a Special Issue devoted to the judgment. More details will follow in due course, but we will be open to proposed submissions, as we want to make sure that the issue is as balanced and diverse as possible.
The above said, it is immediately possible to get a clear idea of the logic underpinning the judgment. It is remarkable in a number of ways, which, if appealed and confirmed by the Court of Justice, may lead to a substantial expansion of the scope of Article 102 TFEU.
The rationale behind the judgment can be summarised as follows:
The General Court’s develops a principle of equal treatment, which is inferred from the case law applicable to public undertakings (and public bodies) and is now expanded to other dominant firms (para 155).There is an element of ‘abnormality’ in the differential treatment of a search engine’s affiliated services, on the one hand, and third party ones, on the other (paras 176, 179 and 616).Google’s search engine is a ‘quasi-essential facility’; in any event, it is not necessary to establish that the platform is indispensable within the meaning of the Bronner case law.
Equal treatment, abnormality and competition on the merits
When reading the judgment, one cannot avoid the impression that the General Court viewed the practice at stake in the case as inherently suspicious, that is, as a departure, by its very nature, from competition on the merits. To quote the judgment itself: ‘the promotion on Google’s general results pages of one type of specialised result – its own – over the specialised results of competitors involves a certain form of abnormality‘ (para 176).
The judgment concludes that the behaviour at stake is ‘abnormal’ for two separate reasons…

Italy’s antitrust regulator has fined Google and iPhone maker Apple 10 million euros ($11.2 million) each for “aggressive practices” linked to the commercial use of user data, reported Reuters. 
The authority said in a statement the two tech groups did not provide “clear and immediate information” on how they collect and use the data of those who access their services.
Both Google and Apple said they disagreed with the antitrust decision and that they would appeal it.
The watchdog said that when users set up their account with Google, the system was designed in such a way that the terms and conditions on data usage were set up to be accepted.
In the case of Apple, users do not have a choice on the issue, the antitrust regulator added.
“We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users, so they can choose what information to share or not, and how it’s used,” Apple said in a statement, describing the regulator’s view as “wrong”.
Google said in a statement it followed “fair and transparent practices to provide users with useful services, as well as provide clear information on their use”.

The UK competition watchdog said that it has secured improved commitments from Google on proposals to remove third-party cookies and other functions from its Chrome browser.
The Competition and Markets Authority said Google’s revised privacy proposals address its competition concerns, and the regulator is now consulting on these modifications.
In 2019, Google launched the Privacy Sandbox initiative. It includes proposals to improve online security and address covert tracking techniques. The company says tracking technologies need to be addressed in order to protect privacy online.
However, the CMA has been investigating Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals since the start of the year due to concerns that they could impede competition in digital advertising markets, causing advertising spending to become even more concentrated on Google.
Now, Google has offered to appoint an independent monitoring trustee, more extensive testing commitments and a more transparent process to take market feedback on the Privacy Sandbox proposals. It has also committed not to use Google first-party personal data to track users for targeting and measurement of ads shown on non-Google websites.
“If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy,” CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.

Support for curbing large technology companies’ market power is widening in the Senate, with lawmakers in both parties endorsing new legal constraints on search engines, e-marketplaces, app stores and other online platforms.
Lawmakers say they are responding to public concerns over the size and influence of the tech companies, reported Wall Street Journal.

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), a lead sponsor of some of the key bills, said. “There is bipartisan momentum to get something done, and the public is on our side.”
The measures must overcome a stepped-up lobbying effort in opposition from companies including Google,Amazon and Apple which say many of the proposals will hurt consumers who have grown dependent on their products and services.
The momentum for the bills in the Senate echoes the earlier push in the House. The House Judiciary Committee passed a raft of far-reaching antitrust bills after a tumultuous meeting in June that stretched over two days, including an all-night.

Google and its video platform YouTube owe nearly $26 million for infringing a streaming-video patent owned by VideoShare, a Texas federal jury said.
The Waco, Texas jury found Tuesday that YouTube’s streaming technology works in the same way as VideoShare’s patented technology for converting a video to multiple formats and transmitting it in the best format for a user’s device.
The jury also rejected Google and YouTube’s claims that the patent was invalid for containing “well-understood, routine, and conventional” elements.
Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in an email Wednesday the company is still confident the patent is invalid and that it didn’t infringe, and is evaluating its options.
VideoShare attorney Michael Shore of Shore Chan said in a statement on Wednesday that the company “had the facts and the law on its side.”
VideoShare, which was created in 1998 by three inventors who developed early streaming-video technology, suedGoogle and YouTube in 2019, alleging YouTube technology for transmitting a video file to a user based on its compatibility with the user’s device infringed the patent.

The EU’s General Court ruled Wednesday that the European Commission was right in fining Google for an antirust breach, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The ruling comes after the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in 2017 that Google had favored its own comparison shopping services and fined the company 2.42 billion euros ($2.8 billion) for breaching antitrust rules. Alphabet-unit Google contested the claims using the EU’s second-highest court.
“The General Court finds that, by favoring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favorable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms, Google departed from competition on the merits,” the court said in a press release Wednesday.
In addition, the court also confirmed the fine at 2.42 billion euros. “The General Court concludes its analysis by finding that the amount of the pecuniary penalty imposed on Google must be confirmed,” the court added.

“Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales on the platform.

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) third Digital Platform Services Inquiry interim report found that Google continues to be the dominant search engine in Australia, with a market share of 94%. Google Search is the default search engine on the two most popular browsers in Australia, Google’s Chrome browser and Apple’s Safari browser, which are pre-installed on most mobile devices in Australia.
The report found that Google’s dominance in general search engine services in Australia is extended and entrenched by the large sums of money it pays to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser, its ownership of Chrome and by the pre-installation and default arrangements it has in place with competing browser suppliers and device manufacturers that use Google’s Android operating system.
“Search engines play a critical role in the digital economy. We are concerned that Google’s dominance and its ability to use its financial resources to fund arrangements to be the default search engine on many devices and other means through which consumers access search, such as browsers, is harming competition and consumers,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“Google pays billions of dollars each year for these placements, which illustrates how being the default search engine is extremely valuable to Google’s business model.”

Earlier this year Epic Games announced that it has filed a legal claim against Google with the Federal Court of Australia, continuing its pursuit for fairer digital platforms globally. Epic has already filed a claim with the Court against Apple on similar grounds. 
In the claim Epic alleges that Google’s anti-competitive conduct breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). The company states that Google abuses its control over the Android operating system (“Android OS”), restricting competition in payment processing and app distribution on the Google Play Store. This harmful conduct stifles innovation, reduces consumer choice and inflates prices. 
This claim complements legal proceedings already underway in the US and UK, as well as an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union. Epic is not seeking damages from Google or Apple, it is simply seeking fair access and competition that will benefit consumers and developers.

“Google further avers that for Fortnite transactions processed through Epic’s own payment processing tool, Google is paid nothing for its intellectual property or for app distribution,” according to the lawsuit. “Epic has reaped economic benefit from its relationship with Google and all of the services that Google provided to Epic.”
Google claims that Epic’s contract breach led to it removing Fortnite from the Google Play store last year.
Epic Games’ launch of Fortnite on Google Play was part of Project Liberty, according to Google, and it was part of Epic’s plan to end what it considers an anti-competitive fee from Apple and Google’s app stores. Google claims that Epic intentionally breached its contract to “draw Google into a legal battle over antitrust.”
Google asked for a jury trial in its countersuit and asks for compensatory and punitive damages, and restitution of Epic’s profits. Epic filed its complaint against Google in August 2020, claiming the Google Play store prevents healthy competition.

185,"October 7, 2021",Alternative Search Engines Write EU With Complaints About Google,"


Four search providers—DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Qwant, and Lilo—have penned an open letter to the European Commission claiming that Google is suppressing search engine competition.
The EU has made a number of efforts to counter Google’s search monopoly, including a July 2018 ruling that the company engaged in “illegal tying of Google’s search and browser apps” and “illegal payments conditional on exclusive pre-installation of Google Search.”
Google responded with some licensing changes. In August 2019, it agreed with the EU to provide an Android Choice screen, which included selling spots on the new menu via auction – leading to participants like privacy-centric DuckDuckGo complaining that they were priced out.
The Android Choice screen has since been revised by further agreement with the European Commission, and now features more options and free participation. The new choice screen includes up to 12 search services, with the five most popular search engines in the local country listed first, as recorded by StatCounter, and is free for search providers.
Third-party search providers are not happy. Today’s open letter [PDF] states that “despite recent changes, we do not believe it will move market share significantly.” The providers say that the new Android Choice menu is “only shown once, in a Google-designed, Google-owned onboarding process. If [users] later decide to switch defaults, they must labour through 15+ clicks or factory-reset their phone.” They also complain that Chrome desktop and other operating systems are not included, and worry that “it doesn’t apply to all search aspects points in Android.”

Google’s Nest Hub doesn’t infringe a patent owned by Profectus Technology for a digital picture frame, a federal jury in Waco, Texas, found. The jury also sided with Google and found the patent claims invalid. 
The jury in US District Judge Alan Albright’s court, which is known as a hotspot for patent litigation, also found that the relevant parts of it weren’t valid.
Google’s attorney Darin Snyder of O’Melveny & Myers declined to comment. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Profectus attorneys Casey Griffith and Michael Barbee of Griffith Barbee.
Texas-based Profectus sued Google last year, alleging its Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max – which control smart-home functions, display pictures and play music, among other things – infringe its patent. Profectus’ patent relates to a mountable picture frame for displaying digital images.
The jury found Wednesday after a four-day trial that Mountain View, California-based Google didn’t infringe the patent or induce others to infringe, and also found the five parts of the patent at issue weren’t patentable.

On Monday Google submitted a  motion to compel where they asked the District of Columbia court overseeing a Department of Justice antitrust suit to compel the production of documents from proposed custodian Luther Lowe, Yelp’s Senior Vice President of Public Policy. According to the defendant, the documents Lowe holds are crucial to its defense. The motion explained that Yelp’s long-held views about Google’s alleged monopolism were “conceived and advanced” by Lowe and reportedly are central to the government’s theory of liability.

The case, filed by the federal government and a handful of states, is proceeding through discovery after Google answered the complaint in December 2020. In the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Google acted as a “monopoly gatekeeper” and successfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in several markets: the general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising markets.
The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief to restrain Google from its allegedly anticompetitive conduct. This week’s motion explains that Lowe is “a non-lawyer who has testified before the US Senate and Ohio Senate, has made numerous appearances on television and podcasts, and has given other commentary seeking antitrust enforcement against Google on the very allegations ultimately brought by the Plaintiffs.” As such, Google alleges that there is no comparable custodian.

Billions of people use Google because it’s the best, not because of deals the company made to stay competitive, Google’s lawyer said on Friday, wrapping up a week of testimony as the US tech giant fights a record US$5 billion antitrust fine. 
The European Commission hit Google with a €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine in 2018 for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet searching from 2011.
At issue are deals requiring phone makers to pre-install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser app together with Google Play, as well deals blocking some variants of Android.

“The reason why billions of people choose Google as their search tool every day is not because of an abuse of dominance. It’s because it’s the best,” lawyer Meredith Pickford told the EU’s General Court, the bloc’s second highest.
Pickford said the deals were far from being anti-competitive tools, rather they were to ensure Google stayed competitive.
“You can still compete hard and compete on the merits. Consumers aren’t stupid. If Bing or another search engine were better than Google, people would turn to it,” he said, referring to a rival Microsoft  search engine.

According to Reuters, €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) European Union antitrust fine was based on flawed calculations, Alphabet’s Google claimed on Thursday, September 30, urging Europe’s second-highest court to scrap or reduce what it claimed was not an appropriate penalty.
Google was fined for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet search from 2011, in the largest penalty meted out to any company found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.
“The fine that was imposed, a staggering 4.34 billion euros, was not appropriate,” Google’s lawyer Genevra Forwood told the five-judge panel of the General Court on the fourth day of a week-long hearing, which is taking place three years after the European Commission sanctioned the company.
Related: Google Tells EU Court New Updates Give Android A Chance Against Apple
“The problem is not the headline-grabbing fine per se. The problem is how the Commission reached that figure,” she said.
Forwood said there was no anti-competitive intent in Google’s actions nor could it have known that its conduct was an abuse based on EU case law and there was no precedent for it.
“So it was wrong for the Commission to impose any fine at all, let alone turn up the dials to reach its biggest fine ever,” Forwood said.
She also took issue with the EU competition enforcer adding a 11% gravity factor to Google’s fine, compared with 5% for Intel in 2009 in a separate case.
“Even if this Court considers that a fine is appropriate, it would only be proper to turn the dials right down,” she said.

Payments to phone makers to pre-install only Google Search on their devices were not aimed at preventing competition, but were necessary for Android to seize market share from Apple, Alphabet’s Google told Europe’s second-top court on Wednesday, September 29.
Google was addressing the General Court on the third day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get judges to dismiss a record €4.3 billion (US$3.7 billion) EU antitrust fine and a European Commission order to loosen its search engine grip on Android devices.
The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs) because these shut out rivals.
This was not the case and the payments were just to encourage phone makers, which were already generating money from other apps, to give Android a place, Google lawyer Assimakis Komninos told the court.
“Google had to offer an offsetting revenue stream. An incentive to convince them to open up and adopt the Android platform. At the same time, the RSAs also helped them to keep prices down and compete more successfully with Apple,” he said.
“And obviously, Google was getting in return a promotional opportunity, sole preinstallation, which allowed it to invest in a free OS (operating system), a free app store and so on.”
On top of that, the RSAs only covered 5% of the market, Komninos said.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan rejected the claim. “What concerned them was competitors gaining traction,” he said and the RDAs were “the pinnacle of Google’s interlocking practices.”

Google is on a collision course with advertisers and publishers who fired off a fresh antitrust complaint with the European Union in the run up to the US tech giant’s court fight over a record US$5 billion antitrust fine.  
Movement for an Open Web, an industry group, asked the European Union to rein in how Google tweaks its search engine, after the company imposed ad-tracking changes that threaten to hit advertisers’ and publishers’ revenue streams.  
A previous complaint fueled a UK probe and the group’s members now want their evidence to bolster the European Commission’s wide-ranging investigation into Google’s advertising technology. 
Google, a unit of Alphabet, has been embroiled in various antitrust battles in Europe for more than a decade. Its lawyers are currently challenging a record US$5 billion EU fine at a five-day court hearing in Luxembourg. The EU earlier this year stated it would investigate Google’s privacy changes and how the search giant may favor its own online display advertising technologies over rivals.

Google dominates Australia’s online advertising market to the point of harming publishers, advertisers and ultimately consumers, the country’s antitrust regulator stated, calling for new rules to rein in the Big Tech giant.
A report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), published on Tuesday, September 28, stated that more than 90% of clicks on advertisements traded through the Australian “ad tech” supply chain passed through at least one service owned by the Alphabet unit in 2020.
“Google has used its vertically integrated position to operate its ad tech services in a way that has, over time, led to a less competitive ad tech industry,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement, released alongside the report.
“This conduct has helped Google to establish and entrench its dominant position in the ad tech supply chain. We recommend rules be considered to manage conflicts of interest, prevent anti-competitive self-preferencing, and ensure rival ad tech providers can compete on their merits.”
A Google spokesman was not immediately available for comment. In a blogpost published soon before the ACCC’s report, Google wrote that its advertising technology supported more than 15,000 Australian jobs and contributed AU$2.45 billion a year to the country’s economy annually.
The ACCC stated the US company benefited from vast amounts of internet user data from its search engine, mapping, and YouTube video streaming services, and must be more transparent about the way it uses this information to sell advertisements.
The regulator stated it wanted special powers to address the imbalance of advertiser access to consumer data, such as rules forcing them to separate data between business units or share data with competitors.

193,"September 27, 2021",India Judge Accepts Google’s Confidentiality Request,"
India’s antitrust watchdog has agreed to Google’s request to keep confidential some information the company provided during an investigation into its business, though the regulator denied allegations it leaked a report on the probe to the media, a judge said on Monday.
Google sued the Competition Commission of India (CCI) at a New Delhi court last week, urging a judge to direct the watchdog to prevent leaks of information.
The filing came after The Times of India and Reuters reported this month, citing a confidential CCI report, that the regulator’s probe had found that the US tech giant abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, unfairly using its “huge financial muscle” to hurt competitors.
Google, in its 188-page court filing seen by Reuters, stated it was aggrieved by the CCI’s rejection of its request, made before the media reports, that “highly business sensitive information” it had provided to the regulator during the course of the investigation be kept confidential.
On Monday, September 27, Justice Rekha Palli said the CCI had agreed to accept Google’s request to keep its submissions confidential, without elaborating on the details of the agreement between the watchdog and the company.
If Google “still has a grievance that any information is being leaked”, it can seek legal recourse, Justice Palli added.
However the justice said CCI had rejected as untrue Google’s allegations that it had leaked any information to the media.
On Friday, in a near hour-long showdown in court, Google had called the CCI a “habitual offender” in terms of leaking confidential information. The watchdog’s counsel repeatedly denied the allegations, and accused the US company of frustrating the investigative process.
Google’s filing to the court, reviewed by Reuters, said the publication of the investigation report’s findings caused “irreversible damage” to its reputation.

194,"September 27, 2021",Google In Court To Appeal EU’s Android Antitrust Case,"


Google is heading to a top EU court Monday, September 27, to appeal a record EU antitrust penalty imposed for stifling competition through the dominance of its Android operating system.
The company is fighting a 2018 decision from the EU’s executive Commission, the bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, that resulted in the €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine still the biggest ever fine Brussels has imposed for anticompetitive behavior.
It’s one of three antitrust penalties totaling more than US$8 billion that the Commission hit Google with between 2017 and 2019.
The others focused on shopping and search, and the California company is appealing all three.
While the penalties involved huge sums, critics point out that Google can easily afford them and that the fines haven’t done much to widen competition.
In its original decision, the Commission claimed that Google’s practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.
Google, however, plans to argue that free and open source Android has led to lower-priced phones and spurred competition with its chief rival, Apple.
Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world.
This case isn’t supported by the facts or the law, the company stated as the five-day hearing opens at the European Court of Justice’s General Court.
Android is the most popular mobile operating system, beating even Apple’s iOS, and is found on four out of five devices in Europe.
The Commission ruled that Google broke EU rules by requiring smartphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all, and prevented them from selling devices with altered versions of Android.
The bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps, and Gmail, but regulators focused on the three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome, and the company’s Play Store for apps.
Google’s position is that because Android is open source and free, phone makers or consumers can decide for themselves which apps to install on their devices.
And because it’s the only one bearing the costs of developing and maintaining Android, Google has to find ways to recoup that expense, so its solution is to include apps that will generate revenue, namely Search and Chrome.
The company also argues that just because its apps come pre-installed on Android phones, it doesn’t mean users are excluded from downloading rival services.

Google is reportedly seeking to settle a new antitrust probe by the European Union into its digital advertising practices. Reuters reports the settlement might help the search giant avert another hefty fine that could amount to US$18.2 billion.
In June, the European Commission launched an investigation into Google’s online advertising technology business for possible violations of EU competition rules. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s executive vice president in charge of competition policy in the region, stated at the time that Google may be abusing its advertising dominance to make it “harder for rival online advertising services” to compete in this sector.
The EC’s latest investigation focuses on whether Google limits third-party access to “user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use.” 
Citing an anonymous source, Reuters says the Alphabet unit made a proposal to the EU, though the specifics of the proposed settlement are unknown at this time. If approved, Google’s settlement will allow it to avoid paying fines of up to 10% of its global revenue.

Technology giant Google has approached the Delhi High Court, complaining against the leak of a confidential report in an ongoing investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against it. 
The report relates to an antitrust investigation by the competition regulator into Google’s android smartphones agreements.The petition was mentioned on Thursday morning, September 23, by Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi before the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.
On September 18, the Times of India newspaper reported that the regulator’s investigative arm, the Director General (DG), had found Google’s conduct to be anti-competitive in the mobile operating systems and related markets.
The probe found Google India guilty of stifling competition and innovation to the detriment of the market as well as consumers in order to maintain its grip and dominance in search, music (through YouTube), browser (chrome), app library (Play Store), and other key services, the daily reported.
The competition law promises confidentiality to entities under CCI investigation and gives them the right to claim, negotiate non-disclosure of commercially sensitive information obtained as part of a DG investigation. Once the DG submits its report to the CCI, parties to an investigation get an opportunity to rebut the findings. Only after that, the regulator gives a final order.

The Commission declined to comment. Google did not respond to several requests and phone calls for comment.
It remains to be seen whether European antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is open to settlement talks which typically take months or even years before any agreement can be reached or they could stall mid-way.

The once high-flying Australian founded startup has filed a 69-page complaint in the state of California, in which it claims it was forced into bankruptcy as a direct result of Google banning Unlockd’s apps from its services.
“Google is no longer the idealistic startup it once claimed to be,” the complaint stated. “It has acquired monopoly power in multiple digital markets, in areas ranging from online search engines to mobile application distribution, and it uses its monopoly power to strengthen its dominance and exclude its competitors, always keeping in mind its core profit driver: digital advertising.

Four members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into whether an advertising agreement between Facebook and Alphabet violated federal antitrust laws.
The letter, signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts) and Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut), and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Democrat – Washington), and Mondaire Jones (Democrat – New York), was sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Acting US Attorney Nicholas Ganjei.
Federal criminal cases can take years, but a probe would form a new front in the multi-pronged effort to rein in Big Tech. Prior efforts against the tech giants have largely been in the form of civil litigation, directives to federal agencies, and proposed legislation. The Federal Trade Commission has filed a civil suit against Facebook for alleged antitrust activities.
The letter takes issue with an agreement between Google and Facebook executives. Information about the pact, nicknamed “Jedi Blue,” and Google’s alleged efforts to secure dominance in online advertising were first outlined in the Texas-led complaint last year and subsequent court documents, some of which were improperly redacted. The suit alleges that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising. Many of the accusations in the Texas-led suit relate to Google’s ad technology, which companies use to buy and sell ads on the web.
The letter notes that in exchange for backing off technology that threatened Google’s dominance, Facebook received a fixed percentage of ad bids on Google’s platform.

Google announced on Wednesday, September 1, it was appealing against a €500 million (US$591 million) fine imposed by France’s antitrust watchdog in July over a dispute with local media about paying for news content, reported CNBC.
The fine came amid increasing international pressure on online platforms such as Google, part of Alphabet, and Facebook to share more of the revenue they make from using media outlets’ news.
“We disagree with a number of legal elements, and believe that the fine is disproportionate to our efforts to reach an agreement and comply with the new law,” said Sebastien Missoffe, head of Google France.
“We continue to work hard to resolve this case and put deals in place. This includes expanding offers to 1,200 publishers, clarifying aspects of our contracts, and sharing more data as requested by the French Competition Authority.”
The French antitrust body imposed the sanction on Google for failing to comply with its orders on how to conduct the talks with publishers.
It stated on Wednesday that Google’s appeal, which will be ruled on by Paris’ court of appeal, would not hold up the fine, which the US tech giant must still pay. It could not say how long the appeal process would take.
The case focused on whether Google breached temporary orders issued by the authority, which stated that such talks should take place, within three months, with any news publishers that asked for them.

207,"August 31, 2021",South Korea Passes Bill Limiting Apple & Google’s Payment Dominance,"
The South Korean parliament approved a bill on Tuesday, August 31, that will ban major app store operators — like Google and Apple — from requiring developers to only use their payment systems to process the sale of digital products and services, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The legislation will become law once signed by President Moon Jae-in, whose party has been a vocal supporter of the bill.
Apple and Google’s policies usually require developers to pay the tech giants a commission as high as 30% of every transaction.
The bill, approved Tuesday, means that developers will be able to avoid paying commission to major app store operators — like Google and Apple — by directing users to pay via alternate platforms.
An Apple spokesperson said the bill will “put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases and features like ‘Ask to Buy’ and Parental Controls will become less effective.”
They added that user trust in App Store purchases will likely decrease as a result of the legislation.
A Google spokesperson said its service fee “helps keep Android free, giving developers the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world.”
“We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks,” the Google spokesperson added.

The law, sometimes referred to as the Anti-Google Law, was submitted to parliament last August, according to Yonhap News.
It is designed to prevents app store operators with dominant positions from forcing payment systems on app developers and “inappropriately” delaying app reviews or blocks, according to Reuters.
The law also gives the South Korean government the power to mediate disputes regarding payment, cancellations, and refunds in the app market, according to reports.
South Korean parliament approved the bill, and some 180 of the attending lawmakers voted in favor of passing the amendment made to the Telecommunications Business Act, Reuters reported.

Google’s Play Store for mobile devices generated US$11.2 billion in revenue in 2019 — a figure the company previously had not disclosed publicly — court documents unsealed by a federal judge Saturday, August 28 revealed, Reuters reported.
The store also saw US$8.5 billion in gross profit and US$7 billion in operating income, an operating margin of over 62%, according to the report.
The information was contained in previously redacted portions of a civil suit filed by the state of Utah and three dozen additional states in July, the report stated. Google unsuccessful had sought to keep the information private.
The suit alleges Google violated antitrust laws by zealously restricting access to its Play Store and, by extension, the marketplace for users of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system.
The attorneys general who are the plaintiffs in the suit describe the Play Store’s operating margin in the complaint as “enormous,” according to the filing.
US District Court Judge James Donato also ordered unredacted the entirety of a paragraph that stated: “Google’s tie is not necessary for it to reap significant profits from the Google Play Store and the Android ecosystem, nor for it to continue to invest in the quality of these products. Google’s core business model for Android is to collect detailed personal data from Android users and monetize that data through targeted advertising.”
The complaint alleged that search-related revenue totaled 78% of Android Search and Play Store revenue.

209,"August 29, 2021",Report: Google To Pay Apple $15B To Remain Default In Safari,"


Google could pay close to US$15 billion to Apple this year in order to retain its dominant search position on Apple products.
That report comes from the website Android Central, citing a new research note from Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. The US$15 billion figure comes from Apple’s public filings and analysis of Google’s traffic acquisition costs payments.
As reported here last year, the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in an antitrust suit that Google had paid Apple between US$8 billion and US$12 billion to hold the default search status on iPhones and other Apple devices.
The DOJ pointed to the deal to make its case of how Google uses its profits to sideline its rivals, and to show just how much search is worth.
According to Android Central, Sacconaghi suspects Google could pay more this year to prevent Microsoft from outbidding it. At the same time, the tech giant could revisit its strategy soon and try to renegotiate with Apple, as the payments could balloon to US$20 billion next year.
The report notes that there’s also a risk that regulators could block similar deals between Apple and Google, a move that could lead to a 4% to 5% impact on Apple’s gross profits. Apple has stated it supports Google because it is the most popular search engine, but notes users can easily change to different alternatives.

South Korea is likely to bar Google and Apple from requiring software developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commissions on in-app purchases, the first such curbs on the tech giants by a major economy, reported Reuters.
The parliament’s legislation and judiciary committee is expected on Tuesday, August 24, to approve the amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act, dubbed the “Anti-Google law,” that takes aim at app store operators with dominant market positions.
If the bill gets the committee’s approval, it will be put to a final vote on Wednesday. Lawmakers in South Korea have pushed the issue of the commission structure since mid-2020.
In a statement, Apple stated the bill “will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases.”
The iPhone maker stated it believes “user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal — leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.”

Tougher rules are needed to stop platforms like Google and Apple using their market power to push consumers into expensive payment options, according to competition regulator Rod Sims.
In a speech on Thursday, August 18, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will argue that legal battles against digital platforms are insufficient to curb their growing influence over app marketplaces, which may be pushing up prices for consumers.
“Enforcement actions and market studies are necessary to tackle the problems arising from dominant digital platforms, [but] they are not enough on their own,” Mr Sims will tell a global competition webinar, according to an advanced copy of his speech.
“This conclusion is of fundamental importance.” Mr Sims has led the ACCC into many legal battles against digital platforms in recent years, reported The New Daily.
The ACCC published a report into app marketplaces in April. It found the market is plagued with poor transparency, inadequate dispute resolution, and unfair and potentially anti-competitive behavior.
“We do not believe that Apple and Google are striking the right balance between providing streamlined, consistent processes for consumer complaints,” Mr Sims said.

Google had asked that the case, which was filed against it by Texas and other states, be combined with similar cases in US District Court for Northern California.
Texas opposed the move, and the request prompted federal legislation aimed at allowing state attorneys general to choose the venue for their lawsuits. 
The panel, which recently heard arguments on the proposed move, said that the Texas case and others involve “common questions of fact, and that centralization in the Southern District of New York will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses.”

A federal judge asked Microsoft on Friday to let him know how big of a burden it would be for the company to provide documents requested by long-time rival Alphabet’s Google, in a US antitrust lawsuit against Google.

Google served a subpoena to Microsoft more than three months ago, seeking documents regarding Microsoft’s Bing search engine as well as its Internet Explorer and Edge but has not received them, the filing said.
Google says some of the documents might shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully.

The European Union has given Google an eight-week ultimatum to make its travel-related search more transparent or the Silicon Valley technology giant could face consequences, Reuters reported on Monday, July 26, citing regulators from the EU and European Commission.
“EU consumers cannot be misled when using search engines to plan their holidays. We need to empower consumers to make their choices based on transparent and unbiased information,” said EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, per the news outlet.
The issue at hand concerns pricing and search ranking for hotels and airfare. Officials are concerned that the final prices shown don’t clearly show all fees and taxes. The reference prices used to figure out discounts are also not clearly shown, Reuters reported, citing a joint statement from the EU executive and national consumer watchdogs, led by the Dutch agency and the Belgian Directorate General for Economic Inspection.

Epic has renewed its fight against mobile platforms’ app store restrictions, filing an update to its antitrust case against Google. The filing adds mostly redacted details about Google’s alleged monopolistic behavior on Android, including banning Epic’s game Fortnite from the Google Play Store last year. The amended complaint comes soon after a judge officially linked the case with a recent multi-state lawsuit, which took aim at Google’s Play Store policies.
Epic’s complaint builds on information gleaned from government antitrust probes and documents produced since the original suit. One addition, for instance, includes details revealed last year about “the close relationship that Google maintains with Apple,” including an agreement to pay between $8 and $12 billion to be Apple’s default search provider. 
It also includes new information about Google’s supposed anti-competitive conduct, including its deals with phone makers and alternate app stores. Most of this information, however, has been sealed — leaving only hints about the claims that the case could hinge on.
Google denied the claims in a statement to The Verge. “The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users. While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies. We will continue to defend ourselves against these meritless claims,” said spokesperson José Castañeda.
Among the new redacted information, Epic apparently describes its plans to launch Fortnite on the Samsung Galaxy Store. “Google was determined not to let this happen,” the complaint says, so it offered Epic a “special deal” to launch on Google Play. When Epic rejected the deal, Google allegedly took other anti-competitive action, but the details of that action aren’t available

Google was fined €500 million (US$593 million) Tuesday, July 13, by French competition regulators for failing to comply with an order to negotiate fair deals with news publishers for the use of their content.
France’s Competition Authority stated Google had breached an April 2020 ruling that ordered the company to negotiate “in good faith” licensing deals with publishers and news agencies for any reuse of copyrighted content.
In January, Google agreed to a major digital copyright deal with French publishers. As part of that deal, the company stated it would negotiate individual licenses with members of France’s press alliance covering related rights and access to a new service called News Showcase.
France’s competition agency took issue with this, saying it did not include a discussion on remuneration for current uses of content covered by “neighboring rights” for the press. The regulator added that Google restricted the scope of talks with the media by refusing to include the use of press images.
It is the largest-ever fine imposed by France’s competition watchdog for a company’s failure to adhere to one of its rulings, according to France 24.

Google is set to acquire pring, a Tokyo-based cashless payment and settlement startup company, for between US$180 million and US$270 million, Nikkei Asia reported. The move will give the IT giant a foothold in Japan’s growing financial services space.
Once the deal is completed, Google will offer FinTech services, including payments and transfers, across Japan by next year, mirroring similar offerings in the US and India, according to the report.
Google’s entry into Japan marks an important shift for the country, which has been largely resistant to cashless payments, the report stated. Users of the pring app can make payments, cash transfers, and withdrawals on their mobile devices and laptops.
Google’s move into fintech services in Japan is the latest example of tech companies using their strong online presence and vast databases to become one-stop shops for various services including finance and shopping.
Japanese consumers have been relatively slow to embrace cashless payments, which suggests that the market has plenty of room for expansion. The entry of Google will intensify competition in the sector, where other technology players have already seen opportunity.

A group of 36 states and the District of Columbia sued Google on Wednesday over claims that its mobile app store abuses its market power and forces aggressive terms on software developers, reported The New York Times. 
The suit is the fourth state or federal antitrust lawsuit filed against Google since October, but the first to scrutinize the company’s lucrative app store. Utah, North Carolina, New York and Tennessee led the suit, which was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California.
Developers of mobile apps have taken issue with the way Google makes them use its own system for some payments inside their products. That system charges a 30 percent commission on top of many transactions, which the developers say forces them to charge higher prices for their services.
The lawsuit echoed those concerns, saying Google seized control of the distribution of mobile apps in its Android smartphone operating system.
“Because of Google’s anticompetitive conduct, Google Play Store’s market share — which is well over 90 percent — faces no credible threats, and market forces cannot exert pressure on its supracompetitive commissions,” the complaint said.
Google called the lawsuit “meritless” in a blog post. It said it was strange that the attorneys general had chosen to attack its Play Store instead of its rival Apple.
“Android and Google Play provide openness and choice that other platforms simply don’t,” wrote William White, senior director of public policy at Google. “This lawsuit isn’t about helping the little guy or protecting consumers. It’s about boosting a handful of major app developers who want the benefits of Google Play without paying for it.”

Following last week’s court decision in Washington, which pushed Facebook’s market value above US$1 trillion, Mr Sims said Facebook and Google’s power was as big a problem as the millionaire Rockefeller family’s control of the global oil refining market a century ago, which was ultimately ruled an illegal monopoly by the US Supreme Court.
He said the ACCC was gathering evidence of market power abuses by the American companies and planned to use two current inquiries to launch a new assault on them in conjunction with counterparts in Europe, Britain, the US, and Canada.
“In the next six to 18 months, a lot will change in terms of how those abuses are dealt with,” Mr Sims said in an interview. “There is an extraordinary amount of market power: self preferencing, markets that aren’t transparent, very high charges and rent extraction.”

232,"July 5, 2021",DOJ Grows Antitrust Team For “US vs Google”,"


The Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice is seeking “highly qualified attorneys” that it wants to serve as trial attorneys as it takes on Google.
The Justice Department last October filed a long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging the big tech giant engaged in anti-competitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search advertising that form the cornerstones of its vast conglomerate.
In an online posting spotted on Sunday, July 4, the Justice Department is seeking trial attorneys to serve “in its Technology and Digital Platforms Section – United States V. Google Litigation Team based in Washington, DC.”
“The attorneys selected can expect to be given significant responsibility and have immediate involvement with matters of national importance,” the posting noted.
The long-anticipated case, filed in a Washington, DC, federal court, marked the most aggressive US legal challenge to a company’s dominance in the tech sector in more than two decades, with the potential to shake up Silicon Valley and beyond. Once a public darling, Google attracted considerable scrutiny over the past decade as it gained power but has avoided a true showdown with the government until now.

US tech giants Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, and Twitter have privately warned the Hong Kong government that they could stop offering their services in the city if authorities proceed with planned changes to data-protection laws, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, July 5, citing a letter.
The laws could make the tech companies liable for the malicious sharing of individuals’ information online, the newspaper added.
A letter sent by an industry group that includes the internet firms stated that the companies are concerned that the planned rules to address “doxing” could put their staff at risk of criminal investigations or prosecutions related to what the firms’ users post online, the Journal reported.
Hong Kong’s Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau in May proposed amendments to the city’s data-protection laws that it stated were needed to combat doxing, a practice that was prevalent during 2019 protests in the city, the newspaper reported.
According to the newspaper, the letter dated June 25 was sent by Singapore-based Asia Internet Coalition.
“The only way to avoid these sanctions for technology companies would be to refrain from investing and offering the services in Hong Kong,” the Journal reported, quoting the letter.

Australia’s competition watchdog announced on Thursday, July 1, it issued draft proposals to authorize regional newspaper industry group, Country Press Australia, to negotiate with Google and Facebook for payments for news content on their platforms.
Country Press Australia (CPA) is seeking authorization to allow its members to hammer out a payments deal with Google and Facebook for use of news content on the tech platforms, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) stated.
CPA represents 81 news publishers that publish about 160 regional newspapers across the country.
“Allowing the publishers of 160 newspapers to collectively negotiate with Google and Facebook should help address some of the considerable bargaining power imbalance that exists between the digital giants and these local news outlets,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.
The proposed authorization, which would expire after 10 years, follows an interim authorization granted by the ACCC to CPA in April to commence the negotiations.

Google has put on hold a preliminary deal with some French publishers to pay for news content as it awaits an antitrust decision that could set the tone for copyright talks on online news in Europe, two sources close to the matter said.
Under the three-year framework agreement signed by Google and the Alliance de la presse d’information generale (APIG), a lobby group representing most major French publishers, the US company agreed in January to pay a total of US$76 million to 121 publications, according to documents seen by Reuters.
It is one of the highest-profile deals under Google’s “News Showcase” program to provide compensation for news snippets used in search results, and the first of its kind in Europe.
However, no individual licensing agreement has been signed by Google with an APIG member since then and talks are de facto frozen pending the antitrust decision, the sources said.
Only a few publications, such as daily newspapers Le Monde, Le Figaro, and Liberation, had reached individual deals prior to the framework agreement.
“We’re still working with publishers, the APIG and the French competition authority on our agreements in order to finalise and sign more deals,” Google, a unit of Alphabet, said in a statement.

An attorney for the US Justice Department stated on Tuesday, June 29, that he wanted depositions planned for August in an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google to be live rather than on Zoom.
The government hopes to question, or depose, three people in August: one Google employee and two people who left Google, one in 2011 and 2013.
The government sued Google last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals. That lawsuit has been combined for discovery purposes with a broader antitrust lawsuit brought by 38 states and territories. read more
“We wanted to let the court know that it is our hope to do all or most of these depositions in person,” said the Justice Department’s Kenneth Dintzer, noting that the three first people that he wanted to depose were in California. “It is our understanding that California is re-open.”
Dintzer also said in the status conference, which was being held remotely, that he hoped to also return to regular court hearings.
Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia also discussed whether the Justice Department should be allowed to see performance reviews of executives that the government is considering calling as witnesses.
Mehta said that after reading a sample of the reviews that they were potentially useful but urged the government to request performance reviews only of people they wanted to depose. He further asked the two sides to agree on a protocol for safeguarding anything personal in them.

237,"June 28, 2021",Europe’s New Google Probe Zeroes In On YouTube,"
Europe recently announced its fourth big investigation into Google, and this time video-sharing site YouTube seems to be getting some special attention. According to CNBC, Europe’s new Google probe is focusing on Youtube Ads. 
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, announced last week that it had concerns that Google is favoring its own online display ad technology services, therefore potentially breaching antitrust rules in the EU.
As part of the probe, the Commission stated it will examine “in particular” what it described as the “obligation” to use Google services like the Google Ads platform to purchase online display ads on YouTube. Display ads are a form of paid advertising that can be found on websites, apps, and social media. These ads come in several different formats and sizes.
It also stated that it will assess the “obligation” to use Google Ad Manager, a platform that facilitates both the buying and selling of ads across multiple ad networks, to serve online display ads on YouTube, as well as potential restrictions placed by Google on rival services and how they serve online display ads.
“YouTube has a strong market position. It is possible that Google makes use of that to favor his services,” a source familiar with the investigation, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the probe, told CNBC. The same source added that the EU’s work is still “very preliminary.”
YouTube’s ads made up around US$6 billion of Alphabet’s first-quarter revenue in 2021. That was 11% of the firm’s total sales for that period.
Google stated in the wake of the new probe, “We will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission to answer their questions and demonstrate the benefits of our products to European businesses and consumers.”
The EU has been at the forefront of tech regulation and has fined Google in the past after concluding three different investigations — into Google’s shopping services, Android, and AdSense — for antitrust breaches. These three EU cases are currently still under appeal.

238,"June 25, 2021",Amazon & Google Investigated By UK Regulator Over Fake Reviews,"


Amazon and Google are to be investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns the tech companies have not done enough to tackle the widespread problem of fake reviews on their websites.
The Competition and Markets Authority, which began looking at the issue of fake reviews on major platforms two years ago, will now consider whether Amazon and Google have broken consumer law by not taking sufficient action to protect shoppers from fake reviews.
Sellers use fake and misleading reviews to improve their star ratings, which can in turn affect how prominently their company, and products, are displayed when consumers shop online.
“Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,” said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. “Equally, it’s simply not fair if some businesses can fake five-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence while law-abiding businesses lose out.”
The CMA said its work so far raised “specific concerns” that the two Silicon Valley companies were not doing enough to detect fake and misleading reviews or suspicious patterns of behavior and investigate those reviews, and were failing to impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses who break the rules on posts – even the serial offenders.
It was also concerned that Amazon’s systems have been failing to “adequately protect and deter” some sellers from manipulating product listings – for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products.
If the CMA’s investigation finds Amazon and Google have broken consumer law it could take enforcement action. This could include securing formal commitments from Amazon and Google to crack down on the problem, or pursuing court action if they fail to do so.

239,"June 24, 2021",Vestager Defends Google Fitbit Data Deal Approval,"


According to Bloomberg, Vestager responded to criticism that she’s been too lenient on big tech, pointing to Google’s pledge to separate data before taking over health tracker Fitbit last year as a success for the bloc’s deals regulator. 
Google’s offer to store Fitbit’s data separately from its services “is much more than a simple promise not to combine data,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a Thursday, June 24, speech. “It’s much closer to a structural remedy” — jargon for divesting a unit — “with technical solutions that reliably keep data separate.” 
Regulators often have limited choices to fixing antitrust problems with deals and need to consider businesses’ pledges to share data instead of blocking a takeover, Vestager said.
Consumer and privacy advocates have lobbied for the EU to block the tech deal as it could allow Google to expand into health services. Some other merger regulators were also critical of the EU’s approval of the deal and an apparent reluctance to demand divestments from digital firms.
EU approval of the deal last year came in a harsh climate as Google and others are facing mounting scrutiny of acquisitions that help them push into new business areas. Google announced its plans to buy Fitbit in November 2019, describing the bid for the smartwatch maker as a boost to its lagging hardware business.
Vestager warned that data issues will increasingly come up in merger reviews “and to fix that sort of issue, an important question is whether we can use a data silo remedy, that lets the companies merge, but keeps their data separate,” she said. Such a structure is “a kind of firewall that prevents companies from taking data from one side of a business and using it in another part.”
Regulators are also looking at Google’s dominant position in different parts of the advertising technology industry in a probe opened earlier this week, she said.

Google delayed its plan to scrap a widely used technology to track web-browsing habits amid regulatory scrutiny and concern from privacy advocates and the advertising industry over the search giant’s approach to replacing the tool.
On Thursday, June 24, the Alphabet unit stated its Chrome internet browser will stop supporting a user-tracking technology called third-party cookies by late 2023, nearly two years later than its initial time frame of early 2022. Google had announced the removal of cookies, which many companies in the advertising sector use to track individuals’ and target ads, under pressure from privacy regulators and advocates.
Google stated the delay will give it more time to get publishers, the ad industry, and regulators comfortable with the new technologies it is developing and testing to enable targeted ads in cookies’ wake.
“While there’s considerable progress with this initiative, it’s become clear that more time is needed across the ecosystem to get this right,” Google stated.
The company’s plan to remove cookies is facing an array of regulatory scrutiny and complaints from privacy advocates who said it wasn’t going far enough to protect users’ data. Competitors said the search giant was using privacy concerns as a pretext to box them out of online advertising.

241,"June 23, 2021","Senate Judiciary Committee Presses Google, Amazon For Smart Home Info","


The chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights called on Amazon and Google’s Alphabet to extend more information about how smart home devices and virtual assistants will meet user privacy and competition requirements.
A subcommittee hearing last week, Protecting Innovation and Consumer Choice in Home Technologies, raised issues about dominance and competition in the smart home sector.
US Senator Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) sent a letter to Alphabet and Amazon asking both to respond by July 2 regarding how data is collected and used. The letter was sent to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
“I am deeply concerned about competition and the future of innovation related to connected home devices … The hearing testimony raised profound concerns about the ways your companies may use that power to suppress competition in the emerging connected home technology industry, as well as your access to and use of highly sensitive personal information,” Klobuchar wrote in the letter, which was dated Tuesday, June 22.
“More than 94 million Americans already have connected speakers. And we are just at the beginning; these connected home technologies will continue to develop and expand beyond lighting and thermostats to appliances like connected refrigerators and washing machines. In the years to come, they will play an even larger role in our everyday lives,” Klobuchar wrote.
The subcommittee chair also asked specifically about supported devices regarding Matter, a new smart home interoperability standard jointly developed by tech industry leaders like Apple, Google, Amazon, and others.
Connected smart home devices took off during the pandemic as people hunkered down at home. A survey conducted by Security.org in October 2020 showed that 91% of respondents already had at least one smart home device. Some 64% indicated they were planning to acquire that technology in 2021.

Amazon and Google both released statements on Tuesday, June 22, opposing the new antitrust bills that have been introduced. Apple and Facebook, which were also targets of the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation into digital markets, have yet to put out their own statements. 
However, industry groups backed by the tech firms have also pushed back on the legislation, arguing it would prevent the companies from operating popular consumer services and ultimately hurt small businesses and entrepreneurs.
The six bills set to be considered at Wednesday’s markup, where lawmakers will discuss the proposals and any amendments before deciding whether they should advance, would have a profound impact on the tech industry and possibly beyond it. 
Amazon and Google both called for the Judiciary Committee to pump the breaks on the legislation, which is headed to a full committee markup in an unusually short period of time — less than two weeks since most were introduced.
Google VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy Mark Isakowitz said in a statement the company isn’t opposed to new regulation, but warned the bills on the table would “break” popular consumer services.
“As many groups and companies have observed, the bills would require us to degrade our services and prevent us from offering important features used by hundreds of millions of Americans,” he said. “This would all dramatically undermine US technology leadership, damage the way small businesses connect with consumers, and raise serious privacy and security concerns. We respectfully recommend that these consequences receive more thoughtful consideration before Congress takes action.”
Amazon VP of Public Policy Brian Huseman also warned of “significant negative effects” on Amazon consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses that sell on the platform. Amazon is still reviewing the bills, he added.
“More than a half million American small- and medium-sized businesses make a living via Amazon’s marketplace, and without access to Amazon’s customers, it will be much harder for these third-party sellers to create awareness for their business and earn a comparable income,” he said in a statement. “Removing the selection of these sellers from Amazon’s store would also create less price competition for products, and likely end up increasing prices for consumers. The Committee is moving unnecessarily fast in pushing these bills forward. We encourage Chairman Cicilline and committee members to slow down, postpone the markup, and thoroughly vet the language in the bills for unintended negative consequences.”

On Tuesday, June 22, India’s antitrust regulator ordered an investigation into allegations that Google abused its Android operating system’s position in the country’s smart television market, reported Reuters.
Last year the Competition Commission of India (CCI) began looking into a case filed by two lawyers against the US tech giant, stating that its initial review found Google had breached certain anti-competitive laws.
The CCI said that based on information available, including submissions made by Google, it was “convinced that a case is made out for directing an investigation” by the CCI director general.
Google has denied wrongdoing. In a statement on Tuesday, it said the emerging smart TV sector in India was thriving in part due to Google’s free licensing model and stated that Android TV competed with several well-established TV operating systems.
“We are confident that our smart TV licensing practices are in compliance with all applicable competition laws,” a company spokesperson said.
Smart TVs, or WiFi-enabled TVs with apps for streaming services, are increasingly popular. Data from Counterpoint Research shows 8 million smart TV sets were sold in India in 2019, with three in five based on Google’s Android system.
Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand, two Indian lawyers who filed the case, told Reuters they welcomed the probe, saying Google had restricted the development of many virtual goods and services.
The case will be Google’s third ongoing antitrust investigation in India, where it faces a probe into its payments app and Android mobile operating system.

The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Google’s vast advertising business, claiming that the company may have disadvantaged rival services, making it harder for brands to reach consumers and for publishers to fund their content, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
The European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust enforcer, stated on Tuesday, June 22, that its investigation, which has been under way informally since at least 2019, will look at a broad array of allegedly anticompetitive business practices around the Alphabet unit’s brokering of advertisements and sharing of user data with advertisers across websites and mobile apps—one of the newest areas of antitrust scrutiny for the company. 
Some of the EU’s investigation will cover similar ground to a case filed last year against Google by a group of US states led by Texas. Similar areas include Google’s allegedly favoring its own ad-buying tools in the advertising auctions it runs.
But the EU probe will also cover complaints that haven’t yet been the subject of formal inquiries anywhere, including Google’s alleged exclusion of competitors from brokering ad buys on Google-owned video site YouTube.
The EU investigation is also examining Google’s plans to block certain kinds of user-tracking technologies on its platforms, such as the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system. Curtailing such tracking responds, at least in part, to pressure from privacy regulators and activists, but has led to antitrust complaints from competitors in the advertising-technology industry.
“Online advertising services are at the heart of how Google and publishers monetize their online services,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief. “We are concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete in the so-called ad tech stack.”

Google is battling anti-monopoly regulators on both sides of the Atlantic and the European Union is reportedly about to turn up the heat. 
Antitrust regulators in the bloc are set to launch an investigation into Google’s lucrative ad business by the end of the year, Reuters reported, building on three other antitrust probes that have resulted in $9.8 billion in fines so far.
Google dominates the digital advertising market worldwide, taking in 27.5 percent of all global ad spending. Its share of the US ad market last year was 28.9 percent, according to the firm.
The search giant’s share of online advertising, however, is much greater. In 2019, the European Union estimated that Google’s market share of online display ads was more than 85 percent between 2006 and 2016.
Advertising brought Google $147 billion in revenue last year — about 80 percent of the company’s total income. Ads on Google’s own properties including search, YouTube and Gmail made up the bulk of Google’s ad sales and profits last year. About 16 percent of revenue came from its display or network business, through which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.
The EU’s antitrust watchdog asked Google rivals and third parties earlier this year if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries, which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources, according to a questionnaire seen by Reuters.

246,"June 16, 2021","New Antitrust Bills Zero In Amazon, Apple, Facebook & Google","


Last week US lawmakers fired a shot across Big Tech’s bow, introducing five new bills designed to curb what lawmakers have described as “unregulated power” held by the firms of Silicon Valley. If enacted, the legislation would mark the biggest changes to US antitrust law in decades.
And while the legislation will affect all firms, their congressional architects have been open in naming the specific targets of the legislation.
“Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google have prioritized power over innovation and harmed American businesses and consumers in the process,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-Col.), the ranking member on the House antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement. “These companies have maintained monopoly power in the online marketplace by using a variety of anticompetitive behaviors to stifle competition.”
The new pieces of legislation would prohibit a dominant platform from discriminating against rivals by offering its own products preference (American Innovation and Choice Online Act); stop firms from using acquisitions as a means of neutralizing potential threats (Platform Competition and Opportunity Act); ban dominant platform from using their power across multiple types of business to give themselves unfair advantages (Ending Platform Monopolies Act); make it easier for consumers to move their data when they want to switch to a new provider (Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act); and change filing fees for the first time in two decades, providing the government funds to pursue antitrust actions.
Those bills are a long way and a lot of subcommittee hearings between now and becoming law — though regulation of Big Tech is one of the few areas where bipartisan action is still possible, as both Republicans and Democrats have qualms about the power Big Tech wields, and a determined interest in reining it in. And while the players most directly targeted by the new bills have not as yet offered any public comment, they will get their chance this week as they have been invited to appear before the House to testify.

Britain’s competition regulator is investigating Apple and Google over allegations the two companies have a harmful duopoly in mobile platforms.
Between them, Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android are installed on 99.45% of all mobile phones in use in the UK. The two companies also have effective duopolies in app stores (Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store) and mobile web browsers (Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome), according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The UK competition watchdog has announced a year-long study, already under way, into whether the control exerted by the two companies is stifling competition.
Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said, “Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles – whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV. We’re looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.
“Our ongoing work into big tech has already uncovered some worrying trends and we know consumers and businesses could be harmed if they go unchecked.”
The CMA is looking at whether the duopoly is leading to price increases, for instance for devices and apps, or for broader goods and services, due to higher advertising prices. The regulator will also examine “any effects of the firms’ market power over other businesses – such as app developers – which rely on Apple or Google to market their products to customers via their phones.”

According to The Verge, the UK’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will collaborate with Google as it attempts to rework online ad targeting, the regulator and Google have announced. It comes as Google is attempting to phase out the use of third-party cookies for tracking and targeting users with ads and instead use a new set of technologies it’s calling Privacy Sandbox.
In its announcement Google says it will work with UK regulators. Google stated this is the first time regulators and technology companies have worked together on new technologies like this. As well as the CMA, the UK’s data protection regulator (the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO) will also be involved. 
“The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms to shape their behavior and protect competition to the benefit of consumers,” the CMA’s chief executive Andrea Coscelli, said in a statement.
The collaboration comes in response to the CMA’s announcement in January that it would be formally investigating Google’s proposals, which involve using AI to bundle users together into anonymized groups to target them with ads (you can read more about the proposals here). Google says it will work with UK regulators. Google’s new approach is intended as a more privacy-orientated alternative to tracking cookies, which the company intends to phase out of its Chrome browser over the next year.
However, concerns have been raised that Google’s Privacy Sandbox could harm competition, and concentrate yet more power in the hands of the search giant. 
Google has made a series of commitments to the UK regulator about how it will develop and implement the changes. It says it will develop the plans transparently, in a way that doesn’t give itself an unfair advantage, or discriminate against its rivals. It’s also making a commitment to not combine user data from Chrome browsing histories or Google Analytics with its ad products.

The Japanese government is said to be preparing another antitrust probe into both tech giants Apple and Google, the media reported. Apple has been the subject of multiple antitrust probes alongside other tech giants, including Google.
It seems that Japan will be adding its own investigation to the pile soon, one that will affect both the iPhone maker and the search giant.
A government panel will apparently launch this month to look into tightening antitrust regulations, according to sources of Nikkei in a report seen by the Mercury News.
The panel will discuss the dealings of Apple and Google with Japanese smartphone producers, including whether they handle domestic companies fairly compared to overseas vendors.
It is believed that iOS and Android make up more than 90 per cent of the Japanese smartphone market, according to the report.
An analysis by IDC in February pointed to Apple selling nearly half of all mobile phones in the country for the entirety of 2020.
The alleged Japanese probe will become the latest in a long line of similar activity by governments and regulators around the world, seeking to curtail the power of tech giants like Apple.

Britain’s competition regulator will have a say in Google’s plan to remove third-party browser cookies that track people online.
The Competition and Markets Authority said Friday it has secured commitments from Google to address concerns about the proposal. The CMA is worried that the plans will harm newspapers and other businesses that rely on personalized ads.
Web cookies are small pieces of code that websites deliver to a visitor’s browser. They can be used to track online activity, such as items added to a shopping basket. Third-party cookies are often added by advertisers to serve people with personalized ads.
Google plans to scrap third-party cookies on its Chrome browser and replace them with an alternative. The company launched an initiative called “Privacy Sandbox” last year in a bid to address privacy concerns about cookies. One of the proposals Google is confident about is called “Federated Learning of Cohorts.” The CMA launched a formal probe into the changes in January.
Google is committed to involve the CMA and the Information Commissioner’s Office, the U.K.’s privacy watchdog, in the development of its Privacy Sandbox proposals. The company promised to publicly disclose results of any tests of the effectiveness of alternatives and said it wouldn’t give preferential treatment to Google’s advertising products or sites.

Alphabet unit Google has bowed to pressure from rivals and will let them compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe, widening a pledge to EU antitrust regulators two years ago, reported Reuters. 
The move by the world’s most popular internet search engine comes as the 27-country bloc considers rules that could be introduced next year to force Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook to ensure a level playing field for competitors.
Google’s Android mobile operating system runs on about four-fifths of the world’s smartphones. The US tech giant stated in 2019 that rivals would have to pay via an auction for appearing on a choice screen from which users select their preferred search engine.
Google’s change of heart follows a 4.24-billion-euro ($5.16 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission, the EU antitrust authority, in 2018 for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine.
“We are now making some final changes to the Choice Screen including making participation free for eligible search providers. We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen,” Oliver Bethell, director at Google, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
The changes will come into effect in September, the blog added.

253,"June 7, 2021",France Fines Google $267M For Abusing Dominant Position In Ads  ,"
On Monday, June 7, France’s competition regulator fined Google €220 million (US$268 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry, reported Bloomberg.
The French Competition Authority stated that Google had unfairly sent business to its own services and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog stated.
The investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator stated.
Isabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.”
She added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell, and optimize ad space on their websites and mobile apps.
“These very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,” said de Silva.
“This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.”

254,"June 6, 2021",Germany Widens Google News Showcase Antitrust Investigation,"


On Friday, June 4, Germany’s competition regulator announced that it was expanding an antitrust investigation into Google and its parent company Alphabet to include Google News Showcase, a new service the US tech giant provides to media publishers.
The Federal Cartel Office will examine whether the Google service, which was launched in Germany last autumn and allows publishers to place journalistic content more prominently online, is compatible with German competition law.
It is the latest in a string of probes that the watchdog has opened this year under a new law allowing it to further scrutinize US tech giants such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
While cooperation with Google could be “an attractive option” for publishers and other news providers, it should not “result in discrimination between individual publishers,” said the regulator’s president Andreas Mundt in a statement.
“Google’s strong position in providing access to end-customers must not lead to a situation where competing services offered by publishers or other news providers are squeezed out of the market.”
Launched in response to a complaint by German-based company Corint Media, the probe will notably assess whether Google has given itself an unfair advantage over rival services by integrating News Showcase into its general search function.

256,"June 1, 2021",Google & Facebook To Pay For Media Content Under New Australian Law,"


Australia’s competition regulator has declared victory in a three-year battle to make Facebook and Google pay for news after the internet groups signed deals with publishers that could be worth about AU$200 million (US$155.33 million) a year, reported 
Rod Sims, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told the Financial Times on Tuesday, June 1, that the country’s world-first news media bargaining code had forced big technology platforms to the negotiating table to agree deals with publishers. 
“We are on track for deals all around. It’s been a big success,” Sims said in an interview. “We are just about there and the media companies are happy — and that’s the key point.” Sims made the comments after confirmation from Nine Entertainment that it had signed a multiyear content deal with Google and Facebook. 
The company, owner of the 190-year-old Sydney Morning Herald, did not release commercial terms of the agreement but forecast that its publishing unit’s earnings would jump AU$30 – $40 million (US$23 – $31 million) in the 2022 financial year. Australia’s other big media groups, including News Corp, Seven West Media, and state broadcaster ABC, have either completed content deals with Facebook and Google or signed letters of intent to do so. 
Dozens of smaller publishers have also struck agreements or are negotiating terms following passage of a law in February designed to make Big Tech pay for news.

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is reportedly expected to pay a fine and change some business practices to settle an antitrust case with the French government over its online advertising business.
France’s Competition Authority has alleged that Google’s advertising tool DoubleClick, which online publishers use to sell ad space, gave an advantage to Google’s own online ad auction system over other companies, the Wall Street Journal reported.
To settle the charges, Google has reportedly offered to remove obstacles faced by competitors within its ad exchange. The changes would only be legally binding in France but could be adopted companywide to appease critics in other countries, according to the paper, which cited people familiar with the matter. 
The alleged settlement talks come as regulators around the world have ramped up scrutiny of Google’s ad business, which brought the company about US$23.7 billion in revenue last year. 
Ten US states sued Google in December, accusing the company of offering Facebook special treatment in exchange for the social media site reducing competition in the advertising space, the Journal reported. Antitrust authorities in Britain and the European Union are also investigating various aspects of the company’s ad practices.

Alphabet’s Google is nearing a settlement of an antitrust case in France over allegations it abused its power in online advertising, and will likely pay a fine and institute operational changes, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, May 27, citing people familiar with the matter.
The French case, which hasn’t been previously disclosed, is one of the most advanced in the world looking at Google’s dominance as a provider of tools for buying and selling ads across the web.
As part of the case, France’s Competition Authority alleged that the company’s advertising server—historically known as DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) and used by most large online publishers to sell ad space—gave Google’s online ad auction house, AdX, an advantage against other auction operators, the people said.
The authority also alleged other forms of self-preferencing between Google’s advertising technology tools, they added.
To settle the French charges, Google has offered to improve the interoperability of AdX with advertising servers run by other companies, and to remove some other obstacles faced by competitors, some of the people said.
The settlement still must be approved by the authority’s board, which could reject the deal, the people said. If approved, the settlement could be announced in coming weeks, they said.

Germany’s antitrust watchdog has launched a probe into whether Google Germany, Google Ireland, and its parent company Alphabet are exploiting their market dominance in the way they handle data, reported Reuters.
The Federal Cartel Office stated the investigation would consider whether the tech giant offers users enough choice in how it uses their data across the wide range of digital services it provides.
Google stated people use its services because they are helpful, not because they are forced to do so or because they cannot find any alternatives.
“We give people easy control over how their information is used and we limit the use of personal information,” spokesman Ralf Bremer said, adding Google would assist the cartel office with its inquiries.
The Bonn-based watchdog has made use of enhanced powers it was accorded under recent reforms to Germany’s competition laws to open new probes into Facebook and Amazon over their data practices.
In Google’s case, it will examine whether its range of digital services, spanning search, YouTube, Maps, its Android smartphone operating system, and Chrome browser, mean the company has a dominant position across markets.
“Google’s business model is fundamentally based on processing the data of its users,” cartel office chief Andreas Mundt said in a statement.
“We will look very closely into the terms on which user data is processed. A central question is whether consumers have sufficient choice regarding the use of their data by Google, if they want to use Google services.”

Google has filed its first-ever lawsuit against Russia’s internet regulator over Russian demands to remove content from YouTube.

Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor on Monday, May 24, gave Google 24 hours to remove prohibited content or face sanctions for “insufficient filtering.”
The US giant faces penalties that include fines and a possible punitive slowdown of its online traffic in the country. Moscow has already placed a punitive slowdown on US social network Twitter for not deleting banned content.
The move comes as Russia seeks to rein in Western tech giants and strengthen what it has termed internet “sovereignty.”

Google and Samsung plan to team up to release a new smartwatch operating system (OS), Yahoo Finance reported.
The OS will be called WearOS and will combine Google’s OS with that of Samsung’s Tizen OS, the report stated.
It will improve battery life and performance, and it will come with an updated look and new capabilities, according to the report. The new features will include Google Pay and turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps along with on-device Google Music functionality.
The addition of Samsung could help boost the wearables Google has already released, aiding with attractive designs and unique interfaces, including a turntable watch face that would let users control various features, the report stated.
The combining of the two companies’ assets could also help to build a real competitor for Apple’s Apple Watch, as Google’s other smartwatch efforts have not done well through the years, according to the report.
Google also stated per the report that it will be bringing health tracking and on-wrist celebrations from Fitbit to WearOS. Google completed the purchase of Fitbit for US$2.1 billion earlier this year. The buy helped the tech giant become more competitive in the field of fitness wearables.
Apple has not been a slough in the wearables space, with its debut of the Fitness+ workout program in December, the report stated. Apple has been known as a leader in the field of smart watches, with a 40% share in the global smartwatch market.
Google was approved in late 2020 to acquire Fitbit after regulators spent time assessing how to keep US big tech companies from having too much influence.
Google argued its case through pledging to keep access for rival health and fitness apps available, which seemed to cause regulators to be less worried about the possibilities for a monopoly-esque situation. According to Margrethe Vestager, EU antitrust chief, the commitments will come down to how Google uses data for ad purposes, how the safeguard works for rival companies and how users will be able to share health and fitness data.

The South Korean government has started looking into an allegation that Google restricted applications downloaded from other app stores from accessing Android Auto, reported The Korean Herald. 
According to the industry and government sources Sunday, the Korea Communications Commission has recently opened a probe to see if Google has violated the Telecommunications Business Act here.
“The commission would see if Google has unfairly limited end users’ access to third-party apps downloaded via other app store platforms,” an official from the Korea Communications Commission said. The official added that the commission could expand the investigation, depending on the findings of its probe.
Google’s Android Auto, which is installed in many of the popular cars from Hyundai Motor, Kia and Renault Samsung, does not allow applications downloaded via app store platforms other than its own Google Play, including SK Telecom’s One Store and Samsung’s Galaxy Store.
The country’s top mobile navigation system T map, for example, is currently downloadable both on Google Play and One Store. But, the application does not function on Android Auto when the application has been downloaded via One Store. The same issue occurs for other applications developed for in-car use.

The ruling by District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California, marks one of the first major decisions in a spate of antitrust cases filed against Google over the last two years by users and rivals as well as the US Department of Justice and state attorneys general.

“The Court is particularly concerned that Plaintiffs’ market excludes social media display advertising and direct negotiations,” she wrote.
The plaintiffs also need to better explain why Google’s refusal to support rival systems that the advertisers rely upon is anticompetitive, because antitrust law does not require monopolists to help competitors survive, Labson Freeman said.
“The Court has serious concerns that some of Plaintiffs’ allegations rely on a ‘duty to deal’ theory of antitrust,” she wrote.
Plaintiffs have until June 14 to amend their lawsuit, according to the decision. Attorneys for Google and the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Italian antitrust authority announced on Thursday, May 13, that had it imposed a fine of €102 million (US$123 million) on Google for abuse of a dominant position through its Android mobile operating system and app store Google Play.
“Google has a dominant position which allows it to control the reach app developers have on final users,” the regulator said in a statement.
The ruling condemns the company for not allowing drivers of electric cars who need to recharge their vehicles to use JuicePass, an electric-vehicle services app from Italy’s Enel X, to operate on Android Auto, which favors Google Maps.
The Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato warned that Google’s “contested conduct can influence the development of e-mobility in a crucial phase… with possible negative spillover effects on the spreading of electric vehicles.”
As part of the ruling, Google will have to authorize Juice Pass on Android. A company spokesperson told the Ansa news service that the company didn’t agree with the decision and will examine it in detail before deciding on the next steps.

The ACCC has granted interim authorization for Country Press Australia (CPA) members to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google over payments to publishers for their news content that appears on the platforms, reported the regulator. 
CPA is an industry body that represents the interests of independent regional and local newspapers throughout Australia. CPA currently represents 81 members and 160 regional newspapers, which provide local news to regional communities in print and online.
Authorisation will enable CPA members to collectively negotiate with each of Facebook and Google, engage in discussions with each other and exchange information about those negotiations. Without authorisation, these collective bargaining arrangements would risk breaching competition laws as no platforms have yet been ‘designated’ under the news bargaining code, which would automatically allow collective bargaining for news media businesses.
“The ACCC considers that allowing CPA members to bargain collectively is likely to result in public benefits by enhancing negotiations between regional publishers and digital platforms, and thereby assisting the sustainability of regional news production,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“These public benefits align with the purpose of the news media bargaining code, which was intended to allow and encourage collective bargaining.”
“We welcome the fact that both Facebook and Google appear to be successfully reaching voluntary deals with Australian news businesses, including a number of smaller publishers, following the passage of the bargaining code. The onus now remains on Facebook and Google to continue to negotiate in good faith with news businesses of all sizes,” Mr Sims said.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) and Mike Lee (Repubilcan – Utah) are demanding more details about an alleged phone call between a Google employee and a Match Group employee on the eve of a key hearing before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. At the hearing, Match and other Google critics accused the tech giant of wielding monopoly power and limiting competition.
During that hearing, Match chief legal officer Jared Sine alleged that Google called Match after its written testimony for Congress became public. Google asked why Match’s comments about Google’s app store rules didn’t match up with statements Match made about Google in previous earnings calls.
The senators wrote in a letter on Tuesday, April 27, to Wilson White, a top Google executive who testified last week, they were “deeply troubled” by Match’s claims Google tried to influence its testimony, and they feel they have an obligation to get to the bottom of what happened on the phone call.
“Any efforts to retaliate against those who speak up about public policy issues or possible legal violations are unacceptable, especially by dominant companies that have the power to destroy the business of a whistle-blower,” the senators wrote in their letter.
“Witness intimidation in any form will not be tolerated,” they added.

The European Commission verified in writing on Friday, April 23, that Google’s use of data to fuel its ad tech business is a focus of its ongoing antitrust investigation.
As Brussels-based journalist Alexander Fanta highlighted on Twitter, this could mean by extension that Google’s FLoC proposal is also part of the Commission’s probe. If so, the same might be true for the other proposals in the Chrome Privacy Sandbox.
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority already launched its own inquiry into Google’s plan to phase out third-party cookies after receiving complaints about how Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals could impact competition. That investigation is also ongoing.
The European Commission’s statements came in response to questions raised in January by Carmen Avram, a Romanian member of Parliament, after Politico reported on the existence of two new antitrust investigations into Google’s business practices.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, answered on behalf of the Commission. “The Commission is currently investigating the way data concerning users is gathered, processed and monetised by Google. The investigation, under the competition rules, covers the use of data and practices in the provision of ‘ad tech’ services, in which Google acts as intermediary between advertisers and online publishers. Google’s proposals to deprecate third-party cookies are within the scope. The preliminary investigation is ongoing and it is too early to report any findings.”

Apple and Google faced a battery of accusations on Wednesday, April 21, from prominent app developers, including Spotify and Tile, who alleged that the large tech platforms have abused their dominance and harmed competition, reported CNBC.
“We’re all afraid,” Match Group Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnessota) the chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, at a hearing.
In a lengthy Senate hearing, the app makers said Apple and Google’s rules surrounding in-app payments and app updates allow the tech giants to choke off rival services, and that they engage in retaliation when app developers refuse to comply.
The occasionally tense showdown highlighted how antitrust scrutiny of Apple is ramping up after more than a year of similar focus on its peers such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. And lawmakers were clear that the hearing would serve as a springboard for legislation to rein in large tech platforms.
Much of the hearing zeroed in on Apple’s treatment of app makers, largely because of Apple’s closed ecosystem that prohibits the installation of iOS apps from anywhere but the Apple app store.
This week, Apple introduced a new product known as the AirTag, a small device that can be used to locate missing items. Tile, which makes a competing product, accused Apple of giving AirTag an unfair home-court advantage by not allowing Tile devices to use the same advanced, ultra-wideband frequencies to communicate with iPhones that AirTag uses.

Amy Klobuchar, the top Senate Democrat on antitrust issues, said Apple and Google can use their power to “exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products” and “charge excessive fees that affect competition.”
App makers like music streaming service Spotify and dating services giant Match, which owns the Tinder app, have long complained that mandatory revenue sharing for sales of digital goods and strict inclusion rules set by Apple’s App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google’s Play store for Android devices, amount to anticompetitive behavior.
Representatives for Apple and Google told senators that the companies’ tight control over their stores and the associated revenue-sharing requirements are needed to enforce and pay for security measures to protect consumers from harmful apps and practices.
But when asked by Senator Josh Hawley, Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer would not commit to spending all of the mandatory fees on security.
Explanations from Andeer and Google’s Wilson White, senior director for government affairs, about why the companies’ fees do not apply to Uber and apps that sell physical goods also failed to satisfy senators.
“I feel like unfrozen caveman lawyer,” Senator Mike Lee said. “I’m not grasping it.”

Google unlawfully exercised monopoly power over the digital advertising market and illegally conspired with Facebook to engage in anti-competitive conduct, according to the filing.
The two dozen newspapers include the Tomahawk Leader, Antigo Times, and the Kewaskum Statesman.
The lawsuit is one of about a dozen similar complaints filed by newspaper publishers across the country, Michael Fuller Jr., an attorney leading the Wisconsin publications’ lawsuit, told the Journal Sentinel. He said he expects the lawsuits will be consolidated before a single federal judge and could attract larger newspaper chains as additional plaintiffs.
The lawsuits come as newspapers across the country have lost ad revenue as advertising has shifted online to search and social media. According to the Wisconsin filing, nearly 1,800 US newspapers have closed or merged since 2014, leaving about 200 counties without a newspaper.

Google will send a top policy executive to testify at Wednesday, April 21’s Senate app store antitrust hearing, while legal executives from Spotify, Tile, and Match will serve as witnesses, according to Bloomberg.
Google Senior Director of Government Affairs and Public Policy Wilson White will be the search giant’s representative, joining Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer in the spotlight. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights, which is holding the hearing, also plans to call Horacio Gutierrez, Kirsten Daru, and Jared Sine, top legal executives from Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, respectively.
Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, will also be called. Spotify, Tile, and Match have all been embroiled in antitrust fights with Apple recently, with Spotify and Match filing complaints about Apple’s App Store rules and fees. Tile believes Apple’s Find My app will give the company’s rumored AirTags accessory for finding physical objects a leg up over third-party rivals.
The Senate subcommittee is investigating Apple and Google over competition issues and concerns from app developers. Apple’s Andeer previously testified on several matters for Apple before the House of Representatives and other US lawmakers.
White, a top deputy of Google legal chief Kent Walker, joined the company in 2011 after working as a software developer and patent lawyer. Since 2013, he has worked as a policy director on Google’s ads and apps divisions, units that were critical to Google’s business success with mobile phones. They’re also units that have been at the center of some of Google’s political troubles.

The parent company of the Daily Mail is suing Google over allegations that the Silicon Valley giant has illegally maintained a monopoly in the digital ad space that has hurt the newspaper’s ad-supported business model, according to a complaint filed Tuesday, April 20, in Manhattan federal court. 
The newspaper hits Google over its market power in the digital ad space, as well as accusing the search giant of using its power to “punish publishers that do not submit to its practices.” 
“Google controls the ‘shelf space’ on publishers’ pages where ads appear, and it exploits that control to defeat competition for that ad space. Among other tactics, Google makes it difficult for publishers to compare prices among exchanges; reduces the number of exchanges that can submit bids; and uses bids offered by rival exchanges to set its own bids — a de facto bid rigging scheme,” the complaint states. 
A spokesperson for the publisher told The Wall Street Journal that the paper’s concerns with Google stem in part from its assessment that coverage of the royal family in 2021 has been downplayed in Google’s search results. 
The spokesperson told the Journal that Daily Mail executives have been disappointed that the newspaper’s digital coverage of the royal family has not shown up prominently in search results for keywords, including “Meghan and Harry,” “Piers Morgan,” and “Prince Philip.” 
Moreover, the complaint accuses Google’s plans not to replace its tracking features once it phases out third-party cookies as a way for the company to further “monopolize the exchange market.”

Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) announced on Monday, April 19, that it had initiated proceedings against US tech giant Alphabet’s Google for allegedly abusing its dominant market position in video hosting services.
Google has already come under pressure from the authorities this year for failing to delete what Russia calls banned content. Other western internet companies have also been targeted by Moscow, including Twitter, which has been punitively slowed down.
The FAS stated the case concerned Google’s YouTube unit and that the company’s actions had resulted in the sudden blocking and deletion of some users’ accounts, which it stated could lead to restricted competition.
The state agency last week initiated proceedings against Yandex, sometimes referred to as “Russia’s Google,” over competition law violations on the company’s search engine, allegations that Yandex has denied.

Australia’s federal court found Alphabet’s Google misled some consumers about personal location data collected through Android mobile devices, the country’s competition regulator said on Friday.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it is seeking declarations and penalties from Google, reported Reuters. 
“This is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the Court’s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement.
The case revolves around specific Google settings related to its location data collection, location history and ‘web & app activity’.
The court found that Google wrongly claimed it could only collect information from the location history setting on user devices between January 2017 and December 2018.

The competition watchdog also stated that Google must ensure within six months that competitors are not disadvantaged and it must report to the board every year for five years about the issue.
In November 2020, the Competition Authority fined Google with 196.7 million lira for breaching Turkey’s competition law. At the time, the search engine was fined for placing ads at the top of the search results, thus affecting organic search results.

The new digital regulator must have tough legal powers to force tech giants like Google and Facebook to pay news organizations fairly for content, the UK’s competition watchdog stated on Tuesday, April 13.
Daniel Gordon, from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), told peers that a planned code of conduct for online platforms was “necessary” to protect the interests of newspapers, websites and advertisers due to Google and Facebook’s online dominance. 
Facing the Lords’ Communications and Digital Committee in the afternoon, he said that the UK needed a beefed-up version of a code introduced in Australia earlier this year, and could also look at examples from other countries including Germany.
A code of conduct introduced Down Under sparked a furious row as Facebook cut access to websites including MailOnline rather than pay fairly for content. 
It prompted accusations of bullying before the Australian government backed down and softened the law. 
The UK’s new regulator, the Digital Markets Unit, is expected to get legal power to suspend, block, or reverse anti-competitive action by tech giants in a bid to create a level playing field for news publishers and other digital businesses.

284,"April 11, 2021","Google’s “Project Bernanke,” Which Used Outsider Data To Boots Own Ads, Revealed In TX Antitrust Case","


Google reportedly ran a secretive project – codenamed “Project Bernanke” – using bidding data collected from outside advertisers using its exchange to benefit the search giant’s own ad system. 
The codename leaked in an erroneously unredacted document filed by Google in response to an antitrust lawsuit brought by Texas. It was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday evening, April 10.
The Journal, which reviewed the unredacted filing, reported that outside advertisers weren’t told about the “Bernanke” system, which brought in millions for Google each year. The project was in place for years, the Journal reported.
The antitrust lawsuit brought by Texas in December alleged that Google used anticompetitive practices.
“Google repeatedly used its monopolistic powers to control pricing” and “engage in market collusions to rig auctions,” Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a Facebook post in December. 
Texas alleged that the “Bernanke” project was instrumental in those efforts, according to the Journal’s reporting. 
In the unredacted filing, Google reportedly wrote that information that came from the project was “comparable to data maintained by other buying tools.” 
In Google’s publicly available response on April 6, the company stated the plaintiffs in Texas had a “deep misunderstanding” of the digital advertising market. The state’s case said “remarkably little about how this lawsuit would help consumers,” Google’s lawyers wrote.
“The government intervention sought by Plaintiffs would do significant harm to the many businesses, large and small, who choose to use Google’s effective advertising services, with a ripple effect of unintended consequences,” Google’s lawyers wrote.
It was unclear why the name “Bernanke” was used for the advertising project. As chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke led US monetary policy between 2006 and 2014.

285,"April 5, 2021",Google Prevails Over Oracle In  Supreme Court Case,"
The Supreme Court ruled Monday, April 5, in favor of Google in a long-running copyright dispute against Oracle that has huge implications for Silicon Valley, with the court finding that Google did not violate the law when it used more than 11,000 lines of Oracle’s software code in developing its Android mobile operating system.
According to Politico, the US tech industry has been deeply invested in the outcome of the case because it will shape the country’s rules around building software, the process upon which the multi-trillion-dollar sector rests. It also gives Google a key win at a time when scrutiny of the search giant has hit a fever pitch in Washington, including a Justice Department antitrust suit against Google and and questions over whether Obama-era federal regulators erred by not taking action against the search giant in an earlier antitrust investigation.
Monday’s 6-2 decision is a key ruling on how US copyright applies to API, software code that enables programs to work with each other. In the case, which dates back to 2010, Google had stood accused of pilfering chunks of API code developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle.
“We assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable,” the decision stated. “But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law.”
Google had argued that this type of code is often used freely by developers to increase interoperability between different products, and that even if such code is copyrightable — as Oracle had argued — it should be covered by the law’s “fair use” provisions, which allow the unlicensed use of otherwise copyrighted material under some circumstances.
Oracle had argued that the code was copyrightable, that it should have been paid for Google’s use of it and that while some standard code is exempt from the protections, the Java code was anything but standard.
Each side in the case claimed that it was, here, the true champion of innovation. Google argued that applying stringent copyright protections to APIs would chill developers who would otherwise build using shared code. That, the company stated, would bad for developers, slowing the process of creating new products, and bad for consumers, minimizing the utility of products they already own. Oracle had argued that a Google victory would discourage programmers from investing deeply in software developing, knowing that the resulting code could be used by others without compensation.
The Supreme Court said Google’s use of the Java API “included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program.” Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the majority opinion in favor of Google, was joined by Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.

Lawyers for Alphabet’s Google and the government tangled on Tuesday, March 30, over how many documents related to the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against the search and advertising giant should be turned over, and how fast.
In a status conference before Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department’s Kenneth Dintzer said Google had balked at delivering some older documents, dating to the early 2000s. He also said that third parties, which could include Microsoft and Apple, had delayed responding to government subpoenas until they got a subpoena from Google – which slowed that process down.
“Broadly speaking, it’s going slowly,” he said, reported Reuters.
For Google’s part, John Schmidtlein, who argued for the company, said they would send some subpoenas to third parties this week and next.
He also said that Google had produced some 250,000 documents, the equivalent of 1.4 million pages, and that another 200,000 were being prepared for delivery to the government.
Judge Mehta told the two sides that if they had specific disagreements, he could jump in but they needed to resolve the larger issues.
The Justice Department has been pushing Google to produce documents on a long list of topics related to its lawsuit, which accuses the company of breaking antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses.

288,"March 29, 2021",Why I Agree With the Google-Fitbit Decision,"
By: Pierre Regibeau (Vox)
On 15 December 2020, the European Commission approved the acquisition of Fitbit by Alphabet, subject to a number of commitments (European Commission 2020). Once a leader in the design and production of fitness trackers, Fitbit had seen its worldwide market share of the overall smartwatch segment fall to between 5% and 10% and was for sale. By acquiring Fitbit, Google would get access to the company’s product, data about the health and health habits of Fitbit users, and Fitbit’s expertise in designing efficient sensor technology for digital wear.
This case caused considerable agitation among some academic and policy circles and led to a number of contributions pressing the Commission to block the transaction (Caffarra and Valletti 2020, Bria et al. 2020, Caffarra and Crawford 2020, Privacy International 2019). The image conveyed by these contributions is apocalyptic: access to Fitbit data would help Google further dominate the market for online advertising and the synergies between these data and the data that Google already holds would ensure its eventual dominance in digital health. This would have dire consequences for privacy. Finally, the acquisition would reduce Google’s incentives to keep its Android ecosystem open to rival wearable products.
I believe that the discussion should now move from the realm of speculation to the sphere of evidence. It is in this spirit that I would like to explain why I find the Commission’s decision fully appropriate. What follows is my own, simplified, view of the economics of the case, stripped of its jargon, legal strappings and subtleties.
The role and standards of merger review
Merger review is meant to ensure that mergers and acquisitions do not hurt consumers by increasing prices, decreasing quality, limiting variety or dampening innovation. These potential harmful effects are evaluated by comparing the post-merger situation to the counterfactual, i.e. to the situation that would have prevailed without the merger…

Google has offered the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) a number of suggestions on how best to move forward with regulation in the digital advertising space, saying a “collaborative” approach would provide the most benefit to consumers and Australian businesses.
“Google succeeds when our partners do — so we have a strong incentive to ensure a healthy digital advertising ecosystem,” a blog post penned by Google Australia’s marketing director Barney Pierce said.
The competition watchdog is currently probing the advertising technology (ad tech) sector, focusing its efforts, again, on the search giant, with the ACCC concerned with “Google’s industry-leading position.”
In response to the ACCC kicking off the inquiry, Google argued ad tech is a competitive market with low barriers to entry, and that it’s merely one of the many companies offering such a service.
The search engine giant said it creates AU$32 billion in benefits annually for businesses and content creators in Australia through its advertising platforms.  
In its 68-page submission (PDF) to the inquiry, Google stated the ACCC’s Interim Report presented an incomplete view of the digital advertising industry. 
“Focussing only on web-based open display advertising results in a misleading view of industry dynamics,” it stated.

290,"March 22, 2021",UK Lobby Pushes For Probe Into Google & Apple’s “Symbiotic Relationship”,"


A group of online advertisers is asking the UK antitrust regulator to scrutinize Google and Apple’s “symbiotic relationship,” reported Bloomberg.
Marketers for an Open Web stated the organization has asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look at concerns that the two companies “are not competing head to head,” citing US regulatory filings on agreements between the tech giants that they say are a form of active collaboration.
The UK regulator is one of several global antitrust enforcers examining technology companies amid concerns they may have too much power. The CMA started an investigation earlier this month into Apple’s app payment rules following scrutiny of Google’s planned advertising changes. The Google probe was sparked by a complaint last year from the Open Web group.
The US Department of Justice’s lawsuit last year alleges that Google and Apple work as “one company” on search. It alleges that Google’s exclusive paid deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple’s iPhones, violate monopoly rules. It’s the most significant US monopoly case in more than 20 years. Texas is also leading an antitrust lawsuit into digital advertising.
Marketers for an Open Web is asking the CMA to request internal documents from the companies on meetings and communications such as those cited in the US lawsuits, according to the group’s lawyer, Tim Cowen. The group made a filing last week to ask the CMA to investigate Apple’s ads and web tracking, an issue France is also examining even as it rejected advertisers’ requests to halt Apple’s ad changes.
Google and Apple are both rolling out privacy changes to curb how users are tracked on their devices. Advertisers and publishers complain that the companies’ actions to limit access to data will hurt their ability to generate ad revenue and undermine their business models.

The US Department of Justice accused Google of dragging its feet in providing documents in preparation for a trial on allegations that it broke antitrust law while the search and advertising giant claimed that the government was being unreasonable, reported Reuters.
In a joint filing late Thursday, March 18, the Justice Department stated that Alphabet’s Google had balked at some search terms that the government wanted it to use to locate relevant documents. The Justice Department estimated the request to Google would produce 4.85 million documents.
It also stated that Google had refused to agree to dozens of additional “custodians,” essentially people whose emails and other documents would be searched as part of pre-trial document production.
Google, for its part, stated that they had reviewed more than 12 million documents for the government’s case, and expressed concern at the growing number of custodians whose documents were sought.
“The DOJ Plaintiffs’ proposal is unreasonable and not proportional to the needs of this case,” Google stated in the filing.
The cases under discussion are the federal government and one of the state lawsuits against Google. Those actions are two of the five antitrust lawsuits filed against Big Tech last year.

Three senators are demanding the Senate Judiciary Committee convene a hearing examining new alarm over the Obama-era Federal Trade Commission’s decision not to take antitrust action against Google a decade ago.
Their request comes after new reporting by POLITICO showed the FTC declined to act despite evidence of potential violations of the law that came to light in the agency’s 19-month investigation into the search giant.

Google’s plan to block a popular web tracking tool called “cookies” is a source of concern for US Justice Department investigators who have been asking advertising industry executives whether the move by the search giant will hobble its smaller rivals, reported Reuters.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed an amended complaint against Google, claiming the tech company carried out antitrust violations and deceptive acts in regards to its advertising business. 
Paxton announced Tuesday, March 16, that attorneys general from Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico have now joined the lawsuit, which originally had 10 states on board, with Texas leading the charge. This makes 15 states or territories total to be a part of the case.
“Google collects thousands of data points about people and uses that information for its own gain while lying to advertisers, publishers, and consumers about their conduct and underlying motives. We will not allow this unprecedented, unlawful conduct to continue. Our coalition looks forward to holding Google accountable for its illegal conduct and reforming Google’s practices in the future. And we are confident Google will be forced to pay for its misconduct through significant financial penalties,” Paxton said in a statement Tuesday. 
The original suit was filed in December 2020, alleging Google violated antitrust and consumer protection laws and used exclusionary practices in its advertising industry. It also claims Google’s agreement with Facebook has allowed the company to monopolize the industry.
In a January 2021 blog post, Google’s Director of Economic Policy Adam Cohen wrote that Paxton’s claims are “misleading.” Cohen explained how the company’s “Open Bidding” agreement with Facebook works. 
“Facebook Audience Network (FAN)’s involvement isn’t a secret. In fact, it was well-publicized and FAN is one of over 25 partners participating in Open Bidding. Our agreement with FAN simply enables them (and the advertisers they represent) to participate in Open Bidding,” the post stated. 
Additionally, Paxton alleges that Google “diminished publishers’ ability to monetize content, increased advertisers’ costs, and directly harmed consumers.”

Alphabet’s Google is halving the percentage it takes from app developers on sales through its Google Play store, following a similar move by rival Apple last year. 
The Mountain View, California-based internet giant announced that it’s reducing the fees to 15% from 30% for the first US$1 million in revenue on sales of apps and in-app-purchases each year, reported Bloomberg.
The program differs from Apple’s approach. The iPhone maker limits its fee reduction to smaller developers who made as much as US$1 million in the previous calendar year.
“Scaling an app doesn’t stop once a partner has reached $1M in revenue — we’ve heard from our partners making $2M, $5M and even $10M a year that their services are still on a path to self-sustaining orbit,” Google wrote in a blog post. “This is why we are making this reduced fee on the first $1M of total revenue earned each year available to every Play developer, regardless of size.”
Google and Apple are a duopoly dominating the app economy of the Western world. The companies have come under intense pressure from regulators and some developers who complain that high app store fees and complex rules are raising costs for consumers. A total of US$143 billion was spent on mobile app stores in 2020, a 20% jump from the previous year, according to analytics firm App Annie.
In December, Bloomberg News reported that at least three US states were investigating the fees Google charges developers and were preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit as early as this year. The European Union and UK authorities are investigating Apple’s App Store.

US District Judge Lucy Koh has ruled that a class-action lawsuit against Google’s Incognito tracking policies can go forward, Bloomberg reported. The lawsuit contends that Chrome’s private browsing “Incognito” mode should also stop Google’s server-side tracking and that Google’s failure to cease such tracking violates federal wiretap laws. The lawsuit seeks at least US$5 billion, or US$5,000 per violation for “likely” millions of users.
Google attempted to get the lawsuit thrown out on the basis of Chrome’s Incognito explainer, a message that shows every time you start up Incognito mode and explains that “your activity might still be visible to websites you visit.”
That was not enough for the judge, however. “The court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,” Judge Koh wrote.

Google is facing a ‘very large investigation’ into its advertising business, the EU’s competition commissioner has said. 
Margrethe Vestager issued the warning during an online event on Friday which was reported by Bloomberg. She said that an investigation was being carried out into the ‘Google ads ecosystem’.
The EU had been investigating Google’s data practices since 2019 and recently widened the scope of its probe to look at Google’s plans to phase out third-party cookies.
Ms Vestager has already slapped Google with billions of pounds worth of fines for breaching competition laws and thwarting rivals of shopping comparison websites.
Her latest warning comes after news emerged in January that the UK’s competition watchdog would probe the firm amid claims it is using its Chrome browser to abuse its position as the dominant power in searches and browsing.
The Competition and Markets Authority launched a blockbuster antitrust probe after publishers said the tech giant’s controversial ‘sandbox’ privacy project will allow the US company to ‘distort’ the market, hoard customers’ data and cream off more cash. 
Antitrust laws are regulations which encourage competition by limiting the market power of any particular firm. 
The investigation was set to assess whether the possible removal of third-party cookies and other functionalities from Chrome could be anti-competitive and further hit UK businesses by decimating their online ad revenues.

Google and Facebook have been in high profile dispute in Australia as to implementation of a news bargaining code promoted by a competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”). Why is the Australian Government legislating to require Google and Facebook to pay media proprietors? What is the competition policy rationale for the ACCC being involved in this dispute? Why is continuing disruption of the business of production of in-depth or investigative journalism being addressed by a competition regulator? Why do both the competition regulator and the Australian Government refer to market power of Google and Facebook as a relevant concern to the question of whether, and if so, how much, these global digital platforms “should” pay to media proprietors? These questions have uniquely Australian answers, as examined in this paper. However, the media policy concerns that underlie these questions are common across many countries, some of which are considering levy, subsidy or targeted taxation schemes to transfer value from global digital platforms to domestic media proprietors. This paper considers how and why media policy concerns arising from disruption of news journalism business arose and came to be associated with business success in Australia and elsewhere of Google and Facebook.

300,"March 12, 2021",Microsoft & Google Spar Over Treatment Of News Outlets At Subcommittee Hearing,"


Microsoft and Google sparred Friday over their practices and treatment of news outlets in a battle between antitrust targets of past and present, reported CNBC.
In his written testimony for a hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Friday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Google has made journalism outlets dependent upon its vast array of services, including analytics and advertising tools, while profiting from access to their content. Smith said Google relies on content from these outlets to keep its users engaged, citing his own experience with Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
Smith said referral traffic from Google has real value to news outlets, but “monetizing that traffic has become increasingly difficult for news organizations because most of the profit has been squeezed out by Google.” He pointed to a steep decline in newspaper advertising revenue from $49.4 billion in 2005 to $14.3 billion in 2018, according to Pew Research. Over the same period, he said, Google’s ad revenue grew from $6.1 billion to $116 billion.
“This is not a coincidence,” he said.
Google swung back at Smith in a statement released ahead of the hearing, calling back to Microsoft’s period of antitrust scrutiny two decades ago.
“We respect Microsoft’s success and we compete hard with them in cloud computing, search, productivity apps, video conferencing, email and many other areas,” Google’s senior vice president of Global Affairs Kent Walker said in a blog post. “Unfortunately, as competition in these areas intensifies, they are reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests.”
“They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival,” Walker wrote. “And their claims about our business and how we work with news publishers are just plain wrong.”

301,"March 10, 2021","Epic Games Sues Google Again, Taking Their Fight To Australia","


Epic Games, the developer behind games like Fortnite and Rocket League, has filed a legal claim against Google with the Federal Court of Australia, following on from its claim with the Court against Apple on similar grounds.
Apple and Epic are locked in a legal battle over Epic’s attempt to bypass Apple’s fee collection with its own in-app purchases for the game. Unhappy it could no longer take its usual 30% cut, Apple removed Fortnite from its store, reported the Verge.
In September last year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced an investigation into the operation of app marketplaces in Australia, citing concerns around competition and consumer protections. Fee policies are one area the Australian regulator will investigate in the probe.
The company alleges that Google’s anti-competitive conduct breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).
“Google gives the illusion of being open by making arguments about the presence of alternative app stores on its platform or allowing direct downloading of apps from third-party providers, but in reality, these situations are so rare that they barely make a dent in the monopoly of the Android OS”, said Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney.

302,"March 10, 2021",Google Will Now Display Free Hotel Listings,"


Google has made it free for hotels and travel companies to appear in hotel booking links, according to a company blog post.
The listings will be cost-free starting this week, the post stated. Users, now with full access to a broader range of hotel prices, also have a better set of options as they research their trip and pick where to go, according to the post.
“While the past 12 months have been difficult for both travelers and the travel industry, we’re optimistic about the road ahead,” the post stated. “People are eager to know when they can travel again, and travel companies are wondering how they can best meet consumer needs once the pandemic subsides.”
The post noted that there’s a need for transparent information to exist for when travel fully resumes. Google stated its hotel bookings have been popular, with users finding them informative while partners see them as a great way to entice customers.
Google’s new move will similarly have a wide range of benefits, the post stated, letting hotels and travel companies access more customers and helping advertisers with more reach through the free bookings.
Google stated in the post that the new update is “part of our larger effort to ensure people have access to all offers available to them by providing free and easy ways for businesses to connect with people on Google.”

303,"March 3, 2021",Google to Stop Selling Ads Based On Your Specific Web Browsing,"


Google plans to stop selling ads based on individuals’ browsing across multiple websites, a change that could hasten upheaval in the digital advertising industry, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The Alphabet company announced on Wednesday, March 3, that it plans next year to stop using or investing in tracking technologies that uniquely identify web users as they move from site to site across the internet.
The decision, coming from the world’s biggest digital-advertising company, could help push the industry away from the use of such individualized tracking, which has come under increasing criticism from privacy advocates and faces scrutiny from regulators.
Google’s heft means that its move is also likely to stoke a backlash from some competitors in the digital ad business, where many companies rely on tracking individuals to target their ads, measure their effectiveness and stop fraud. Google accounted for 52% of last year’s global digital ad spending of US$292 billion, according to Jounce Media, a digital-ad consultancy.

304,"March 3, 2021",Arizona Passes Bill To Add Fortnite-style Payment Options In Google & Apple Stores,"


The Arizona House of Representatives voted 31-29 on Wednesday, March 3, to pass a bill that will require app stores to allow app makers to use their own payment processing software, avoiding fees charged by Apple and Google, reported CNBC. The vote is a setback for Apple, which opposed it, and a victory for the Coalition for App Fairness, a group representing app makers upset with the app stores, which backed the bill.
The legislation still has a lot of challenges to overcome before it becomes state law. First, the Arizona Senate has to discuss and pass the legislation. Then, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey would have a choice to veto the bill. If it becomes law, Arizona will have to grapple with questions including how Apple or Google will comply, or if it would be challenged in court.
The vote comes weeks after the North Dakota state senate voted against passing a similar bill.
The Arizona bill, HB 2005, targeted Apple’s fees by requiring companies that run app stores with over a million downloads per year to allow apps to offer alternative payment processors, enabling developers to avoid fees ranging from 15% to 30%. The bill would apply to companies and users in Arizona.
While the bill didn’t specify any companies, it was clearly targeted at Apple’s App Store, which approves any app that runs on iPhones, and the Google Play app store for Android phones, which takes 30% of sales of digital goods from Android apps. Discussion of the bill in the Arizona House focused mostly on Apple, with some discussion of Google. The bill exempted digital software stores for game consoles or music players.
“I think they have a monopoly on the market right now,” Republican Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, who sponsored the bill, said. “There isn’t anybody in here that doesn’t have a Google Android or Apple phone, I guarantee it.”

Ryan Shores, who oversaw the US Justice Department’s (DOJ) antitrust probe that resulted in its landmark lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google, has rejoined Shearman & Sterling, the law firm announced Monday, March 1. He’ll be an antitrust and litigation partner based in Washington, DC.
Shores joined the DOJ from Shearman & Sterling in October 2019 to help lead its probe and left his post in January, just months after the government filed its complaint alleging Google broke the law in using its market power to fend off rivals.  In that role, Ryan oversaw the Department’s antitrust review of major online platforms, leading to the government’s landmark monopolization case filed against Google last year. He originally joined Shearman & Sterling in 2017 and was instrumental in expanding the firm’s antitrust litigation footprint.
“Ryan returns to the firm with invaluable experience from the Department of Justice, particularly in the critical technology sector, further strengthening our robust antitrust and litigation offerings,” said David Beveridge, Senior Partner at Shearman & Sterling. “Ryan rejoining us further demonstrates the continued execution of our broader long-term growth strategy, which includes growing in key areas to remain a global elite law firm.”
Commenting on Ryan rejoining the firm, Adam Hakki, Global Managing Partner, Global Litigation Practice Group Leader and Global Head of Disputes stated, “We are thrilled to welcome Ryan back to the firm. He will be a major asset and a key part of our strategy to continue to grow our antitrust litigation and counseling capabilities in the U.S. and globally, and to continue deepening our industry focus across key areas including technology and energy.”
Ryan Shores added, “I am excited to be rejoining the talented team of antitrust and litigation practitioners at Shearman & Sterling. The antitrust landscape is complex and evolving, and I look forward to working alongside my Shearman colleagues as we help clients navigate this landscape in the courtroom and in their daily business practices.”

Reliance Industries, India’s largest company by market value, is looking to link up with Facebook and Google in a bid to get a digital payments license from the Reserve Bank of India to serve the country’s growing eCommerce market. The move would also include homegrown technology service provider Infibeam Avenues, Bloomberg reported.
The Reliance conglomerate is run by Mukesh Ambani, currently Asia’s wealthiest individual. Facebook and Google are among Reliance’s 13 international investors. According to Bloomberg sources, the four business partners are working on a detailed plan. The companies declined to comment.
Tufts University’s Fletcher School, in collaboration with Mastercard, released a report last month that assessed countries’ movement toward digital payments. India was fourth in “momentum” among 90 economies ranked at the end of last year. According to Fletcher’s Digital Evolution Scorecard, India takes its place among “break out economies,” which are “lower scoring in their present states of digitization” but changing quickly. The study added that such economies are “highly attractive to innovators and investors.”
Reliance’s Jio is a telecommunications company headquartered in Mumbai. It topped 405 million subscribers in the third quarter of last year. The startup, founded by Ambani, also saw a net increase in profits of 12.85% on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

307,"February 28, 2021",Judge Tells Google Lawyers To Work Out Document Dispute,"


A federal judge hearing a US government antitrust case against Google urged the lawyers to work out a complicated dispute on pre-trial document production among themselves, reported Reuters.
The Justice Department has been pushing Alphabet’s Google to produce documents on a long list of topics related to its lawsuit, which accuses the company of breaking antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses.
Google has balked at some of the production, describing some requests in a court filing as “overly broad.”
The Justice Department’s lawyer, Kenneth Dintzer, said that the government needed Google’s help in crafting a list of search terms that would be used to find relevant documents, saying that people in the company would use nicknames for certain topics, like writing “Redmond” instead of “Microsoft.” Microsoft, a Google rival and critic, is based in Redmond, Washington.
In the end, US District Judge Amit Mehta issued no order but urged the two sides to sort out the disagreements, saying that the government needed to figure out what it wanted and Google needed to help it write search terms to find that data.
“I just don’t know any better way to do that… but to continue hammering at this,” he said.
The Justice Department’s lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google’s search and search advertising. That federal case has been combined with an antitrust case brought by states for pre-trial matters.
The state case, which was filed in December, also accused Google of seeking to extend its dominance to devices like speakers, televisions, and even smart cars.

Google’s former CEO told Congress there is an urgent need to increase the pace of technology innovation to keep up with China. The threat of China’s swift advancements in technology is “very, very real,” said Eric Schmidt, The Washington Post reported Wednesday, February 24.
His comments come at a time when President Biden is under pressure to take a hard line on China over such issues as national security and its unfair trade practices.
“In the United States, we believe we are one or two years ahead of China, not five or 10,” Schmidt told the US Senate’s Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. He pointed to artificial intelligence (AI), an area where China is aiming to be the leader by 2030.
In particular, facial recognition technology, which is based on AI, is an area where China’s “technology is generations ahead of what is possible in the West, and you can understand why,” he said, as China has a vast surveillance network targeting its own citizens.
He added that a lack of privacy rights could also allow the country to build massive databases that could fuel new advances in fields such as healthcare.
“We need to address these without compromising our core American values,” said Schmidt. He added that the US should set up a Technology Competitiveness Council, which would be led by the vice president.
In addition, Schmidt argued that China is significantly ahead in eCommerce and mobile payments technology.

The privacy regulator overseeing Facebook and Google and Apple in the European Union expects to boost its tally of big tech decisions this year—and rejects complaints that its enforcement has been too slow, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Helen Dixon, who leads Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, said her office is on track to make draft decisions in roughly half a dozen privacy cases involving big technology companies this year, compared with just two last year.
“The pipeline is very strong. The momentum is building in terms of concluding these inquiries,” Ms. Dixon said in an interview.
Ms. Dixon is one of the world’s most influential privacy regulators because the data commission she leads is in charge enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for companies that have their regional headquarters in Ireland.
Two cases involving Facebook are already on Ms. Dixon’s desk for draft decisions, she said. Five others, including one involving Google and others involving Facebook subsidiaries, are nearing the end of their investigations, with final reports either submitted to the companies for a final round of comments or received back, she added.

French antitrust investigators have accused Alphabet’s Google of failing to comply with the state competition authority’s orders on how to conduct negotiations with news publishers over copyright, reported Reuters.
In the 93-page report, known as a statement of objections, the investigators wrote that Google’s failure to comply was of an exceptionally serious nature, the sources said.
This comes amid complaints by French news publishers that Google failed to hold talks with them in good faith to find an agreement. The same publishers were not part of the US$76 million three-year deal signed between the US firm and a group of 121 publications, as Reuters reported earlier this month.
The agreement was presented as a major step forward by both Google and the publishers who signed it, but left many publications infuriated.
The French competition authority can impose fines of up to 10% of sales on firms it deems in violation of its rules. Google’s annual sales amounted to about US$183 billion in 2020.
The investigative report is a key element in the authority’s sanction process, but it is up to the watchdog’s board, led by Isabelle de Silva, to decide whether to issue a penalty.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has started an investigation to check whether Google Pay (GPay) has abused its dominance of India’s digital payments market, executives at three payment firms aware of the discussions said.
The market watchdog is holding face-to-face interviews with rival payment firms, including PhonePe and Paytm Payments Bank, as part of the probe, the executives said seeking anonymity.
Through its meetings, CCI will seek to understand whether Google is giving users the choice to pay through other payment instruments in addition to GPay. It will also try to ascertain whether Google is leveraging user data on its platform to gain unfair advantage for its own payment platform and also if it has created restrictions for other payment firms to gain unfair advantage. CCI will also check if Google is abiding by the government’s zero-merchant discount rate (MDR) policy.
The executives cited above said while CCI ordered the probe on GPay last November, a formal investigation began in January with the appointment of an additional director general to the antitrust case.
“CCI is still at a nascent point of the investigation and is trying to approach the matter from the perspective of app bundling with the Android OS, search manipulations where Google Pay appears on the top when a user searches for a payment use-case such as recharge on (Google search); and leveraging Google properties and data such as YouTube and Play Store to plant advertisements for its payment service, through ad personalization,” said one of the three executives cited above.

Seven West Media has become the largest Australian news media business to strike a deal with Google to pay for journalism in a partnership announced Monday before the nation’s Parliament considers draft laws to force digital giants to pay for news.
Google and the publicly listed broadcast television, print and online publishing company jointly announced they had agreed on a “long-term partnership” after weekend discussions Australian government ministers had with media executives, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet and its subsidiary Google.

“Their outstanding leadership on the implementation of the proposed news media bargaining code has resulted in us being able to conclude negotiations that result in fair payment and ensure our digital future,” Stokes said in a statement.
“The negotiations with Google recognise the value of quality and original journalism throughout the country and, in particular, in regional areas,” Stokes added.
The deal was struck under Google’s own model, News Showcase. Google has reached pay deals with more than 450 publications globally since News Showcase was launched in October.

Australia’s Seven West Media became the country’s first major news outlet to strike a licensing deal with Google, as the government pushes ahead with a law that would force the internet giant to pay media companies for content, reported Reuters.
At an earnings announcement on Tuesday, February 9, Seven, which owns a free-to-air television network and the main metro newspaper in the city of Perth, stated it would supply content for Google’s News Showcase platform. It did not disclose terms.
The deal shows Seven splitting from rivals News and Nine Entertainment which have failed to reach agreements with Google and instead backed laws, set to be passed this week, where the government sets the online giant’s content fees in the absence of a private deal.
So far in Australia, only specialist online publishers and one regional newspaper have struck deals to receive payment for their content appearing on the new Google platform which went live in the country this month. Outside Australia, Reuters is among news outlets with similar Google deals.

Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are among major tech companies that have complained to US antitrust regulators regarding NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm. Bloomberg reported that at least once complaining company wants the deal killed, though it did not specify which. The concern from the tech giants is that NVIDIA purchasing Arm will hurt competition.
Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are asking antitrust officials to intervene with the deal, according to sources that spoke with Bloomberg that have asked to not be identified as they aren’t authorized to publicly speak on the subject.
NVIDIA officially started to acquire Arm limited in September 2020, though rumors of a potential deal started in July 2020. The deal price was valued at US$40 billion and was announced by NVIDIA.
Arm licenses out its chip designs and software to several major tech companies, including Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics, Amazon, and many others. Most people have used one of their chips on a phone, tablet, or PC at some point. Bloomberg calls Arm the “Switzerland of the industry” and highlights the concern that NVIDIA owning Arm could limit access to chips for rival companies.
According to Bloomberg, NVIDIA claims that there isn’t any incentive to change the neutrality of Arm. The company cites the purchase price of Arm as a reason to not change what’s working, but Bloomberg states that rival companies and many people don’t believe that to be the case.

A Texas court considering a state antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google is likely to hold a hearing on the company’s request to move the trial to California, according to discussions at a status conference on Thursday, February 4.
Lawyers at the pretrial conference, which was held in Plano, Texas, discussed Google’s motion to move the case to California, where it is fighting similar cases.
Judge Sean Jordan, who was nominated to the court by former US President Donald Trump in 2019, indicated that if either side wanted a hearing on the issue, he would likely schedule one.
“Yes, your honor, we will want a hearing,” said Paul Yetter, who represents Google in the case. Suggested dates for that hearing were late February or early March.
Texas and nine other states sued the search and advertising company in mid-December, accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it dominates all steps in placing digital advertising. Publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues. Google has denied wrongdoing.
Yetter also brought up the issue of an unredacted draft of the Texas lawsuit being leaked to major newspapers. The draft discussed a deal struck between Facebook and Google.

Microsoft stated on Wednesday, February 3, it would never threaten to leave Australia after Google suggested it could pull its widely used search engine from the country, reported CNBC.
Google made the threat last month after the Australian government proposed a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for the right to link to their content.
“One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, in a statement.
“We are committed to supporting the country’s national security and economic success.”
Microsoft is well placed to capitalize from any fallout between Google and Australia. Google currently dominates search in the country, boasting a 94.5% market share, according to web analytics firm StatCounter, while Microsoft’s Bing holds just 3.6%.  
Smith said that he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week, who recently told reporters that Australia “did not respond to threats.”

By Kate Kaye, Digi Day
Google’s decision to kill off third-party cookies has already elicited multiple antitrust lawsuits and a U.S. congressional probe. Now, its attempt to replace the cookie is attracting regulatory attention.
On Jan. 8, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into whether Google’s proposals for replacing third-party cookies — through an effort Google has branded Privacy Sandbox — “could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,” according to a CMA announcement about the investigation.
Under pressure from governments and consumers over data privacy infringement concerns, Google a year ago said it will disable third-party cookies by 2022 in its Chrome browser, which is used by more than 60% of the world’s web users. The move will effectively disable a primary way that ads are targeted and content is personalized on publishers’ sites. By extension, it could compromise publishers’ abilities to make money from online advertising and push people, their data and — along with them — ad dollars further within the walls of Google’s already dominant properties, according to ad tech and publishing executives.

A Virginia news publisher has filed an antitrust suit against Google and Facebook, who together receive roughly half of all digital ad dollars in the US and are facing antitrust charges from federal and state authorities, reported The New York Times.
The company, HD Media, owns several papers in the state, including the Herald-Dispatch in Huntington and the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
HD Media claims Google has so monopolized the online ad market that “it threatens the extinction of local newspapers across the country.” The suit also alleges that Google and Facebook conspired to further their dominance with a secret agreement, referring to a suit filed by 10 Republican attorneys general in December.
The company does not specify the impact on its business of the behavior of Facebook and Google beyond saying that it has hurt its ability to “effectively monetize its content” because Google is enabled to take an uncompetitive share of the news publisher’s ad revenues. A lawyer for the company declined to speak on the record.
It’s the first antitrust lawsuit against a tech platform focused on news publishing, said David Chavern, head of the news trade group News Media Alliance. He said the group was not involved in the suit.
HD Media filed in federal court in West Virginia and asked for a jury trial. It asked for unspecified damages and that the court stop Google and Facebook from the uncompetitive conduct it is alleging.

As a staunch Trump ally, former Attorney General Bill Barr will be remembered for a lot of things. His role in the redaction, and then subsequent disclosure, of the Mueller report and his interventions in cases involving Trump associates spring to mind. However, perhaps his legacy will be something entirely different, with wider ramifications for citizens across the globe, far beyond the Washington political bubble.
Under Barr’s watch, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) initiated a major lawsuit against Google in October for alleged violations of US competition law. Announcing the action, Barr said this was “a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.”
The DoJ’s case has been taken in conjunction with 11 state Attorneys General (including the likes of Florida, Georgia and Texas). It is a civil antitrust lawsuit which alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies through anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets.
The significance of the DoJ’s action cannot be underestimated. Google is one of the wealthiest corporations on the planet with a market value of over US$1 trillion. In announcing the action, Barr threw down the gauntlet to Google saying the “lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google’s grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist.” He compared the lawsuit with the historic antitrust actions taken against AT&T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998…

Google had announced plans to launch News Showcase in Australia last June, signing deals with six small local outlets, including The Conversation, for content. It subsequently delayed the launch, citing regulatory conditions, when Australia’s competition regulator published a draft copy of the proposed media bargaining code.

A lack of competition for Google and a lack of transparency in the digital advertising supply chain needed to be addressed because they were impacting publishers, advertisers and consumers, Australia’s competition watchdog said on Thursday, January 27.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released its interim report on its inquiry into the Google-dominated digital advertising services industry in Australia that is worth AU$3.4 billion (US$2.6 billion) a year.
The industry allows advertisers to buy access to consumers’ eyeballs almost instantaneously through an automated bidding process, flashing up products that supposedly align with the individual consumers’ personal interests. Such individually tailored ads can follow consumers around the internet.
Google not only powers the digital display technology, it also controls much of the advertising space.
Commission chair Rod Sims said, “there is a real lack of competition, choice and transparency in this industry” that add to advertisers’ costs and increase prices paid by consumers.
“Google’s significant presence across the whole ad tech supply chain, combined with its significant data advantage, means Google is likely to have the ability and the incentive to preference its own ad tech businesses in ways that affect competition,” Sims wrote.
“During this inquiry, we have heard concerns from parties about potential conflicts of interest from Google’s various roles in this industry. This includes Google very often acting on behalf of both publishers and advertisers for the same ad sale across the ad tech supply chain, while also selling its own ad inventory,” He added.

326,"January 26, 2021",“Privacy Fixing” After Texas et al v. Google and CMA v. Google (Privacy Sandbox): Approaches to Antitrust Considerations of Privacy,"

By Tim Cowen, Claire Barraclough & Josh Koran1
 
Executive Summary
Societies have designed antitrust laws to protect consumers from unfair practices (e.g. exclusive dealing, price fixing, abuse of dominance and restraint of trade) by ensuring competition drives business rivals to innovate, thus providing consumers with a greater choice of suppliers to address their needs. This paper discusses the practice of “privacy fixing” and how antitrust laws apply to that activity.
We describe the issue of “Privacy Fixing” as raised in Texas v. Google and discuss potential approaches to considerations of privacy as an antitrust issue with reference to the current UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) investigation into Google’s Privacy Sandbox2. We examine three examples of unfair practices regarding the misuse of data privacy policies that may expose organizations to antitrust liability, namely exclusionary abuse, exploitative abuse, and collusion.
 
Introduction
Before addressing the recent Google antitrust cases, let us first define the issue of “privacy fixing.” Privacy fixing can arise in situations of individual firm action where a dominant organization unilaterally acts to use privacy to exclude rivals from a market or to limit the extent and degree of privacy choice available to its rivals. Alternatively, a number of businesses can agree to restrict or limit consumer choice, either directly by reducing their terms of trade with relation to privacy, or otherwise by jointly limiting competition that might offer people the choice of a differing level of privacy.
In 2017, Benjamin R. Dryden & Shankar Iyer reviewed the issue of privacy fixing and predatory privacy under U.S. law, in an article published in the leading online competition journal “Competition Policy International.” As the authors put it “Protecting privacy may seem so obvious a social good that any comparison with price fixing looks silly.” However, “the antitrust laws apply to non-price elements of competition like privacy policies. The Supreme Court has made clear that “for antitrust purposes, there is no meaningful distinction between price and non-price components of a transaction.”3 For these reasons the antitrust rules have been applied “even to public safety rules by private standards-setting organizations.”4
That paper reminds readers that collusion between competitors is “the supreme evil of antitrust” and accordingly antitrust law treats classic collusive activity, like price fixing, bid rigging, or customer allocations, as illegal per se. This means that these kinds of collusive activities have “such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect, and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit, that they are irrebuttably presumed to violate the law.”
Before continuing it is necessary to define the form of “privacy,” which underlies these antitrust concerns. Privacy regulations define “personal data” as information associated with identifiable individuals.5 This information poses higher privacy risks when it is directly associated with people’s offline identity. Privacy regulations state that organizations can reduce the privacy risks for people by instead associating the same information with only a pseudonymous identifier.6 A pseudonymous identifier is one where the organization processing the personal data has appropriate technical and operational processes in place to keep the identifier distinct from people’s directly-identifiable identity.7 Dryden & Iyer discussed likely theoretical examples of privacy that could raise antitrust liability and whether it could be considered per se illegal, quasi criminal, or subject to a rule of reason analysis under U.S. antitrust.
Now we have real world examples. Two independent antitrust investigations, in the United States and the United Kingdom, now raise the privacy fixing issue. On December 16, 2020, Texas’ Attorney General announced that it, along with nine other U.S. States, had filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google.8 The case is neither the first nor last lawsuit against Google to be announced in the U.S., with USA v. Google making headlines in October,9 partly for the surprising extent of the collaboration it revealed between Google and Apple. Colorado’s Attorney General filed another multistate lawsuit on December 17, 2020 covering similar, but not the same, ground. The Texas case focuses on a new aspect, given revelations about collaboration between Google and Facebook and the sharing of WhatsApp data between Google and Facebook.
One allegation made against Google in the Texas case is that “it restricts information to foreclose competition and advantage itself.” Within this, Texas argues that Google “uses privacy concerns as an excuse to advantage itself over its competitors,” even where its “entire business model is to collect comprehensive data about every user in the service of brokering targeted ad sales.”10 The Texas pleading cites evidence from Google’s internal documents, including Google’s proposal to eliminate third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, which “is justified on privacy grounds, but the effect is to increase information asymmetries between Google and its competitors.”11 The documents available to Texas appear to evidence individual firm action – a kind of exclusionary abuse of dominance by Google vis-à-vis Google’s competitors.
Contrary to Google’s assertion that its actions protect people’s privacy, Texas also refers to the fact that Google “violates users’ privacy in other egregious ways when doing so is convenient for Google.”12 Moreover, the complaint goes on to state that “Google actively coordinates with its competitors when it comes to privacy,”13 raising the further question of whether coordination between competitors in relation to privacy terms or policies could constitute anticompetitive collusion, or even a cartel-esque offence. In respect of this, the complaint states: “Of course, effective competition is concerned about both price and quality, and the fact that Google coordinates with its competitors on the quality metric of privacy – one might call it privacy fixing – underscores Google’s selective promotion of privacy concerns only when doing so facilitates its efforts to exclude competition.”14
On January 8, 2020, the CMA announced a formal investigation of the 23 proposed changes to Google’s Chrome and Chromium Browser engine that Google announced on August 22, 2019 under the heading of the “Privacy Sandbox.”15 That investigation is concerned with Google’s unilateral action, the effect of the announcement, and the proposed changes on the market, specifically the negative consequences for publishers, marketers, and others affected relative to the benefits that inure to Google from these changes. The CMA had, during the course of 2019, conducted a wide-ranging Market Investigation which investigated these browser changes among other practices and obtained evidence from many sources. The conclusion of the Market Investigation was to propose new legislation to remedy the situation of dominant gatekeeper platforms’ abuse of dominance, which the Government is now working to enact. 16
One Google document the Market Investigation brought to light discloses the financial impact on publishers of Google’s browser changes, which is particularly relevant to the new investigation. That document discloses that if implemented, just 1 of Google’s 23 proposed changes would likely lead to catastrophic loss of revenue for publishers and, after the impact of the pandemic, the impact on funding for many web publishers and a plurality of the media in the UK could be devastating. A key graph drawn from Google’s publicized research on this topic estimates the impact on publisher revenues from removing interoperable data, which disproportionately impacts smaller players.17 If Google followed through on its change, they estimate approximately 75 percent of the worlds’ largest publishers would lose more than 50 percent of their revenues.
  This internal Google document further bolsters the CMA’s observations that a 70 percent loss in advertising revenues could be suffered by publishers if the announced browser changes were implemented.18 The disproportionate impact on smaller publishers is particularly concerning, given these not only represent a large number of minority voices, provide diversity of opinion, and support the plurality of the media, but also because such an impact would threaten future competition from new rivals by raising barriers of entry to the web publishing ecosystem. An application has now been made to the CMA for interim measures to prevent this from happening and is being considered in the current investigation.19
Let us review three antitrust considerations raised by privacy fixing in the Texas case below.
 
Privacy as a Factor in Competition Cases 
Price and non-price factors of competition are the basis on which consumers make purchasing decisions, and are factors that are routinely taken into account by antitrust authorities when examining those decisions and competitive rivalry among firms. Among the non-price factors antitrust regulators routinely consider are reductions in product quality, variety, and service.20 The United States Supreme Court has also determined that non-price factors deserve protection under antitrust laws.21 Whether privacy is an important non-price factor will depend on the product in question. In traditional goods and non-digital markets it is, however, hard to see situations where privacy is a key component of many purchasing decisions.22
Privacy is more likely to be a component of purchasing decisions in online markets. One early EU case in which this issue arose was Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp. Users of messaging services were, arguably, attracted to WhatsApp’s messaging service and flocked to use its offering in their millions on the basis that it was entirely private and highly secure; and provided groups of people a method for competing with Facebook groups or messenger services and other messaging apps. All were free to the user at the time23, and one clear competitive differentiator between offerings was privacy, given the lack of privacy protection in Facebook’s terms of trade. WhatsApp accumulated 400 million users before being bought by Facebook for over $22 billion. The merger was alleged to be anticompetitive at the time and given Facebook’s notorious compliance record on privacy protection, concerns were raised that Facebook was “taking out” a fast-growing competitor and would degrade the privacy protections offered by WhatsApp over time.
The case was the subject of numerous complaints before EU member states and U.S. authorities’, and eventually the EU Commission.24 The Commission in that case accepted that the degradation of privacy policies could affect other aspects of product quality, or amount to an increase in the “price” paid by consumers for the product (e.g. in terms of requiring more personal data to be provided). The precedent was established that:
“In two-sided markets, where products are offered to users for free and monetised through targeted advertising, personal data can be viewed as the currency paid by the user in return for receiving the ‘free’ product, or as a dimension of product quality.”25
After Facebook gave assurances that WhatsApp users’ private data could not technically be combined for the use of advertising, the merger was allowed. While it allowed the merger, Facebook’s later breach of its undertaking earned it a fine of over $100 million for misleading the Commission,26 and the case became notorious when a UK House of Commons Select Committee released documents that showed Facebook senior executives knew they were taking out a rival competitor at the time.27  Facebook has now announced in January 2021 that it will use personal data gathered in WhatsApp for its advertising, but will not allow third-parties to advertise in this inventory.28  This undermines one of the three rationales the Commission relied upon in allowing the original merger, namely that “a number of alternative providers would continue to offer targeted advertising after the transaction, and a large amount of internet user data that are valuable for advertising purposes not within Facebook’s exclusive control would continue to exist.”29   Moreover, the Commission found that, contrary to Facebook’s statements in the 2014 merger review process, the technical possibility of automatically matching Facebook and WhatsApp users’ identities already existed in 2014, and that Facebook staff were aware of such a possibility.
Unsurprisingly, the fact that privacy protection can be a major factor in customer’s preferences and hence in online competition has been followed in subsequent cases.30 Whether privacy is important to consumers decision making will depend on the product and market concerned. For example, in Microsoft/LinkedIn the Commission considered that data privacy is “a significant factor of quality” in the market for Professional Social Networks.31
 
Misapplication of Data Privacy Policies that Cause Exclusionary Abuse 
The Dryden & Iyer paper above presents a hypothetical example of a dating app which has decided to match competitor’s privacy policy or commitment not to monetize user data for advertising, a decision “motivated by a predatory, monopolistic desire to injure its smaller rivals, rather than a bona fide decision to honor its users’ privacy.”32
In the example they provide, two competitors rely on privacy policy not to improve their service, but instead to reduce competition, given new entrants would not have a scaled user base to support their operations using a direct payment business model. In their example, since advertising revenues can reduce direct cash payments by website visitors, by agreeing to eliminate this revenue model this would raise the prices consumers would need to pay. Essentially, in the example, the dominant dating app is using privacy as a non-price factor of competition to undermine future competition. Such behavior conducted by a dominant supplier that may “create a barrier to entry that inhibits the growth of the new entrants” is likely to be anticompetitive and predatory under U.S. law. The paper cites the leading U.S. antitrust case of Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp, 472 U.S. 585 (1985), where it was found that when a firm “attempt[s] to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency, it is fair to characterize its behavior as predatory.”33
Another example of such behavior, in the digital space, can be found in Texas v. Google where it references the attempts by Google to claim that changes to its Chrome browser are privacy protecting, but which are, in reality, exclusionary of advertising rivals. Essentially, platforms such as Google, which themselves have relied on data monetization to grow, are pulling up the drawbridge behind them. The Texas complaint cites the example of Google’s announcement that it will remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser.34 That action will limit the ability of competitors to Google’s advertising business to access the data needed to optimize the matching of adverts to people across different websites. This negative impact to other publishers is not in dispute, as evidenced in Google’s publicized research.35 It also suggests that the motivation behind the change is designed to reduce competition. The CMA investigation into Privacy Sandbox is assessing how Google’s proposed changes would further concentrate more revenues into Google’s hands to the detriment of competition.36
One potential solution to the issue of exclusionary abuse in the provision of data would be providing access to that data by competitors. The French Autorité de la Concurrence dealt with this issue as long ago as 2014 in the GDF Suez case.37/sup>  The measures requested by the complainant included ordering GDF Suez to give competing suppliers of natural gas access to customer data including the customers’ names, addresses, telephone numbers, and consumption profiles. Such data were private and protected under the French Loi Informatique et Libertés but that did not prevent the Autorité from ordering GDF Suez to grant access to the data, subject to consumers’ consent. In line with the recommendations made by CNIL (the French data protection authority), the Autorité required GDF Suez to inform its customers that competitors would be able to request access to their personal data and they had the right to refuse such access. Another solution would have been to provide access to anonymized data, which falls outside the scope of the GDPR, or to pseudonymized data.
The CMA has proposed such a solution in its Market Investigation38 and it may be forthcoming in the anticipated UK legislation designed to underpin its new Digital Markets Unit. This risk of exclusionary abuse is a just one issue of privacy fixing antitrust authorities should consider in relation to online digital markets.
 
Misapplication of Data Privacy Policies that Cause Exploitive Abuse 
In digital markets, where data is so important for monetization through advertising, there is a tension between companies’ incentives to acquire as much personal data as possible about consumers and incentives to respect consumer privacy. Where subject to competitive constraints, one could expect that companies which stray too far one way or the other will suffer. If they gather too much sensitive data that frequently causes privacy harms, consumers who worry about these risks will seek alternatives and switch away from privacy invading firms so the privacy invaders revenues will suffer. However, in the absence of such competitive choice people may find themselves subject to exploitive abuse.
In competitive markets where offerings are vying with each other to provide greater levels of privacy in return for the service supplied, privacy could be a key differentiator in people’s choices over which services to use. Thus, when competition exists, much depends on the actions and choices of end consumers. Some consumers may be willing to share personal data with a trusted supplier in return for specific services; others may not.  Different levels of sharing may be offered for different levels of service – and competitive rivalry acts to spur innovation.
Indeed, we have some evidence of digital services that compete in this manner. Duckduckgo is a rival search engine to Google’s dominant search service, which differentiates itself by not collecting an individual’s prior search activity to personalize search results.  Both search services have access to the same website data, but essentially compete on privacy. A second example is Brave Browser that offers its users that it alone will collect their personal data and monetize publisher properties without sharing any non-aggregated personal data with marketers. Given this browser is a white-label version of Google’s dominant Chrome browser, Brave essentially is using data sharing with marketers as the principle differentiator. Neither of these alternatives have attracted significant users, which suggests that a majority of people are perhaps not concerned with the exchange of non-sensitive personal data for cost-free access to web services. However, the market context is one of a market that has been dominated and distorted for many years and is not fully competitive. On any analysis, combinations of price and privacy protections are possible, are likely to be better made and reflect consumers real choices in competitive markets than in markets controlled by advertising-funded monopolies. In markets that are funded by advertising, without the constraint imposed by competition, there is an incentive on the monopolist to harvest more sensitive private data if by doing so it can achieve greater numbers of sales and increase profits, even at the expense of consumer privacy.
One leading commentator, Dina Srinivasan, has highlighted this issue in relation to Facebook in both a New York Times article,39 and a longer academic paper.40 She cites Facebook, when it was a start-up, committing to consumers that it did not and would not use cookies “to collect private information from any user,”41 essentially using privacy as a competitive differentiator. Over time Facebook rowed back on the plan. Facebook now gathers a considerable amount of consumer data, including through third party cookies across the internet.42 Since the early 2000s, Facebook has seen its competition diminish, either through the demise of rivals such as MySpace or Bebo, or through acquisition of nascent competitors, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. In “2014, Google announced that it would fold its social network Orkut. Emboldened by the decline of market threats, Facebook revoked its users’ ability to vote on changes to its privacy policies and then (almost simultaneously with Google’s exit from the social media market) changed its privacy pact with users.”43 As competition dwindled, by agreement or otherwise, Facebook began collecting more consumer data. As Srinivasan puts it, “the price of using Facebook has stayed the same over the years (it’s free to join and use), but the cost of using it, calculated in terms of the amount of data that users now must provide, is an order of magnitude above what it was when Facebook faced real competition.”44
Google also changed its stance over the collection of personal data after it acquired DoubleClick. Unlike most digital advertising which marketers evaluate through analysis of consumer behavior after measuring exposure across multiple digital properties, marketers value Search advertising by the immediate click event on a single property (a search engine). For this reason, prior to Google’s expansion into other forms of digital advertising that followed its DoubleClick acquisition, Google differentiated its offering by not collecting and storing personal data associated with its search solutions. In 2007, Google’s VP of product management for advertising was quoted as stating Google was not stitching together a user’s various online actions in one profile.45 This executive stated, “Nothing is stored, nothing is remembered. It all happens within that session.”46 After the DoubleClick acquisition, this same executive announced Google would store user web interactions in a profile to optimize the matching of content to people based on their past actions:
“At Google, we believe that ads are a valuable source of information — one that can connect people to the advertisers offering products, services and ideas that interest them. By making ads more relevant, and improving the connection between advertisers and our users, we can create more value for everyone. Users get more useful ads, and these more relevant ads generate higher returns for advertisers and publishers. Advertising is the lifeblood of the digital economy: it helps support the content and services we all enjoy for free online today, including much of our news, search, email, video and social networks…. We think we can make online advertising even more relevant and useful by using additional information about the websites people visit. Today we are launching “interest-based” advertising as a beta test on our partner sites and on YouTube. These ads will associate categories of interest — say sports, gardening, cars, pets — with your browser, based on the types of sites you visit and the pages you view. We may then use those interest categories to show you more relevant text and display ads.”47
The CMA has recently found that most consumers, when surveyed, indicate that they are concerned about their privacy online.48 It can be inferred, therefore, that consumers would, in a competitive market, switch from Facebook, but to what? In a paradigm where there is not, in most cases, a realistic alternative, as competition in social media is limited, consumers are not currently being protected by market forces.
Of course, given that a defining property of social networks is that they depend on the sensitive personal data of identity, a more competitive market might provide people choice to have their cost-free access subsidized via advertising, but ensure that their digital activity is not linked by the social network to their identity via this advertising.
The CMA itself has put forward a proposal that would both address user needs for protection of privacy and identity and allow advertisers with a pseudonymous ID sufficient for allowing ads to be tailored and relevant, and enable the online marketing and advertising industry to measure the performance of ads across multiple websites.
 
“Privacy-Fixing” Under EU as well as U.S. Competition Law
The examples above reference the issue of privacy in competitive offerings and the issues that have come up in mergers, collusion and unilateral behavior. Both the Texas complaint and the Dyden & Iyer paper explicitly discuss the concept of “privacy fixing,” as a non-price factor that can remove consumer choice either directly by reducing privacy, or by limiting competition. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that even companies acting unilaterally “to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end” is against the public interest.49
The Texas case also reveals that Google may have agreed with Facebook to give it an advantage in advertising markets and between them the parties have taken steps to limit the data that they share with other players.
Under EU and UK law, if competitors were to agree to reduce or limit the level of protection for users’ personal data in their terms or quality of competing offerings, as with an agreement to limit their prices, their conduct would be prohibited in the EU as an anticompetitive agreement within the prohibition of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), and in the UK under Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998. Such an agreement would be similar to an agreement to reduce or limit the quality of the parties’ products. For instance, in the Belgian Association of Pharmacists case, an agreement to restrict suppliers from producing products of a different, inferior, standard (thus limiting the variety of products supplied) has been found to infringe Article 101(1).50
Thus, privacy fixing is an important non-price factor that organizations should consider, along with factors of controlling price, supply, quality, service, and reductions in innovation, to avoid potential liability from activities that may expose them to potential antitrust violations. Similarly, the exchange of information between competitors about planned changes to their privacy policies may violate competition law if it would remove the uncertainty as to their future conduct and, thereby, eliminate the risk of independent competitive conduct on a market.51
 
Coordination Between Online Ad-funded Platforms
Texas v. Google refers to agreements between Google and Facebook that came to light since the House of Commons DCMS select committee investigations of Facebook, which released documents showing that Facebook trades with others and accumulates data from other online businesses on a non-reciprocal basis.
The Texas complaint now goes further and alleges that Google and Facebook not only discussed privacy, but also signed an exclusive agreement in 2015 under which Facebook shared WhatsApp data with Google.52 The timing of that 2015 agreement is remarkable in light of the Facebook/ WhatsApp acquisition since Facebook notified the acquisition in 2014 and informed the EU Commission that it would be unable to establish reliable automated matching between Facebook users’ accounts and WhatsApp users’ account data. It stated this both in the notification form during 2014 and in a reply to a request of information from the Commission. However, in August 2016, WhatsApp announced updates to its terms of service and privacy policy, including the possibility of linking WhatsApp users’ phone numbers with Facebook users’ identities. All the while it now appears that Facebook perhaps not only had access to that information but had agreed to provide information to Google. This is not an issue on which the record is entirely conclusive, but it could be expected to be a matter of some interest to a curious authority.
Google and Facebook both offer very limited privacy protections in their end user contracts. Rather than relying on pseudonymous identifiers (that most of their smaller rivals rely on), both companies offer marketers content targeting based on matches of this directly-identifiable data. There is presently no evidence of any direct agreement between them to take such an approach, but the Texas case refers to evidence that in their dealings with each other they share user data so obtained to their mutual benefit. The extent of their coordination may become clearer as the Texas case progresses.
 
Collusion in Collective Agreements and Standards-making Involving Data Privacy Policies
The concern about competitors meeting and discussing prices goes back centuries. As the well-known quotation goes:
 “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”
Adam Smith eloquently stated the above in The Wealth of Nations Book 1 Chapter X.  it is often repeated as the reason that antitrust authorities maintain vigilance over gatherings between competitors.  A few examples of agreements and collaboration that involve privacy issue are provided below.
In Dryden & Iyer’s dating app example, two competing dating apps hypothetically agree to forego monetization revenue in order to create a barrier to entry preventing new competitors from entering the market at sufficient scale to benefit from network effects in the markets they operate in.
As described above, privacy fixing can, like price fixing, be collusive activity which restricts competition among products and firms and would be condemned by antitrust laws on both sides of the Atlantic. Companies making agreements or arrangements with each other about information sharing, can similarly be guilty of illegal collusion to achieve anticompetitive outcomes.53  In Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1 (1945), the U.S. Supreme Court held that prohibitions on newspaper members of the Associated Press against sharing real-time events was an antitrust violation of the Sherman Act, even though the Associated Press had not achieved a complete monopoly.
Another potential method of privacy-fixing posited by Dryden & Iyer is collusion through an industry body, standards body, or trade body. Indeed, they argue that “the most likely target for a privacy fixing or predatory privacy claim might well be a standards-setting organization or trade association that tries to adopt a best privacy practice or a rule of ethics for an entire industry.”54
Standards bodies, sit within a kind of safe harbor from an antitrust perspective, generally regarded as beneficial or enabling different but complimentary activities to interoperate provided that the standards created are competitively neutral. If such bodies are used for collusion and are not involved in standards-creation or the standards are not competitively neutral, there could well be a breach of the antitrust laws.55
Google has, for example, stated publicly that its proposed changes to its browser, labelled the Privacy Sandbox, are being discussed in W3C groups.56 These proposals are arguably intended to allow Google to collect and process people’s personal data, on terms that it determines, but restrict or limit the accuracy and timeliness of the data provided to all of its advertising rivals. By impairing the interoperable data that smaller publishers rely on, Google inherently forces publishers and advertisers to become even more reliant on its own technology.
Cursory investigation reveals that such discussions are not taking place within standards-making groups of the W3C, but rather in business groups that do not have any standard-making capacity. Facilitation of exclusionary and anticompetitive abuse, as alleged by Texas v. Google via such a medium, is potentially made worse by the fact that the discussion involves all the major players in the industry.
While Facebook/Google coordination appears in the Texas case, Google/Apple coordination is at the center of USA v. Google. That case highlights cross-platform coordination between Apple and Google to an extent that has not previously been appreciated. It is well known that Google has been the exclusive provider of default search on all Apple devices for many years.57 It is also well known that Apple has been pursuing a walled-garden strategy of “there’s an app for that” – within its enclosure for many years. According to USA v. Google, Google has a bigger walled garden, containing more apps, and 90 percent of apps on Android are downloaded through Google Play.58   Although denied by Google, USA v. Google refers to emails and evidence that appear to show that Google and Apple jointly pursue profit maximization to their mutual benefit:
“120. Apple’s RSA incentivizes Apple to push more and more search traffic to Google and accommodate Google’s strategy of denying scale to rivals. For example, in 2018, Apple’s and Google’s CEOs met to discuss how the companies could work together to drive search revenue growth. After the 2018 meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.”59
The sentiment echoes the statements made by companies operating within more traditional cartels.60 Nevertheless, the fact that senior execs have met and discussed a range of topics and that one employee thinks the vision should be to work together as one company may not in itself be sufficient to support a claim for any anticompetitive collusion. If Google’s strategy is similar to Apple’s, and now Google is adopting browser changes to “encourage” publishers to become apps on its walled garden, that may not involve collusion or collaboration with Apple; it might simply be that they have independently worked out that reducing rival publishers’ access to interoperable data makes walled gardens more attractive to marketers, and that app stores provide more control over the market for web content and services.
Whether or not there is a coordinated strategy between Apple and Google, or Google is merely following Apple’s lead in making browser changes, may be a matter of further investigation in the DOJ case, and the Texas case, or if they are consolidated.61
This use of collusion in collective agreements or standards making is a third example of “privacy fixing” that the antitrust authorities should consider in relation on online digital markets.
 
Conclusions
As is clear from the above review, the antitrust considerations related to the misuse of data privacy policies are potentially very significant. As ever, much depends on the facts and the markets in question, and on the extent and degree of choice available to end users.
Antitrust regulation is built upon the notion that consumers ought to have sovereign choice in competitive markets, given this choice drives rivals to innovate to better meet those consumers’ differing needs. Societies are harmed when organizations conduct practices that significantly undermine these market forces, even when such organizations offer some countervailing benefit. Given the idea of consumer sovereignty is central to the operation of most antitrust laws, whether by individual monopolistic action or by agreement, the usurping of consumer choice is and should always be a concern for the authorities. In this article we have referred to three examples: exclusionary abuse, exploitative abuse, and collusion. All usurp consumer choice.
As digital markets are more and more important to society, maybe it is now time to add privacy to the list of other factors, such as prices, that are not a matter for legitimate discussion among competitors.

327,"January 24, 2021",United States v. Google – Implications of the Antitrust Lawsuit for Health Information,"


By Gregory Curfman (American Medical Association)
In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and 11 state attorneys general filed an astounding civil antitrust lawsuit against Google. The cause of action was that Google has created and maintained through anticompetitive strategies monopolies on general internet search and search advertising, in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The lawsuit has sparked wide interest since it is the first time that one of the major technology platforms has been the focus of antitrust action. This article explores the implications of the antitrust lawsuit for health information. Google’s internet search engine is used for a remarkable 1 billion health-related searches per day, constituting 7% of its total search traffic. Search results for health information are typically accompanied by advertisements that appear at the top of the page. This article presents arguments that Google maintains monopolies on online search for health information and advertising for health products. A single, dominant provider of online health information harms consumer welfare since it discourages innovation in internet search and may result in a biased spectrum of health information. The article discusses another recent lawsuit, Dinerstein v. Google, a health information privacy lawsuit, which provides a broad perspective on the vast quantity of personal health information to which Google has gained access. The article concludes with a presentation of possible antitrust remedies.

328,"January 24, 2021",Google Paying For News In Australia Is “Inevitable”  Says Treasurer,"


Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it’s “inevitable” that Google and other tech behemoths will have to eventually pay for using media content, responding to the internet giant’s threat to disable its search engine in the country if it’s forced to pay local publishers for news, reported Bloomberg.
Google stated Friday, January 22, that a proposed law, intended to compensate publishers for the value their stories generate for the company, is “unworkable,” opposing the requirement that media companies pay for displaying snippets of articles in search results.
As Google escalates a months-long standoff with the government, Frydenberg said Australia could either be a “world leader” in pushing for the code or wait to follow others in passing similar legislation.
“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if the legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said.
The threat is Google’s most potent yet as the digital giant tries to stem a flow of regulatory action worldwide, but such a radical step would hand an entire developed market to rivals. At least 94% of online searches in Australia go through the Alphabet unit, according to the local competition regulator. 
Still, Google’s market share puts the company in a position to boost revenue in other businesses to make up for higher costs.
“The company’s product lead in search over rivals such as Yahoo, Microsoft’s Bing and DuckDuckGo makes it unlikely that advertisers and publishers could move to competitor platforms for driving referral traffic in the near- to medium-term,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Matthew Martino. “The company could offset this by raising ad prices and by lowering traffic acquisition costs paid to mobile network carriers.”

329,"January 22, 2021",Google To Shut Down Search Engine In Australia If Forced To Pay For News,"


Google said on Friday it would block its search engine in Australia if the government proceeds with a new code that would force it and Facebook Inc to pay media companies for the right to use their content, reported Reuters.
Google’s threat escalates a battle with publishers such as News Corp that is being closely watched around the world. The search giant had warned that its 19 million Australian users would face degraded search and YouTube experiences if the new code were enforced.
Australia is on course to pass laws that would make tech giants negotiate payments with local publishers and broadcasters for content included in search results or news feeds. If they cannot strike a deal, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide the price.
“Coupled with the unmanageable financial and operational risk if this version of the Code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” Mel Silva, managing director for Australia and New Zealand, told a senate committee.

Google said Thursday it will pay French publishers for news content in a major digital copyright deal.
The agreement comes after several months of talks between Google France and the media groups, which are represented by France’s Alliance de la Presse d’Information Generale lobby.
Google said it would negotiate individual licenses with members of the alliance that cover related rights and open access to a new mobile service from the company called News Showcase.
Newspapers would be remunerated based on contributions to political and general information, daily volume of publications and monthly internet audience, Google said.
“After long months of negotiations, this agreement is an important step, which marks the effective recognition of the neighboring right of press publishers and the start of their remuneration by digital platforms for the use of their online publications,” Pierre Louette, CEO of the Les Echos newspaper, said in a statement Thursday.

Alphabet’s Google has asked a US judge in Texas to transfer an antitrust lawsuit filed by 10 states in December to a court in California, a state that has more relevant witnesses and documents needed by the company, reported Reuters.
In December, Texas and nine other states sued Google in a US court in Sherman, Texas, accusing the search engine company of working with Facebook in a way that violated antitrust law to boost its already-dominant online advertising business.
Google stated in a court filing that the first case alleging it monopolized online display advertising was filed in May by an advertiser, and that since then five other cases have been filed.
All were filed in the Northern District of California, “the venue where Google is headquartered and where more relevant witnesses and documents are located than in any other district in the country,” Google stated in its request to move the case, which was filed late on Tuesday, January 19.
Google added that the states’ lawsuit “does not identify a single company or person who might be a witness at trial and lives or works within 100 miles” of the Texas courthouse where the case was filed.

In Sunday’s blog post, Google’s Economic Policy Director Adam Cohen wrote that the company wanted to set the record straight and dispel myths about its open bidding process for advertising.
“AG Paxton tries to paint Google’s involvement in this industry as nefarious,” Cohen wrote. “The opposite is true.

Alphabet-owned Google could be hit by a third lawsuit by state attorneys general, this time over its management of the Play Store, Reuters reported on Friday, January 15, citing sources.
A lawsuit could be filed in February or March, the sources said. Aside from the state AG lawsuits, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) also filed a suit against the search giant last year. All the lawsuits accuse Google of abusing its dominance in search and antitrust violations.
Following more than 12 months of investigations into the four major tech platforms — Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple — the DOJ’s first suit was filed against Google over its search business and search advertising. Apple’s App Store is still under investigation by the US Justice Department over its policies. 
This latest Google probe will be headed by the attorneys general of Utah, North Carolina, and New York, one of the sources said. Other states are also expected to join the suit.
Google told Reuters that its Android operating system gives users and developers the option of using other app stores.
“Most Android devices ship with at least two app stores preinstalled, and consumers are able to install additional app stores,” Sameer Samat, vice president of Android and Google Play, said in a statement to the news outlet.
“This openness means that even if a developer and Google do not agree on business terms the developer can still distribute on the Android platform,” he told Reuters.
Some of the issues raised by the various lawsuits concern Google’s ban of apps with “objectionable content” and its requirement that some apps are forced to use the company’s payment tools. There have also been issues over Google’s commission, which can be as high as 30%.
Lawsuits against Google are focused on search, advertising, and its tactics to further its search dominance in voice assistants and other new markets.

Fortnite maker Epic Games has sued Apple and Google in the United Kingdom over its removal of the battle royale action game from its Apple App Store for iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad, and the Google Play Store for Android mobile devices, reported Yahoo.
In a filing with the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CTA), Epic claims that Apple is unfairly restricting competition from other app stores (the Apple App Store is the de facto space to buy apps and make in-app purchases), not allowing app developers to use their own payment processing services, and charging unfair fees on sales (Apple takes a cut of anywhere between 15-30% from all purchases).
While Epic alleges many of the same complaints against Google, alternate app stores and means of purchasing apps and content are allowed on Android devices outside of Google Play.
Epic is not seeking monetary damages (as highlighted in a statement below); instead, it is asking the CTA to compel both Apple and Google to reinstate Epic’s removed software and accounts, allow developers to use payment-processing systems in their apps (including their own) not owned by the platform owners, and let consumers download Epic’s software outside of the App Store and Google Play.

Alphabet-owned Google announced Thursday, January 14, it’s finally completed the acquisition of Fitbit, which was first announced in November 2019.
The deal had been subject to a months-long probe into whether it could further push Google’s market position in the online advertising business if it uses Fitbit data to help personalize ads.
Fitbit may help boost Google’s presence in the wearable market. While Google doesn’t build its own smartwatches or fitness trackers, it provides the software that’s used by other companies to build smartwatches. But they haven’t provided as much in-depth information for workouts, sleep, and other metrics that are important to people who want to improve their health, reported The Wall Street Journal.
“This deal has always been about devices, not data, and we’ve been clear since the beginning that we will protect Fitbit users’ privacy,” Google’s Senior Vice President of devices and services Rick Osterloh said in a statement.
“We worked with global regulators on an approach which safeguards consumers’ privacy expectations, including a series of binding commitments that confirm Fitbit users’ health and wellness data won’t be used for Google ads and this data will be separated from other Google ads data,” he added.

338,"January 10, 2021",UK Watchdog To Probe Google Chrome Changes Over Antitrust Concerns,"


Concerns continue to grow over Google’s plan to update the Chrome web browser, with the UK’s competition watchdog reportedly eyeing the issue of third-party cookies, in particular.
The UK’s Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) has begun an investigation to look at whether Google’s proposals would hurt publishers and give the Big Tech behemoth an even bigger piece of the online advertising pie, Reuters reported on Friday, January 8. Google’s plan would remove third-party cookies and other functions from the Chrome browser.
“As the CMA found in its recent market study, Google’s ‘Privacy Sandbox’ proposals will potentially have a very significant impact on publishers like newspapers, and the digital advertising market,” Andrea Coscelli, the UK regulator’s CEO, told Reuters.
Google argues the update, with its “Privacy Sandbox” feature, will help people to receive relevant ads without tracking users on an individual level.
However, the CMA stated, third-party cookies play an important role in online advertising by helping publishers, such as newspapers, pay for their free web content through targeted ads.
The CMA stated it had received complaints from Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), a coalition of technology and publishing companies, charging that Google’s proposals show a tendency for “abusing its dominant position” in online advertising.
However, the regulator acknowledged that cookies also raise privacy concerns for consumers — by allowing users to be tracked across the web in ways that many may feel uncomfortable with, not to mention difficult to understand.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened an investigation into Google’s proposals to remove third party cookies and other functionalities from its Chrome browser.
The investigation will assess whether the proposals could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors. It follows complaints of anticompetitive behavior and requests for the CMA to ensure that Google develops its proposals in a way that does not distort competition.
Third party cookies currently play a fundamental role online and in digital advertising. They help businesses target advertising effectively and fund free online content for consumers, such as newspapers. But there have also been concerns about their legality and use from a privacy perspective, as they allow consumers’ behavior to be tracked across the web in ways that many consumers may feel uncomfortable with and may find difficult to understand.
Google’s announced changes – known collectively as the “Privacy Sandbox” project – would disable third party cookies on the Chrome browser and Chromium browser engine and replace them with a new set of tools for targeting advertising and other functionality that they say will protect consumers’ privacy to a greater extent.

The mass exodus of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton‘s top staff over accusations of bribery against their former boss has left the Republican seeking $43 million in public funds to replace some of them with outside lawyers to lead a high-profile antitrust lawsuit against Google, reported NBC. 
Former Paxton aides told The Associated Press that before they reported him to the FBI in September and began resigning, the lawsuit against the search engine giant was set to be handled internally by what is one of the largest state attorney general’s offices in the US.
The outside lawyers’ contracts put a price tag on the fallout from Paxton’s deputies accusing him of crimes in the service of a wealthy donor who employs a woman with whom the attorney general allegedly had an extramarital affair. It remains to be seen how much taxpayers will ultimately shell out under the complex deals.“At the time I left, there was no intention of hiring outside counsel,” Jeff Mateer, Paxton’s former top lieutenant who resigned in October, told the AP.

341,"January 5, 2021",Too Big Not To Fail? Google’s Antitrust Woes,"


By Ronan Dunne & Philip Lee
As a staunch Trump ally, former Attorney General Bill Barr will be remembered for a lot of things. His role in the redaction, and then subsequent disclosure, of the Mueller report and his interventions in cases involving Trump associates spring to mind. However, perhaps his legacy will be something entirely different, with wider ramifications for citizens across the globe, far beyond the Washington political bubble.
Under Barr’s watch, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) initiated a major lawsuit against Google in October for alleged violations of US competition law. Announcing the action, Barr said this was “a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.”
The DoJ’s case has been taken in conjunction with 11 state Attorneys General (including the likes of Florida, Georgia and Texas). It is a civil antitrust lawsuit which alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies through anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets.
The significance of the DoJ’s action cannot be underestimated. Google is one of the wealthiest corporations on the planet with a market value of over US$1 trillion. In announcing the action, Barr threw down the gauntlet to Google saying the “lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google’s grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist.” He compared the lawsuit with the historic antitrust actions taken against AT&T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998.
Barr’s references to AT&T and Microsoft are significant. This is the first time that the US has initiated court action against a major tech company since Microsoft in the late 90s. While Microsoft was able to cut a deal that left its business intact, the same cannot be said for AT&T. The Bell System of companies, led by the Bell Telephone Company and later by AT&T, had dominated telephone services in the USA for over a century before it was broken up in the early 1980s as a direct consequence of the DoJ’s actions.
Could a similar fate befall Google? That is the great unknown at this stage. The DoJ has stated that “nothing is off the table”. But the litigation is likely to drag on for years at a minimum. A settlement may, ultimately, suit all parties. That’s unlikely to lead to a break-up of Google, though divestments of specific business functions cannot be ruled out. It is too early to tell how the chips will fall.
The action does, however, mark a turning of the tide against the US tech titans which, up until now, had seen antitrust action concentrated in Europe. The early years of the Trump administration were set against a backdrop of global trade wars and increasingly protectionist policies. The Google lawsuit reflects a clear departure from those days, in a direction that is only likely to continue under president-elect Joe Biden. Indeed, early December saw further lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and over forty states against Facebook. These proceedings accuse Facebook of buying up rivals to suppress competition. DoJ and FTC investigations into Amazon and Apple are also ongoing, reflecting the growing bipartisan support in the US for action against Big Tech.

342,"December 29, 2020",Why the Federal Government’s Antitrust Case Against Google Should—and Likely Will—Fail,"
By: Thom Lambert (Truth on the Market)
On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and eleven states with Republican attorneys general sued Google for monopolizing and attempting to monopolize the markets for general internet search services, search advertising, and “general search text” advertising (i.e., ads that resemble search results).  Last week, California joined the lawsuit, making it a bipartisan affair.
DOJ and the states (collectively, “the government”) allege that Google has used contractual arrangements to expand and cement its dominance in the relevant markets.  In particular, the government complains that Google has agreed to share search ad revenues in exchange for making Google Search the default search engine on various “search access points.” 
Google has entered such agreements with Apple (for search on iPhones and iPads), manufacturers of Android devices and the mobile service carriers that support them, and producers of web browsers.  Google is also pursuing default status on new internet-enabled consumer products, such as voice assistants and “smart” TVs, appliances, and wearables.  In the government’s telling, this all amounts to Google’s sharing of monopoly profits with firms that can ensure its continued monopoly by imposing search defaults that users are unlikely to alter.
There are several obvious weaknesses with the government’s case.  One is that preset internet defaults are super easy to change and, in other contexts, are regularly altered.  For example, while 88% of desktop and laptop computers use the Windows operating system, which defaults to a Microsoft browser (Internet Explorer or Edge), Google’s Chrome browser commands a 69% market share on desktops and laptops, compared to around 13% for Internet Explorer and Edge combined.  Changing a default search engine is as easy as changing a browser default—three simple steps on an iPhone!—and it seems consumers will change defaults they don’t actually prefer…

The Competition Commission of South Africa has conditionally approved the proposed merger whereby Google intends to acquire Fitbit. This is a global merger, notified in several jurisdictions, including the EU, USA, Australia, Canada, and Japan.
Google is active in a wide range of areas, including online search, online advertising, other online services such as YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail as well as cloud computing services. Google’s business in South Africa relates to the provision of local support and marketing services internally for Google. Google does not sell any wearable devices or hardware in South Africa. 
Fitbit develops, manufactures, and distributes wrist-worn wearable devices and smart scales as well as software and services designed to give its users tools to help them reach their health and fitness goals. The main Fitbit products available in South Africa are fitness trackers, smartwatches and the Fitbit mobile app.
The Commission found that the proposed transaction is likely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition.
Specifically, Google commits:
not to discriminate against any Wrist-Worn Wearable Device manufacturers by withholding, denying, or delaying access to the Android functionalities that Google generally makes available to other Android Smartphone App Developers for use with an Android App.Not to discriminate between Wrist-Worn Wearable Device manufacturers and other Android Smartphone App Developers in relation to changing, replacing, or retiring Android APIs.Not to discriminate between Wrist-Worn Wearable Device manufacturers and other Android Smartphone App Developers in terms of the access it provides to Developer Previews.Not to discriminate between Wrist-Worn Wearable Device manufacturers and other Android Smartphone App Developers in terms of the access it provides to Developer Documentation.

344,"December 22, 2020",Google Rejects DOJ Antitrust Suit Claims,"


Google is pushing back in court this week on antitrust claims brought against it by the Justice Department two months ago, reported The New York Times. In a legal filing with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Google denied or partially rejected almost 200 specific complaints against it. On only one count, that Google was a “founded in Menlo Park garage 22 years ago,” did the company side with the Justice Department.
The filing, a 42-page document, is a paragraph-by-paragraph — and sometimes sentence-by-sentence — denial of the claims made by the government and a group of states that have joined its lawsuit. In the filing, Google claims it “developed, continually innovated and promoted” its search product as part of its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
“People use Google Search because they choose to, not because they are forced to or because they cannot easily find alternative ways to search for information on the internet,” the company stated.
In October the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.

Facebook and Alphabet’s Google agreed to “cooperate and assist one another” in case of an investigation into their pact to work together in online advertising, the Wall Street Journal reported late on Monday.
The Journal report cited an unredacted version of a lawsuit filed by 10 states against Google last week.
The states accused Google of working with Facebook in an unlawful manner that violated antitrust law to boost its already-dominant online advertising business.
According to the report, the lawsuit claims that Google and Facebook were aware that their agreement could trigger antitrust investigations and discussed how to deal with them.
A Google spokesperson told the Journal that such agreements over antitrust threats are extremely common.
The unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which the Journal stated it had reviewed, also claimed that Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg signed the deal with Google. The draft version also cites an email in which Sandberg told Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and other executives that “this is a big deal strategically,” the report stated.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has announced that it will not accept a long-term behavioral undertaking offered by Google that sought to address competition concerns about its proposed acquisition of wearables supplier and manufacturer Fitbit.
The ACCC will therefore continue its investigation into Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit and has set a new decision date of March 25, 2021.
“The ACCC continues to have concerns that Google’s acquisition of Fitbit may result in Fitbit’s rivals, other than Apple, being squeezed out of the wearables market, as they are reliant on Google’s Android system and other Google services to make their devices work effectively,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. 
The proposed acquisition also further consolidates Google’s leading position in relation to the collection of user data, which supports its significant market power in online advertising and is likely to have applications in health markets.
“We are also continuing to investigate the acquisition’s potential impact on wearable operating systems. The acquisition may result in Google becoming the default provider of wearable operating systems for non-Apple devices and give it the ability to be a gatekeeper for wearables data, similar to the position it holds for smartphones which licence the Android operating system,” Mr Sims said.

Four private publishers filed two antitrust lawsuits against Google this week as the company comes under increasing scrutiny over its advertising and search practices, reported Fox News.
Dozens of state attorneys general and the Justice Department also filed two separate antitrust complaints, led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, respectively, against the tech giant on Thursday and Wednesday, December 17 & 16, respectively.
Sweepstakes Today is one of four companies that filed two private lawsuits, which Reuters published online, against Google, alleging that the tech giant has violated the Sherman Act by displaying monopolistic behavior through its digital ad sales.
“Publishers, including Sweepstakes Today, have seen their revenues decline significantly as Google uses their monopoly to horde more and more of the digital advertising revenues,” attorney John Herman of Herman Jones, who is representing Sweepstakes Today, told FOX Business in a statement.
He added that “the lawsuits by private litigants and the enforcement actions by the federal government and the majority of the states should put an end to these market abuses.”

By Damien Geradin, Dimitrios Katsifis & Theano Karanikioti (Geradin Partners)
Online advertising is what funds free online content. Since its birth in the 1990’s, it has evolved into a multi-billion-dollar industry. At the core of this industry lies the ability to identify and track users through various technical means, such as web cookies. Online tracking for advertising purposes has sparked privacy concerns, and is subject to a growing body of regulation across the world. But the most important rules seem to come from a handful of large technology platforms, namely Google and Apple. In their capacity as suppliers of the most popular browsers and smart mobile OSs, these companies are taking a series of measures in the name of user privacy that restrict the ability to identify users, thus shaking the very foundations of online advertising. In what is a first in a series of papers exploring Google and Apple’s role as de facto privacy regulators for online advertising, we propose to explore in detail Chrome’s decision to phase out support for third-party cookies, accompanied by a set of proposals known as the Privacy Sandbox. Considering that Google is the subject of growing antitrust scrutiny in the US and Europe, we query whether Chrome’s decision raises any antitrust concerns – and if so, how such concerns fit within existing antitrust investigations. At a conceptual level, we use this paper as an opportunity to reflect on the relationship between competition law and privacy and the trade-offs regulators may have to make.

A bipartisan group of 38 states sued Google Thursday, December 17, alleging broad antitrust violations in the online search market, reported CNBC. This is the third US case against the search giant in two months.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser led the group of 38 states and territories in the lawsuit, which claims Google illegally maintained a monopoly in general search and search advertising through anticompetitive conduct and contracts. Members of the executive committee leading the states also included Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. 
Weiser said at a press conference Thursday that the group would file a motion to consolidate the case with the Justice Department’s recent lawsuit against Google. 
Thursday’s suit followed a months-long investigation by attorneys general in Colorado, Nebraska, New York, and other states into whether Google abuses the market power of its dominant search business.
A press release announcing the new states lawsuit describes Google’s actions as a “multi-pronged effort to maintain its monopolies.”
Weiser said at the press conference the new suit goes beyond the DOJ’s by looking at how Google allegedly used exclusionary contracts to tie up emerging distribution channels that consumers use to access search engines, like smart speakers.
A group of ten Republican AGs sued Google on Wednesday, targeting its advertising technology business and an allegedly illegal deal with Facebook.

The deal had triggered criticism from privacy advocates on both sides of the Atlantic, consumer organizations, and Google rivals about the company’s market power and the use of people’s health data in targeted advertising.
Fitbit, once the leader in the wearable devices market, has lost market share to Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei in recent years.
The European Commission announced it had agreed upon concessions with Google, valid for 10 years with the possibility of another 10-year extension, addressing competition concerns, confirming a Reuters story in October.

A coalition of states is finishing an antitrust lawsuit against Google focused on its power in the online search market that could be filed as soon as Thursday, December 17, reported Business Insider.
The complaint, led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, is expected to allege that Google has altered the designs of its search engine to the disadvantage of rivals that offer specialized search results, two other people close to the investigation said.
That differs from the antitrust suit that the Justice Department filed against Google in October, with the support from 11 Republican state attorneys general. That complaint focused more narrowly on the exclusive contracts the company has signed with Apple, Mozilla, and manufacturers of Android-powered smartphones to set Google as the default search engine on their browsers and mobile devices. (California has since asked to join that suit.)
The Justice Department suit has led a burst of antitrust cases against some of Silicon Valley’s most titanic companies, including a suit that the Federal Trade Commission and dozens of states filed last week seeking a breakup of Facebook. Future state- and DOJ-led lawsuits targeting other aspects of Google’s ad-driven business are expected in the coming weeks and months.

California would be the first Democratic-led state to join the case. Mr. Becerra’s move could help placate Republican critics as he seeks confirmation next year as President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Some Republicans have griped privately about the lack of participation in the Justice Department’s Google case by Democratic attorneys general prior to the November 3 presidential election, saying it appears they didn’t want to support an initiative by a Republican-led Justice Department.

Britain’s competition watchdog stated that tailored rules should be used to regulate tech giants Google, Facebook, and others on Tuesday, December 8, reported Reuters.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that a legally binding code of conduct backed up by penalties that could extend to fines of up to 10% of turnover, as well as enhanced merger rules, should be set up in legislation.
The code will be enforced by a new Digital Markets Unit announced last month.
CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said consumers and businesses who relied on Google and Facebook should be treated fairly, with a level playing field for competitors.
“For that to happen, the UK needs new powers and a new approach,” he said on Tuesday. “In short, we need a modern regulatory regime that can enable innovation to thrive, while taking swift action to prevent problems.”
The CMA’s proposals are based on principles rather than rules or outcomes, tailored to different technologies, reported Reuters. 
The proposed rules focus on companies’ dominance in individual sectors, such as Google and Facebook in digital advertising. The two companies accounted for around 80% of £14 billion (US$18.7 billion) spent in 2019, the CMA stated.

362,"December 1, 2020","AMP It Up: As Its Antitrust Critics Grow Louder, Google Dials Back One of Its Most Controversial Policies","
By: Alex Petros (Public Knowledge)
Full disclosure: this blog post was not written with just the best prose and policy prescriptions in mind. There was something else I considered, something shared by everyone from the smallest of bloggers to the New York Times: how to optimize ranking in Google’s search algorithm. As Google is the dominant search engine that people use to navigate their web journeys, search result rankings can have profound consequences. Even the smallest tweaks to this secret sauce algorithm can determine whether this post will be seen by an audience beyond my coworkers, family, and friends—or (perhaps more importantly) if your local newspaper gets the ad revenue needed to stay afloat. Google’s latest tweak, one to its AMP framework, is a step in the right competitive direction, and perhaps a sign that the heightened antitrust scrutiny against the company is already having an effect.
AMP Explained
In case you’re not a voracious reader of the Google Webmaster Central Blog, you might be wondering what AMP is. AMP, or “accelerated mobile pages,” is basically an HTML framework that allows web pages to load faster. Originally developed and still functionally controlled by Google, web publishers can build in AMP code to their web pages. Then Google stores a cached version of the page on its servers and pre-downloads it to your device for faster display after an end user—that’s you!—first clicks on a link.
However, the faster loading times come at a cost, as outlined by the News Media Alliance in a recent white paper. AMP pages keep users on Google’s web ecosystem, allowing Google to continue extracting data from users who otherwise would have moved on to a full third-party site, “further reinforcing Google’s dominance of the Web.” Publishers also cede control to Google of some aspects of their page layout, as well as the number and type of ads they can show. There’s also technical duplication in making AMP versions of all of the web pages in one’s domain, a burden that falls especially heavily on small, local newspapers—whose newsrooms are already hemorrhaging reporters—without a web engineer on staff. Online advertising is increasingly their only financial lifeline, and AMP routes more of that process through Google.

363,"November 30, 2020",The Google Complaint: A Step Backward for Antitrust Policy,"

By Jay Ezrielev (Elevecon)1
 
The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and eleven states filed their Complaint against Google, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct to maintain and extend monopolies in search and search advertising. Although the Complaint alleges anticompetitive exclusion, its theory is ultimately grounded in mere harm to competitors. The Complaint seeks relief that is likely to harm consumers, hinder innovation, and distort the competitive process. The Complaint’s focus on harm to competitors rather than competition is a step backward for antitrust policy. Perhaps even more importantly, the Complaint will generate further uncertainty about antitrust standards for unilateral conduct in markets across the economy, leaving many companies to question whether antitrust enforcers would condemn vigorous competitive conduct as anticompetitive.
 
The Complaint
The Complaint accuses Google of maintaining and extending monopolies in search and search advertising by paying original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), web browsers, and wireless service providers to install Google search as the default search engine on “search access points” controlled by these entities. The Complaint alleges that installing Google as the default search engine gives Google “de facto exclusivity.” The Complaint also alleges that scale is “of critical importance to competition among general search engines” and that Google’s conduct to obtain default status at search access points has “foreclosed competition for internet search” and denied “vital distribution, scale, and product recognition” to Google’s general search engine competitors.
Notably, the Complaint does not allege that Google’s payments for default status at search access points sacrificed short-term profits to hobble competitors. Instead, the Complaint argues that paying for default status increases Google’s “valuable scale” and “simultaneously denies that scale to rivals.” The Complaint contends that no other search engine competitor can match Google’s bids to obtain default status because “of the longtime deprivation of scale” for these competitors, which leads them to be unable to match Google’s “mix of quality, brand recognition, and economics.”
 
Are Search Engine Defaults Anticompetitive?
The Complaint’s allegation of Google’s de facto exclusivity at search access points is central to the Complaint’s case. Google may dispute this allegation. After all, if a user prefers another search engine to Google, changing a search engine default is not very difficult. Search engines also assist users in changing defaults. Moreover, users can access alternative search engines directly by going to “bing.com” or to “duckduckgo.com” in their browsers. But even if one were to accept the Complaint’s characterization of search engine defaults as leading to de facto exclusivity, the Complaint offers no compelling basis for concluding that installing Google search as the default search engine at search access points had a significant anticompetitive effect.
A default is a user convenience. It saves users the time and effort of selecting options, but also leaves them the flexibility to customize their systems through selecting alternative options. Defaults are especially convenient for users if they reflect the users’ preferences. Installing Google as the default search engine is convenient for users who prefer Google to other search engines or are indifferent between search engines. The Complaint argues that users rarely change search engine defaults and that search defaults on mobile devices are “especially sticky.” However, the lack of switching from Google to other defaults may simply be a reflection of users’ preference for Google search rather than any resistance to switching defaults.
The Complaint does not argue that installing Google as the default search engine is inconsistent with user preferences. On the contrary, the Complaint suggests that Google may offer better searches than its competitors because of Google’s greater scale. Presetting another search engine as a default at search access points may benefit that search engine, but may harm the consumers of search. If a user prefers Google to other search engines, then presetting another search engine as the default would either force the user to spend the time and effort to change the default or relegate the user to a less preferred search engine because of user inertia. The Complaint offers no evidence to suggest that forcing users to choose a search engine for their searches would result in significantly more search scale for Google’s competitors.
 
The Complaint Seeks Relief That Would Harm Distributors and Consumers
The Complaint seeks relief that would enjoin Google from paying for default status at search access points. The Complaint refers to such payments as “exclusionary payoffs.” Enjoining Google from paying for default status would deny compensation to OEMs, wireless service providers, and browsers for use of their proprietary assets in distributing search services. This relief would effectively infringe the distributors’ property rights.
Although enjoining Google from paying for default status may benefit Google’s search engine competitors by making it easier for them to obtain default status at search access points, doing so would likely harm the consumers of products and services from OEMs, wireless service providers, and browsers. Rather than harming competition, Google’s payments for default status intensify competition among the distributors of search services. The Complaint alleges that Google pays Apple in excess of $8 billion each year for search default status on Apple devices, accounting for between 15 and 20 percent of Apple’s worldwide net income. The Complaint also alleges that Google pays billions of dollars to other owners of search access points, including other OEMs, wireless service provides, and browsers. These payments are structured as revenue sharing agreements, under which Google pays the distributors a percentage of search advertising revenue for searches conducted through the distributors’ search access points. The revenue sharing agreements effectively reduce the distributors’ marginal costs of serving users and provide direct incentives for OEMs, wireless service providers, and browsers, to compete for new users by reducing prices and investing in innovation. Google’s payments under the revenue sharing agreements thus pass through to consumers in significant part through lower prices and greater innovation. Enjoining Google from paying for default status would deny users these significant procompetitive benefits of lower prices and greater innovation by OEMs, wireless service providers, and browsers.
 
The Complaint Seeks Relief That Would Interfere With the Normal Competitive Process
Enjoining Google from bidding to obtain default status at search access points would interfere with the normal competitive process, potentially leading to inefficient allocation of default status and harm to consumers. Securing distribution channels to reach end-users is a common element of competition, and it is normal for distributors to receive compensation for providing distribution services.
Default status is a scarce resource because there is at most one default search engine for any given search. Multiple search engines may wish to be installed as the default search engine at a search access point, but only one can be selected for any given search. Bidding to secure default status is an effective market mechanism for balancing the supply and demand of default status at search access points.
Paying to obtain default status at search access points is similar to other market mechanisms for the allocation of scarce resources. For example, firms pay to show their commercials on cable networks’ 30 second slots, where the slots can only show one commercial at a time to any given viewer. The practice of paying to use scarce resources is ubiquitous in business. Firms hire talented engineers and scientists, lease retail and office space, lease production facilities, and lease supercomputing resources. A firm’s use of these resources precludes other firms from using the resources. Search engines’ payments for default status are substantially similar to these other procompetitive business practices.
Bidding to obtain default status (by offering compensation to distributors of search services) is also likely to lead to an efficient allocation of default status among search engines. The efficient allocation of a resource is one that generates the greatest value from its use. For the choice of a default search engine, this value reflects the value to consumers of having their preferred search engine set as default, as well as the value to search engines from gaining additional scale, which the search engines can use to improve their products and services. What the search engines are willing to bid for default status incorporates their value of gaining additional scale from the default status. Under a competitive bidding process, the distributor chooses the search engine default based on search engines’ bids and the preferences of the distributor’s customers. When the competitive process functions properly, the distributors’ choice of default search engine likely yields an efficient allocation of default status.
The Complaint offers no credible basis for claiming that paying for default status at search access points harms the competitive process. It does not allege any anomalies in Google’s bids to obtain default status. The Complaint does not allege that Google sacrificed short-term profit to hobble competitors or that it somehow inhibited the ability of its search engine competitors to bid for default status.
Some may argue that there is a potential benefit to interfering with the competitive process for the acquisition of default status if doing so results in greater scale for Google’s search engine competitors. The Complaint suggests that greater search scale for these search engines would cause them to be more effective competitors to Google. However, such a shift in search scale from Google to other search engines (as a result of enjoining Google from paying for default status) may actually harm consumers. Shifting scale from Google to other search engines would reduce Google’s scale, which may prevent Google from achieving some further improvements in search quality. Because Google conducts far more searches than its competitors, the loss of quality improvements for Google searches may be more impactful than any benefit in search quality improvements for other search engines. Shifting searches from Google to competing search engines by imposing alternative defaults may also harm consumers if the consumers prefer Google to other search engines.
 
Uncertainty About Antitrust Policy
The Complaint does not articulate clear principles for determining when unilateral conduct crosses the line from being vigorous competition to being anticompetitive. The Complaint raises many important questions about antitrust policy in markets with significant scale effects. In the view of the DOJ and the eleven states, how could Google lawfully compete for default status?  What are the rules of conduct when it comes to going after users in a market with scale effects? Should Google have avoided paying for default status? Should Google have avoided bidding to be the default search engine? Should Google have bid on only some default opportunities at search access points? Should Google have bid less aggressively? Should Google have been more accommodating to other search engines so as to allow them to gain greater scale? The Complaint does not answer these questions, leaving market participants not knowing exactly what conduct would raise concerns for antitrust enforcers.
Uncertainty about the rules of conduct is never a good thing. Companies may see the Complaint as sending a message that competing hard would increase antitrust risks and being accommodating to competitors would mitigate the risks. Such a message discourages robust competition to the detriment of consumers.

364,"November 30, 2020",DOJ Preps Antitrust Suits Against Facebook & Google: Report,"


According to The Wall Street Journal, both federal and state antitrust authorities will be filing new lawsuits against Google and Facebook. This would mark the first time that Facebook has been sued by the government on antitrust grounds.
According to the report, the authorities are readying as many as four more cases targeting Google or Facebook by the end of January, the people said, following the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google last month.
According to the WSJ, federal and state officials are probing whether the tech giants abused their power in the internet economy; Google to dominate search and advertising, and Facebook to dominate social media.
A potential case against Facebook would likely delve into whether the company abuses its position to stifle competition or puts user data at risk the former claim will likely take a close look at the company’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.
If Facebook were to be sued, it would mark the first government antitrust action against the social-media titan in the US. Facebook has come under particular criticism from Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking consultation on a court-enforceable undertaking submitted by Google in relation to its pending acquisition of FitBit.
Under the proposed undertaking, Google has offered to not use certain user data collected through Fitbit and Google wearables for Google’s advertising purposes for 10 years. The search giant has also proposed that this ban could be extended by a further 10 years if the ACCC deems it to be appropriate.  
Google would also have to provide third parties, such as health and fitness apps, with access to certain user data collected through Fitbit and Google wearable devices for 10 years as well as maintain levels of interoperability between third party wearables and Android smartphones for 10 years to fulfil the undertaking. 
In announcing the ACCC was seeking views from the Australian public, the watchdog’s chair Rod Sims clarified that the consultation did not mean the undertaking and acquisition would be approved in Australia. 
“Our decision to begin consultation should not be interpreted as a signal that the ACCC will ultimately accept the undertaking and approve the transaction,” he said. “Feedback from interested parties will assist us to decide whether the behavioural remedy proposed is capable of addressing our competition concerns regarding this transaction.”

Australia’s mandatory news code no longer excludes the ABC and SBS from receiving payments from Google and Facebook for using their content, reported the Guardian.
The addition of the public broadcasters is one of the significant changes treasurer Josh Frydenberg has made to the draft mandatory news code before it is tabled in parliament by 10 December 10.
Labor, the Greens, and several crossbenchers suggested the ABC and SBS should be added to the ranks of Australian news publishers to benefit from the code, in the interests of helping gain broad cross-party support for the legislation.
When he announced the draft code, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, said the ABC and SBS were excluded because they were taxpayer-funded.
If passed, the legislation would force Google and Facebook to share revenue from news links with Nine Entertainment, News Corp, and any other eligible media companies including Guardian Australia, or pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.

An alliance of British businesses that is campaigning to stop Google from allegedly controlling the open Web, has asked the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to delay the release of new search technology, reported the Financial Times.
In a statement, Marketers for an Open Web (MOW) stated that if Google was allowed to release its so-called Privacy Sandbox technology, it would frustrate efforts by regulators around the globe to ensure that there was fair competition on the Internet.
The sandbox would remove login, advertising, and other features from the open Web and place them under Google’s control, MOW alleged.
In the event that MOW succeeds, it would mark the first time that the CMA has used its powers to challenge online platforms’ growing control of the Internet.

By Thomas Hoppner (Technical University Wildau)
On 27 July 2017, the European Commission adopted a decision finding that, between January 2008 and 27 July 2017, Google infringed Article 102 TFEU by positioning and displaying more favorably, its own comparison shopping service (compared to competing comparison shopping services) in the general search results pages of its search service “Google Search”.
This study assesses whether the measures taken by Google since the Decision conform with the obligations imposed by the Decision’s operative part. The study is based upon empirical data (for example, data covering consumer traffic, conversions, revenues and customer reactions) provided by 25 European comparison shopping services operating in 21 European markets , including the market leaders in 7 of the 13 commercially most relevant countries . Such services have combined their data for a representative economic and legal market analysis of the implications of Google’s chosen compliance mechanism.
Following an executive summary, as well as a summary in 13 illustrations with corresponding explanations, the main analysis will first outline the core elements of the Decision (Chapter 1) before explaining the measures that Google implemented to remedy the abuse (Chapter 2). The central assessment then follows in Chapter 3, examining the economic impact of Google’s chosen compliance mechanism and in Chapter 4, examining the mechanism’s compliance with the Decision.

By Erik Sherman, Forbes
While companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon become ever-larger behemoths and make up double-digit portions of the S&P 500 index, politicians on both sides of the fence have been using the dreaded R-word: regulation.
A recent Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit targeting Google, with attorneys general of 11 red states and a number of blue states considering joining, is just one example.
Democrats and Republicans, who had distinct areas of criticism of big tech companies like Google and Facebook, have moved back and forth across the lines. It’s tough to tell where anyone stands without a digitally updated score card. But “break up Big Tech” has become a fixture in public debate.
That leaves industry-watchers wondering whether lawsuits and other regulatory actions have any chance of making a difference, and if the government can realistically hope to win.

The lawsuit is separate from a widely anticipated Texas antitrust action that could also come before the end of the year, according to two people briefed on the matter.
The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google in October, and this group of states has stated it planned to combine its case with the government’s. The states are Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah.
One source said the states planned to file the lawsuit in federal court in mid to late December while the second said the target date was December 15.
The group has had an expansive probe underway into Google’s businesses, including Android. No final decisions had been made regarding what would be included in the lawsuit, a third source said.

Britain’s competition regulator stated on Monday, November 23, it had received a complaint about Google related to its market study this year on online platforms and digital advertising.
The complaint from a coalition of technology and publishing called Marketers for an Open Web (MOW) stated they wanted the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to delay the launch of Google’s so-called Privacy Sandbox technology.
The group stated the changes will curb members’ ability to gather information on web users, which helps them offer more valuable advertising. It’s urging the CMA to use its power to protect smaller media companies at risk of losing as much as 75% of their revenue, reported Bloomberg.
“We take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act,” the CMA said in a statement.
Google stated the ad-supported web was “at risk if digital advertising practices don’t evolve to reflect people’s changing expectations around how data is collected and used.”
“That’s why Google introduced the privacy sandbox, an open initiative built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers,” the company said in a statement.

Big tech companies stated that confidential material they provided for the US government’s antitrust probe of Google should not be shared with the search giant’s in-house lawyers because the information is too sensitive, reported the Los Angeles Times. 
In a filing Friday in federal court in Washington, Apple said it gave the US Justice Department “competitively sensitive” documents and that allowing lawyers inside Google to see the information would result in “material harm” to Apple. A similar joint filing was made by Amazon, AT&T., Microsoft, Oracle, Comcast, Sonos, Duck Duck Go and T-Mobile.
Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google, alleging abuse of its power to thwart competition. The Justice Department and Google have clashed over the extent of access to information collected by the government before it sued. The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, has yet to rule on the issue.
The Justice Department has proposed allowing companies that provided information to designate their most sensitive documents as “highly confidential,” which would prevent access by Google’s in-house lawyers, according to court papers. The US argues that allowing the search giant to see the proprietary information would give Google even more power in the market than it already has.
“Disclosure of this information to Google would directly implicate future business dealings between Apple and Google, provide Google with a substantial advantage over Apple in negotiations, and potentially disadvantage competitor search engines that negotiate with Apple and other software providers,” Apple stated.

A lawyer for Google asked the federal government for a faster release of the documents it used to draft its antitrust case against the tech giant, Reuters reported.
With Google scrambling to file a response to the government’s case by Dec. 21, an attorney for the tech giant said it needs access to the material quickly in order to draft its defense, according to Reuters.
On Oct. 20, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against Google, arguing the tech company used “anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in search and search advertising,” the department noted in a press release.“We need to get access to that material,” said Google attorney John Schmidtlein in a status conference held by phone, per Reuters. “We need to know more about the contours of that material.”Responding to Google’s request, Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seemed inclined to grant Google’s wish, or to at least part of it, Reuters reported. In particular, Mehta asked the DOJ, through one of its attorneys, whether the government’s legal team could provide Google with a list of companies that had provided information for the case.In addition, Mehta also asked the government to disclose how much information each company gave, and to make copies for Google as requested, Reuters reported. All told, it would amount to a list of 100 witnesses.“It seems like you’re going to have a pretty good window into the government’s case,” the judge said, according to Reuters.

Judge Mehta, who is overseeing the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit against Google said he hoped to set an initial schedule for the case in December, reported the Wall Street Journal.
During a brief telephone hearing Wednesday, November 18, US District Judge Amit Mehta said he wanted to hammer out a schedule with both sides before the holidays so that Google and the government could begin the process of legal discovery, gathering information, and exchanging materials about evidence that may be presented at trial.
The DOJ sued Google on October 20, alleging the company uses anticompetitive tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business. The company denies the allegations, claiming it holds its market position because users like its products and services.
Google lawyer John Schmidtlein said Wednesday that the search giant needed more information quickly about the materials the Justice Department has already gathered during its more than yearlong investigation, especially what was produced to the government by third-party companies. Until Google has that information, it will have a hard time committing to how much time it will need to prepare its defense, Mr. Schmidtlein said.

“In a serious monopolization action like this one, it’s important that a breakup remedy be on the table,” she said.

She also made clear that Congress needs to take action to ensure robust antitrust enforcement. She said a number of Supreme Court cases have made it more difficult for the government to succeed in antitrust challenges, leaving it up to lawmakers to reset expectations in the courts.
“If anyone’s waiting on the courts to solve our monopoly problem, that’s going to take a really long time,” Klobuchar said. “We need to update our laws. We really don’t have another choice besides increasing enforcement.”

A group of 165 companies and industry associations, from the US and UK as well as 21 European Union (EU) countries, sent a letter to antitrust regulators asking that they throw the book at Google as fast as possible, according to a Reuters statement on Thursday, November 12.
The joint letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager was from 135 companies offering online services plus 30 industry associations. The group criticized Google for favoring its own services, including preferential search placement, and asked Vestager for fast action. 
The group said it is the biggest collaboration to write to EU antitrust regulators urging a fast response. The letter was seen by Reuters, and signers included Yelp, Expedia, Trivago, Kelkoo, Stepstone, and Foundem.
“While we compete amongst ourselves for the best consumer experience, there is one common competitor that does not compete fairly, Google,” the letter stated, according to Reuters.
“Google gained unjustified advantages through preferentially treating its own services within its general search results pages by displaying various forms of grouped specialized search results (so-called OneBoxes),” it added.
Google denies the assertions and has stated that its users have freedom to choose any search engine they want.
“People expect Google to give them the most relevant, high quality search results that they can trust,” a Google representative told Reuters. “They do not expect us to preference specific companies or commercial rivals over others, or to stop launching helpful services which create more choice and competition for Europeans.”

Yelp Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman has long been convinced that Google has a monopoly in the internet search market and said a recent US antitrust case against the company validates his position, reported Bloomberg.
“We’re very encouraged by that,” Stoppelman said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Wednesday, November 11. “Google has behaved illegally and has leveraged its monopoly in ways that are destructive to innovation and competition. It’s bad for consumers, bad for small business owners.”
Yelp, a local search provider that collects reviews of restaurants, shops and services, claims Alphabet’s Google, which controls about 90% of the online search market, abuses its position by putting its own reviews higher in search results than those of its rivals.
“They’ve really tried to maximize the revenue and in doing so have put the consumer in the back seat,” Stoppelman said. “There’s no organic content anymore.”
Google Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker has argued that people use Google search “because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives.”
Yelp and other small businesses faced a moment of “terror” in the early months of the pandemic, Stoppelman said, as cities shut down and people stayed indoors. But by the third quarter, Yelp reported sales that beat analysts’ estimates.
“We certainly took a pretty big hit in advertising dollars that people paused,” he said. But “looking at Yelp’s performance in the third quarter, we’ve really come back, in a big way, faster than even we were hoping for.”

By: Heather Kelly (Washington Post)
Whether you want to look up facts about the moon or find the lowest prices on sweatpants, Google’s search engine is unavoidable. That’s a problem for consumers, said the U.S. government in a new, long-awaited antitrust lawsuit filed against the company Tuesday.
In the 64-page complaint, the Justice Department lays out its case against Google’s alleged search monopoly by focusing on one part of its business. It looks at all the deals Google has struck to be the path of least resistance for most consumers. Years of partnering with other companies, expanding its own line of products and user complacency have made it the default search engine on everything from our laptops to smartwatches.
Here are five interesting takeaways from the lawsuit.
Google’s search competitors aren’t very competitive
Google has a search monopoly, the lawsuit asserts, because it has 88 percent of the search market in the United States. According to the complaint, there are only three other search providers worth mentioning: Bing, Yahoo and the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo…

By: Johannes Persch (D’Kart)
The DOJ begins the lawsuit with a brief overview of Google – from a scrappy start-up to a monopoly gatekeeper with a market value of over one trillion dollars (para 1). Then it explains where search engines are used: On the computer or – more and more – on the mobile phone. So far, no surprises. It only gets more exciting afterwards: the most effective means of distribution for a search engine is to be set as the standard search engine – defaults are sticky. Although users could theoretically download another search engine app or change the default search engine, most users would simply not do this. The default search engine enjoys de facto exclusivity (para 3). Google has made itself the sole beneficiary of this consumer inertia through a system of exclusivity agreements and billions of dollars in payments to smartphone manufacturers, mobile operators and browser developers: Google is set as the default virtually everywhere (paras 2-6). This is followed by a few paragraphs on how this behavior creates barriers to market entry and inhibits innovation (paras 7-9): operating a search engine is not only enormously expensive, but also depends on economies of scale with the available data. Google’s practice prevents other search engines from achieving sufficient economies of scale to compete with Google: They lack (scaled) access to users, advertisers and data.
Looking to the future, Google is in the process of applying the same practice to the next generation of electronic devices, i.e. smart speakers, intelligent vehicles, etc. (para 12). The internet of things is thus the next area that could fall prey to Google.
The protection of consumers, advertisers and all companies in the internet industry requires that Google’s behavior be stopped (para 13). Here the action even includes – still rather unusual for American antitrust practice – the keyword data protection…

According to CNN, the hearing came less than a week before the US election and as social media companies have been bracing for an onslaught of misinformation. In recent days, Facebook and Twitter have both taken action to slow the spread of some content, bringing about allegations of bias, censorship, and even election interference.
Sen. Roger Wicker opened Wednesday’s hearing by slamming the tech companies for an “apparent double standard” that disadvantages conservative content on social media. Wicker said that Section 230, which shields tech companies from litigation over their content moderation decisions, must be changed. “The time has come for that free pass to end,” he said. 
Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said she hoped Wednesday’s hearing would not cause a “chilling effect” on tech companies’ efforts to reduce misinformation, particularly around the election and COVID-19.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company approaches its work without political bias, “full stop.” 
“To do otherwise would be contrary to both our business interests and our mission, which compels us to make information accessible to every type of person, no matter where they live or what they believe,” Pichai said.

391,"October 28, 2020",Apple Is Creating A Google Search Alternative Amid Antitrust Scrutiny,"


Apple is intensifying long-standing efforts to beat Google at its own game by building its own rival search engine technology, the Financial Times report.
This comes as US antitrust regulators hone in on the search engine giant for allegedly abusing its dominant market position and deals with other big players like Apple.
In the latest version of the iPhone operating system, iOS 14, Apple bolstered its own search capabilities with little fanfare, the Financial Times reports.
The change went largely unnoticed, and included displaying its own search results and linking to websites directly, rather than through another engine, when users typed queries from their home screens.
While the iPhone’s default search engine, Google, pays US$8-12 billion a year for the privilege in a deal US antitrust regulators are investigating remains unchanged, the FT reported the change is “an important advance” that “could form the foundation of a fuller attack on Google,” according to several people in the industry.
Apple and Google are both fighting antitrust battles right now that could potentially reshape the digital landscape as we know it. The US Department of Justice sued Google last week for alleged antitrust violations following a 16-month investigation into the practices of big tech companies. The investigation included its multi-billion deal with Apple to ensure Google remains the default search engine on the iPhone.

Italian regulators opened an investigation Wednesday, October 28, into Google over alleged abuse of its dominant role in the country’s online ad market, adding to the global scrutiny that the Silicon Valley company is facing, reported Reuters.
The investigation follows a complaint filed by Italian digital advertising lobby group IAB last year and will have to be completed by November 2021, adding to regulatory scrutiny of the Silicon Valley tech giant around the world.
In a press release announcing the action the AGCM stated it “questions the discriminatory use of the huge amount of data collected through its various applications, preventing rivals from competing effectively as well as adversely affecting consumers.”
“At the same time, Google has allegedly used tracking elements enabling its advertising intermediation services to achieve a targeting capability that some equally efficient competitors are unable to replicate,” it added.
The watchdog stated it suspects Google of using enormous amounts of data collected through its own applications to prevent rival operators from competing effectively, adding that it carried out inspections of some Google offices on Tuesday.
The Italian online advertising market was worth revenue of €3.3 billion (US$3.88 billion ) last year, with display advertising, such as banner ads, accounting for nearly 37%, sector data showed.

Some Senate Democrats are seeking to enable regulators to protect local news outlets, accusing tech giants such as Google and Facebook of “unfair business practices,” according to a new report by members of a key committee that will hear from the top industry executives this week, reported Wall Street Journal.
Released on the eve of the Senate Commerce Committee’s hearing on Wednesday, October 28, with the chief executives of Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the report argues that local journalism is in a crisis, badly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic—partly because of alleged anticompetitive behavior on the part of the tech platforms that ought to be policed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
“They are facing unfair practices,” Sen. Maria Cantwell (Democrat – Washington), the ranking member on the committee, said in an interview. “We think Congress and the FTC should address those unfair practices.”
A Google spokeswoman said the report “distorts the reality around Google’s role in the online news ecosystem and the value that we provide to publishers who face challenges in transitioning to the digital world.”

Australia’s consumer regulator is sharpening its focus on big tech, warning platform giants are pervasively tracking the nation’s users and dominating the local online advertising markets in its first major update since its landmark Digital Platforms inquiry.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) late last week released its first six-monthly report on digital platform services, oversight set up as part of the government’s response to the 2019 Digital Platforms Inquiry, which uncovered systematic problems including the two market leaders Facebook and Google having become “unavoidable trading partners.”
The digital duopoly now take more than 80% of online advertising spend in Australia, according to the regulator.
In the first follow up report, the ACCC examines some of the competition and consumer issues with online private messaging services as well as updating its previous findings on social media and online search services, including commissioning its own research on the Australian market.
The regulator identifies an increasingly dominant market position of Facebook and Google and the endemic tracking of Australians online as threats to competition and consumers.

398,"October 26, 2020",Possible Problems in the Google Case,"

By Gregory J. Werden & Luke M. Froeb1
 
Google invented neither the search engine nor the Internet browser, but it made them better. Competing on the merits, Google overcame Microsoft’s substantial incumbency advantages and displaced it as the dominant incumbent. At a cost of billions of dollars each year, Google provides and improves services that make it the third most trusted brand in American (behind the United States Postal Service and Amazon). To give up all on-line search and maps, the median American (in 2017) must be paid $21,178 per year.
The complaint filed by the Department of Justice and 11 states echoes the Microsoft case by alleging that Google has monopoly positions in search and search advertising which Google protects with anticompetitive tactics. The complaint has been criticized for not going further, but it states a case that seeks to take advantage of a causation standard for monopoly maintenance so low that the D.C. Circuit’s liability opinion in Microsoft described it as “edentulous.” Even so, Judge Mehta could get hung up on some points.
The complaint stresses the inability of small rivals to compete because they lack scale, and it alleges that Google’s practices block small rivals from achieving scale. But the complaint does not allege that Google’s small rivals had a plausible path to obtaining scale in the absence of all the challenged practices. If every computer and mobile device were preloaded with every search engine and browser, the vast majority of users likely would choose Google’s search engine and browser.
Among other things, the complaint alleges that Google pays makers of mobile devices and mobile service providers to promote usage of Google search. A striking allegation in the complaint is that Apple charges Google $8-12 billion per year to use its search engine. One might wonder whether Apple is the real gatekeeper and Google is just paying the price of admission.
The foundational allegation of the complaint is that “For both mobile and computer search access points, being preset as the default is the most effective way for general search engines to reach users, develop scale or remain competitive.” And the complaint acknowledges that Microsoft takes advantage of its monopoly in PC operating systems to promote its Edge browser and Bing search engine. Yet statcounter reports that Google has an 81.5 percent share in U.S. desktop search engines, while Bing has just a 12.1 percent share. Being preset as a default either does confer a big advantage on Bing, or Google overcomes that advantage through competition on the merits.
The obvious remedy would bar Google from buying distribution. The big loser could be Apple, and the loss of Google’s payments would act like a cost increase throughout the mobile device supply chain, so consumer prices likely would rise. Microsoft stands to benefit significantly, as it has the second most popular search engine and browser. The impact on Google is least clear, but it could come out ahead: Google could save billions of dollars a year in payments yet experience only a modest decline in usage.
The complaint asserts that “Google’s practices are anticompetitive under long-established antitrust law,” but antitrust law has not come to grips with monopolies in free services. An earlier monopoly claim against Google brought by KinderStart.com was dismissed, in part, on the basis that free Internet search could not be a monopoly under antitrust law. But conventional antitrust principles can be applied to free search with careful modification to account for monetization through advertising.
The complaint misapprehends application of the hypothetical monopolist test (“HMT”) to free search. The HMT made market delineation into a market power inquiry. Because market power normally is exercised by raising prices, the HMT asks whether a profit-maximizing monopolist would raise price, or perhaps whether an actual monopolist already did. Although a search monopolist would maximize profits by charging monopoly prices for advertising, the complaint omits the profit maximization and alleges that a hypothetical monopolist “would be able to maintain quality below the level that would prevail in a competitive market.”
A curious aspect of the government’s complaint is the public bemoaning of the fact that Google instructed employees not to use language that the government otherwise would have quoted. Antitrust plaintiffs love to invite the inference of anticompetitive motivation from small snippets taken from memos and emails. But the government cannot be inviting the inference of anticompetitive motivation from the absence of the usual snippets, so what is the point?
It also is unclear what the government hopes to achieve. History suggests that, no matter what is accomplished, the Biden Administration can be accused of selling out the American people in the 2024 election campaign. As President, William Howard Taft presided over the breakups of American Tobacco and Standard Oil in 1911. In the 1912 presidential election campaign, both Wilson and Roosevelt lambasted Taft for selling out the American people, and Taft got just 8 electoral votes (compared to 321 in 1908).
While any remedy is unlikely to satisfy the public, any rationale in the liability ruling is unlikely to satisfy the antitrust bar. In the platform context, legitimate competitive practices can look like illegitimate anticompetitive practices because network expansion lowers cost and improves quality. According to the complaint, Google increases the quality of it services by enlarging its user base and the best way to do that is through the sort of arrangement the government challenges. No one should expect the legal guidance from this case to be either clear or clearly in the consumer’s interest.

Google rivals believe the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against the company will open the door to future cases, CNBC reported. Rivals from around the world have gone public with their complaints that Google unfairly wields its dominance in internet search to edge out competitors since the case began. 
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, alleges Google has abused its market powers. Google denied wrongdoing. A former Google executive also has defended the company’s business practices.
Shivaun Raff, co-founder of Foundem, complained to European competition authorities repeatedly about Google, she told CNBC.
“In normal cases, the first barrier to overcome was the Google halo effect, where people almost didn’t view Google back then as a business,” she said. “People almost viewed it as some sort of public nonprofit. Now I think that halo effect has been very much diminished.”
Luther Lowe, an executive at Yelp, told CNBC his company raised the possibility of an antitrust claim involving Google at a meeting of attorneys general years ago and that Google shortly thereafter changed the scraping practice that was troubling Yelp executives.
“The lightbulb kind of went off of,” Lowe told CNBC. “In antitrust, your weakness is your strength. It’s sort of the judo of public policy. The A word is the one thing that Google respects. And I think that kind of began our long journey.”
CNBC wrote: “Rivals from around the world have gone public with their complaints that Google unfairly wields its dominance in internet search to edge out competitors, among complaints about its opaque advertising business. And as the chorus of criticism has grown louder, Google’s glow in the eyes of those with the power to rein it in has dimmed.”
A question lingering in the tech world following the government’s suit against Google is how it will affect new products the company is developing.

Google’s deal with Apple to maintain its standing as the default search engine for iOS devices is reportedly at the heart of a recent Justice Department lawsuit against the tech giant.
The Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google that accused the company of abusing its power over the internet search industry. The deal with Apple and other companies is cited as part of the department’s argument.
Within Google, the prospect of losing the default position was thought to be so dire that it was internally dubbed “Code Red,” according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal.
Google search is the default search engine in Safari and for Siri on iPhone and iPad devices.
According to the Journal, that has been a major source of revenue for both companies. In 2018, for example, Google is said to have paid Apple upwards of US$9 billion to maintain the arrangement.
Although neither company has confirmed how much the deal is actually worth, the lawsuit indicates that it accounts for between 15% and 20% of Apple’s annual profits. That suggests payments of as much as US$11 billion.

The target of the US government’s last major tech antitrust campaign could be the biggest beneficiary of its newest lawsuit, reported Wall Street Journal.
Microsoft’s Bing search engine is the only major competitor to Google’s dominant product, though it has less than 7% of the market. The Justice Department accused the Google of using anticompetitive tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business in an antitrust lawsuit it filed Tuesday, October 20.The suit represents the biggest enforcement action against a major tech company since Microsoft and the US government went to battle more than two decades ago. The Justice Department’s latest charges echo those it leveled against the software maker in 1998.After years of litigation, Microsoft avoided a threatened breakup. But the distraction from the case helped rivals capitalize, such as Google becoming the dominant search provider.This time Microsoft could get the boost. “Anything that limits Google’s ability to move freely in the market is a good thing for Microsoft,” said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.

Mozilla has responded to the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit against Google, but rather than commending the DOJ’s action, the Firefox browser maker has voiced concerns that its commercial partnership could make it “collateral damage” in the fight against Google’s alleged monopolistic practices.
The DOJ, with support from 11 US states, confirmed on Tuesday, October 20, that it is suing Google for allegedly violating anti-competition laws by crowding out rivals in the internet search and advertising markets.
“Small and independent companies such as Mozilla thrive by innovating, disrupting, and providing users with industry-leading features and services in areas like search,” Mozilla chief legal officer Amy Keating wrote in a blog post. “The ultimate outcomes of an antitrust lawsuit should not cause collateral damage to the very organizations, like Mozilla, best positioned to drive competition and protect the interests of consumers on the web.”
Mozilla has a long and complicated history with Google. In recent years, Mozilla has launched countless privacy campaigns against the internet giant’s various online properties, and just last month it introduced a new browser add-on to crowdsource research into YouTube’s opaque recommendation algorithm. On the other hand, Mozilla relies heavily on royalties from a search engine partnership with Google. The duo recently extended their deal to make Google the default search engine inside Firefox in the US and other markets, which will reportedly secure Mozilla up to US$450 million over the next three years.

On Tuesday, October 20, the US Department of Justice sued Google over charges that its search and advertising empire violated federal antitrust laws, finding after a year-long investigation that the tech giant wrongfully wielded its digital dominance to the detriment of corporate rivals and consumers, reported the Washington Post.
In its complaint, the Justice Department makes sweeping allegations that Google has stifled competition to maintain its powerful position in the marketplace for online search and search advertising. 
Eleven states, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas,  joined the suit, according to the complaint.
The Justice Department did not explicitly ask a judge to break apart Google as part of its complaint, though it did request the court consider “structural relief” — which theoretically could include a requirement that the company sell a portion of its business. In doing so, government lawyers invoked the specter of the government’s last major antitrust challenge against a tech giant, its years-long war with Microsoft, in making the case that Google violated the Sherman Act.
“Absent a court order, Google will continue executing its anticompetitive strategy, crippling the competitive process, reducing consumer choice, and stifling innovation,” the Department of Justice alleged in its complaint, adding, “For the sake of American consumers, advertisers, and all companies now reliant on the internet economy, the time has come to stop Google’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition.”

Google revised the package after the European Commission received feedback from rivals and consumers, the people said, declining to provide details. The move could also help stave off a possible EU charge sheet setting out specific concerns.

They are regularly reminded that Google doesn’t “crush,” “kill,” “hurt,” or “block” the competition. And if you hope to land an executive job at the internet company, do not bring up the A-word in the interview process.
As the US Justice Department, a coalition of state attorneys general, and a Congressional subcommittee have investigated Google for monopoly behavior over the last year, there has been little discussion internally about antitrust concerns. Now, as the Department prepares to file a lawsuit against the company, the usual forums where Google employees debate anything and everything have been startlingly subdued about what may be an existential threat to it.
According to the NYT, Google’s leaders have made it clear that antitrust is not a topic to be discussed. And while there is no written policy banning discussion of antitrust, a former executive recalled “coming down like a ton of bricks” on an employee who wrote flippantly about antitrust concerns.
The caution is not limited to employees. After Google interviewed a candidate for an executive job last year, that person sent a follow-up email to Sundar Pichai, the company’s chief executive. In the email, the candidate asked about the antitrust implications of a potential merger, according to two people familiar with the incident. An antitrust question to Mr. Pichai was seen as inappropriate, raising questions about the candidate’s judgment, the people said. While it did not disqualify the candidate, it was seen as a negative for their job prospects.
According to the NYT, all of this has contributed to an unspoken understanding among Google employees that it is not wise to address the antitrust issues openly, said six current and former employees, who declined to be identified because they were either not permitted to talk publicly, or feared retaliation.
“It’s seen as something you don’t talk about because there is no productive conversation associating Google with the word ‘monopoly,’” said Jack Poulson, a Google research scientist who left the company in 2018 and now works at a tech ethics nonprofit. “The reality is that Googlers are paid well and that’s because of the monopoly. In effect, the monopoly is on their side.”

415,"October 12, 2020",Indian Startups Meet CCI To Flag Google’s Antitrust Practices,"


The fight between startups in India and Google over the app store monopoly continues, with a group of startups reportedly knocking on the doors of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). A group comprising 15 startups reportedly held a meeting virtually with the CCI to complain about Google’s anti-competitive practices in the country.
There has been rising discontent against Google’s practices, which came to the fore after it announced that it will be enforcing a 30% commission on in-app purchases of digital goods. The policy, which was to be implemented in September 2021, has since been deferred till March 31, 2022.
The meeting reportedly had Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founders of BharatMatrimony, MapMyIndia, TrulyMadly, and nCore Games.
According to the Economic Times, the points of contention for startups are that allowing payments only through Google Play creates a monopoly, removing real money gaming apps violates Indian law and that it removes apps from the Play Store for violations without proper notice.
“With more than 95% of India’s digital population accessing the Internet through Google, this strategy of having an OS and Play Store, together gives Google an advantage over other app stores and operating systems. Hence, we have requested them to look into this matter,” one of the founders present at the meeting told Mint.

416,"October 12, 2020",Opening the Black Box: An Analysis of Google’s Behavior in Search and Display Advertising Using Large-Scale Datasets,"
This article summarizes three quantitative pieces of analysis using large transaction-level datasets that the CMA undertook in a recent market study into online platforms and digital advertising. These are: a comparison of Google and Bing’s search advertising prices; an analysis of Google’s fees from providing advertising intermediation services; and an assessment of the value of targeting digital advertising through the use of third-party cookies. We find that Google’s search advertising prices are 30-40 percent higher than Bing’s on a like for like basis, while Google’s fees for advertising intermediation services are broadly comparable with those of its competitors. Regarding the value of user data for targeting, we find that blocking access to third-party cookies reduces publisher revenue by around 70 percent. We expect that this form of analysis will become an increasingly important aspect of regulatory oversight of digital markets in the future, as it can provide highly valuable insights into the working of the often-opaque algorithms that increasingly drive digital market outcomes.

By Simeon Thornton, Chris Jenkins, Giacomo Mason & Dan Griffiths1
 
I. INTRODUCTION
The Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) conducted a market study into online platforms and digital advertising in the UK between July 2019 and July 2020.2 Our aim was to assess the state of competition in the sector, and to analyze the sources and implications of market power of the large platforms funded by digital advertising – notably Google and Facebook. The market study concluded that there was a need for pro-competition ex ante regulation of digital platforms to address the exploitation of market power by the large platforms and to implement remedies to increase competition in specific markets.
Some other recent studies have drawn similar high-level conclusions and also made a case for regulatory reform, including the Furman and Stigler Center reviews in the UK and U.S. respectively.3 However, one thing our study was able to do that was not possible in these other exercises was to undertake detailed empirical analysis of very large-scale datasets in order to assess the extent of the concerns in relation to online platforms and the size of the detriment arising from them. This sort of in-depth analysis can provide a robust quantitative evidence base for assessing the case for interventions to address competition concerns in relation to online platforms, and is required in order to move beyond high level prescriptions and diagnoses to detailed design and implementation of the new regulatory regime.
When conducting a market study, the CMA has statutory information-gathering powers to require parties to provide data and other information. Using these powers, we compiled several large transaction-level datasets which allowed us to carry out detailed empirical analysis in a number of areas.4 This article summarizes three quantitative pieces of analysis we undertook in the study which use large transaction-level datasets and which focus specifically on the behavior of Google in search and display advertising markets:

A “like for like” comparison of the search advertising prices of Google and Bing;
An analysis of Google’s fees from providing advertising intermediation services; and
An assessment of the value of targeting digital advertising through the use of third-party cookies

For each exercise, we set out the objectives of the analysis, summarize the data collected and the analysis undertaken, and discuss the results and implications for the study findings. Part of our aim in the market study was to demonstrate the type of data analysis that might be carried out by a future regulator of digital markets, and in the conclusion, we set out some considerations that should be taken into account in undertaking this future work.
 
II. COMPARISON OF GOOGLE AND BING SEARCH ADVERTISING PRICES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
A key question for our study was whether the market power of the large platforms leads to higher prices for advertisers. Consumers using online platforms such as Google and Facebook typically do not pay directly for the service; instead they provide attention and data which are monetized by the platforms through the sale of advertising. We would expect platforms with market power to be able to earn higher returns than their competitors from digital advertising.5
We tested this hypothesis in relation to search advertising by comparing the UK search advertising prices of Google, which accounts for more than 90 percent of search queries and search advertising revenues in the UK, with those of Bing, its main competitor in the UK, which has less than 10 percent of revenues and queries in the UK.
Google, Bing and other search engines sell advertising based on the search query entered by the user. Advertisers bid to display adverts in response to specific search “keywords.” When a user enters a particular search query, the search engine determines which advert(s) to show using a real-time auction, taking account of the price bid by the advertiser, relevance of the advert to the search query, and other quality factors. Search adverts are typically sold on a cost per click (“CPC”) basis, where the advertiser only pays if a user clicks on the ad link.
The main challenge for our analysis was how to compare prices on a like-for-like basis. CPC varies significantly by search query (i.e. some search queries have much higher commercial value than others), so a simple comparison of average CPC across all search terms would be affected by differences in the mix of search queries seen by Google and Bing. Similarly, we would expect CPC to vary based on the position of the ad on the page (i.e. a higher ad position is more valuable), and on the device type used (mobile vs desktop). We therefore collected transaction data on search events from Google and Bing as described below, to allow us to control for these factors and identify price differences on a more comparable basis. To our knowledge, this is the first time an analysis of this type has been carried out using a comprehensive dataset from more than one party, allowing for like-for-like comparisons to be made.
B. Data Collected
The CMA collected data for all the (3 – 4 billion) search events made in the UK on Google and Bing during a single week in 2020. For the purposes of the analysis, each search that is undertaken on a search engine is regarded as a “search event.” The text that is associated with a search event is a “query.” Many queries are associated with multiple search events. The set of queries that remain once duplicates have been removed are “distinct queries.” The “frequency” of a distinct query is how many times it appears in the dataset.
For each search event, the CMA could observe: (i) basic characteristics of the user’s device, such as operating system platform (mobile, tablet, or desktop) and browser; (ii) number of text ads (ad load), number of clicks, and total revenue; (iii) for the top text ad (the one appearing in the highest position), the cost per click (“CPC”) and the price-bid ratio (“PBR”) – defined as the ratio between the amount actually paid by the advertiser and the what the winning advertiser had actually bid. CPC and PBR were only observed when the top ad was clicked.
C. Results and Implications
We compared the prices of queries that were observed by both Google and Bing, and calculated the results separately for queries on desktop and mobile, to yield results that can be compared “like-for-like” on a query basis. This allowed us to isolate differences in market outcomes, rather than capturing differences in the scale or distribution of queries across Google and Bing. The results from our analysis were striking. We found that top text ads on Google have a CPC that is on average 30 to 40 percent higher than Bing on both desktop and mobile, for comparable queries where the top ad was clicked.
Differences in the CPC of Google and Bing at the query level may be in part driven by differences in the perceived value of a click between Google and Bing. This may be due, for example, to differences in advertiser or audience composition (e.g. one search engine attracts more valuable users and/or advertisers) or differences in the ability of the search engine to interpret search intent and serve relevant ad results that are more likely to lead to conversions.
To address this issue, we also compared PBRs for Google and Bing, which measure the difference between the winning bid and the price paid. Insofar as the bid is an indicator of the advertiser’s willingness to pay (i.e. the value it expects to derive from a click),6 the PBR controls for any difference in the value of a click on Google as opposed to Bing. A higher PBR means that the platform is able to extract more of the rent or surplus value from the advertising opportunity, and a lower PBR means that the advertiser retains more of the surplus value. Our results show that the PBR for searches on Google is [20 – 30 percent] higher than that of Bing on a like for like basis on mobile and [10 – 20 percent] higher on desktop, indicating that Google is more effective at extracting surplus value from the advertiser than Bing.
Overall, these results support the hypothesis that Google’s market power gives it an ability to raise prices above the competitive level.7 Given that over £7bn was spent on search advertising in the UK in 2019, higher advertising prices are likely to result in considerable detriment to UK consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services that use search advertising, including hotels, flights, and consumer electronics.
In addition to allowing for the comparison of Google and Bing’s prices, our analysis shed light on a number of other characteristics of search advertising prices in the UK. For example, we found that ads on less common queries tended to be more expensive than ads on more common queries and that CPCs on desktop were more expensive than CPCs on mobile.
Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to quantify the extent to which Google enjoys greater access than Bing to uncommon “tail” queries, which can be of particular value in training algorithms to improve the quality and relevance of search results. We found that, of the queries that Google only saw once or twice, only 1.0 percent were in the Bing dataset, while of the queries that Bing only saw once or twice, 31.5 percent were in the Google dataset. This is shown in the figure below.
Figure 1: Distribution of the percentage of Google search events which were for queries seen by Bing, and vice versa, by the frequency of their search query
We define the head as the 15 percent of queries seen most often in a dataset and the tail as the 30 percent of queries seen least often.
This evidence is supportive of our assessment of Google’s scale advantage in search. The scale and variety of click-and-query data seen by Google underpins its ability to provide timely and relevant search results. The benefits of scale are particularly large for less common queries, where Google’s advantage over Bing is more significant. In view of the importance of search relevance to consumers and keyword coverage to advertisers, we found that a lack of comparable scale in click-and-query data is likely to be a key factor that limits the ability of other search engines to compete with Google.
 
III. ANALYSIS OF GOOGLE’S AD TECH FEE RATES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
A second piece of analysis conducted during the market study related to open display advertising. In this part of the market, online publishers sell advertising in real time via a chain of intermediaries (the “adtech stack”) that bring together demand from advertisers and run auctions to decide which ad to show to a specific user on a publisher’s site. Various stakeholders in the CMA’s market study including publishers, advertisers and public bodies expressed concerns regarding the proportion of advertising revenues in open display which accrues to the providers of intermediation services, and the lack of transparency over these payments.
We carried out an aggregate-level analysis based on information requests to a wide range of intermediaries, which found that ad tech intermediation services accounted for at least 35 percent of the amount paid by advertisers. However, there were concerns that this aggregate analysis might not identify so-called “hidden fees” which could arise if ad tech intermediaries were able to exploit a lack of transparency to take additional margins at different points in the ad tech chain.
We therefore gathered transaction-level data from Google to investigate in more detail the fees it earned at different points in the ad tech chain. While this could only tell us about Google’s fees rather than those charged by other intermediaries, Google is the largest player in all the main parts of the ad tech chain, so the analysis was informative about a significant portion of the market.8 The fact that Google operates in all parts of the chain also meant that we could trace a large number of individual transactions from “end to end,” allowing us to observe all payments including any hidden fees.
B. Data Collected
The CMA obtained from Google a dataset containing event-level information generated by Google Ad Manager in the seven-day period beginning March 8, 2020 Pacific Time (“PDT”).9 The dataset covers all Google Ad Manager open auction web traffic in the UK (based on user location) for that week, amounting to several billion observations.
The dataset is at the bid level, including, for each bid, the DSP, the amount bid, any bid floor, and the result of the auction. For the winning bid in each auction, information about buy- and sell-side fees is also available. Finally, the dataset includes user characteristics (operating system, platform, browser) and the domain of the page where the auction took place. This data allowed us to observe the end-to-end payments from advertiser to publisher where Google intermediaries were used – including any possible “hidden fees” which would not be visible to either the advertiser or the publisher
C. Results and Implications
Our analysis found that, in transactions where both Google Ads and Ad Manager (“AdX”) are used, Google’s overall take rate was approximately 30 percent of advertiser spend. Overall, Google take rates were broadly in line with, or slightly lower than, aggregate market-wide fee estimates from other sources.
This data allowed us to investigate an additional concern raised by stakeholders, notably UK news publishers, that Google Ads has an informational advantage over other DSPs that allows it to shade its bids in the auction,10 such that the Google Ads winning margin (its winning bid minus the maximum of the second highest bid or floor price) would be systematically lower than that of other DSPs. Such an outcome could be thought of as a “hidden fee,” as Google Ads would be able to maximize the difference between the winning bid in the auction that it holds among buyers on the platform and the bid that it submits to the unified auction.
To shed more light on these concerns, we calculated the margin between the winning bid and the second highest bid for Google and non-Google DSPs, to test whether Google Ads was systematically able to win with a lower margin over the second highest bid compared to other DSPs. We did not find clear evidence that Google’s winning margins were systematically lower than non-Google DSPs. In absolute terms there was some evidence that Google Ads is able to achieve lower winning margins than other DSPs. However, in proportionate terms its winning margins were higher than other those of other bidders.11
Overall, the results of our analysis in relation to Google’s adtech fees stand in contrast to those regarding Google’s search advertising prices, in that we did not find evidence that it systematically charged higher fees than its competitors, notwithstanding its market power in different segments of adtech intermediation. We noted in the study that Google’s position was still a source of concern, particularly if it led to reduced dynamic competition and innovation over time, and that Google retained the ability and incentive to raise fee levels in the future.
 
IV. THE VALUE OF TARGETING WITH THIRD PARTY COOKIES
A. Objectives of the Analysis
The third piece of analysis related to the value of user data in digital advertising. One of the defining characteristics of digital advertising is the ability to target advertising at specific users or groups of users based on information about their characteristics, preferences and interests. This form of “personalized” advertising is particularly important in relation to display and video advertising. Advertisers want to target advertising at consumers for whom their adverts are more likely to be relevant, reducing deadweight loss and increasing the likelihood of conversion, i.e. achieving a sale as a result of a consumer seeing an advert.
We sought to assess the value of user data by analyzing how access to it translated into higher advertising prices. This analysis helped us to understand how the large platforms’ extensive access to data on consumers’ preferences and past browsing behavior might act as a source of competitive advantage over smaller players and online publishers. Further, it allowed us to assess how future changes to the market – introduced either by large platforms or by regulatory authorities – that changed participants’ access to user data would affect their ability to generate revenue through serving targeted advertising.
Our analysis was based on observing the impact on advertising revenues of “switching off” access to third party cookies, which are a common means of tracking users across the web and targeting them based on their interests.
B. Data Collected
In the summer of 2019, Google ran a global randomized controlled trial (“RCT”) to assess the short-run impact of disabling third-party cookies on publisher revenues from display ads. The CMA obtained the data for the UK subset of this experiment and expanded the analysis, to shed more light on the value of cookies in targeted advertising.
The dataset contained a few million impressions where Google was operating on the demand and/or supply side. These impressions were randomly sampled from Google’s traffic in the UK, and allocated with equal probability to a control group (the “business as usual” case) and an intervention group, where Google’s systems were prevented from accessing the information associated to each cookie ID. For each impression, we observed advertiser payments and publisher revenue for the winning bid, user characteristics (operating system, platform, browser, cookie age) and the domain of the page where the auction took place.
The dataset was smaller than the others discussed in this article. Further, it did not originate directly from a data collection request that was designed by the CMA, but was collected by Google as part of an internal experiment. However, the randomization in the RCT design helps to answer research questions of a causal nature, compared to purely observational data.
C. Results and Implications
As part of our analysis, we identified a number of sample selection issues and implemented a different econometric approach to tackling each one.12 Having implemented these, our best estimate was that blocking cookie information reduced average publisher revenue by around 70 percent. Thanks to the availability of rich transaction-level data, we were able to go beyond average effects and investigate whether the effect differs by type of user. We adopted a causal forest approach, which uses machine learning to flexibly account for all possible combinations of user characteristics. We found that the negative effect of blocking cookies on publisher revenue was larger for users with older cookies (and thus with a potentially more complete profile) and was smaller for users navigating with browsers that adopt anti-tracking technologies such as Safari and Firefox.
The results of the experiment make clear that, for individual publishers competing against other publishers that offer personalized inventory using cookies, blocking access to cookie identifiers reduces publisher revenue from users navigating with cookies by a significant amount. This impact is best understood as a short run effect, where the blocking applies to a relatively small subset of impressions in an ecosystem where third-party cookies are the commonplace means of identifying users. A question this experiment cannot answer is what the impact would be in a “long-run market-wide” perspective, where third-party cookies are unavailable throughout the ecosystem. In such a world, the impact on publisher revenue is likely to be mitigated by dynamic responses, for example heavier use of contextual targeting rather than personalized targeting, and alternative methods of cross-site tracking, including fingerprinting.
This analysis proved valuable in helping us understand the importance of Google’s announcement early in 2020 that Chrome browsers will stop support for third-party cookies in the future, restricting the ability of publishers to sell personalized advertising.13 Depending on how the proposals are implemented,14 this decision has the potential to have a significant impact on publishers’ revenues and the CMA has undertaken to discuss this with ICO, alongside a number of other issues relating to the interaction between competition and data protection regulation in digital advertising markets.
 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK
The pieces of quantitative analysis outlined in this paper played an important role in supporting the overall findings of our market study. They provided empirical evidence of the impact of Google’s market power on search advertising prices, shed light on fees paid to ad tech intermediaries and quantified the value of access to personal data on for targeted advertising. This quantitative work is important in evidencing the scale of harm from lack of competition, and in providing the basis for assessing the costs and benefits of potential regulatory interventions.
We expect that this form of analysis will become increasingly important as part of regulatory oversight of digital markets in the future. One of the key characteristics of digital markets is their reliance on real-time processes driven by algorithms, based on access to very large sets of data on the behavior and characteristics of consumers and other market participants. These processes can be very hard for third parties (including regulators) to assess. For example, the way in which auction prices are adjusted to take account of quality cannot be observed purely by interrogating auction outcomes, and transactions in the open display market typically cannot be traced from “end-to-end” – i.e. from the advertiser to the publisher on which an ad is shown. We think that regulators will increasingly need the powers to request and interrogate large datasets from the platforms in order to understand their behavior and to ensure that any regulatory rules designed to prevent exploitation of market power are being complied with.
The experience of carrying out large-scale data analysis during the market study has highlighted some lessons that can inform the future work of the Digital Markets Unit (“DMU”), a body proposed by the Furman Review and the CMA’s market study to regulate the behavior of large online platforms and encourage greater competition in online platform markets. We have found that this type of analysis should be well within the reach of a regulator like the DMU. Thanks to advancements in open-source software, multiple well-known tools are available that can perform data manipulation and statistical analysis. The availability of cheap cloud computing resources allows this type of analysis to be scaled in a mostly seamless fashion, making the processing of large amounts of data possible. These capabilities can be effectively supported by building in-house teams with specialist data science and software development knowledge, whose skills can be leveraged in concert with more traditional specialist profiles already present within competition authorities and regulators.
The right tools and skillsets can enable more ambitious analysis. In the instances described in this paper, we chose to collect transaction-level data rather than asking parties to compute aggregate figures beforehand. This clearly increases the workload on the regulator’s side. However, it has numerous advantages: it provides more insight into online platforms, enabling regulators to understand their dynamics on a deeper level; and it increases flexibility in the analysis, allowing for adjustments rather than being wedded to a fixed, pre-specified analysis. Furthermore, the code generating the analysis can be shared with the parties – which reduces the chance of errors and increases transparency. All of these aspects are likely to be particularly important for the DMU, with its envisaged powers of continuous monitoring, and assessment.
Finally, we note that working with personal or otherwise sensitive data need not be an obstacle to the pursuit of regulatory functions. Throughout the study, we were able to cooperate effectively with parties and minimize the risks connected with transferring and analyzing personal data, for example by anonymizing transaction-level data and encrypting potentially sensitive information such as search engine queries. In more complex cases, privacy-enhancing technologies can be used to enable sharing of information across parties while preserving confidentiality.15

4 We are grateful to Google and other parties such as Microsoft for their work in collecting the data used in this analysis.
5 The precise mechanisms by which a platform with market power can charge high prices in digital advertising markets is complicated by the fact that prices in these markets are largely set through real time auctions. In Chapter 5 and Appendix Q of the market study final report we discuss a variety of ways in which platforms can influence the prices in these auctions, and conclude that market power will increase a platform’s ability to raise prices compared to a situation in which they were subject to greater competitive pressures.
6 This is more likely to be the case where the advertiser sets a maximum bid directly, as opposed to automated bidding, in which the bid is set according to a Google algorithm. In 2019, [40-50] percent of Google’s UK search advertising revenue came from advertisers using automated bidding, while the remainder set maximum CPC bid limits. The data we collected did not allow us to distinguish automated from advertiser-set bids. This could be explored in further work.
7 We note that the prices currently offered by Bing may not reflect the prices that we would expect to apply in a fully competitive market.
8 In 2019, Google had a share of [90-100] percent of the publisher ad server segment, [80-90] percent of the advertiser ad server segment and shares of [50-60] percent in supply-side platforms (SSPs) and [50-60] percent in demand-side platforms (“DSPs”).
9 In GMT time, the dataset spans from 08:00 on Sunday 8 March to 08:00 on Sunday 15 March.
10 Specifically, the concern is that Google Ads has access to superior data which allows it more accurately to anticipate when it will be the only bidder exceeding the floor price in the first-price unified auction.
11 This result may reflect that Google Ads typically bids for lower valued inventory than other DSPs.

The US Department of Justice is reportedly pondering a divestiture of several ad-tech assets, according to Politico.
Politico reports that the DoJ is considering the option as a part of its investigation into Google’s alleged antitrust violations. In the case, which is expected to start in the coming weeks, the tech giant and its parent company Alphabet are accused of abusing their power in the online search market.
The report notes that discussions about how to resolve Google’s dominance are “ongoing” and that no final decisions have yet been made.
Chrome, which was launched by Google in 2008, is the most popular browser in the world and has the largest market share in the US. However, it has been accused of using its access to users’ browsing habits in order to aid its digital advertising business.
In January, Google announced that it would stop using third-party cookies, which are used to track users’ movements from page to page across the web, in its Chrome browser within the next two years.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is examining a complaint claiming that search giant Google abused its dominant market position in smart television operating systems, reported LiveMint.
Antitrust lawyers Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand filed the complaint with CCI in the first week of June.
“If a TV manufacturer intends to use Google’s operating system, you have to enter into certain agreements. These agreements prohibit you from manufacturing any other device, whether it is televisions, phones, etc., on any forked version of Android,” the person said. Forked Android refers to operating systems based on Android, like Amazon’s Fire TV OS.
This means a company using the AndroidTV platform cannot just choose to make TVs on other Android-based platforms, but also has to make phones and other devices, on Google’s platform. The person said Google is using the dominance of Android to create a monopoly in smart TVs as well.
Chinese smartphone and TV maker Xiaomi and TV maker TCL have also been named as parties in the case, since they also manufacture products on the Android platform. Google did not respond to an email, while Xiaomi and TCL declined to comment.
The Competition Commission of India will seek comments from Google and other parties only after it launches a formal probe.

419,"October 8, 2020",Google Pay Faces New Probe In South Korea,"


South Korea has launched an antitrust probe into Google over its plan to enforce its 30% Play Store commission by disallowing any apps circumventing its payment system, a top official said Thursday, October 8.
Google has always required apps offered on the Play Store’s virtual shelves to use its payment system, which takes an industry-standard 30% cut, the same as Apple does, reported Reuters. 
The company has been lax about enforcing the rule, however, unlike Apple, which is currently involved in a legal battle with the owners of the Fortnite game series after banning the app when developers allowed users to circumvent the payment system.
The internet giant announced last month that the new policy, set to take effect next year, applies to fewer than 3% of developers with apps in the Play Store.
But the announcement prompted a backlash from South Korean app developers, who claim the new plan will allow Google to collect too high a fee.
Joh Sung-wook, chairperson of the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), on Thursday said Google’s plan was being investigated for possible “anti-competitive practises.”
“Competition isn’t working properly in the industry,” she told lawmakers during a parliamentary audit.
“We are searching for anti-competitive practices in order to restore competition.”

A French appeals court on Thursday, October 8, confirmed the country’s antitrust authority’s order to US tech firm Google to pay French publishing companies and news agencies for their content, reported Reuters. 
The ruling may reverberate outside France, as it compels Google to sit down with publishers and news agencies to find a way to remunerate them under the “neighbouring right” enshrined in revamped EU copyright rules, which allows publishers to demand a fee from online platforms for showing news snippets.
It differs from last week’s pledge by Alphabet’s Google to pay US$1 billion to publishers globally for their news over the next three years, because the French arrangement would involve finding a sustainable methodology to remunerate publishers and news agencies for news.
Google’s vehicle to remunerate news publishers, dubbed Google News Showcase, is set to launch in Germany, where it has signed up German newspapers including Der Spiegel, Stern, Die Zeit, and in Brazil with Folha de S.Paulo, Band and Infobae.
“Our priority remains to reach an agreement with the French publishers and press agencies,” Google said in a statement.

Under the terms of that settlement, the EU has accepted Broadcom’s agreement not to craft any exclusivity pacts for chips that are used in television set-top boxes and modems through the next seven years.
But the real news, and the flare being sent up for Big Tech firms, is that the injunction “tool” (through a policy known as interim measures) had not been used in 18 years – and, as the Journal noted, effectively forced Broadcom to “suspend” the agreements with six other firms that had been under investigation.
An injunction represents a way to prohibit individual corporate actions – a scalpel approach to, ostensibly, stopping any (anti-competitive) harm that might occur before final regulatory or judicial opinions are rendered.
Vestager has said the injunctions would be more widely deployed as antitrust investigations continue into Google, Amazon, and Apple, among others.
“If you have taken a tool out of a toolbox and have some experience using it, it’s more likely that you’ll use it again,” she said, as quoted by the Journal.

422,"October 6, 2020",French Court To Rule If Google Can Be Forced Into “Neighboring Rights” With Press,"


According to a report from Euractiv, the Paris Court of Appeal will rule Thursday,  October 8, on whether the country’s competition authority had the power to require Google to negotiate with the French press on so-called “neighboring rights,” which allow online newspaper publishers to be remunerated for publishing extracts of their articles on Google News.
What are neighbouring rights? This principle similar to copyright is designed to help newspaper and magazine publishers, as well as news agencies, receive payment from the world’s Internet giants when their content is being reused online.
It was established by Article 15 of the EU Copyright Directive, adopted by the European Parliament at the end of March 2019 after an intense lobbying battle, with the terms and conditions of use and prices still to be negotiated between press publishers and platforms.
France is the first EU member state to apply this reform after it swiftly transposed the directive into national law on July 24, 2019.
Why are the French press and Google in conflict? Google does not want to remunerate publishers for the extracts and thumbnails it includes on its search results page, arguing that this generates enormous traffic for publishers. According to the US giant, the traffic is sufficient to pay them.
The publishers, for their part, believe that Google itself became a content producer with its search results pages, which capture the user’s attention and can thus be monetized.
In November 2019, French publishers filed a complaint against the American giant before the French Competition Authority for abuse of dominant position.

The Justice Department (DOJ) and state AGs will sue Google as soon as this week for alleged antitrust violations related to online searches, sources told Politico.
The DOJ, which has been probing Google for 16 months, circulated a text of a proposed complaint last week, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. The complaint could come late this week or just after the Columbus Day holiday, two of the people said. All spoke anonymously to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The DOJ and state prosecutors also spoke Friday afternoon, October 2, to go over the proposed antitrust suit, two of the people said.
The long-expected suit,  the United States’ biggest legal salvo in decades against an alleged corporate monopoly, will accuse the company of abusing its stranglehold on the online search market. The complaint is expected to include claims on Google’s contracts with smartphone manufacturers and Apple to make it the default search engine on mobile devices and touch on other aspects of Google’s search business.
The DOJ and a group of state AGs led by Texas have also been probing Google for potential advertising tech violations, which could lead to a separate complaint in the coming weeks.

Google has postponed the Australian roll-out of News Showcase citing regulatory complications, just three months after announcing the product, as the US internet giant grapples with one of the most audacious attempts to police its activities, reported Reuters. 
After naming Australia, Germany, and Brazil as markets where it would start paying publishers to feature their news, the Alphabet unit dropped Australia from the product’s launch this week because its antitrust body has since pushed for laws forcing Google to pay royalties for content industry-wide.
Google stated it has therefore “paused” contracts with five local publishers whose news was due to feature on News Showcase, which presents content on swipeable cards it dubs story panels.
“As we work to understand the impacts of the news media bargaining code on partnerships and products, we have put this project on pause for now,” Google’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, Mel Silva, told Reuters in an email.
“Although our concerns about the code are serious, we hope they can be resolved so we can bring News Showcase to Australia soon,” Silva wrote.

More than 150 startups and firms in India are working to form an alliance and toying with the idea of launching an app store to cut their reliance on Google, five people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
Google, which reaches more internet users than any other firm in India and commands 99% of the nation’s smartphone market, has stumbled upon an odd challenge in the world’s second-largest internet market: scores of top local entrepreneurs.
The list of entrepreneurs includes high-profile names, such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma, co-founder and chief executive of Paytm  (India’s most valuable startup); Deep Kalra of travel ticketing firm MakeMyTrip; and executives from PolicyBazaar, RazorPay, and ShareChat.
The growing list of founders expressed deep concerns about Google’s “monopolistic” hold on India, home to one of the world’s largest startup ecosystems, and discussed what they alleged was unfair and inconsistent enforcement of Play Store’s guidelines in the country.
Their effort comes days after a small group of firms, including Epic Games, Spotify, Basecamp, Match Group, and ProtonMail, forged their own coalition to pressure Apple and Google to make changes to their marketplace rules.

426,"October 1, 2020",Google To Pay News Publishers $1B Over 3 Years,"
Google will pay publishers more than US$1 billion over the next three years through a new program for licensing news, reported Reuters.
The tech giant has signed licensing deals with about 200 publications in select countries, with plans to add more and expand geographically. Google, along with Facebook, controls a large share of the advertising dollars that once went to publishers in the news industry. Shrinking ad revenue has led to smaller newsrooms and diminishing resources for telling local stories. 
The billion dollar spend on licensing news is Google’s way of showing publishers it is committed to paying for high quality journalism and sustaining a struggling industry. The licensing deals, previously announced in June, are part of a new product called News Showcase, where participating publishers can curate and decide for themselves how to present their content on the platform. 
The content is displayed as a “story panel,” and publishers can employ timelines, bullets or related articles to tease the story and encourage viewers to click through to their site to read more. Google will pay some publishers to make paywalled articles free to access for non-subscribers.
Starting Thursday, October 1, Google users in Brazil and Germany can access the feature. At launch, News Showcase will only be available in the Google News app on Android. But it will soon come to the iOS app and later expand to the Google Discover app and Google search.
“It’s clear that the newspaper industry has long faced economic challenges,” Brad Bender, Google’s vice president of product management for news, told CNN Business. “I think a number of us in the ecosystem want to step up and enable a better future for news. This is a very big investment, our biggest investment today, but it really does build on our 20 years of efforts with the industry.”

The EU is drafting new rules intended to curb the power of big US platforms such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, reported Business Insider.
The draft rules, known as the Digital Services Act, aim to set the ground rules for data-sharing and how digital marketplaces operate. They are expected to come into force by the end of the year.
The European Commission is taking a tough line against US tech giants, driven in part by antitrust cases resulting in decisions that subsequently failed to boost competition because of the lengthy process that typically takes several years.
The case has taken on urgency because of the dependence of thousands of EU companies on the US tech giants for their business.
Gatekeepers, such as companies with bottleneck power or strategic market status, will not be allowed to use data collected on their platforms to target users unless this data is shared with rivals, according to the document seen by Reuters.
“… nor require from any third party operating system developers or hardware manufacturers to pre-install exclusively gatekeepers’ own application,” the paper stated.

By Damien Geradin (Platform Law Blog)
As has been widely reported in the press, Google has decided to adopt a more aggressive approach to the enforcement of the obligation imposed on app developers offering in-app purchases of digital goods on Google Play to use Google’s proprietary payment solution “Google Play In-App Billing” and pay the associated 30% commission.
At the same time, Google issued yesterday a blog post titled “Listening to Developer Feedback to Improve Google Play“, which detailed its new policies with respect to Google Play. This blog post was accompanied by an FAQs about Google Play Billing and referred to the new Payment Policies that will apply from 20 January 2021.
These are very important developments for the millions of app developers that rely on Google Play to distribute their apps. These developments come at an interesting time, where Google has been sued by Epic Games in the U.S. and the European Commission is investing Apple’s App Store’s practices in the EU. Google and Facebook are also facing greater pressure from major app developers, which have set up the Coalition for App Fairness and set a series of principles that should govern app stores. While Google claims its new policies are informed by developer feedback, there is no question that they come at a time where app stores are under greater scrutiny by regulators and pressure from app developers…

429,"September 30, 2020",Report: DOJ’s Google Antitrust Suit May Come Next Week,"


Months of investigations into Google’s alleged violation of antitrust laws is expected to culminate in a lawsuit as early as next week, sources told Reuters.
When the government’s case against Google reaches a courtroom, prosecutors will focus on the multinational technology conglomerate’s power over internet searches, the news service reported.
Sources told Reuters the complaint is expected to accuse the world’s dominant search engine of hurting competitors, including Microsoft’s Bing.
In addition, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also been investigating Google’s search advertising, the ads that appear under a search box when someone looks up a word or phrase.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is urging state attorneys general to become plaintiffs in the suit. The Mountain View, California-based company has insisted it has not committed any wrongdoing, noting users have access to other information and eCommerce sites.
Google has stated that users can choose Amazon to buy products and Twitter for news. In the competitive world of advertising, Google claims it faces competition from many companies, including Oracle and Verizon.
While DOJ investigators examined Google’s ability to place ads across the internet and the prices it charges advertisers, the suit was narrowed to the company’s search engine. Prosecutors say the sharp focus will allow the antitrust complaint to be filed soon and have the best chance of beating any potential court challenges.
Attorney General William Barr has vowed to bring the case against Google by October 1.
In 2019, Federal Trade Commissioner (FTC) Rohit Chopra said fining tech companies is not enough. “We’re not going to solve some of these problems just by small-time fines that aren’t going to change the underlying business model of these firms,” he said. “We actually have to take a hard look at whether these behemoths are killing off innovation and competition.”
Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have faced backlash from lawmakers and regulators around the globe. The president has supported efforts to limit the power of the tech giants. In addition, the House of Representatives and the FTC have each had their own separate investigations.

China is preparing to launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet’s Google, looking into allegations that the company has leveraged the dominance of its Android mobile operating system to stifle competition, reported CNBC. 
The case was proposed by telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies last year and has been submitted by the country’s top market regulator to the State Council’s antitrust committee for review, sources said.
A decision on whether to proceed with a formal investigation may come as soon as October and could be affected by the state of China’s relationship with the United States, one of the people said.

EU rivals are accusing Google’s online shopping search engine of still disadvantaging them despite a regulatory crackdown three years ago that led the search giant to alter its practices, reported the Financial Times. 
Less than 1% of traffic through Google Shopping is currently being directed to rival comparison shopping sites such as Kelkoo and Idealo, the analysis of 10.5 billion clicks, commissioned by 25 comparison shopping sites, a new report has shown.
In the three years since Google updated its policy to grant rivals “access” to its shopping platform by allowing them to bid for slots on it, following an EU penalty over alleged anti-competitive behavior, the visibility, and profitability of its competitors have halved, according to the research. 
Google’s overhaul of its shopping search came in 2017 after the European Commission fined the tech giant a record €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion) over abuse complaints, and stated it must “offer the [advertising] space on the same terms to Google Shopping and its competitors.” However, the measures it has taken in response to the crackdown have done little to assuage regulators’ concerns.

433,"September 28, 2020",Google To Enforce Universal 30% Cut On Play Store Due To Epic Suit,"


Google said on Monday that it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system, reported The New York Times. 
The move means developers have until Sept. 30, 2021 to use Google’s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments, instead of independent payment systems. The announcement brings Google Play’s policies in line with Apple’s App Store policies, which have come under fire from developers and regulators over several issues, including its own 30% cut.
Apple has argued against scrutiny of its App Store by pointing out that other app stores, like Google Play, also take a 30% fee from in-app purchases.
Google’s existing policy said developers have to use Google’s billing system on in-app purchases made within the Google Play Store, but it had not been enforced, Google said on Monday in a blog post. 
Google didn’t name apps that had been skirting the rule. It said 97% of developers selling digital goods already comply with its policies. Netflix and Spotify prompt users inside their Android apps to use a credit card to pay them directly. 
“We want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied consistently and fairly to all developers, and so we have clarified the language in our Payments Policy to be more explicit that all developers selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play’s billing system,” Google said in the announcement, signed by Sameer Samat, a VP of product management. 
Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, updated its Android softwarein August to allow gamers to directly pay Epic for in-app purchases of digital goods like colorful outfits, which circumvented Google Play billing.
Google responded by removing Fortnite from the Play Store. “While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies,” Google said at the time. Epic Games sued Google.

On Tuesday, September 15, Alphabet’s Google faced a tough series of questions about its ad business, there was a particular focus on whether it misused its dominance in online advertising to drive profits, reported Bloomberg.
Republican chair of the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, Senator Mike pressed Google’s Don Harrison, who testified remotely, on the company’s dominance of the interlocking businesses which connect advertisers with newspapers, websites and other firms looking to host them.
“As that business has grown, so too have complaints that Google – which both operates the ad selling and buying platforms, and sells its own inventory through those platforms -has conflicts of interest and has manipulated or rigged online ad technologies and auctions to favor its own interest,” Lee said.He and others pressed Harrison on advertiser complaints that Google was opaque where ad dollars went; specifically how much went to publishers and how much to Google, reported Reuters. 
During the hearing Harrison, who took over as head of Google’s corporate development in 2012, argued that the ad tech ecosystem was crowded and competitive, with Amazon.com and Facebook, AT&T, Comcast and others among Google’s powerful rivals, and that the price of placing an ad had fallen.
Lee’s concern was echoed by fellow Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley, “You control YouTube and search, which are the dominant platforms; you control massive amounts of consumer data that you have harvested from your other consumer-facing platforms — Gmail, Google Maps, G Suite,” said Senator Josh Hawley. “You then use those advantages in the ad stack at every single layer, every layer of which you exercise dominance in. This looks like monopoly upon monopoly in a classic case of tying.”
The hearing was held as the US Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit against Google within weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Google will ask the court to dismiss the Epic Games lawsuit in relation to Fortnite’s removal from Google Play.

Google explained that even though iOS and Android are competitors, there are different policies in place for developers to adhere to.
Moreover, as explained by Google, Android devices are more open; there is more room for developers to maneuver given there are multiple storefronts as opposed to a single one on iOS, the App Store.
The reason for Google’s fallout with Epic is the same as Apple’s. The Fortnite creator made a new payment option for its battle royale, which prevented both tech companies from taking its 30% commission. As a result, the game was booted from both the App Store and Google Play.

Another crucial dispute is whether to push to file the suit before Election Day — assuring it as a legacy for Attorney General William Barr — or risk leaving the case’s future in the hands of a Biden administration.
Widespread consensus still exists between Barr’s department and dozens of AGs of both parties that they have a strong case against Google, whose command of both the online search and digital ad markets has brought complaints from competitors in industries such as advertising, tech and media. But the closeness to the Nov. 3 election has heightened the partisan dimensions of the disputes, including qualms about President Donald Trump’s anti-tech agenda and doubts about Joe Biden’s past closeness with Silicon Valley.

Italy’s antitrust authority said on Monday it had opened an inquiry into Google, Apple and Dropbox over cloud computing services, reported Reuters. 
“The proceedings relate to alleged improper commercial practices and the possible inclusion of unfair clauses in contract conditions,” the authority said in a statement.
The investigation is the third by the AGCM into Apple. In July, the AGCM began scrutinizing Apple and Amazon over allegations that the two companies blocked the sale of Apple and Beats devices to resellers in order to stifle competition. Each investigation is separate and managed irrespective of other ongoing investigations.
A previous AGCM probe looked into the company for iPhone battery slowdowns, which the antitrust watchdog said was a form of planned obsolescence. It subsequently demanded a 10 million euro fine from Apple as a sanction

Colombian regulators on Friday ordered Alphabet’s Google to clearly ask each user whether the world’s largest search engine can use their personal data which is being captured without authorization.
Non-compliance could lead to investigations, sanctions and fines equivalent to 1.76 billion pesos ($480,500), the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce said in a statement.
“The decision was taken … after determining that the information treatment policy used by Google, located in the United States, does not comply with 52.63% of the requirements demanded by Colombian regulation.”
Google’s office in Colombia said it respected Colombian laws and would evaluate the order once it was informed of it by the regulators.

448,"September 3, 2020",DOJ To File Antitrust Charges Against Google Soon: NYT,"


According to a report from the New York Times, the Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case. 
According to three of the people, DOJ officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September.
Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline, reported the NYT. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.
The career lawyers also expressed concerns that Mr. Barr wanted to announce the case in September to take credit for action against a powerful tech company under the Trump administration.
According to the NYT Mr. Barr felt that the department had moved too slowly and that the deadline was not unreasonable, according to a senior Justice Department official.
When Mr. Barr imposed a deadline on the investigation, some lawyers feared that the move was in keeping with his willingness to override the recommendations of career lawyers in cases that are of keen interest to President Trump, who has accused Google of bias against him.
The Google case could also give Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr an election-season achievement on an issue that both Democrats and Republicans see as a major problem: the influence of the biggest tech companies over consumers and the possibility that their business practices have stifled new competitors and hobbled legacy industries like telecom and media.

Google urged the European Commission on Thursday to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to the tech industry in its forthcoming Digital Services Act, reported Yahoo News. 
The EU executive is drawing up new rules for data-sharing and the digital marketplace as well as boosting competition after concluding that multiple antitrust actions against Google have been ineffectual.
The Commission’s public consultation period ends on Sept. 8. In a blog post and 135-page submission, Google encouraged European legislators to provide greater clarity on rules and responsibilities of online platforms.
It said while it was important to identify illegal content, mandating use of technology to do that could ‘overblock’ Europeans’ speech and access to information.
The Commission should update its rules with a graduated scheme of exemptions from liability, including for search engines or cloud services, Google said.
Hosting services such as Google’s YouTube video channel should have to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to illegal content, Google said, but expressed concern that companies may be forced to prioritise speed over careful decision-making.
New rules should also encourage new and improved features and products and help European consumers get things done quickly. The rules, Google said, should not create undue costs and burdens for European businesses seeking to recover from a global pandemic.

Google has a new head general counsel, company legal exec Halimah DeLaine Prado.
Google announced Tuesday that Prado will be taking over legal duties from Google SVP Kent Walker, effective immediately. The company promotedWalker to senior vice president of global affairs in 2018, where he took on extra responsibilities, including overseeing Google’s policy, legal, trust and safety, and corporate philanthropy teams.
The latest appointment comes as the company faces potential antitrust cases against it this year. The company is reportedly expecting a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, focused on its dominance in online advertising and search. Last month, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai joined CEOs of Amazon, Apple, and Facebook at the House Judiciary Committee for a four-hour questioning session about the company’s competitive practices. That was followed by the release of trove of internal emails.
Prado will oversee legal responsibilities and teams, reporting directly to Walker, the company said.
In a statement, Walker said, “Halimah has been a trusted counselor and exceptional leader, having navigated a variety of cross-product and company-wide issues over the course of her nearly 14-year career at Google. She is uniquely qualified to lead the Legal Department at this critical moment, and I look forward to working with her as we enter this next chapter.”

Vacation rental search engine HomeToGo, like other local travel startups including experienced booking platform GetYourGuide, has filed an antitrust complaint against Google, accusing it of stealing content and data, according to a report in German newspaper Handelsblatt.
According to the newspaper’s report, the group of more than half a dozen startups is mulling filing a cartel complaint against the multinational technology giant over accusations that Google is abusing its search dominance by asserting its data standards on advertising partners, extracting their data and using it to promote its own products at a cheaper rate. To achieve this, it forces its partners to sign non-disclosure agreements [NDAs] to access their products and data.
The CEOs of Google, its parent company Alphabet, and a number of the largest tech platforms such as Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, were recently grilled at an historic antitrust hearing at the US Congress from members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee over suggestions that the companies are becoming too dominant in their segments and driving any competitors away from the market.
This was seen recently when Apple reportedly threatened to drop Airbnb and live on-demand workout platform ClassPass from its App Store if they did not comply with the company’s demands to receive 30% of any sales generated by their virtual experiences and classes now being offered due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Google has launched an international campaign targeting YouTubers, asking creators and viewers to swamp the Australian competition watchdog with complaints about its proposed mandatory news code, they announced in a blog post,
The messaging seeks to pit YouTubers and their fans against “big news businesses” that Google suggests could misuse personal data and make unjustified demands for money to the detriment of YouTube users. It includes an email address for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
The YouTube campaign follows Google’s targeting of Australian users with pop-up warning ads that link to an open letter about the mandatory news code that the ACCC says contains “misinformation”.

The campaign claims “vloggers”, “educational creators” and “music artists” are among those who will suffer if the mandatory news code, which will force Google to share advertising revenue with publishers, comes into effect.
When negotiations regarding remuneration for news content stalled between Google, Facebook and publishers, including Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia, the ACCC announced a mandatory code would be imposed.
The search giant is now appealing to the public to demand the ACCC drop its plan, arguing the code would have a “significant, negative” effect on content creators.

According to the Wall Street Journal some DOJ staffers have expressed internal concerns over plans to bring an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google.
The department has been moving toward bringing a lawsuit as soon as this summer, but some lawyers involved in the yearlong investigation have expressed a belief that the department doesn’t have a camera-ready case right now and needs more time to consider whether the millions of pages of documents in the government’s possession yield the kind of evidence needed to win in court, the people said.
According to the report dozens of government antitrust lawyers are on teams investigating whether the search giant has used its dominance to stifle competition. One group is focused on Google’s search practices, and some of its members have voiced the belief that there are vulnerabilities in a case built around those issues, people familiar with the matter said. Details about the Justice Department’s legal theories couldn’t be learned.
Another team is examining Google’s online advertising business, where the company owns industry-leading tools at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers. Some attorneys working on that aspect of the probe aren’t ready to move forward because they are still untangling the new and complex issues raised by that part of Google’s business and how it affects the many companies in the digital ecosystem, the people said.A senior Justice Department official said harm to innovation and nascent competition in fast-moving technology markets can happen quickly. The department has a duty to act expeditiously to determine if antitrust violations have been committed and, if so, to address them, the official said.
As the department’s leader, Mr. Barr, aided by his top lieutenants, will make the final decision on whether and when to sue Google.
“Things are moving along to my satisfaction in terms of the timing. I’m hoping to make a decision by the end of the summer,” Mr. Barr said in an interview last week, when asked about Google.
“While we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is firmly on providing free services that help people every day, lower costs for small businesses, and enable increased choice and competition,” a Google spokeswoman said.

454,"August 17, 2020",Google May Have Better Defense In Fortnite Antitrust Suit,"


Alphabet’s Google has a better chance than Apple at defeating Fortnite video game maker Epic Games in court over its allegations that the two companies breached antitrust laws, reported Reuters.
Epic sued Google and Apple separately in US district court on Thursday, August 13, accusing the companies of using their dominance to charge app developers an “exorbitant” 30% fee on sales and impose other restrictions that benefit their own businesses. 
Nearly all of the world’s smartphones outside restricted markets such as China come with either Google’s Play store or Apple’s App Store. 
But proving that Play store rules violate antitrust laws may be more difficult than with Apple’s App Store. 
While Apple requires all apps be installed through the App Store, Google allows such installation through several different app stores, in one of several key policy differences that could help it beat the allegations of anticompetitive conduct. 
Google encourages phone makers to set the Play store as the default and it erects security roadblocks when users try to download from some other sources.

On Monday August 17, Google said a proposed antitrust law in Australia forcing tech firms to pay for news that appears on their social media websites would adversely impact individual content creators and channel operators.
Google said the law proposed last month would help big media firms artificially inflate their search ranking, luring more viewers to their platforms and giving them an unfair advantage over small contributors running their own websites or YouTube channels, reported Reuters.
Google’s YouTube video service allows individuals and companies to create channels featuring advertisements that create revenue for both them and YouTube.
The US tech giant said the law may also obligate it to give big news firms confidential data about systems that they could use to try to appear higher in rankings on YouTube, resulting in fewer views for content of smaller businesses.
“This law wouldn’t just impact the way Google and YouTube work with news media businesses – it would impact all of our Australian users,” Google Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said in a post titled “Open letter to Australians”.

456,"August 13, 2020",Fortnite Is Suing Apple & Google After Both Pulled Game From App Stores,"


Fortnite developer Epic is suing Apple and Google after both pulled Epic’s hit game from their app stores over direct-payment disputes. As of right now, neither are allowing users to download and install Fortnite on phones through their digital marketplaces.
At the heart of the debate is whether Epic has the right to include a direct-payments service in its Fortnite app, circumventing Apple’s and Google’s payments systems and the up to 30% charge Apple and Google levy on each transaction, reported The Washington Post. Epic’s lawsuit alleges that Apple has become a “behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition and stifle innovation.”
“Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched and more pernicious than monopolies of yesteryear,” Epic says in the suit. “Apple’s size and reach far exceeds that of any technology monopolist in history.”
Epic’s lawsuit against Google attacks the company for abandoning its “don’t be evil” motto.
“In 1998, Google was founded as an exciting young company with a unique motto: “Don’t Be Evil”,” reads the lawsuit’s preliminary statement. “Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought, and is using its size to do evil upon competitors, innovators, customers, and users in a slew of markets it has grown to monopolize.”
Apple earlier Thursday said it chose to remove Fortnite from its App Store because the game violated guidelines Apple says it applies equally to every developer and that are designed to keep the store safe.
“As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store,” Apple said in a statement, adding that it’ll work with Epic to resolve the issue. “Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services.”
Google also cited rule-breaking by Epic as the reason it removed Fortnite from its digital marketplace. Consumers can still download the game on Android phones using other app stores, such as the Galaxy Store for Samsung devices.
“While Fortnite remains available on Android, we can no longer make it available on Play because it violates our policies,” a Google spokesman said. “However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play.”

Epic Games has added a new “direct payment” option to Fortnite on iPhone and Android devices, aimed at cutting out the portion of proceeds Apple and Google take via their own official stores, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Epic has long railed against Apple and Google’s 30 per cent cut, and previously launched Fortnite on Android via its own launcher to get around the issue.
“Fortnite” has more than 350 million registered players, according to closely held Epic, making it one of the most popular videogames in the world.
Originally available only on computers and later consoles, “Fortnite” surged in users after launching on Apple’s App Store in 2018. It debuted on Google’s Play store earlier this year after Epic gave up a yearslong battle with the company to get permission to include its own payment system inside “Fortnite”—which is essentially what Epic is doing now. Previously, “Fortnite” was available on Google-supported devices independent of Google Play.

458,"August 12, 2020",Genius Media Lawsuit Against Google Dismissed,"


A state court has dismissed a high-profile case showing unsportsmanlike conduct by Google,  which was caught red-handed using lyrics obviously scraped from Genius. Unfortunately for the latter, the complaints amount to a copyright violation — which wasn’t what the plaintiffs alleged, sinking the case.
The lawsuit, filed in December, accused Google of violating Genius’s terms of use and unjustly enriching itself by scraping lyrics on the site to be displayed on searches for songs. So, for instance, someone searching for “Your Love is Killing Me lyrics” would be shown the lyrics immediately instead of being sent to a site like Genius  that hosted them.
Judge Brodie found that Genius’ lyric transcriptions are derivative works of the original lyrics, which are protected under Copyright Law. However, Genius doesn’t have the ability to sue for copyright infringement because “the case law is clear that only the original copyright owner has exclusive rights to authorize derivative works,” she wrote in the decision.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has delayed its ruling on Google’s proposed takeover of fitness wearables manufacturer, Fitbit, by another four months.
The news comes after the European Commission announced last week it would engage in-depth investigation into the proposed takeover, prompting speculation that both regulators would consult on the decision.
The ACCC launched its investigation into Google’s US$2.1 billion takeover of Fitbit around six months ago, taking the new extension to a notable 10 month saga.
Both the ACCC and European Commission remain focused on the risks to localized consumers, with data security and privacy provisions between Fitbit and Google following the deal a core consideration.
Though Google has pledged to restrict its data collection provisions for Fitbit devices, EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager asserts the investigation will seek to ensure the transaction does not distort competition.
“Throughout this process we have been clear about our commitment not to use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google ads and our responsibility to provide people with choice and control with their data,” Google said in a statement.

In the late 1990s, when David Boies 1 prosecuted the Microsoft antitrust trial, he told me that despite the thousands of documents, emails and deposition transcripts that were rolled into court each day, no more than 50 were the key to the government’s case. He memorized them and knew right where to find them if he needed them in the middle of a cross-examination.
Of those 50, maybe two dozen were the kind you just don’t forget — bald, vivid illustrations of what the government hoped to prove: that Microsoft was using its monopoly power to squeeze Netscape, the upstart browser company that Microsoft viewed as a potential threat to its Windows monopoly.
“How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?” Microsoft founder Bill Gates asked, according to an email recapping a meeting with AOL executives. (He added, “This is your lucky day.”)
In another email, Gates suggested that Microsoft offer Intuit “something like $1M … in return for switching browsers” from Netscape to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.

Ten top senators are demanding the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate anticompetitive practices in Google’s search algorithms following a report from the Wall Street Journal accusing the company of promoting its own service providers, stifling smaller competitors, reported Bloomberg,“With public venues of all kinds closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, now, more than ever, content creators are dependent upon revenues from streaming and other online sources,” the group of bipartisan senators wrote. “Unfortunately, public reporting suggests that some online platforms are using their market dominance to provide preference to their own streaming services, skewing marketplace pricing and competition.”
The letter drew signatories from both sides of the aisle, from the usual agitators of Big Tech, such as Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, to the chamber’s partisan firebrands Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Others who signed the letter include Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, and Cory Booker of New Jersey, reported The Federalist. 
The letter centers on a July article in the Wall Street Journal, which found that “engineers at Google have made changes that effectively preference YouTube over other video sources.” YouTube is owned by the internet search giant.
“While a company favoring its own products, in and of itself, may not always constitute illegal anticompetitive conduct, the Journal further reports that a significant motivation behind this action was to ‘give YouTube more leverage in business deals with content providers,’” the senators wrote to senior officials at the FTC and DOJ. “We ask that you inquire as to whether Alphabet/Google is using its resulting market dominance to gain leverage in business deals with content providers.”
The senators’ requests come just one week after Google CEO Sundar Pichai, alongside executives of Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, faced questions over accusations of anticompetitive practices before congressional lawmakers on the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee.

Google has agreed to buy a 6.6% stake in security-monitoring provider ADT for US$450 million, as part of the search-engine company’s effort to bolster its hardware business and capitalize on growth in the market for smart-home security products, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
The two companies announced Monday, August 3, they would combine Google’s Nest hardware and services with ADT’s offerings.

Each company is committing an additional US$150 million, subject to certain milestones, for joint marketing and product development, among other initiatives.
The partnership will help ADT compete better in the smart-home market, the company stated, adding that it will use transaction proceeds to expand its business and reduce debt. Google stated its machine-learning capabilities will support ADT’s smart-home offerings, aiming to provide fewer false alarms, more ways to receive notifications and better detection of potential incidents.

The European Commission is launching a full investigation into Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. EU regulators are worried that the deal will entrench Google’s position as a market leader in online advertising by giving the search giant access to data collected from Fitbit’s health tracking hardware that can be used for personalized advertisements. 
“The data collected via wrist-worn wearable devices appears … to be an important advantage in the online advertising markets,” wrote the commission in a press release. “By increasing the data advantage of Google in the personalization of the ads it serves via its search engine and displays on other internet pages, it would be more difficult for rivals to match Google’s online advertising services.”
In recent months, regulators and consumer groups have signaled their concerns about the $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit, which was announced in November 2019. Google has responded to these concerns by promising not to use health data collected from Fitbit devices to target ads, and placing it in a “data silo” separate from its ad tracking business.
But the EU says these assurances were insufficient, as the information Google promised to place in the silo “did not cover all the data that Google would access as a result of the transaction and would be valuable for advertising purposes.”
In addition to its worries about Google strengthening its position in the ad business, the commission is also concerned about the effects the acquisition might have on the digital health market in Europe and interoperability of rival fitness tracking devices with Android.

Google and Facebook could be forced to pay Australian news publishers to distribute their content, in a landmark regulatory move from the country’s competition regulator, reported CNN. 
The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was tasked by the government earlier this year with developing a mandatory code for the tech giants to pay for their use of news content. If approved, a draft code announced by the ACCC Friday would allow Australian outlets to secure payments in a matter of months.
It is aimed at addressing “acute bargaining power imbalances” between news groups and Google and Facebook, the ACCC said. Under the rules, if the publishers and digital platforms are unable to agree a deal after three months of formal talks, a “final offer” arbitration process will be initiated that results in the selection of the “most reasonable” offer in 45 business days.
“Our regulatory changes are designed to create a level playing field and a fair-go,” Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Friday, July 31. “We want the rules in the digital world to reflect the rules in the physical world. We want to ensure consumer protection is enhanced, competition is increased and of course we deliver a sustainable media environment for all Australians for the future.”

Google’s $2.1 billion bid for fitness tracker maker Fitbit will face a full-scale EU antitrust investigation next week. Reuters reported that the deal will face a full-scale antitrust investigation, which the European Commission will reportedly open next week. Regulators and consumer advocacy groups have shared fears about Google’s planned acquisition of Fitbit, related to the search giant gaining access to sensitive data like fitness activities, heart rates, sleep patterns, and more.
Consumer groups from across Europe, the US, Mexico, Canada, and Brazil have labeled Google’s Fitbit deal a “test case” for regulators’ abilities to prevent data monopolies. Google has been trying to appease European regulators by offering not to use Fitbit’s health data to target ads, but the Financial Times reports that this guarantee hasn’t been enough. 
EU officials are reportedly demanding more concessions that would guarantee Fitbit’s data would be open to third-party developers, and also seeking assurances that Google won’t use Fitbit data to improve its search engine.
The EU’s investigation will likely take an additional four months to dig into Google’s potential use of Fitbit data. Google announced its Fitbit acquisition back in November, and it could be a full year or more before the company is able to finalize it. Google also spent $40 millionto acquire some smartwatch technology from Fossil last year in a greater push to build Android-integrated wearables.

Google is reportedly in the midst of convincing Samsung to prioritize Assistant and the Play Store over Bixby and the Korean company’s own app store. 
According to Bloomberg the tech giants are discussing a new global revenue-sharing deal that would give Google more control over Samsung’s devices. Google has apparently been urging Samsung to give Assistant and its Play Store app more prominence on its devices for quite a while now. Samsung hasn’t been receptive, however, because it has its own voice AI and app store strategy, it even gave its devices dedicated Bixby buttons.
The Korean tech giant may now be more willing to accept the deal, considering the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the whole mobile industry. While Samsung’s mobile division saw profits increase in the first quarter of 2020 when compared to the previous quarter, its smartphone sales ultimately declined by 20 percent, according to Gartner. Reuters says Google’s new proposal contains more lucrative terms than their previous deals in an effort to make it even more enticing.
It’s still unclear whether the agreement would force Samsung to drop Bixby and its app store entirely or, as Bloomberg says, whether it simply has to make those services less integrated on its own devices. Neither company confirmed the negotiations when the publication asked for a statement.
A Google spokesperson said “Like all Android device makers, Samsung is free to create its own app store and digital assistant. That’s one of the great features of the Android platform. And while we regularly talk with partners about ways to improve the user experience, we have no plans to change that.”

Internal documents describe it as a “service that collects sensitive Android user data,” though it is anonymized and not tied to individual accounts.
The report identifies a “Magic Eye” team within Google that’s tasked with tracking first-party app usage and leverages Lockbox data to brief executives on how third-party services compare.
Lockbox is part of the Google Mobile Services bundle that includes defaults like Gmail and Drive. The company confirmed to The Information that it “accesses usage data on other developers’ apps through Android, but said it has provided similar functionality to external developers.”
This report stated that Lockbox recently helped the YouTube team responsible for a competing “Shorts” feature see the “behavior of Indian Android users on TikTok and its competitors, and “speed up the future launch.” However, The Information cites one example of a Googler’s request for Lockbox information being denied, so it’s not clear how freely available this “competitive data” is internally.
Meanwhile, Google glaims its “data collection on external apps is ‘obtained solely’ by a public software program in Android, which was first made available in 2014.”

“Like many Americans across the political spectrum, I have been concerned by the exercise of market power held by Google and other tech giants,” said Sen. Lee. “This hearing will be an opportunity to dig deeper into those concerns, building off of earlier Antitrust subcommittee hearings. It will hopefully reaffirm the wisdom of focusing on better enforcement rather than the radical transformation of the antitrust laws demanded by the extreme left.”
“Google is a force online, dominating internet search and technology services that deliver targeted ads to consumers. For years, we have heard complaints that Google has used multiple acquisitions and its unmatched advantage in consumer targeting to undermine rivals and limit competition. As the Justice Department and several state enforcers investigate Google’s conduct in digital advertising markets, it is critical that the Antitrust Subcommittee focus on the lack of competition in these online markets and the impact on consumers,” Klobuchar said.

470,"July 27, 2020",Australian Regulator Says Google Misled Users Over Data Privacy,"


Australia’s competition regulator on Monday accused Alphabet’s Google of misleading consumers to get permission for use of their personal data for targeted advertising, seeking a fine “in the millions” and aiming to establish a precedent, presented The New York Times. 
The move comes as scrutiny grows worldwide over data privacy, with US and European lawmakers recently focusing on how tech companies treat user data.
In court documents, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accused Google of not explicitly getting consent or properly informing consumers of a 2016 move to combine personal information in Google accounts with browsing activities on non-Google websites.
“This change … was worth a lot of money to Google,” said commission chairman Rod Sims. “We allege they’ve achieved it through misleading behavior.”
The change allowed Google to link the browsing behaviour of millions of consumers with their names and identities, providing it with extreme market power, the regulator added.
“We consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” Sims said. 
However, Google said the change was optional and consumer consent was sought through prominent and easy-to-understand notifications.

471,"July 26, 2020",Democratic Senators Speak Against Google’s Fitbit Deal,"


Senators Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and five other Democratic senators urged the Justice Department to be cautious in reviewing Google’s planned purchase of Fitbit, saying the tech giant had already cemented its dominance in some areas through acquisitions, reported Reuters. 
In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, the seven Democratic senators expressed skepticism that the purchase was solely a bid to enter the wearables market since Google’s revenues are largely based on advertising driven by consumer data. 
“Adding Fitbit’s consumer data to Google’s could further diminish the ability of companies to compete with Google in … ad technology markets and could raise barriers for potential competitors to enter these markets,” the lawmakers wrote.
Warren and Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, have both been outspoken on antitrust issues. They were joined on the letter by Senators Richard Blumenthal, Cory Booker, Mazie Hirono, Sherrod Brown, and Mark Warner. 
The lawmakers also noted that Google had formally told European antitrust enforcers that it would not use Fitbit’s health data to help it target ads. The senators called the offer “modest, short-term concessions.” 
Fitbit’s fitness trackers and other devices monitor users’ daily steps, calories burned, and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, sleep duration and quality, and heart rate.

472,"July 23, 2020",Brussels Wants Major Concessions From Google In Fitbit Deal,"


The EU is demanding Google make major concessions relating to the acquisition of Fitbit if the deal is to be allowed to go forward, FT reports, citing unidentified people with direct knowledge of the matter.
According to the Financial Times, the EU wants Google to pledge it will not use Fitbit’s health data to enhance its search advantage and that it will grant third parties equal access to it.
Since it was announced last November, the acquisition has faced steep opposition from consumer groups and regulators, who have raised concerns over the effect of Google’s access to Fitbit’s health data on competition. 
EU regulators now want the company to pledge that it will not use that information to “further enhance its search advantage” and that it will grant third parties equal access to it, these people said. The move comes days after the EU regulators suffered a major blow in Luxembourg, losing a landmark case that would have forced Apple pay back €14.3b in taxes to Ireland.
Brussels insiders said that a refusal by Google to comply with the new demands would probably result in a protracted investigation, adding that such a scenario could ultimately leave the EU at a disadvantage.

 A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet’s Google will collaborate with India’s Reliance Industries on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world’s second-largest mobile market, reported Reuters.
Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company’s annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost “4G or even 5G” smartphone that Reliance would design. 
The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India. 
Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country. 
“If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,” said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys. 
Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.

A Congressional Democrat has called on Apple and Google to prevent smartphone apps from compromising national security by sharing data with foreign entities “including China and Russia,” as viral video app TikTok faces a potential US ban over its Beijing ties, reported The Financial Times. 
In letters sent on Tuesday, July 14, to Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Stephen Lynch, the Democratic congressman who chairs the House oversight subcommittee for national security, wrote, “As industry leaders, Apple and Google can and must do more to ensure that smartphone applications made available to US citizens on their platforms protect stored data from unlawful foreign exploitation, and do not compromise US national security.” 
Mr Cook and Mr Pichai are both expected to testify before Congress on July 27, alongside Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, to face questions from the House judiciary antitrust subcommittee. While Mr Lynch did not name specific apps, he cited evidence from the office of the US director of national intelligence, who said last week that mobile apps made or owned by foreign entities could present a “national security risk” because “developers can deliberately code . . . backdoors or vulnerable data streams” into apps that could grant access to software, data, “or even — in some cases — the device itself.”
He added, however, that banning some smartphone apps altogether might inhibit innovation and enable censorship.

EU antitrust enforcers are asking interested parties whether Google’s pledge not to use fitness tracker maker Fitbit’s health data for its advertising, and to separate the dataset from its own, might ease concerns over their tie up. 
Alphabet’s Google made the pledge to the European Commission late on Monday to try address concerns that its $2.1 billion takeover of Fitbit might boost its clout in online advertising and search. 
The EU executive is now seeking feedback from rival makers of wearable devices, app developers and other online service providers as well as healthcare providers before deciding whether to accept the offer, demand more or open a full-scale investigation. 
While the feedback is important, sources had already told Reuters the data pledge could assuage EU competition worries and help the deal secure approval.
To ring-fence Fitbit’s health data, Google has proposed to set up a structure for data storage consisting of auditable technical and process controls called Fitbit Account Data, the EU questionnaire seen by Reuters said. 
This data will not be transferred to a Google account nor be available to Google ads, while Fitbit will be the sole legal data controller, the document said.

Alphabet’s Google will invest about $4.5 billion in Jio Platforms, the company behind India’s largest telecom provider by subscribers, giving the American tech giant a powerful partner for its plans to get hundreds of millions more people online, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
Google will take a 7.7% stake in Jio, which brought the internet to millions of people who previously couldn’t afford it by offering inexpensive handsets and data plans. It now has more than 388 million subscribers. 
Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Jio’s parent company, Reliance Industries Ltd., and India’s richest man, announced the deal at a Reliance shareholder meeting Wednesday.
“Google has empowered millions of Indians to access helpful information and, like Jio, is a force for change and innovation,” Mr. Ambani said. ”We welcome Google onboard and are excited about our partnership for what it can deliver to Indians.”
Jio and Google also announced that they will work together to develop affordable smartphones.
The tie-up provides Jio with cash and another sophisticated international partner. In return, Google will get a powerful local ally. Reliance Industries has interests ranging from retail to refining and is known for its understanding of regulators and regulations.
Jio has raised billions of dollars from leading technology and private-equity firms around the world this year. The investment by Google follows others by companies includingFacebook, Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, KKR, General Atlantic, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, sovereign investor Mubadala Investment and Qualcomm Ventures.

477,"July 14, 2020",Google Objects To Belgian Regulator’s Fine Over Privacy Violations,"



Google is objecting to a fine issued by Belgium’s privacy watchdog, the latest for alleged violations from a European privacy regulator.
The Data Protection Authority (DPA), a Brussels-based independent agency established to ensure the protection of personal data, fined the technology giant a record 600,000 euros ($681,400), Bloomberg reported. DPA ruled Google was “grossly negligent” by refusing to remove links to news articles that the authority said involved unproven harassment incidents from more than 10 years ago.
Google told Bloomberg that it intends to appeal the Belgian authority’s decision in court, saying it has worked “to strike a sensible, principled balance between people’s rights of access to information and privacy.”
The Belgian authority said it ruled in favor of a complaint by an unidentified public figure who was unsuccessful in convincing Google to remove links to a harassment complaint and what regulators called “political labeling,” the news service reported.
Google was cited by the DPA for its failure to delete links regulators ruled were harmful to the person’s reputation under the EU’s Right to be Forgotten measure. The ordinance provides the right to have negative private information removed from internet search engines and other directories.
The law was established in 2014 by the EU’s Court of Justice and enables residents of the member countries to ask search engines to remove links containing their personal information.
The justices ruled search engines must balance the requests against the public’s right to access a link associated with the searched-for name, considering, for example, whether the person is a public figure.
But Google opposed the ruling.
“We didn’t believe this case met the European Court of Justice’s criteria for delisting published journalism from search,” Google told Bloomberg in an emailed statement. “We thought it was in the public’s interest that this reporting remain searchable.”
Since that court decision, Google reportedly has removed more than 1 million links for search results that appear in the EU.

478,"July 14, 2020",Google Steers Users to YouTube Over Rivals,"


By Sam Schechner, Kirsten Grind and John West
When choosing the best video clips to promote from around the web, Alphabet Inc.’s Google gives a secret advantage to one source in particular: itself.
Or, more specifically, its giant online-video service, YouTube.
Take a clip of basketball star Zion Williamson that the National Basketball Association posted online in January, when he made his highly anticipated pro debut. The clip was popular on Facebook Inc., drawing more than one million views and nearly 900 comments as of March. A nearly identical YouTube version of the clip with the same title was seen about 182,000 times and garnered fewer than 400 comments.
But when The Wall Street Journal’s automated bots searched Google for the clip’s title, the YouTube version featured much more prominently than the Facebook version.
The Journal conducted Google searches for a selection of other videos and channels that are available on YouTube as well as on competitors’ platforms. The YouTube versions were significantly more prominent in the results in the vast majority of cases.
This isn’t by accident.
Engineers at Google have made changes that effectively preference YouTube over other video sources, according to people familiar with the matter. Google executives in recent years made decisions to prioritize YouTube on the first page of search results, in part to drive traffic to YouTube rather than to competitors, and also to give YouTube more leverage in business deals with content providers seeking traffic for their videos, one of those people said.

Google must respond by July 22.
Among the Google product changes targeted by investigators is the company’s decision in 2016 to require advertisers to buy YouTube ads through Google’s products; the adoption of accelerated mobile pages, known as AMP, a technology that stores mobile websites on Google servers; and the January announcement that the tech giant will eliminate third-party cookies from the Chrome web browser.

481,"July 13, 2020",Clearing Up Misconceptions about Google’s Ad Tech Business,"


By Daniel S. Bitton (Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider LLP) & Stephen Lewis (RBB Economics LLP)
The technologies that advertisers, website owners and app developers use to buy and sell advertising space online (“ad tech”) have attracted regulatory interest around the world.Interest in this area is understandable. Ad tech tools help website owners and app developers (collectively, “publishers”) optimize their ad sales and thereby fund free original content. Advertisers similarly rely on such tools to optimize return on their digital ad spend.However, it appears that scrutiny of ad tech is in part driven by fundamental misunderstandings about Google’s products and practices in that space.In this paper, we explain how ad tech products operate in general, how Google’s ad tech products have evolved and work today and how ad tech fits into Google’s overall business model. We then address several mistaken propositions and theories advanced by two Google critics, Damien Geradin and Dimitrios Katsifis (G&K),2 which seem to have colored some of the regulatory interest in Google’s ad tech business. This paper is not a comprehensive economic and legal assessment of G&K’s antitrust theories. There are fundamental legal and economics deficiencies in their theories that are not addressed in this paper. Instead, while we follow a legal and economic antitrust framework, we focus primarily on how and why the facts, as we understand them, do not support G&K’s theories.G&K center their claims on Google’s popular Ad Manager product. This ad tech product helps publishers manage the sale and placement of ads on their websites and apps, and as part of that service, connects them with ad buyers through various mechanisms,4 including ad auctions. G&K claim that Google has designed Ad Manager to stifle competition by favoring its own ad auctions over those offered by competitors, and has been able to extract monopolistic rents. As we explain in this paper, their theories are unfounded. The paper is structured as follows:In Section II, we describe ad tech concepts and terminology relevant to G&K’s theories, including Google’s products. We also explain how the particular ad tech concepts on which G&K are focused—open ad auctions operated by ad tech intermediaries—fit into the greater online advertising marketplace and represent a relatively small sales channel in that marketplace. Most advertiser spend on online display advertising does not involve such intermediated open ad auctions.In Section III, we examine how Google’s business model as a search engine and vertically integrated ad tech provider affects its incentives, and the implications of that for G&K’s theories. Google makes the large majority of its ad revenue from Google Search, and search engines are more useful if there continues to be a wealth of free, original online content for which to search. That suggests that Google should have strong economic reasons to facilitate a competitive ad tech sector, because competitive and innovative ad tech supports publishers’ ability to fund free and original content. Trying to stifle competition in ad tech, on the other hand, would undercut publishers’ ability to fund free and original content and thus ultimately hurt Google’s search business. As a search engine and vertically integrated ad tech provider, Google also has incentives to balance the interests of all ecosystem participants—users, publishers, and advertisers—and promote the long-term viability of the open Internet. That includes incentives to solve market externalities or “tragedy of the commons” problems, such as when publishers adopt ad practices in search of incremental revenue for themselves, only to drive users to adopt ad blockers, which harms publishers and advertisers. G&K’s theories focus exclusively on the interests of publishers. As a result, they mistake conduct by Google that attempts to balance the interests of all ecosystem participants as anticompetitive.

482,"July 10, 2020",CA Probes Google For Potential Antitrust Violations,"


California has opened its own antitrust probe into Google, intensifying the pressure on the search giant already in the middle of investigations by the Justice Department and a host of other states, according to three people with knowledge of the inquiry, reported Politico.
The move by California’s attorney general comes as Google has come under increasing scrutiny from both Congress and foreign regulators for its market conduct and acquisitions that have turned it into the world’s top search engine and the most profitable online advertising company.
In September, attorneys general from 48 states,Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia announced an antitrust investigation into Google focused on the company’s dominance of the advertising technology market. Over the past 10 months, that investigation — led by Texas — has expanded into other aspects of the company’s business, including its conduct in the search market.
California, which houses Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, was the most notable holdout in the multi-state group, and Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra has repeatedly declined to answer questions about why the state wasn’t a participant.
The California antitrust probe is a separate investigation from the multi-state effort, two of the individuals said. All of the individuals spoke on condition of anonymity to talk openly about a confidential probe. Alabama is now the only state that is not investigating the company.
It was not immediately clear what aspect of Google’s business California is targeting. A spokesperson for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra declined to comment. The spokesperson, Sarah Lovenheim, said it is office policy to not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.
The Justice Department in August opened its own antitrust investigation and has been working closely with the states. The federal agency is expected to file a suit against the company as soon as next month, though whether the states will join that effort or proceed with their own remains an open question. DOJ is looking at allegations the company has monopolized the advertising technology market and used exclusive contracts to maintain its dominance in search.
In addition to the investigations, Google is facing accusations of abusing its dominance in Congress. Chief executive Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify in front of a House Judiciary panel along with the CEOs of Apple, Amazon and Facebook.

The US Justice Department is nearing a lawsuit against Alphabet’s Google for antitrust violations and a coalition of states that are conducting a parallel investigation are divided over the best strategy for taking on the Internet giant, according to Bloomberg.
While the multistate investigation into Google’s dominance of the digital advertising market is in its final stages, some state attorneys general are advocating to take more time to investigate Google’s conduct in other markets and potentially bring a broader case against the company, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.
The disagreement could affect whether states join a Justice Department complaint about Google. Like the states, federal antitrust enforcers have been investigating whether Google is thwarting competition in the digital advertising market, where it holds a commanding position.
The Justice Department, which is coordinating with the states, wants to move quickly, two of the people said, and is on track to file a complaint this summer, another person said, though it wasn’t clear what conduct the complaint will ultimately target. The Department declined to comment.
“While we continue to engage with ongoing investigations, our focus is on creating free products that lower costs for small businesses and help Americans every day,” Google said in a statement.
State attorneys general can play a pivotal role in enforcement cases against companies when they band together in group investigations. They joined the Justice Department in suing Microsoft  in 1998 for antitrust violations. The case nearly led to the break-up of the company when a judge sided with the government. After an appeals court reversed the ruling, the Justice Department under the George W. Bush administration settled the case.
Two people familiar with the states’ investigation said the split among the states reflects normal tension about the best litigation strategy. A broad complaint would cover more conduct, but would take more time to complete.

European regulators are investigating Google’s proposed $2.1 billion takeover of Fitbit, the San Francisco-based wearable technology maker, the Financial Times reported.
Consumer and privacy groups have argued that the deal should be blocked because Fitbit will give its new owner more data, making it impossible for other providers to compete against the popular search engine and advertising business, the news service reported.
The European Union (EU) sent in-depth questionnaires to Google’s and Fitbit’s rivals to determine whether the merger could potentially hurt competition – specifically, whether fitness tracking apps in Google’s Play Store will suffer and whether the deal would provide Google with expanded profiling information to give its online search and advertising businesses an advantage, the report noted.
In a separate move, nearly two dozen consumer groups, including the European Consumer Organization (the Belgium-based umbrella group that represents 45 consumer agencies from 32 countries), and the Consumer Federation of America, the Washington, D.C. consumer interest nonprofit, sent out a warning about the transaction on Thursday (July 2).
“Regulators must assume that Google will in practice utilize the entirety of Fitbit’s currently independent unique, highly sensitive data set in combination with its own, particularly as this could increase its profits, or they must impose strict and enforceable limitations on data use,” they said in a joint statement.

Federal officials are set to meet Friday with state attorneys general who are pursuing their own antitrust probe of Google, according to reports. The virtual meeting will focus on the reach of a potential lawsuit and whether the states will join the feds’ complaint or bring their own.
A Google spokeswoman said the company continues to “engage with the ongoing investigations” led by US Attorney General William Barr and Texas AG Ken Paxton.
“Our focus is firmly on creating free products that help Americans every day and lower costs for small businesses,” the spokeswoman said in a statement.

493,"June 25, 2020",Google Agrees To Pay Some Publishers For Content,"




Google will pay for news content from select publishers as part of a new licensing program they announced. It says the content will form part of a “new news experience” coming later this year, launching first on its Google News and Discover services. In some cases, Google says it could offer free access to paywalled articles by paying content owners on the user’s behalf.
Google says it’s starting the program with publishers in Germany, Australia, and Brazil, but says that it’s got “more to come soon.” Publishing partners include Der Spiegel in Germany, and Schwartz Media in Australia, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Google’s announcement comes after multiple countries have stepped up efforts to have the search giant compensate publishers for the news content it links to. Australia recently unveiled plans to force tech platforms to help pay for the free content they profit from. In April, France’s competition authority ordered Google to pay for content from French publishers.
Google’s announcement comes as Facebook has just launched a new news tab in the US in which it pays some participating publishers for their work. Stories are curated by a team of human editors, and publishing partners include BuzzFeed, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Facebook is reportedly looking to expand this news tab to Europe.

494,"June 24, 2020",Small Business Advertisers Sue Google For Antitrust Violations,"


Several independent advertisers on Monday, June 22, filed a class action accusing Google of creating a monopoly in digital advertising and suing the tech company for antitrust violations under the Sherman Act and California’s Unfair Competition Law.
Plaintiffs Michael Devaney, Nicholas Arrieta, and Sara Yberra, acting on behalf of themselves and others, accuse Google and Alphabet of creating an illegal monopoly by eliminating competition in the display advertising ad-tech stack through acquisition of competitors, exclusivity provisions, interoperability and compatibility design choices, and development of its analytics services.
The plaintiffs — who bought digital ads through Google for their businesses, which include a photography business, a moving business, and an online store for bicycling hardware — separately purchased digital ads from Google. They claim to have overpaid for the ads and suffered financial loss, and that Google “wrongfully acquired and unlawfully maintained monopoly power in the relevant markets.”
From the purchase of the DoubleClick ad server to AdMob, which serves ads in apps, to the AdMeld supply-side platform, Google has developed or bought its way into the advertising business to capitalize on consumer searches and advertisements served on publisher sites.
“With its ability to track millions of users across millions of sites and apps, other publishers cannot compete with Google’s informational advantage,” according to Law Street Media, and the court document filed on Monday.

495,"June 24, 2020","DOJ, State AGs To Meet Friday On Google Antitrust Probe","


US Justice Department officials and some state attorneys general are set to meet on Friday to discuss ongoing antitrust probes into Alphabet’s Google unit, Fox News reported.
The meeting will be virtual and address the allegation that Google has used its dominant power as a search engine and tech giant to suppress competition. According to WSJ, the litigation planning is already well underway. The lawsuit could come as soon as this summer.
The focal point of the controversy is Google’s online advertising business, which has afforded the company the most valuable link in the chain of publishers and advertisers. But the lingering question is exactly how much of Google’s conduct the antitrust regulators are going to end up challenging, since Google holds such a dominant status in the market.
For its part, Google has maintained a denial that it is using its power to squash competition.
“We continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by Attorney General [William] Barr and Texas Attorney General [Ken] Paxton,” a Google spokeswoman said, according to WSJ. “Our focus is firmly on creating free products that help Americans every day and lower costs for small businesses.”
Some conservative officials have alleged that Google has a political bias in favor of liberal viewpoints. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, said she urged “mounting a full investigation that examines the company’s control over vast sectors of the internet economy, from online advertising to online search,” WSJ reported.
It is unknown exactly what course of action will be recommended through the meeting, and while many different states and officials have criticized Google, it’s not clear if they’re on the same page for this meeting.
The investigative actions into Google, spanning the entire US, have also included the tech giant’s Android Business and search engine.
Google has faced adversity elsewhere, such as in France, where the competition authority fined Google 150 million euros ($169.8 million) for anti-competitive behavior.

France’s top administrative court has confirmed a record €50 million (£45m) fine against Google for data protection violations.
While the fine represents a tiny fraction of Google’s annual revenues, it has a symbolic value as the largest such penalty to date. GDPR data protection rules introduced that took effect in 2018 allow regulators to fine companies up to 4% of their global annual turnover in serious cases.

Australia’s antitrust regulator warned Google’s planned $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker maker Fitbit may give it too much of people’s data, potentially hurting competition in health and online advertising markets.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the first regulator to voice concerns about the deal in a preliminary decision on Thursday. The Alphabet Inc-owned tech giant is already at loggerheads with the Australian government over planned new rules about how internet companies use personal information.
“Buying Fitbit will allow Google to build an even more comprehensive set of user data, further cementing its position and raising barriers to entry to potential rivals,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said on Thursday. “User data available to Google has made it so valuable to advertisers that it faces only limited competition.”

EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 20 whether to clear Alphabet Inc-owned Google’s US$2.1 billion bid for fitness trackers company Fitbit, a deal that has prompted concerns from consumer groups and privacy advocates, reported Reuters. 
Google sought EU approval on Monday, June 15, according to a filing on the European Commission’s website.
The EU competition enforcer can either clear the deal with or without concessions, or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
The acquisition would help Google compete with Apple and Samsung in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches. Other players are Huawei and Xiaomi.
While privacy concerns are not part of the EU antitrust review, the trove of health data generated from Fitbit devices used to monitor users’ daily steps, calories burned, and distance travelled and how Google plans to use it is expected to be a focus.

499,"June 11, 2020",Google Countersues Sonos In Patent Case,"


Google has countersued Sonos for patent infringement, following Sonos originally filing a patent lawsuit against Google in January. The lawsuit alleges that Sonos is infringing five Google patents covering mesh networking, echo cancellation, DRM, content notifications, and personalized search.
Google’s suit seems to serve a few purposes. One is obviously to countersue Sonos with its own patents. Another is for Google to show how it has been aggrieved after what it sees as helpful support for Sonos’ product development efforts.
“While Google rarely sues other companies for patent infringement, it must assert its intellectual property rights here,” the company says in its lawsuit. It characterizes the work it’s done to provide Google’s music services and Assistant voice assistant technology on Sonos products as “significant assistance in designing, implementing, and testing.”
The Sonos lawsuit filed in January alleged that Google had infringed five patents covering the setup, control, and synchronization of multiroom network speaker systems. Sonos claimed Google had stolen the technology after working with Sonos to integrate Google Play Music and had further insisted on harsh terms for Sonos to include the Google Assistant on its products, including sharing the full Sonos product roadmap for six months, even as Google was developing competing speaker products. Earlier this year, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence testified before the House Antitrust Committee that Google had blocked the company from enabling both Amazon’s Alexa assistant and the Google Assistant from being active at the same time.

500,"June 8, 2020","DOJ, States Eye Alleged Antitrust Issues In Google’s Ad Tech Business","


Alphabet’s Google is facing an investigation over potential antitrust violations by 50 of the nation’s state attorneys general led by Texas, CNBC reported.
Critics allege Google bundles its ad tools in a way that rivals can’t match, and its combination of search results, YouTube, Gmail, and other services are killing competition.
The AGs, and separately the US Department of Justice (DOJ), have been investigating Google’s business practices. They are considering a lawsuit against the 22-year-old Menlo Park, California, global technology giant. If successful, it would break up Google’s ad technology business, sources told CNBC.
It’s possible the AGs could lobby for alternatives for its ad technology business, such as imposing restrictions on how it runs its business, CNBC reported. But a suit may also include both options.
Some lawyers said breaking up Google’s ad technology business could be tough because it’s not a stand-alone unit.
“Courts are very concerned that by ripping a company apart, it hurts consumers and make[s] it worse for people that don’t have the expertise to do that,” Stephen Houck, one of the government lawyers in the Microsoft antitrust case two decades ago and now a Google advisor, told CNBC.
Still, big technology companies are under scrutiny. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to crack down on the liability protections for internet companies like Google. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed, if elected, he would establish a new department within the Justice Department to reexamine mergers and those under consideration.
Google has defended itself. In a blog post last year, it argued the ad technology industry is a crowded one with competitors including Telaria, Rubicon Project, and The Trade Desk, CNBC reported.
A Google spokesperson told CNBC the company continues discussions with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and it doesn’t have any updates or comments on speculation.
“The facts are clear,” she said. “Our digital advertising products compete across a crowded industry with hundreds of rivals and technologies, and have helped lower costs for advertisers and consumers.”
A spokesperson for Paxton, who is leading the ad tech part of the probe, declined to comment to CNBC, and a spokesperson for the DOJ did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Facebook’s photo transfer tool is now available globally half a year after an initial rollout in Europe, the company stated. 
Putting some resources into data portability looks like a collective strategy by powerful players to try to manage and fend off antitrust action that might otherwise see dominant empires broken up in the interests of rebalancing digital markets.
The data portability feature enables users of the social network to directly port a copy of their photos to Google’s eponymous photo storage service via encrypted transfer, rather than needing to download and manually upload photos themselves,  thereby reducing the hassle involved with switching to a rival service.
Facebook debuted the feature in Ireland at the end of last year, going on to open it up to more international markets earlier this year and granted access to users in the US and Canada in April.
Europe is certainly looking closely at updating its rulebook to tackle platform power, with legislative proposals targeting digital services slated before the end of the year.

US federal and state authorities are asking detailed questions about how to limit Google’s power in the online search market as part of their antitrust investigations into the tech giant, according to rival DuckDuckGo Inc.
Bloomberg reported that Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive officer of the privacy-focused search engine, has spoken with state regulators, and talked with the US Justice Department as recently as a few weeks ago.
Justice Department officials and state attorneys general asked the CEO about requiring Google to give consumers alternatives to its search engine on Android devices and in Google’s Chrome web browser, Weinberg said in an interview.“We’ve been talking to all of them about search and all of them have asked us detailed search questions,” he added.Weinberg’s comments shine a light into how the inquiry is examining Google’s core business — online search. 
Bloomberg has reported that the Justice Department and Texas are already examining Google’s dominance of the digital advertising market. The Justice Department and a coalition of states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton have been investigating the company for a year, and the DOJ has begun drafting a lawsuit, which could be filed in the coming months. It would kick off one of the most significant antitrust cases in the U.S. since the government sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.
The investigations have been wide-ranging and are looking into various parts of Google’s business. States including Utah and Iowa are focusing on search, according to people familiar with the matter. Texas is looking at the digital ad market and related technology.

Google has rejected demands it pay hundreds of millions of dollars per year in compensation to Australian news media under a government-imposed revenue sharing deal, The Guardian Reported. 
The company’s top executive in Australia said Google made barely AU$10 million (US$6.7 million) per year from news-linked advertising, a fraction of a government watchdog’s estimates for the sector.
In an effort being closely watched around the world, Australia is set to unveil plans to force major internet firms to share advertising revenue they earn from news featured in their services.
The country’s competition regulator, the ACCC, has estimated that Google and Facebook together earn some AU$6 billion (US$4 billion) per year from advertising in Australia.
Leading news publishers have demanded the two companies pay at least 10% of that money each year to local news organisations, which they say have lost the vast majority of their advertising revenue to the global technology giants.

504,"May 28, 2020","Google, Amazon And Other Big Tech Making M&A Deals Amid Pandemic","


Giant tech companies are seeking deals at their fastest pace in years, fueled by COVID-19 despite an increase in scrutiny by regulators.
The Financial Times reported Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft have made 19 deals so far this year, according to Refinitiv, the London-based global provider of financial market data. This represents the fastest pace of acquisitions and strategic investments since 2015.
On Wednesday, May 27, PYMNTS reported Amazon is negotiating to purchase the California self-driving car company Zoox. Two years ago it was valued at US$3.2 billion, FT reported. 
Last month, Facebook closed a US$5.7 billion deal for a minority stake in Indian telecom startup Reliance Jio, giving the social media giant a larger foothold in the region.
These coronavirus pandemic deals represent a different world compared to the 2001 recession and the financial crisis of 2008, when tech companies stayed on the sidelines as the stock market tumbled, the news service reported.
“One big difference between now and the last financial crisis is the cash balances of the tech majors are in the hundreds of billions, all effectively onshore, due to the Trump tax changes,” John Gnuse, a tech M&A adviser at Lazard Asset Management, a New York financial advisory firm that engages in investment banking, told FT.
These deals also solidify the tech giants’ deep pockets amid the COVID-19 crisis, as they seek to take advantage of their record valuations and become the dominant players in emerging sectors, FT reported.
The transactions come as some lawmakers have called for more scrutiny and a pause on mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
Late last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts) and US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrat – New York) proposed legislation to halt harmful mergers, that they say will protect Americans from further consolidation and concentration during the COVID-19 crisis. 
The lawmakers introduced the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act. If approved, the measure would curb M&As during the pandemic by companies with more than US$100 million in revenues.
“This crisis threatens to further entrench the power of Big Tech,” Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington, DC, think-tank, told the news service. “These companies are already extraordinarily powerful, but they’re well-positioned to emerge as the biggest winners of COVID-19 unless some legislative action is taken.”
While the Federal Trade Commission has begun a review of acquisitions made by the five tech giants dating back to 2010, antitrust advocates are skeptical that the Department of Justice or regulators can control spending by big tech companies.

India’s antitrust body is looking into allegations that Alphabet Inc’s Google is abusing its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country, five sources familiar with the case told Reuters.
The complaint was filed in February and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has kept the identity of the complainant confidential, the first source with direct knowledge of the case said. 
The complaint alleges the U.S. tech giant more prominently showcases its Google Pay app inside its Android app store in India, giving it an unfair advantage over apps of competitors which hurts consumers, the source added. 
Google did not respond to a request for comment. Two of the sources said the watchdog informed Google about the case being filed a few days ago and the company will respond in due course. 
A source said the case filing is currently being reviewed by senior CCI members. Typically in such cases, Google will appear before the watchdog which will then decide on the way forward. 
The CCI can direct its investigations unit to conduct a wider probe into the allegations, or dismiss the case if it finds no merit in it.  “It is at a consideration stage,” the source said.

France, which has long been sceptical of the growing power of US Big Tech companies, is seeking to bypass Apple and Google for a smartphone app to help trace people infected with the novel coronavirus.
The move, which will leave France relatively isolated in Europe alongside Britain and Norway, reflects differences on how such apps should be structured, who has access to sensitive data, and their effectiveness.
Being dependent on Apple and Google means “staying in an extremely restrictive framework for usage” of the data, said a source close to France’s contract tracing effort.
“It is Google and Apple who are defining the debate” in what is essentially a public health issue, the source added.
A number of countries, including India, have already deployed “contact tracing” apps on smartphones that track a person’s contacts and alert them if need be.
These apps can be based either on a decentralised or centralised architecture.
A decentralised architecture keeps the information about whom a person has been in contact with on the smartphone. If the person declares themselves to have been infected by the coronavirus, then those people deemed to have been in close contact for an extended period receive a notification to isolate themselves and get tested.
In a centralised system, the data is managed by an authority, for example a national health service, which would have access to the data to ensure those who are exposed are indeed following the proper health and isolation recommendations.
Apple and Google banded together last month to develop coronavirus contact tracing technology that would work across their operating systems.

According to The Guardian, Australia’s competition watchdog has promised to even up the market imbalance between news organizations and tech giants. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking feedback on a wide range of issues with a mandatory code of conduct, which will be in place later this year.
The rules will force Google and Facebook to pay for news content. “A collective boycott, or the threat of a collective boycott, may encourage each of Google and Facebook to offer news media businesses more appropriate remuneration for the use of their content,” the concepts paper which canvasses different mechanisms stated.
ACCC chair Rod Sims says the new regime would allow media organisations to bargain with tech giants over fees. “We need to even up the bargaining,” he said on Tuesday, May 19.
“We need to give that teeth and make that work, and see as best we can to come up with the sort of outcome you’d have in a competitive market.”
Rod Sims, said the tight timetable had been influenced by the urgency of the media crisis due to the collapse of advertising revenue during the pandemic, but resolutions may not come in time for some media organisations.
“Covid is a force majeure event of all time,” Sims said. “Clearly it’s affecting local news. No point having a local pub advertise in the paper if the pub is closed. The code will help, whether it helps in time I just don’t know.”

508,"May 19, 2020",Obama Era Antitrust Official Lays Out Case Against Google,"


A former top antitrust economist in the Obama administration argued Monday that Alphabet’s Google has used its powerful position in the digital advertising space to stifle competition, outlining a possible case against the search giant at the same time federal and state enforcers are making preparations to go to court, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
“There is significant reason for concern that Google has violated U.S. antitrust law,” Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton, the chief economist in the Justice Department’s antitrust division from 2011-2012, wrote in a new academic paper entitled “Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google.”
The paper argues Google is using its dominance in search as a springboard to dominate the adjacent market of display advertising, harming publishers, advertisers and consumers in the $130 billion digital advertising market.
Google’s tactics in the online advertising ecosystem are a focus of Justice Department antitrust officials and state attorneys general who are investigating whether the company has engaged in unlawful monopolization. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the Justice Department and the states are likely to sue Google later this year.
Ms. Scott Morton co-wrote the paper with David Dinielli, a senior adviser with the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investing firm of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, which is advocating for stronger antitrust enforcement to curb the power of dominant tech platforms. The authors base their analysis on data uncovered by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority last December in its preliminary study of the UK digital advertising market, arguing that the US market behaves similarly.

509,"May 18, 2020",Here’s What an Antitrust Case Against Google Might Look Like,"
By Gilad Edelman, Wired
OVER THE WEEKEND, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal and state officials are likely to file antitrust lawsuits against Google later this year, focusing on the company’s dominance of the digital advertising industry. This morning, thanks to a pair of former Obama administration officials, we got our best look yet at what the theory of the case may be. In a new paper released by the Omidyar Network, they argue that Google has harmed competition in the US, and identify 20 different ways in which it may have broken the law on its road to digital advertising domination.
Until recently, the Big Tech antitrust movement has mostly been driven by outsiders who challenged the conventional legal wisdom. The authors of the new paper, by contrast, are very much a part of the establishment: David Dinielli served as special counsel in the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division, and Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale School of Management, was its top economist from 2011 to 2012—during a time when the White House and Google were as chummy as can be. They’re the kind of people who could end up working on antitrust in a Joe Biden administration, should he win in November. While their paper is unconnected from any official government investigation (its timing is coincidental), it’s as good a window as we have into how current antitrust enforcers may be thinking.
Titled “Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google,” the paper’s big-picture argument is simple. Google might be best known for search, maps, and email, but it makes most of its money through advertising. Over the past decade or so, the company has achieved a dominant position at each step of the way between advertiser and internet user. It uses that power, the paper argues, to extract a toll from everyone who participates in that market—earning essentially free money above whatever value it creates.
The authors are careful to note that they’re not going so far as to allege specific antitrust law violations. “Without access to any confidential information, it would not be appropriate to say, ‘So-and-so violated the law,’” said Morton in an interview last week. Still, she said, “What I can see publicly gives me grave concern that there’s been a violation of the law, that’s for sure.”
Gene Kimmelman, who worked with Morton as chief counsel of the DOJ antitrust division under Obama and advised on the paper, said that some of the conduct could have innocent explanations. “But the fact that we found so many of them, and a pattern of behavior, is what is so troublesome about this,” he said.
Google rejects the idea that its ad business poses any monopoly problems. In an emailed statement, it said, “Competition is flourishing, and publishers and marketers have enormous choice . . . the price of digital advertising has fallen by more than 40% since 2010. No other medium has seen such a large drop. The result is that expenditure on advertising as a fraction of GDP has never been lower, with cost savings going directly to businesses and consumers.”
The question, however, is whether businesses and consumers would be benefiting even more in a market less dominated by Google—and whether some of those cost savings have come at the unfair expense of the publishers running the ads.
There’s a long series of steps—occurring nearly instantaneously—between a company paying to place an ad and that ad being shown to a pair of human eyeballs. Remarkably, Google dominates nearly every one of those steps. Since the findings of the state and federal investigations are still confidential, Dinielli and Morton rely on a comprehensive report by the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority last year to estimate the US digital advertising market. According to the report, the company controls 90 percent of the publisher ad server market, meaning if a publisher wants to sell ad space, 90 percent of the time it’s going through Google. It controls between 40 and 60 percent of the supply-side platform market, which is where different publishers come together to automatically bid on ads. On the other side of the auction sit demand-side platforms, where advertisers bid to place their ads. Google has 50 to 70 percent of that market.

510,"May 15, 2020",DOJ and State AGs Likely To Bring Antitrust Suits Against Google: WSJ,"


Both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general are likely to file antitrust lawsuits against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and are well into planning for litigation, according the Wall Street Journal.
The Justice Department is moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, some of the people said. At least some state attorneys general—led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican—are likely to file a case, probably in the fall, people familiar with the matter said.
Much of the states’ investigation has focused on Google’s online advertising business. The company owns the dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers. The Justice Department likewise is making Google’s ad technology one of its points of emphasis. But it is also focusing more broadly on concerns that Google uses its dominant search business to stifle competition, people familiar with the matter said.
Details about the Justice Department’s legal theories for a case against Google couldn’t be learned.
Though the coronavirus pandemic has complicated work for the Justice Department, Attorney General William Barrhas devoted considerable resources to the Google probe and continues to treat it as a top priority. Mr. Barr told The Wall Street Journal in March that he wanted the Justice Department to make a final call this summer. “I’m hoping that we bring it to fruition early summer,” Mr. Barr said at the time. “And by fruition I mean, decision time.”
Mr. Paxton of Texas said the pandemic was not slowing the states’ efforts. “We’ve issued [civil subpoenas] to Google and impacted third parties. We hope to have the investigation wrapped up by fall,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement. “If we determine that filing is merited we will go to court soon after that.”
“We continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General Paxton, and we don’t have any updates or comments on speculation. Our focus is firmly on providing services that help consumers, support thousands of businesses and enable increased choice and competition,” a Google spokeswoman said.
The department continues to gather information in its probe and all signs point toward it bringing a case, the people said, but both the federal and state investigations are ongoing and no final decisions have been made. Investigations at times can be settled without litigation, though it’s unclear whether an agreement could be reached in the Google probes.

511,"April 20, 2020",Google and Facebook Must Pay for Local Journalism,"
By David Chavern, New York Times
The U.S. should emulate the French government’s resolve to fight for the news media industry.
Much of the news business is being hammered by the decline in advertising because of Covid-19, just when the public most needs reliable information. While digital audiences are way up, the rapid contraction in revenue has so far caused 33,000 news media employees to be furloughed, to be laid off or to suffer reduced pay.
But in the midst of this crisis, something very good just happened for journalism: French antitrust authorities ordered Google to negotiate with publishers to pay for the news content shown in search results. It is the first time that a major digital platform has been required to pay for news anywhere.
France’s action stems from a new European Union Copyright Directive, and Germany and other countries will be next. This means that in the United States, the pressure to similarly compensate stressed local publishers will be extremely high.
There are several ways the pressure on Google could be brought to bear. If Congress passes the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, publishers would be allowed to negotiate rates with Google as a group. Alternatively, publishers might finally be forced to undertake their own lengthy copyright litigation. In any case, I believe that Google will eventually be required to treat news publishers, like music publishers, as equals.
We have argued for some time that the big tech platforms should be an answer for journalism, rather than a problem. They are the main distributors of news and they benefit greatly from the engagement that comes with it. Just think of all of the hundreds of millions of people who went to Google and Facebook over the last few months for information about the coronavirus.
These platforms pay for music and lots of other kinds of content, and last year Facebook even agreed to pay a limited number of publishers for its News Tab. But most local publishers were left out of that deal. And Google has refused to pay them anything.

512,"April 20, 2020",Australia Forces Facebook and Google To Share Advertising Revenue,"
 Facebook and Google will be forced to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies after the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, instructed the competition watchdog to develop a mandatory code of conduct for the digital giants amid a steep decline in advertising brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
In its response to the landmark digital platforms inquiry in December, the federal government asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to develop a code between media companies and digital platforms including Google and Facebook.
The code was to require the companies to negotiate in good faith on how to pay news media for use of their content, advise news media in advance of algorithm changes that would affect content rankings, favour original source news content in search page results, and share data with media companies.

513,"April 19, 2020",EU Pressures Google Over Privacy In Coronavirus Tracing Apps,"
Brussels has stepped up pressure on Google to respect EU privacy laws as the US search group joins forces with Apple to help in the development of Covid-19 contact tracing apps, reported The Financial Times. 
The US tech companies are working to develop a system that will alert individuals of possible exposure to coronavirus in the hope that this will allow cities to emerge from severe lockdowns and kick-start their ailing economies.  
However, there are growing concerns among civil society groups and EU regulators that the introduction of such technologies — even on a voluntary basis, could lead to abuse and breaches of individuals’ privacy. 
Thierry Breton, the EU’s Single Market Commissioner, held a 30-minute teleconference on Wednesday, April 15, with Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai during which he said Brussels would be scrutinizing closely how the service is rolled out in the bloc, according to people with direct knowledge of the talks.
Through the EU’s digital agency, DG Connect, regulators in Brussels will assess potential risks to privacy before the tool is released, which could be as soon as early May, those with knowledge of the discussions said. Mr Breton warned that the design of the app could “trigger concerns on privacy rules” and undermine the whole venture. 
While he is in favor of rolling out tracing apps, the commissioner has been vocal in his opposition to the introduction of apps that would track individuals’ movements in real time using GPS technology.

514,"April 14, 2020",Canada Watching Google ‘closely’ After French Ruling,"
Canada’s Competition Bureau is closely following a French regulator’s ruling that Google must work out new arrangements to pay publishers and news agencies whose content is featured on its site. But experts in copyright law and digital media don’t expect Canada to follow suit, reported The Star. 
The Autorité de la concurrence ruled last week that Google must negotiate a repayment agreement with news companies and publishers for using their content. 
The ruling stems from a November 2019 complaint from two unions representing press publishers and a French-headquartered news agency, that claimed Google displayed their content unfairly in snippets on its service, costing them important revenue. 
“The Competition Bureau is aware of this decision … (but) regarding the conduct in question, it would be inappropriate for the bureau to speculate as to whether it may represent a contravention of (Canadian law),” Marcus Callaghan, a spokesperson for the Canadian regulator, said in a statement Monday, April 13. 
“The bureau must conduct a thorough and complete examination of the facts before deciding whether to challenge any type of alleged conduct.” 
According to the complainants, search engines represent between 26% and 90% of their redirected traffic. Google’s display policy meant publishers had to allow Google to display article extracts, photos, and more without compensation — otherwise they wouldn’t be displayed at all.

515,"April 12, 2020","Google, Apple Team Up To Enable Coronavirus Tracking Tech","
Apple and Google are collaborating on a new technology to track the spread of the coronavirus by using Bluetooth.
As reported by Reuters, the new technology could be available as early as mid-May for iPhone and Android devices.
The platform, which the companies called “Contact Tracing,” would alert smartphone users if they come into contact with an infected person.
The announcement by the California-based tech giants on Friday, April 10, came as the U.S. death count surpassed 18,000 and is forecast to reach 60,415 in the summer, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.
“All of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world’s most pressing problems,” the companies said in a statement. “Through close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of COVID-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.”
Apple stated that since the virus can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person, the healthcare community agrees that contact tracing will help to end the spread.
In a blog post, Google wrote that privacy is key. Users’ consent is required and the tool doesn’t collect personally identifiable information (PII), user location data, or the list of people you’ve been in contact with. People who test positive are not identified to other users, and the contact tracing information will only be used by public health authorities for COVID-19 pandemic management.
Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a tweet on Friday that the project would be done in a way that honors “transparency” and “consent.”

516,"April 9, 2020",France’s Regulator Orders Google To Pay For News Reuse,"
France’s competition authority has ordered Google to negotiate with publishers to pay for reuse of snippets of their content, such as can be displayed in its News aggregation service or surfaced via Google Search.
According to Tech Crunch, the country was the first of the European Union Member States to transpose the neighboring right for news into national law, following the passing of a pan-EU copyright reform last year.
Among various controversial measures the reform included a provision to extend copyright to cover content such as the ledes of news stories which aggregators such as Google News scrape and display. The copyright reform as a whole was voted through the EU parliament in March 2019, while France’s national law for extended press publishers rights came into force in October 2019.
A handful of individual EU Member States, including Germany and Spain, had previously passed similar laws covering the use of news snippets, without successfully managing to extract payments from Google, as lawmakers had hoped.
In Spain, for example, which made payments to publishers mandatory, Google instead chose to pull the plug on its Google News service entirely. But publishers who lobbied for a pan-EU reform hoped a wider push could turn the screw on the tech giant.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has stepped up its investigation of Google’s proposed US$2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit, a deal that critics say could pose increased threats to customer privacy, two sources close to the situation told The Post.
In a move that typically signals increased scrutiny for a merger, regulators are now conducting a so-called second request review, asking for more documents and taking additional time to investigate the deal, the sources said.
Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the DOJ’s antitrust division, has recused himself from the case because of his past history as a lobbyist working for Alphabet’s Google.
Now, it is the Attorney General William Barr who is issuing civil investigative demands (CIDs) to parties in the investigation and will be more directly involved in the review than he would be normally, sources said.
Barr told the Wall Street Journal in a March 23 article that his investigation of Google’s overall anti-competitive behavior in suppressing competition would be wrapped up by early summer.
“One would think Google would be a lower priority for the government until Corona clears,” Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel told The Post. “But given Barr’s statement, it seems like he hasn’t been deterred.”

518,"March 19, 2020",Google Firebase Part Of US Antitrust Probe,"
Some app developers claim Google is pressuring them to embed a code in their products that will expand Google’s access to consumer data and give it an advantage over competitors. The concerns involving Firebase, a software offered for apps, are part of an investigation by state attorneys general and the US Justice Department into whether Google has stifled competition, Reuters reported, citing “two people with knowledge of the investigation.”
Tools on Firebase, which is embedded in apps such as Instacart and Expedia, give Google information on consumers that it can use for targeted ads, Reuters explained. 
“It’s about data collection and ad serving,” Bob Lawson, founder and director of mobile software company Kumulos told Reuters. “The more Google knows about users, the more helpful it can be to advertisers.”
Firebase is bundled with Google’s Android Studio, a program to code apps for Google’s Android operating system. Over the last two years, Google has been making it difficult for apps to do even common functions without Firebase tools, sources told Reuters.
Google recently has told app developers that Firebase will “significantly improve” results of their Google ad campaigns, Reuters reported.
Firebase competitors are saying they want to be promoted on Android Studio as well. Android developers  “deserve to know that there is a choice,” said Mark Piller, chief executive of a competing software vendor, Backendless.
Firebase tools are optional, can be used with competing services, and can boost revenue for apps, Google told Reuters. With Firebase, app makers don’t have to code basic components or install alternatives that can be more complex, the company stated.

519,"March 17, 2020",Taking a Dive Into Google’s Chrome Cookie Ban,"
By Damien Geradin & Dimitrios Katsifis (Geradin Partners)
14 January 2020: After months of speculation, Google finally announced its plan to phase out third-party cookies on Chrome within the next two years. As Chrome boasts a worldwide market share in excess of 64%, the news sent shockwaves in the online advertising industry, whose foundations are largely built on web cookies. Concerns have been expressed that the banning of third-party cookies from Chrome could further strengthen Google and Facebook because of their large addressable first-party audience at scale. As to Google’s proposed “Privacy Sandbox” initiative, which it claims will “fundamentally enhance privacy on the web”, no one really knows how it will be implemented in practice and the industry seems to be confused. This uncertainty could hurt investment in an area that has already lost its attractiveness to investors.Against this background, this short paper examines Chrome’s policy change and its wider implications on the online advertising industry. Yet in order to appreciate the importance of the announced change we need first to get back to the basics and understand what cookies are and how they are used in online advertising. This is all the more the case considering that, while many people talk about “cookies”, few seem to have a solid understanding of what they are, how they are created, and for which purpose.

520,"March 16, 2020",EU Says Google Sends More Shopping Search Traffic to Rivals,"
Google is sending more shopping traffic to smaller rivals under a European Union order for it to show competing services more prominently, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said.
According to Bloomberg, shopping search services have “substantially increased” their use of Google’s offer to show their results in its shopping ads, Vestager said in a response to a lawmaker’s question. The services pay to appear in the product listing ads shown above search results, once provided only by Google.
“In June 2018, only one third of shopping units included at least one competitor, and around 6% of clicks in the unit went to competitors,” the EU said. “In January 2020, 79.7% of shopping units include at least one offer of a competitor, and 44.6% of clicks go to those.”
Google faces a threat of more EU fines if it doesn’t comply with the EU antitrust order to give equal treatment to rivals in shopping search ad results. Google chose how to obey the order and the EU has never explicitly stated whether the company is complying correctly. Several search services have criticized Google for using a paid auction to let them appear in the slots.

521,"March 16, 2020",Google Accused By Rival Of GDPR Breaches,"
Google is sharing users’ personal data between its services without acquiring specific consent to do so, thus flagrantly breaching fundamental principles of European data protection law, one of its smaller rivals has claimed.
In a new complaint submitted to the Irish data regulator, which oversees Google’s European business, Johnny Ryan, chief policy officer of the niche web browser Brave, accused the US tech company of operating an “internal data-free-for-all,” reported The Financial Times. 
The complaint alleges that Google is taking users’ consent for certain uses of their personal data, for instance location tracking or YouTube history, and applying it to a range of other services that are completely invisible to them, a practice that is illegal under the General Data Protection Regulation. 
In one example cited, Google’s privacy policy states that “Location History saves where you go with your devices. This data is saved even when you aren’t using a specific Google service, such as Google Maps or Search . . . This data may be saved and used in any Google service where you are signed in [and] . . . helps Google give you more personalised experiences . . . both on and off Google.”
The notice appears to seek the user’s consent to process their location data, according to the complaint, but also indicates that such data may be used for various unknown purposes that could have nothing to do with location. It also suggests “extensive or minor data sharing with an unknowable number of Google’s business partners,” the complaint claims. 
The submission to the regulator also includes a document titled “Inside the Black Box,” which itemizes evidence of Google’s “hundreds of publicly available processing purposes,” according to Mr Ryan, which range from advertising to analytics. “These repeated allegations from a commercial competitor don’t stand up to serious scrutiny,” said a Google spokesperson. 
“Twenty million users visit their Google Accounts each day to make choices about how Google processes their data. Our privacy policy and the explanations we provide users are clear about how data is stored and the choices users have.”

Corporate America joined the fight against the spread of coronavirus on Friday, march 13, as President Donald Trump and executives announced that Google would offer a website to help people determine whether they needed tests and retailers would set up drive-through testing in parking lots
According to Reuters, shares of Google parent Alphabet, Walmart, Target and drugstore owner CVS Health Corp all closed up more than 9%, in line with the broad stock market, though Alphabet dropped 2% after hours.
Pressure has been rising on US officials to increase and improve testing for the fast-spreading virus, which has reached almost every U.S. state and infected more than 1,660 people in the country.
“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website, it’s gonna be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” Trump said.
“Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now, made tremendous progress.” 
An administration presentation showed a potential user would be asked several questions on the website and then given a recommendation as to whether they should get a coronavirus test. 
Those requiring a test would be referred to a store that can provide assistance, potentially including a drive-through test, according to the administration’s presentation. Results would be available online in 24 to 36 hours.

523,"March 10, 2020",Yelp Tells Senators Why Google Needs To Be Broken Up,"


Yelp, one of Google’s most enduring critics, got to share its grievances with senators on the Antitrust Subcommittee on Tuesday, reported CNBC. 
At a hearing dedicated to “Examining Self-Preferencing by Digital Platforms,” Luther Lowe, Yelp’s senior vice president of public policy, laid out the company’s long-standing claims against Google. Yelp, which delivers local search results for consumers looking for restaurants or other businesses, has persistently complained that Google favors its own products and services in search, often at the expense to consumers in terms of quality.
Now, Yelp isn’t the only one paying attention. Regulators and lawmakers across the political spectrum are raising concerns about the power Big Tech companies wield over competitors who also rely on their services. Tuesday’s hearing was another demonstration that Yelp’s complaints are finally resonating in the U.S. as lawmakers introduce new policies and ramp up oversight.
Google didn’t always try to stifle competition, according to Lowe, who acknowledged co-founder Larry Page’s 2004 claimthat, “We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.” But Lowe said Google’s approach later shifted from this model around 2007 when it added answer boxes or “OneBoxes” that surfaced what Google seemed to determine would be the most relevant result for a user.
Because Google displayed the answer boxes at the top of search results, Lowe argued in his prepared testimony, “it had conditioned consumers to expect for the best or most relevant results from around the web — even though they no longer were. By doing so, Google physically demoted non-Google results even if they contained information with higher quality scores than the information Google.” Some of those non-Google results included Yelp, which Lowe said gets about 80% of its web traffic from Google.
“We build Google Search for our users,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “People want quick access to information and we’re constantly improving Search to help people easily find what they’re looking for,  whether it’s information on a web page, directions on a map, products for sale or a translation.”

524,"March 10, 2020",US Senators Think Google Probe Should Include Search,"


The US Justice Department should expand its antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google to include the internet giant’s conduct in online search, in addition to digitial advertising, two senators said.
According to Bloomberg, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Tuesday that the department’s inquiry appears to be too narrowly focused on advertising even though the company is a monopoly in internet search, “where the opportunities for anticompetitive conduct are substantial.”
“It is critical to remember that the company’s primary function is supplying a search engine to users,” they wrote to Attorney General William Barr. “Narrowing the investigation’s focus such that Google’s anti-competitive practices to dominate the online search market is not captured does a grave disservice to consumers.”
The senators’ plea comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing Tuesday to examine claims that internet platforms like Google favor their own services over those of rivals. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she was introducing legislation that would toughen antitrust enforcement by putting the burden on companies to justify conduct that thwarts rivals.
“All of us hear stories about how these companies are leveraging their scale or financial resources with unparalled access to users’ data and market power,” she said.
Executives of Yelp Inc., which has long complained that Google is thwarting competition in the market for local searches, told the senators on Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee that reports the Justice Department is focused on Google’s conduct in the digital advertising market are a concern.
“Making the focus too narrow would be a grave mistake,” Luther Lowe, Yelp’s senior vice president for public policy, said in written testimony. “You can’t look at Standard Oil without looking at oil. You cannot investigate Google without looking at search.”

AT&T  is working with the Justice Department as the government considers whether to bring an antitrust case against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, two years after the telecommunications giant was at loggerheads with the department over its acquisition of Time Warner, according to people familiar with the matter.AT&T has conferred several times with Justice officials to share its views that Google is stifling competition in the advertising sector, where AT&T is seeking to make inroads with its Xandr division, the people said. 
Those discussions have included an audience with the top DOJ officials overseeing the probe, they said, and the Dallas company also is cooperating with a group of state attorneys general, led by Texas, that are investigating Google’s ad practices.
Google has said the ad marketplace remains competitive, with the search giant competing against companies large and small to power digital advertising across the web.
It isn’t uncommon for rival companies and industry customers to speak with the Justice Department during an antitrust review, and the department has spoken with many companies during its Google probe, including Wall Street Journal publisher News Corp, a longtime Google critic, and others such as Yelp, DuckDuckGo and Oracle Corp.
AT&T in recent years has said it wants to take on Google and Facebook Inc. in the fight for advertising dollars. It has built its Xandr advertising division to leverage its wireless subscriber base, its pay-TV customers and the stable of entertainment content it acquired when it bought Time Warner in 2018.
Two years ago, it was AT&T that was embroiled with the Justice Department, which filed suit against the company over its proposed acquisition of Time Warner, alleging the merger would harm competition in pay-TV markets. AT&T won the case and the merger went ahead. 
“We talk to advertisers. You’re hard-pressed to find an advertiser who says, I would like to spend more with Facebook and Google,” AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson testified during the 2018 trial.
In court, he and other AT&T officials touted their plans to take on the tech giants in advertising as a counterargument to DOJ’s claims that the Time Warner transaction would be anticompetitive.

A US$50 million lawsuit brought against tech giant Google by Rep. Tusli Gabbard (Democrat – Hawaii) has reportedly been dismissed by a federal judge this week. Gabbard’s lawsuit alleged that Google censored the presidential candidate’s free speech by suspending her advertising account after she crushed Kamala Harris in a debate.
The New York Times reported that a US$50 million lawsuit brought against Google by presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has been dismissed by a federal judge. The lawsuit accused Google of infringing on Gabbard’s free speech by suspending her advertising account last year.
Gabbard’s lawsuit alleged that Google blocked her ads shortly after the first Democratic presidential debate. Gabbard’s lawsuit cited two Breitbart News scoops demonstrating the company’s political bias, the Google Tape, a recording of Google executives’ dismayed reaction to President Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, and leaked emails showing senior google employees trying to remove ad revenue from Breitbart.
This week judge Stephen V. Wilson of the US District Court for the Central District of California, granted Google’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit stating that Gabbard had failed to prove that the First Amendment clause that prohibits the government from curbing free speech applied to Google as a private company.
Judge Wilson wrote in his order that the Gabbard campaign’s lawsuit failed to establish “how Google’s regulation of its own platform is in any way equivalent to a governmental regulation of an election.” The lawsuit alleged that Google infringed on Gabbard’s right to free speech when the company suspended the campaign’s advertising account for six hours on June 27 and 28 following the first Democratic presidential debate.

527,"March 5, 2020",Should Antitrust Laws Tackle Privacy Issues? DOJ and State AGs Continue Google Investigations in Response to Privacy Concerns,"
By Darley Maw, BakerHostetler
Months have passed since it was first revealed in July 2019 that the Department of Justice (DOJ), in response to various stakeholders’ concerns, was conducting a review into certain “market-leading online platforms” and whether they engaged in antitrust violations.[1] U.S. Attorney General William Barr reiterated that the government was “taking a closer look at the leading online platforms and the competitiveness of digital markets.”[2] He emphasized the bipartisan effort to review the practices of both Google and Facebook, noting that a similar coalition was formed approximately 20 years ago. Notably absent from the Google inquiry is antitrust chief Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who recused himself because he had represented the company while he was in private practice.
Almost all state attorneys general are also conducting a parallel investigation into Google. Led by Ken Paxton of Texas, the attorneys general are looking at “Google’s overarching control of online advertising markets and search traffic that may have led into anticompetitive behavior that harms consumers.”[3] Reaching beyond antitrust concerns, the state AGs have also raised other issues, most notably whether the FTC should be investigating Big Tech’s possession of consumer data and whether that raises privacy concerns.[4]
Earlier this month, officials from the DOJ met with various state AGs to discuss their respective findings from their investigations. At this time it is unclear whether the dual inquiries will ever merge into one cohesive effort; however, it is clear that the probes are very much active. Recently, the state AGs reached an agreement with Google regarding consultants retained to assist with their probe as the investigation proceeds.[5] The focus of the inquiry is to determine whether Google “undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users’ privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.”[6]
While noncompetition issues, such as privacy, in antitrust are hardly a novel concept,[7] the differences now are the magnitude and reach of the information tech companies now possess. As online platforms increasingly evolve into behemoth entities, with their pervasiveness evoking Frank Norris’ 1901 novel, The Octopus, federal and state agencies are stepping up to enhance antitrust enforcement and to examine Big Tech’s practices when it comes to using citizens’ private information. But does penalizing these companies actually benefit consumers? Online platforms claim that their ability to provide the best services to their users at the lowest cost is based on how they track data. In exchange, privacy rights are implicated, forcing authorities to take action. It makes sense, then, for federal and state officials to respond with a massive investigation into one of the biggest tech companies.   This, of course, is not the end of the story.

The European Commission’s new digital strategy missed a momentous opportunity to better shape our global future. While it may create marginal advantages for the bloc in the race to control data and artificial intelligence, it fails to address the way digital technology platforms are degrading democracies. That will undermine the EU’s ability to accomplish its agenda.
When I was working as a design ethicist at Google, I saw how the emergence of the “attention extraction” business model led to vast individual and societal harms. The social media platforms now intermediate the way we construct shared truths and social relationships.
This business model sells advertisers and political actors highly sophisticated techniques to manipulate individuals and the public sphere. Children and teens are especially vulnerable.
The commission has earned a reputation as the world’s foremost online watchdog. Brussels’ General Data Protection Regulation becoming the gold standard for data protection — about 120 countries have adopted privacy laws — and its proposal to create a shared data pool has merit. But the new EU strategy, despite its attempts to lay down rules for artificial intelligence and data use, fails to grapple with the underlying crisis.

Google’s delays in turning over documents in an antitrust investigation are “unacceptable,” the US Justice Department told the company in a letter this week,the Washington Post reported.
 The Post described the letter as a “rare, private rebuke” for failing to turn over critical information to investigators.
The antitrust investigation has been underway since last year and records requested by the Justice Department suggest it could involve Google’s search engine,  advertising and the Android smartphone operating system, the Post reported.
Ryan A. Shores, an associate deputy attorney general who signed the letter to Google, gave the company a March 2 deadline to comply with documents requests or the department, “would be compelled to pursue other mechanisms” the story said.
If Google doesn’t comply, the Justice Department could ask a court to force the company to turn over the records, the Post said.
Google has already turned over millions of pages to the DOJ, company spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister told the Post. “We have a long track record of cooperating with regulators and will continue working to show how our products create choice, and help millions of consumers and businesses across the country,” she said in a statement.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post Wednesday, February 26, that the company is investing more than US$10 billion this year in data centers and offices across the United States. The move comes as Google faces increased scrutiny from US regulators.
According to CNBC, leaders of the House Judiciary Committee in September requested documents from the company, raising antitrust concerns. The Federal Trade Commission announced in February that it’s examining prior acquisitions made by Google parent Alphabet. And the Department of Justice  in July announced a broad antitrust review of Big Tech.
Google will spend the money to expand its presence in Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and California, Pichai said.
“Everywhere we invest, we strive to create meaningful opportunities for local communities,” Pichai wrote.
He cited a data center in Pryor, Oklahoma. “Last year, I visited Pryor to announce a $600 million investment, our fourth expansion there since 2007,” said Pichai. “It felt like the whole community came out to welcome us, from small business owners to teachers to Google employees.”
New office and data center projects in 2020 will “create thousands of jobs—including roles within Google, construction jobs in data centers and renewable energy facilities, and opportunities in local businesses in surrounding towns and communities,” according to Pichai.
“We look forward to continuing this progress in the year ahead,” he said.

The European Union’s review of Google’s plan to buy Fitbit Inc. won’t involve privacy regulators, the bloc’s antitrust chief insisted, days after data watchdogs warned about how tech giants could use M&A to access citizens’ private information.
A panel of EU data regulators raised the alarm last week, saying that the $2.1 billion takeover of fitness tracker Fitbit could “entail a high risk to privacy and data protection” in an unusual statement.
But the group, known as the European Data Protection Board, can’t have a formal role weighing the merger, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in an interview with Bloomberg.
“We cannot invite other bodies to participate,” she said. “We are very much aware that in cases there can be a privacy issue. We are just very careful not to see a competition issue where there is a privacy issue because, if that is the case, it’s not for us.”
Google’s plan to buy Fitbit is running into a wall of antitrust and privacy worries in the U.S., Europe and Australia, where competition officials are increasingly wary of how internet giants can exert control over data to cement their dominance. The deal adds wearable devices to the internet giant’s hardware business. It also advances the ambitions of Google parent Alphabet Inc. to expand in the health-care sector by adding data from Fitbit’s more than 28 million users.

Alphabet’s Google has reached a settlement with state attorneys general over the states’ use of consultants in their antitrust investigation of the internet search giant, reported CNBC. 
Google in October went to court to restrict the Texas Attorney General’s office from disclosing sensitive information to consultants who have worked for competitors and other companies such as News and Microsoft Corp that have complained about Google to regulators. Both sides reached a settlement that places some restrictions on how the experts can access confidential business information, Google announced on Friday, February 21.
The settlement means that potential roadblocks to the states’ probe may be cleared for now, allowing the attorneys general to continue digging into Google’s business. A delay to the investigation could hinder the states’ ability to uncover important information about Google’s competitive practices. Though antitrust investigations are notoriously slow and fact-intensive, the rapid pace of change in the tech industry makes it especially important for investigators to move swiftly in order to impose remedies before they are no longer relevant.
Texas is leading the the probe into Google’s digital advertising business, which is backed by 49 other attorneys general from US states and territories. The investigation is expanding into other areas of Google’s business as well, including search and Android.

533,"February 23, 2020",Google’s Bid For Fitbit Prompts Warning From EU Over Data Privacy,"
The European Union’s privacy body has voiced skepticism over the acquisition of Fitbit by Google, claiming it could lead to privacy risks, Reuters reported. The deal was announced last November, with Google angling to compete with rivals Apple and Samsung in terms of a crowded market of fitness trackers and smartwatches.
According to the EU, among others, the merger has the potential to endanger people’s privacy. The consumption of Fitbit by Google would give the Big Tech firm access to a wide range of health documents, with the EU claiming that this acquisition could lead to a “high level of risk” for European people’s sensitive information.
European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager will vet the deal. In November, she voiced concern over the merger, and about Big Tech firms targeting rivals that amass troves of such data from users.
The EU hopes that Google would exercise the proper level of restraint and precaution in terms of data, and assess data privacy requirements — as well as mitigate any possible privacy and data risks — before going forward for an antitrust approval with the EU. Google stated it would never sell people’s personal information and would not use data from Fitbit to sell ads. Fitbit users would also have the option to review and delete their data if they chose to do so.
Google stated it would make sure to work with regulators on any potential concerns.
The acquisition bid for Fitbit has been a contentious one for Google thus far, as it has battled numerous instances of red tape and regulatory concerns from multiple parties. The acquisition is worth US$2.1 billion for Google, and the entrance into the health market for parent company Alphabet has seemed worth the cost.
However, both the US Department of Justice and the EU have been looking into the antitrust concerns.

534,"February 20, 2020",Apple/Google Are Mulling Big Changes Amid Antitrust Scrutiny,"
United States antitrust investigations into Big Tech haven’t yet concluded, but they already seem to be making an impact.
Bloomberg reported on Thursday, February 20, that Apple is considering allowing iPhone users the ability to make third-party apps such as Chrome and Gmail the default on their phones, a potential reversal that could alleviate one criticism from competitors and consumers alike that has caught lawmakers’ attention. And earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google executives were informally discussing whether they should consider spinning off their advertising-technology unit as regulators examine the company’s dominance in online advertising and its dealings with publishers.
Taken together, the internal discussions at Apple and Google seem to signal that the biggest tech platforms are, at a minimum, taking probes from Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice seriously. On top of that, they could be looking to make sacrifices to ward off potential regulatory actions or lawsuits. This brings up the question of whether Amazon and Facebook are mulling their own changes. 
In the case of Apple, the company is reportedly considering a reversal of a practice it’s had in place since the App Store launched in 2008: that its own Safari browser and Mail email application are pre-installed as defaults and can’t be swapped out. Lawmakers on the House antitrust subcommittee have expressed concern over Apple’s treatment of third-party app developers and the inability of those external apps to become default options. 
Apple is also facing a class action lawsuit filed by app developers who argue that Apple’s ban of other app stores — and “profit-killing” fees it charges in its own App Store — are signs of an unlawful monopoly. The Supreme Court also ruled in May that a group of iPhone owners could bring an antitrust case against Apple, in which they argue that Apple’s control of the only app store for iPhone apps has resulted in higher-than-competitive app prices.
At Google, the Journal reported that “[t]he growing regulatory scrutiny has prompted some Google executives to discuss informally whether the company should consider divesting its third-party ad-tech business, according to people familiar with the situation.” The business lets online publishers sell ad space to marketers and allows marketers to bid on ad space on sites around the web. At the time of the Journal report, a Google spokesperson said the company has “no plans to sell or exit this business.”

535,"February 20, 2020","UK Google Users Will Be Under US, Not EU Privacy Protections","
Google users in the UK will no longer have access to European Union data security, instead being moved by the tech giant to American jurisdiction, according to officials, according to Reuters reported on Wednesday, February 19.
The shift is due to Britain’s exit from the EU, also known as Brexit. Because of the change, data and privacy will leave the data of tens of millions of people under less protection, and it will be subject to more scrutiny by British law enforcement.
Google will require its users in the UK to sign new terms of service agreements, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Ireland, which hosts the headquarters of Google and other big US companies, is staying in the EU and will keep some of the EU’s famously stringent data protection rules, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Because Google is unsure whether Britain will comply with GDPR rules, Google decided to move its UK customers out of the EU’s jurisdiction altogether, people familiar with the matter said. If British users’ data was held in Ireland, British authorities would have a harder time accessing the data.
Recent US developments such as the Cloud Act, however, will make it easier for British law enforcement to obtain data from Google and others. Britain and the US may also end up negotiating a broader trade agreement.
The US has one of the weakest privacy protections of any developed nation. There are no broad laws despite years of advocacy and protests by consumer interest groups.
One employee familiar with the matter said that for now anyway, Britain’s privacy rules will still apply to requests for data from Google. Google opted not to have British accounts answer to a British subsidiary of its company umbrella.
Lea Kissner, Google’s former lead for global privacy technology, said per published reports, that she would’ve been surprised if the company had kept British accounts controlled under EU laws as the country left the union.
Brexit has had many effects on the economy and business of the region, such as Britain’s announcement that it will put import controls on goods coming into the country, and digital bank N26 blaming its departure from the country on Brexit.

536,"February 20, 2020",EU Privacy Body Warns Of Privacy Risks In Google/Fitbit Deal,"
Alphabet owned  Google’s $2.1 billion bid for fitness trackers company Fitbit could pose privacy risks, the European Data Protection Board warned on Thursday, adding its voice to other critics of the deal.
Google announced the deal in November last year, as it seeks to compete with Apple  and Samsung in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.
Fitbit, whose fitness trackers and other devices monitor users’ daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled, would give the US tech giant access to a trove of health data gathered from Fitbit devices.
“The possible further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data regarding people in Europe by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to privacy and data protection,” it said.
It urged the companies to assess their data privacy requirements and privacy implications in a transparent way and mitigate possible privacy and data protection risks before seeking EU antitrust approval for the deal.
Google said it would never sell personal information to anyone and that Fitbit health and wellness data would not be used for its ads while Fitbit users would have the option to review or delete their data.
“Protecting peoples’ information is core to what we do, and we will continue to work constructively with regulators to answer their questions,” the company said in a statement.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who will vet the deal, in November voiced her concerns about big companies targeting data-heavy rivals.
The European Commission on Thursday in an emailed comment said it had yet to be formally notified.

537,"February 18, 2020","Google leaves court bruised, not broken","
By Simon Van Dorpe, Politico
It has been a good three days in court for the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager.
Google had appealed one of her biggest calls — the 2017 decision to fine the company €2.42 billion for unduly favoring its own shopping comparison service.
At no point during the three-day hearing at the EU General Court in Luxembourg was the Commission’s position fundamentally threatened — unlike Google’s.
If the case goes Vestager’s way, it will strengthen her hand to take a tougher approach not only toward Google’s other specialized search services, including flights and restaurants, but also on similar ventures by other tech giants, such as Facebook’s Marketplace or Apple Music. It would also pave the way for damages cases as Google’s crushed rivals will seek compensation.
Conversely, the EU has a big problem if the judges in Luxembourg, who serve as the only check on the unrivaled powers of the EU’s antitrust czar, decide that she had been too bold. A victory for Google would be a major setback for Vestager’s Brussels reign, potentially driving her to make more use of her new powers to initiate legislation, rather than focus on antitrust cases.

538,"February 17, 2020",Google’s Waze Acquisition Likely Target Of FTC Scrutiny,"
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating acquisitions made by big tech firms in the past 10 years and has a special focus on Google’s US$1.1 billion purchase of mapping app Waze, Bloomberg reported on Friday, February 14.
In June 2013, the FTC approved Google’s acquisition of the Israeli company behind the crowdsourced navigation app Waze. It was different from Google’s own Maps, in that users could exchange information about police in the area or traffic-causing construction. Waze was considered by some to be part social media site, part navigation app.
Antitrust experts said the FTC is now looking back on the acquisition because it put the two most popular mapping apps under the ownership of the same company: Google. The FTC stated owning both gave Google control over and access to even more user data. Further, by purchasing Waze, Google got rid of its main competitor. 
Bilal Sayyed, the FTC’s director for the Office of Policy Planning, told reporters on Tuesday. February 11, that it is taking another look at several deals from the past. 
“Certainly, Waze is one of them,” said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and former Justice Department antitrust official. 
Google’s many acquisitions led to it becoming the leader in search, mapping, and advertising, which has now global watchdogs asking whether this dominance hurts businesses and customers. Reviewing earlier acquisitions can help answer any questions. The agency stated the Waze deal is a clear case that needs review.
“It was literally Google acquiring its number one competitor in maps,” said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, which is pushing for a crackdown on big internet platforms. “It was a bad deal that should have been blocked.”
When Google announced the deal, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the “move eliminates Waze as a potential acquisition target for competitors who could use the app’s collection of data and 50 million users to bolster their own location-based products.”
The FTC’s investigation into the biggest five tech companies in the US expanded into an inquiry about acquisitions last week. The FTC is investigating Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, and Microsoft over antitrust implications, and it recently asked the companies to turn over information regarding takeovers of smaller companies between the years of 2010 and 2019.

539,"February 17, 2020",Google Looks To Publishers To Start Rival To Apple News ,"
Google might launch its own news aggregation service as a way to compete with rival Apple News+.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Google has been discussing the issue with several publishers, talking about paying a license fee to use content in an upcoming project.
While not much information is readily available yet, the company could be working with publishers outside the US, reported CultOfMac.com. Google is speaking with officials in France and elsewhere in Europe about the beginnings of the project.
The company stated it sees a news service as an important asset because of the potential to help inform people and lead to a more educated democracy. Richard Gingras, vice president of News at Google, said the goal is to help people find quality journalism, something he said was a cornerstone issue for a healthy democracy.
Gingras said Google would build on previous initiatives like the Google News Initiative, and said they “care deeply” about the issue.
Google hasn’t announced yet whether the service will be free.
Apple launched Apple News+ last year, priced at US$9.99 a month. The service offers subscribers access to over 300 papers and magazines, including Vogue, National Geographic Magazine, People, ELLE, The Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times.
While Apple hasn’t released statistics on growth, it mentioned in a report last year that growth had been sluggish.
If Google launches its proposed service, it would become the third major tech platform to pay licensing fees to third-party organizations. Facebook also stated it wants to pay publishers to show its content in upcoming news aggregation service.
The tech giants’ moves toward aggregation comes to a world that is increasingly focused on efficiency and combining platforms, and many platforms are trying to make it simplify the sign-up process.

540,"February 16, 2020",EU Judge Says Google Committed “Clear Infraction” In Antitrust Case,"
A European judge has hampered Google’s fight against a US$2.6 billion fine, saying the company committed a “clear infraction” by putting its own price-comparison services above others in its search listings, according to a report by Reuters.
Judge Colm Mac Eochaidh made the remarks on Thursday, February 13, on the second day of a three-day hearing at Europe’s second-highest court, the General Court. Google is trying to get the first of its three antitrust penalties overturned.
The search giant was initially fined in 2017 and has been appealing ever since. The European Commission stated Google favored its own results over those of its rivals, and the judge agreed.
“For me, this case really is visibility. This is a very important point in the case. It is perfectly apparent [that] what has happened is this: You have promoted your own service and demoted that of others,” he said. “That is a clear infraction.”
Mac Eochaidh also asked Google what it was holding back from competitors that compelled them to turn to the EU for help.
Christopher Thomas, the lawyer from Google, blamed the Commission for not looking at Amazon when preparing its case for how it would measure Google’s actions. Thomas Hoppner, a lawyer for the complainants, said it was the right decision to not take Amazon into account.
“Merchant platforms and CSSs (comparison shopping services) simply cater to different needs of different types of online retailers. These different needs mean that CSSs cannot easily be transformed into merchant platforms and vice versa,” he said. “The entire Google story that the condemned conduct was a means to compete with Amazon has no merits.”
The ruling is expected to come in next year. If it doesn’t go in Google’s direction, the company can appeal to Europe’s highest court, the Court of Justice.

541,"February 14, 2020",Google May Start Paying For News,"
Google may start paying news organizations for content, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Most of the publishers are outside the U.S., including France and other parts of Europe the Journal said.
“We want to help people find quality journalism—it’s important to informed democracy and helps support a sustainable news industry,” Google said in a statement. “We care deeply about this and are talking with partners and looking at more ways to expand our ongoing work with publishers, building on programs like our Google News Initiative.” 
The licensing deals would be a “watershed moment for publishers,” who have for years sought payments from Google, the Journal said. Talks are in the early stages and financial terms under consideration couldn’t be learned, the story said.
Last year, Facebook said it would start paying news organizations to license their  headlines and story summaries. Those licenses could generate millions of dollars a year in revenue for publishers, the Journal reported.

542,"February 13, 2020",Google Says EU Antitrust Regulators Holding Back Innovation,"
Google defended its business model on Wednesday, February 12,claiming that making innovative products was at its core rather than helping rivals, as it sought to overturn a €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion at the time) EU antitrust fine at Europe’s second-highest court.
The legal fight comes as European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager gears up to take on US tech giants and Chinese companies with legislation in the coming months, on top of ongoing antitrust investigations.
“Competition law does not require Google to hold back innovation or compromise its quality to accommodate rivals. Otherwise, competition would be restricted and innovation would be stifled,” the company’s lawyer Thomas Graf told a panel of five judges on the first of a three-day hearing at the General Court.
“The decision’s case is, at its core, that Google should not have introduced these innovations, unless it gave competing CSSs (comparison shopping services) the same access,” Graf said, laying out the arguments for the world’s most popular internet search engine in a decade-long battle with the European Commission over its business practices.
The company did not favour its own service, but competed on its merits, he said.
The EU competition enforcer handed the fine to Google in 2017 for favouring its own price-comparison shopping service against those of smaller European rivals.
Two further decisions for different issues since then have lifted the total penalty to €8.25 billion, four times more than Microsoft’s EU fines of €2.2 billion.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan swatted away Google’s arguments, saying this was a clear case of a company using its dominance to give itself an advantage in other markets.
“What Google engaged in was leveraging conduct of the type found to be abusive many times under EU competition law. Conceptually, there is nothing esoteric about this case,” he told the judges.
He criticised Google for cherry picking elements of the EU decision to challenge.
“It is as if Google has applied a ranking algorithm to the decision and decided that parts of it just aren’t relevant,” Khan said.
Lawyer Thomas Vinje for British price-comparison shopping service Foundem, whose complaint triggered the EU investigation, said Google’s product would never have gained prominence if Google had treated it the same way as rival products.
“But instead of being prone to being demoted, Google’s comparison-shopping service is systematically promoted to the most visible spots in Google’s search results,” he said.

543,"February 13, 2020",Google Finalizes $2.6B Purchase Of Looker Data,"
Google has completed its US$2.6 billion acquisition of Looker Data Sciences after receiving approval from the UK’s competition authorities. The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) review, which follows similar probes by the US Department of Justice and the Austrian Federal Competition Authority, found that the deal would not increase prices or harm rivals’ access to data. 
Looker, which makes business intelligence analytics software, is Google’s biggest acquisition for many years, alongside its planned US$2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit. “Together, we’re excited to offer customers a comprehensive analytics solution that integrates and visualizes insights at every layer of their business,” said Thomas Kurian, chief executive of Google Cloud, in a blog post on Thursday, February 13, announcing the deal’s completion. 
He added that customers would retain “complete control of their data”. Getting the go-ahead on Looker from the CMA relieves Google of at least one antitrust battle, as it faces off against the EU in court in Luxembourg this week over a €2.4 billion fine for allegedly promoting its shopping search engine at the expense of smaller rivals. Still, dealmaking is getting more difficult for big tech companies as regulators have become increasingly concerned that M&A has been used by the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon to stifle competition. 
This week, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it would review hundreds of smaller start-up acquisitions made over the past decade by the five largest US companies, including Microsoft and Apple. Google’s Fitbit deal is facing regulatory challenges in Europe and the US over how it will handle the fitness tracker maker’s store of health data from some 28m users. 
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, is seeking tougher powers, such as the ability to impose fines, to use against tech companies.

544,"February 12, 2020",Google Fights $2.6B Antitrust Fine In EU Court,"
Alphabet’s Google told Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, February 12, that antitrust regulators had no legal grounds to levy a €2.4 billion (US$2.6 billion) fine against the company, according to a report from Reuters.
Google defended its business model on the first day of a three-day hearing at the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg. The search giant stated its goal is to make innovative products and accused the court of stifling innovation.
“Competition law does not require Google to hold back innovation or compromise its quality to accommodate rivals. Otherwise, competition would be restricted and innovation would be stifled,” Thomas Graf, a lawyer for Google, told a panel of five judges.
“The decision’s case is, at its core, that Google should not have introduced these innovations unless it gave competing CSSs (comparison shopping services) the same access,” Graf said.
European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said in 2017 that Google abused its leadership position in search to divert traffic to its own ads and skip over the competition. The EU has fined Google a total of €8.25 billion in three separate cases.
Graf said Vestager’s findings were “wrong on the facts and wrong on the law.” Nicholas Khan, a lawyer for the European Commission (EC), dismissed Google’s arguments.
“What Google engaged in was leveraging conduct of the type found to be abusive many times under EU competition law. Conceptually, there is nothing esoteric about this case,” Khan told the judges. “It is as if Google has applied a ranking algorithm to the decision and decided that parts of it just aren’t relevant.”

In June, Google appealed the EU’s US$1.7 billion fine, which was issued in March for anti-competitive behaviors in the online advertising market.

545,"February 11, 2020","Antitrust, Privacy Concerns Surround Google’s Fitbit Takeover Bid","
Google‘s plan to buy Fitbit isn’t going as well as it had hoped, reports said. The search engine giant has been running into a wall of regulatory red tape, as competition officials across multiple continents worry that the mass control of data by tech giants could have negative implications.
The acquisition, worth US$2.1 billion on Google’s part, would give the tech giant control over Fitbit’s array of smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other such wearable devices, another industry added to Google’s increasing arsenal. Google parent Alphabet has been eyeing ways to enter the healthcare sector, and Fitbit’s 28 million users seemed to fit the bill.
However, even though the company wouldn’t directly compete with Google, and the profit would still be just a small share of the hardware and fitness-tracking industry, the merger has raised alarm bells for regulators. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division is investigating the merger, and the EU will likely review it as well, according to sources familiar with the investigation.
Australian authorities are looking into the matter, though no serious action will be taken until both companies file with their watchdog officials. Neither Google nor Fitbit have responded to requests for comment.
In Europe, the EU has been concerned for some time about the leveraging of massive amounts of data by large tech companies like Google. Regulators from various places have critiqued that they’ve been too accepting of some deals in the past — such as Facebook’s takeover of WhatsApp for US$19 billion in 2014, or its US$1 billion buyout of Instagram in 2012.
Maurice Stucke, an antitrust professor at the University of Tennessee, called Google a “data-opoly,” and said the concern was that the tech giant could use its data to reinforce the hold over large markets.
Antitrust activity has brought companies like Google into the investigation spotlight due to the size and privacy policies. For example, the US DOJ is looking into Google on issues of its third-party advertising, and dealings with publishers.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is demanding information from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft on their mergers over the past nine years, significantly increasing the pressure on the tech industry’s biggest players amid growing antitrust scrutiny, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The agency announced on Tuesday, February 11, that it issued the investigative subpoenas to the companies, seeking details on deals that fall below the threshold of normal federal antitrust reviews, as part of a study into acquisitions of startups.
The FTC has been particularly focused on re-examining mergers that already have been approved by the government. That re-examination could eventually lead the FTC to try to unwind deals that it finds to be having anticompetitive effects now, officials have said.
According to the Journal, the FTC action reflects growing concern in Washington and around the country that some US tech companies have grown so large and powerful that they have begun to squelch competition in various ways and harm consumers.
In a joint statement, the two Democrats on the five-member panel urged the Commission to study “consumer protection issues arising from the privacy and data security practices of technology companies, including social media platforms.”
“In particular, we encourage the FTC to study whether and, if so, how content curation and targeted advertising practices impact data collection, use, and sharing,” said the statement from Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra.

Google’s plan to buy Fitbit is running into a wall of antitrust and privacy worries in the US, Europe and Australia, reported Bloomberg. Google’s $2.1 billion acquisition of the maker of smartwatches and fitness trackers, announced in November, would add wearable devices to the internet giant’s hardware business. It also advances the ambitions of Google parent Alphabet Inc. to expand in the healthcare sector by adding data from Fitbit’s more than 28 million users. Google has struck cloud-service partnerships with hospital groups and signed a deal with Mayo Clinic to build new artificial intelligence tools.According to Bloomberg, in the past, the Fitbit deal probably wouldn’t have raised much concern for competition enforcers because the company doesn’t compete directly with Google. And even with Fitbit, Google would have a minuscule share of the hardware and fitness-tracker market.Today, there’s heightened concern, particularly in the European Union, about how tech companies can leverage their control over data to become ever more powerful.

Alphabet unit Google faces the risk of more EU antitrust problems after 40 rivals on both sides of the Atlantic accused it of favouring its own vacation rental service on its search engine and urged European Union enforcers to take action, reported The Financial Times.
The 40 companies and trade bodies in nine EU countries, Switzerland and the United States, which include eDreams Odigeo, Expedia and Tripadvisor , laid out the case against Google in a letter to EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
“We see strong indications of a competitive strategy for Google to reduce us and our industry to mere content providers for the ‘one-stop-shop’ of Google’s new product,” the letter said.
In focus is Google’s prominent display of its product at the top of its general search results pages, jazzed up with pictures, a map review, ratings and prices. “Such favourable ranking and display secures Google’s service more user attention and clicks than any competing service may acquire, even if these are more relevant for the user’s search query,” the letter said.
The letter came as Google gears up for a legal battle on Wednesday against the first of three antitrust fines levied by Vestager for using its dominance to promote its price comparison shopping service, squeezing out smaller rivals. The Commission said it had received the complaint, but declined further comment. 
Google said its search results aim to provide users with the most relevant information. “We’re currently testing a new format for specialist searches in Europe, including jobs, local and travel, where people might see a carousel of links to direct sites across the top of the search results,” a spokeswoman said. “This is designed to demonstrate the range of results available.” The company started including vacation rentals in hotel search results in 2018.

The US International Trade Commission (ITC) announced on Thursday, February 6, it was launching a patent investigation into certain audio players and controllers sold by Alphabet’s Google based on a complaint by rival smart speaker maker Sonos, reported The Financial Post. 
The ITC received a complaint from Sonos last month alleging that the import of certain audio players and controllers and their components infringe on its patents.
Sonos at the time also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google in US District Court in Los Angeles and testified to a House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee about its frustrations with Google.
“Sonos has made misleading statements about our history of working together. Our technology and devices were designed independently. We deny their claims vigorously, and will be defending against them,” Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said in a statement on Thursday.
The ITC has in some cases issued orders banning products from US entry on the grounds they infringe US patents. The threat of such bans, known as exclusion orders, can be leverage in settlement discussions.

The state attorney general leading a broad antitrust investigation into Google is accusing the tech giant of delaying the case and vowed to see it through to the end.
In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, February 5, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton pointed to Google’s attempts to prevent the state from using certain outside consultants as one delay tactic. And Paxton said he’s willing to take a more aggressive stance as a result.
“They’re pushing us towards a fight,” Paxton told CNBC. “We don’t necessarily want one. But we won’t back off if they’re not going to cooperate.”
Google has stated it objected to three consultants because they worked for competitors, including Microsoft and News, and that it wants to ensure any documents they review remain confidential.
“We have been working constructively with the Texas attorney general and have produced a substantial volume of information in response to his inquiry even as we seek assurances that our confidential business information won’t be shared with competitors or vocal complainants,” a Google spokesperson said. 
Texas announced its investigation into Google in September of last year on the steps of the US Supreme Court, backed by 49 attorneys general from nearly every state and territory in the country. Paxton told CNBC his team is focused on Google’s ad business, while other states are looking into a range of additional anticompetitive complaints. CNBC reported last fall that some state attorneys general have expanded their probes to look into Google’s Android and search businesses.

552,"February 5, 2020",DOJ Intensifies Google Antitrust Probe Zeroing In On Ads,"
The Justice Department antitrust investigation into Google seems to be ramping up with a flurry of activity this week, as the subject of the probe reportedly zeros in on the tech giant’s online advertising tools.
On Tuesday, several state attorneys general investigating Google met with Justice Department officials to coordinate their efforts to probe the search and advertising giant.
The attorneys general of Texas, Utah and Nebraska were among those in attendance. Nearly every state AG in the country is participating in the state-level probe led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.
‘We’re working well together and trying to make sure that there aren’t redundancies,’ Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said. ‘We’re hoping to go as quickly as we possible can but I don’t have a specific timetable.’
At the federal level, Google’s ad-tech software appears to be a major focus of the probe, several people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. 
Virtually all major publishers use Google’s ad server, which connects online publishers to Google’s advertising exchange. 
Google’s ad server, DoubleClick for publishers, was integrated into its ad exchange, AdX, in 2018, and re-branded as a single product called Google Ad Manager.
Many publishers and advertising rivals accuse Google of tying its various tools together in anti-competitive ways.
The probe’s increasing focus on ad tools is believed to be the reason thatAssistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the department’s antitrust chief, stepped down from leading the investigation this week.
Delrahim lobbied on Google´s behalf in 2007 when company faced antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of advertising competitor DoubleClick.

The Data Protection Commission has launched two separate statutory inquiries, into search firm Google and dating app Tinder. Both inquiries relate to the handling of user data and are being opened under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).The inquiry into Google will look at how the company processes location data, including information obtained through its Google Maps service. There is also a concern around transparency, and whether users are made aware of how their data is handled by the company.
The DPC said it has launched the inquiry having received “a number of complaints from various consumer organisations across the EU”.
The inquiry into MTCH Technology Services, the corporation behind Tinder, will also look at whether the company is transparent with users in how it handles data.
Meanwhile the commission will investigate whether the company is complying with rules around users’ data requests. 
This will specifically look at whether the firm gives users all of the information it holds on them when requested, and whether it is deleting all of that data when asked to do so.
The DPC said this inquiry has come about after concerns were raised “by individuals both in Ireland and across the EU”.

554,"February 4, 2020",DOJ Antitrust Chief Recuses Himself From The Google Probe,"


The top antitrust official at the Department of Justice is recusing himself from the agency’s investigation of potentially anticompetitive behavior at Google due to potential conflicts of interest in his past, reported The New York Times. 
Delrahim was previously hired as a lobbyist who helped shepherd Google’s $3.1 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007. DoubleClick has become a key part of Google’s advertising business, which has raised antitrust concerns.
“As the technology review progressed, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim revisited potential conflicts with previous work with the Department of Justice’s ethics office,” a spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC after The New York Times first reported the recusal.“He and the ethics office have decided that he should now recuse himself from a matter within the tech review in an abundance of caution. Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores will continue to oversee the tech review. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alex Okuliar, who joined the Antitrust Division last week, will also assist with the tech review.”
Shores previously worked as in the litigation and antitrust department at law firm Shearman & Sterling. He was hired in October by Deputy Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen, to work in his office, which oversees all of the Justice department divisions, rather than Delrahim’s antitrust division. The Justice Department said at the time he would work closely with its antitrust review, so he has been overseeing the investigation since then.
The change of leadership overseeing the Google review may further the investigation’s ties to Deputy Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen’s boss, Attorney General William Barr, industry sources noted. Barr has appeared to cooperate in working with states that are leading their own antitrust investigation into Google, a person familiar with the investigation said, requesting anonymity because the investigations are confidential.
The timing of the decision, months after the DOJ announced it was an investigation, took some industry insiders by surprise. It could suggest that the DOJ is zeroing in on Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick as part of its review, industry sources noted. DoubleClick helps strengthen Google’s advertising technology business, which has been a major focus for a separate antitrust investigation attorneys general are leading.

State attorneys general will meet with US Justice Department attorneys next week to share information on their respective probes of Alphabet’s Google unit, a step that could eventually lead to both groups joining forces, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
The meeting is seen as the start of a periodic dialogue that could expand into more formal cooperation as the probes continue, the people said.
To date, federal and state authorities involved in the probe haven’t shared investigative materials about their concurrent probes of Google, some of the people said.
At least seven state attorneys general who are part of the investigation have been invited to the meeting, one of the people said. The group—comprising the executive committee of the states’ investigation into Google—is led by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general.
The state and federal investigations have given considerable focus to Google’s powerful position in the lucrative market for online advertising. The company’s dominant position in online search and possible anticompetitive behavior by Google in its Android mobile operating system have also drawn scrutiny, according to the people familiar with the matter. 
The planned meeting is likely to include discussions on those issues, the scope of the probes and the best division of labor as the investigations move forward, reported The Journal.

556,"January 23, 2020",US: Google spent $150M on lobbying over last decade,"
Google cut its lobbying spending nearly in half last year from 2018, even as government investigations into tech companies have scaled up in Washington and throughout the country.
Of the four tech giants thought to be facing antitrust scrutiny, Alphabet’s Google was the only one that reduced its year-over-year spending, according to newly released filings.
Here’s the breakdown: 
Google: US$11.8 million, -44% from last year
Facebook: US$16.7 million, +32%
Amazon: US$16.1 million, +14%
Apple: US$7.4 million, +10%
Google faces antitrust probes from the Justice Department and a coalition of 50 attorneys general across the country. Its YouTube subsidiary had to answer to the Federal Trade Commission last year with a US$170 million settlement over claims that it violated child privacy laws. In the fourth quarter, it lobbied on mobile location privacy, online child safety, encryption standards, and more.
Google’s reduced spending reflects that it fired about half a dozen firms representing about half of its lobbying bill, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The move was part of a broader change in Google’s global government affairs and policy operations.

557,"January 22, 2020","US: Google’s Pichai talks antitrust, privacy concerns","
Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, on Wednesday discussed the data privacy and antitrust concerns that people and regulators have raised about the company and other technology giants, saying that “privacy is at the heart of what we do” and that Alphabet/Google doesn’t pursue scale for scale’s sake.
During a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that was entitled “An insight, an idea with Sundar Pichai,” he was questioned about General Data Protection Regulations (GDPRs), calling them “a great template” that provides a “standardized privacy framework.”
“For us, privacy is at the heart of what we do,” Pichai said. “Users come to Google at very important moments, ask us questions, we deal with people’s sensitive information in Gmail, Google Photos and so on, and so we have to earn their trust. Today we do it by giving them control and transparency and choice around it.”
Over time, he argued artificial intelligence (AI) could allow the company to do better. “We can do that [work] with less data over time,” he said. “We can use AI to actually preserve privacy.”
He also emphasized that “privacy can not be a luxury good,” adding: “We need to make sure we [serve] up services in a way that works for everyone, but puts them first and is privacy-enhancing.”
Asked about Google’s regular acquisitions of startup companies and past and current antitrust probes in the U.S. and Europe, Pichar said, “With our scale rightfully comes scrutiny. You are right [that] we have bought startups, but as a company we invest every single year in hundreds of startups through our venture arms. These support entrepreneurs and incubators around the world.”

558,"January 20, 2020",US: Google CEO calls for AI governance,"
In a Sunday, January 19, opinion column in The Financial Times (FT), Google and Alphabet chief executive officer (CEO) Sundar Pichai wrote about the importance of having government oversight regarding artificial technology (AI).
“Growing up in India, I was fascinated by technology. Each new invention changed my family’s life in meaningful ways,” he wrote. 
Now that he is in the position to frame new tech advances, he said he believes that international cooperation for oversight is vital in order to impose workable global standards. 
“Now there is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated. It is too important not to. The only question is how to approach it,” he wrote, pointing to historical examples that “technology’s virtues aren’t guaranteed.”
He said people “need to be clear-eyed” about the many possible negative consequences of technology, particularly when it comes to AI. 
The market should not dictate how technology is used, and big tech firms like Google have a responsibility to make sure “technology is harnessed for good and available to everyone,” he wrote. 
In 2018, Google created its own AI policies to provide guidance as well as open-source tools and code for the ethical development of AI that also avoids bias and ensures privacy. The policy also outlined Google’s opposition to mass surveillance and the infringement of human rights.
“We believe that any company developing new AI tools should also adopt guiding principles and rigorous review processes,” he said in the article. “Government regulation will also play an important role.” 
He pointed to Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as being a good start for a “strong foundation.” 
Google wants to partner with regulators to extend its own expertise and tools and “navigate these issues together.”
Earlier this month the Trump administration submitted new rules governing any future federal regulation of AI. Any new rules will not impact how federal agencies like law enforcement utilize “facial recognition and other forms of AI.” 
AI watchdogs point to the current lack of accountability as more computer infrastructure and software systems replace human workers in multiple professional environments.

559,"January 20, 2020","US: Microsoft, IBM and Google granted access to medical records","
Hospitals have granted Microsoft, International Business Machines, and Amazon the ability to access identifiable patient information under deals to crunch millions of health records, reported the Wall Street Journal. 
This breadth of access wasn’t always spelled out by hospitals and tech giants when the deals were struck.
The scope of data sharing in these and other recently reported agreements reveals a powerful new role that hospitals play—as brokers to technology companies racing into the US$3 trillion health-care sector. Rapid digitization of health records in recent years and privacy laws enabling companies to swap patient data have positioned hospitals as a primary arbiter of how such sensitive data is shared. 
“Hospitals are massive containers of patient data,” said Lisa Bari, a consultant and former lead for health information technology for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center. 
Hospitals can share patient data as long as they follow federal privacy laws, which contain limited consumer protections, she said. “The data belongs to whoever has it.”
Microsoft and Providence, a Renton, Washington, hospital system with data for about 20 million patient visits a year, are developing cancer algorithms by using doctor’s notes in patient medical records. The notes haven’t been stripped of personally identifiable information, according to Providence. 
And an agreement between IBM and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, to jointly develop artificial intelligence allows the hospital to share personally identifiable data for specific requests, people involved in the agreement said—though so far the hospital hasn’t done so and has no current plans to do so, according to hospital and IBM officials. 
Microsoft executive Peter Lee in July described how his company would use Providence patient data without identifying information for algorithm development. In a December statement, he said patients’ personal health data remains in Providence’s control and declined to comment further.

560,"January 19, 2020","US: Companies plead for Congress to regulate Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google","
Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google took a public lashing at a congressional hearing Friday, January 17, where some of their smaller rivals, including Sonos and Tile, pleaded with federal lawmakers to take swift action against Big Tech.
According to the Washing Post, Democrats and Republicans at times appeared stunned as they heard tales of technology giants wielding their massive footprints as weapons, allegedly copying smaller competitors’ features or tweaking their algorithms in ways that put new companies at a costly disadvantage. The testimony came as part of a wide-ranging antitrust probe into Silicon Valley’s biggest players that House lawmakers aim to wrap up in the coming months.
The pleas for regulatory relief resonated with lawmakers, led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), the chairman of the House’s top antitrust committee. “It has become clear these firms have tremendous power as gatekeepers to shape and control commerce online,” Cicilline said to open the session.
The hearing at the University of Colorado at Boulder put public faces on the pain caused by some of the largest tech companies in the United States. Cicilline and other lawmakers have sought to determine if federal antitrust law is sufficient to hold Silicon Valley leaders accountable — and whether changes to federal law are necessary to address anti-competitive concerns in search, smartphones, e-commerce and social networking.
“I think it’s clear there’s abuse in the marketplace and a need for action,” said Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado).

562,"January 12, 2020",EU: DuckDuckGo still critical of Google’s Android choice,"
Google announced which search engines have won an auction process it has devised for an Android “choice screen” as its response to an antitrust intervention by the region’s competition regulator.
The big winners of the initial auction, for the period March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, are pro-privacy search engine DuckDuckGo which gets one of three paid-for slots in all 31 European markets and a product called Info.com, which will also be shown as an option in all those markets. 
French pro-privacy search engine Qwant will be shown as an option to Android users in eight European markets. While Russia’s Yandex will appear as an option in five markets in the east of the region.
Despite participating in the process and winning a universal slot, DuckDuckGo told us it still does not agree with the pay-to-play approach.
“We believe a search preference menu is an excellent way to meaningfully increase consumer choice if designed properly. Our own research has reinforced this point and we look forward to the day when Android users in Europe will have the opportunity to easily make DuckDuckGo their default search engine while setting up their phones. However, we still believe a pay-to-play auction with only 4 slots isn’t right because it means consumers won’t get all the choices they deserve and Google will profit at the expense of the competition,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

563,"January 9, 2020",EU: DuckDuckGo is the winner in Google’s search auction,"


Google is almost ready to release a new search provider selection screen in the EU, but it’s not doing so by choice. Last year, the EU ordered Google to offer placement to other search engines in Android, and Google is complying in the most Google way possible. It has conducted an auction for spots in the setup flow, and now the results are in. DuckDuckGo is a big winner, and Bing is almost entirely absent. 
The EU antitrust decision in 2018 hammered Google for its practice of integrating Google Search with Android. If users wanted to use a different search engine, they had to manually install it and change the defaults. That’s a fine setup in most countries, but the EU is much more aggressive about pursuing antitrust matters. In addition to ordering Google to change its practices, it imposed a record $5 billion fine. 
Google might end up recouping some of that loss when the new selection screen rolls out. The company opted to go with a “fourth-price” auction to choose the search providers. For each EU country, providers were invited to bid on one of the four spots. The three top bids get a place on the selection screen along with Google. However, they don’t pay the amount of their proposal. Each time a user selects a search engine, that company pays Google the amount of the fourth-highest bid. The selection screen controls which engine appears as the default in Chrome and the home screen search widget. The phone also downloads the search app from the Play Store automatically.

564,"January 9, 2020",US: Sonos CEO will testify to lawmakers after suing Google,"


Only a day after Sonos officially sued Google for stealing its tech designs, House antitrust leaders have invited the speaker company to air its grievances in an open hearing. 
The hearing, which is scheduled for January 17th, will be the fifth installment of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust investigation into big tech companies like Facebook and Google. Since June of last year, the antitrust panel, led by Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI), has been bringing in witnesses from some of the country’s largest tech firms and their critics to discuss how lawmakers could rein in their market dominance. 
Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is scheduled to appear alongside the founder and CEO of PopSockets, David Barnett, and the vice president and general counsel to Tile, Kirsten Daru, at the University of Colorado Law School. PopSockets has long struggled with infringing products, with one executive describing it as “one of the largest counterfeiting and knockoff problems of major consumer brands.”
More witnesses could be called before next Friday, the press release said. 
Over the past six months, lawmakers have brought in representatives from Facebook, Google, Amazon, and a number of academics and tech critics to the hearing room to discuss what should be done, if anything, to regulate large tech firms. The hearings have focused on issues ranging from the effect platforms have had on the news industry to how and why they collect user data. 
In its lawsuit, Sonos alleged that after partnering with Google, the tech giant stole the company’s multiroom speaker technology, as laid out in a series of patents. That original partnership was meant to allow Sonos speakers to stream music through Google’s apps, but Sonos says Google stole the designs and flooded the market with its own speakers for cheap, subsidizing the cost by extracting more data from consumers. Google has disputed those allegations, saying it is “disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith.”

Shares of internet giant Alphabet closed out the day at an all-time high on Monday, January 6, as big tech companies saw gains that defied the rest of the market, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
Google-parent Alphabet closed up 2.7% at US$1,397.81 per share, which brings the company’s market cap to US$964 billion.
Facebook rose almost 1.9% on the day, closing at US$212.60 per share, which makes the social media giant worth US$606.3 billion — a 52-week high, and just 3% off its all-time high of US$218.62, set on July 25, 2018.
The record highs come as both companies face ongoing antitrust investigations by coalitions of state attorneys general.
In September, 50 attorneys general announced the launch of an investigation into Google over possible antitrust violations in its advertising business. The next month, CNBC reported that the attorneys general were preparing to expand their investigation into Google’s Android and search businesses.
Around the same time as the launch of the Google probe, 47 attorneys general announced an antitrust investigation into Facebook’s practices, which sent the stock down almost 4% that day.
However, Monday’s record highs suggest investors are unconcerned going into the new year about the ongoing investigations.
Alphabet’s record high comes nearly a month after former CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page relinquished his role to Sundar Pichai, former Google CEO. Pichai will help the company find new revenue streams, Pivotal Research Group analyst Michael Levine said as he upgraded the stock to a buy rating.

569,"December 18, 2019",UK: Competition regulator asks for views on breaking up Google,"
The UK’s competition regulator has raised concerns about the market power of digital ad platform giants Google and Facebook in an interim report published Wednesday, December 18, opening up a consultation on a range of potential inventions, from breaking up platform giants, to limiting their ability to set self-serving defaults, and enforcing data sharing and/or feature interoperability to help rivals compete.
According to TechChrunch, breaking up Google by forcing it to separate its ad server arm from the rest of the business is one of a number of possible interventions  the regulator is eyeing, along with enforcing choice screens for search engines and browsers that use non-monetary criteria to allocate slots vs Google’s plan for a pay-to-play offering for EU Android users.
The UK regulator is also considering whether to require Facebook to interoperate specific features of its current network so they can be accessed by competitors, as a fix for what it describes as “strong network effects” which work against “new entrant and challenger social media platforms.”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched the market study in July, a couple of weeks after the UK’s data watchdog published its own report setting out major privacy and other concerns around programmatic advertising.
It is due to issue a final report next summer, which will set out conclusions and recommendations for interventions, and is now consulting on suggestions in its interim report, inviting contributions before February 12.

The UK’s competition watchdog has launched a merger enquiry into Google’s June 2019 acquisition of data analytics firm Looker for US$2.6 billion.
The decision comes two weeks after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated  that it had “reasonable grounds” to suspect that Google was planning to roll Looker fully into its parent company Alphabet, rather than keep it separate.
In that initial enforcement notice, the CMA stated that it suspects “it is or may be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in: Google, including its subsidiaries Jumelles and Google UK; and Looker Data Sciences, (Looker) ceasing to be distinct.”
Google described the move as standard acquisition procedure. A company spokesperson said, “The acquisition of Looker has received regulatory approval in the U.S. and Austria and we continue to make progress with regulators in the UK.”
Looker has a range of competitors, including Tableau, Sisene, Qlik, and Domo. Its acquisition was the first major deal of Google Cloud Platform CEO Thomas Kurian’s tenure.

572,"December 17, 2019",India: Google offers advice to the Fed on FedNow,"
Google sent a letter to the Federal Reserve, asking the US central bank to consider modeling FedNow after the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) framework used in India, The Economic Times (ET) reported on Sunday, December 15. FedNow is the new interbank real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service that will offer integrated clearing functionality for faster digital payments.
Mark Isakowitz, Google’s head of US government affairs and public policy, wrote in a letter to the Fed that Google “worked closely” with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to build Google Pay for the Indian market. NPCI, the payment regulator governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), launched real-time payments in 2016.
“First, UPI is an interbank transfer system. … Second, it is a real-time system. Third, it is ‘open’ — meaning technology companies can build applications that help users directly manage transfers into and out of their accounts held at banks,” Isakowitz wrote, according to ET.
The system in India was quickly and widely adopted, and jumped from 100,000 monthly transactions three years ago to 1.15 billion now.
“Google has been a successful market participant in India’s use of UPI, and Google Pay provides one of the three leading mobile applications that use UPI, as measured by transaction volume,” the letter stated.
Monthly users of Google Pay hit 67 million in September, an increase of 45 million over September 2018. A recent Assocham-PWC study has indicated that digital payments in India will grow to US$135.2 billion in 2023 from US$64.8 billion in 2019.
“Every transaction made on Google Pay is done through our partnerships with India’s banks over UPI. This success is mutual as between tech financial services and government,” the letter indicated. 
Google stated it can use what it learned from the experience with India to offer the Fed specifics to “support real-time low-value and high-value payments, use standardized messaging protocols with extended metadata, and provide clear standards for an application programming interface (API) layer that enables licensed non-financial institution third parties to access and submit requests into this payment system.”
Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and UPI are proving to be game-changers for India’s community of more than 100 million migrants participating in the nation’s workforce — one-fifth of India’s workforce.

574,"December 16, 2019",US: Antitrust regs probe Google’s shopping comparison tool,"


The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into Google’s online shopping conduct as part of its broader antitrust probe, Bloomberg reported Friday (Dec. 13).
Richard Stables, the CEO of London-based online shopping comparison site Kelkoo Group, said he spent time with DOJ officials to talk about how Alphabet — Google’s parent company — allegedly damages his business.
Stables said he also met with congressional staff members in the House and Senate earlier this week.
Antitrust enforcers are now probing how Google competes in the eCommerce comparison market as the overall investigations continue.
A DOJ spokesman would only tell Bloomberg that the department has had “numerous productive meetings with third parties.”
Stables said he was concerned that Google could “squash not just other European comparison sites, but also travel companies, searches for local businesses and services, and other firms in the US”
A September blog post by Google Senior Vice President of Global Affairs and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker indicated Google promised to cooperate with antitrust officials.
“We have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us,” Walker said. “The DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations, and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions. We have always worked constructively with regulators, and we will continue to do so.”
Google’s appeal against a $2.64 billion fine for antitrust practices in the EU will be heard by a court Feb. 12-14. Google and a tech lobbying group will bring their argument to the Luxembourg-based General Court. The European Commission will be represented by the country of Germany, as well as eight other companies.
The EU accused Google two years ago of favoring its own search service over that of competitors, levying the fine to punish the search giant and help level the competition field. Google went to the General Court with its appeal and is also appealing other antitrust decisions.

575,"December 16, 2019",US: ”Fortnite” developer spars with Google over App-Store fees,"
The creator of “Fortnite” is challenging Google’s policy of taking a cut of payments made for app-related purchases at a time when regulators have started scrutinizing those kind of arrangements between tech companies and their vendors.
Epic Games is asking Google to release in its app store a version of “Fortnite” with a built-in payment system that allows the developer to keep all in-game revenue. Google, a unit of Alphabet currently takes a 30% cut for the kind of in-game purchases players make on games downloaded via its app store.
Epic’s move effectively puts Google in the uncomfortable position of having to either approve the game and forgo a lucrative revenue stream, or potentially provide antitrust regulators with evidence it may be unduly pressuring smaller companies.
“We believe this form of tying of a mandatory payment service with a 30% fee is illegal in the case of a distribution platform with over 50% market share,” Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney said in a statement. “Epic doesn’t seek a special exception for ourselves; rather we expect to see a general change to smartphone industry practices in this regard.”
“Fortnite” is free to play and sells virtual currency for real money that users can spend on in-game perks such as avatar costumes and dance moves.
The shooter game has been accessible on mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system since last year, though only by downloading it from Epic’s website. Now the game maker wants to distribute the free game also via Google’s app store, called Google Play, which could help broaden its reach. That is where Google then takes a 30% cut on sales.
“Google Play has a business model and billing policy that allow us to invest in our platform and tools to help developers build successful businesses while keeping users safe,” Google said in a statement. It said it expected companies that want to distribute their apps through its channel to ”participate under the same terms as other developers,” adding they can also distribute their game to Android users without going through Google’s channel.

576,"December 11, 2019",US: DOJ to review Google’s Fitbit acquisition for antitrust flags,"
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is going to investigate Google’s proposed US$2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit for potential antitrust issues, according to Reuters. Google, owned by Alphabet, would be able to compete in the wearables sector against companies like Samsung and Apple if the deal, announced on November 1, goes through.
Fitbit makes fitness trackers and other health-related accessories. 
Public Citizen and the Center for Digital Democracy — two watchdogs on antitrust issues — have asked for the deal to be blocked because they believe it would give Google too much data about American consumers, on top of what it already gleans from its advertising business. The Federal Trade Commission also has authority to investigate the deal. 
It was also recently revealed that Facebook attempted an acquisition Fitbit, but didn’t win its bid. Facebook made several bids for Fitbit in October, including a final offer of US$7.30 per share, sources told the news outlet.
The filing showed that Fitbit CEO James Park met with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on June 11 of this year for a dinner to discuss the wearables market. A second dinner with Zuckerberg took place on July 2 with Park and other Fitbit executives. Zuckerberg and Park met again in September, according to the filing.
Google announced that it wanted to make a deal with Fitbit for about US$2.1 billion in cash, or US$7.35 per share. Facebook stated it has no intention of bidding again, since Google has agreed to the purchase, the report said. 
Fitbit was valued at around US$2.1 billion when the deal with Google was announced, which is expected to close in 2020. Google stated it will work with Fitbit’s experts to develop top artificial intelligence (AI), software and hardware to stimulate advancement in wearables that could benefit people worldwide.

 Australia said on Thursday technology giants such as Facebook and Google will have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government will impose new controls on them. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will create a code of conduct to address complaints that the technology companies have a stronghold on advertising, the main income generator of local media operators.
The guidelines will ensure substantial market power is not used to lessen competition in media and advertising services markets.
“I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world for how we are dealing with digital platforms, social media platforms,” Morrison told reporters in Melbourne.

The European Commission has sent detailed questionnaires to news publishers as it tries to understand whether the way Google collects data from their websites allows it to stifle competition in online advertising. 
The questionnaire, seen by the Financial Times, asks news publishers to explain how Google tracks user activity and browsing data from their sites in order to subsequently personalize adverts. 
“Describe any agreements . . . based on which Google collects data from your company or is allowed to obtain data from users of your websites or apps,” stated one question, asking the publishers to describe the scope, duration, and rationale for their deals with Google. The questions also ask whether Google provides any technical support or compensation in exchange for the data.
The questions also ask whether Google provides any technical support or compensation in exchange for the data. In a sign of how the Commission’s antitrust investigators are trying to shape a case against Google, the questions focus on whether the internet company is using its dominance to force publishers into sharing data, and whether that data is then repackaged and sold on by Google to third parties, giving any of its advertising clients the same information that news websites have about their readers.

579,"December 4, 2019",US: Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the reins at Alphabet,"
Google CEO Sundar Pichai will take over as the new CEO of Alphabet, as well as retain his job at Google, according to a blog post by Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
“Going forward, Sundar will be the CEO of both Google and Alphabet. He will be the executive responsible and accountable for leading Google, and managing Alphabet’s investment in our portfolio of Other Bets,” the post stated. “We are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term, and will remain actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders.”
Pichai said that the new position won’t affect the way things are done at Alphabet.
“I want to be clear that this transition won’t affect the Alphabet structure, or the work we do day to day. I will continue to be very focused on Google, and the deep work we’re doing to push the boundaries of computing and build a more helpful Google for everyone,” he wrote in the post. “At the same time, I’m excited about Alphabet and its long-term focus on tackling big challenges through technology.”
Page and Brin founded Google in 1998, and saw it grow from a brand new type of search engine to one of the largest tech companies in the world. Its parent company dabbles in everything from driverless cars to internet-enabled balloons to provide connectivity to far-flung, rural places around the globe, according to The Wall Street Journal.
“Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21, and it would be time to leave the roost,” the founders said. “While it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it’s time to assume the role of proud parents — offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!”

580,"December 4, 2019",US: Google co-founders stepping down,"


More than 20 years after launching Google out of a Menlo Park garage, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are relinquishing their executive roles at its parent company Alphabet. 
Page and Brin are stepping down as CEO and president, respectively, of Alphabet, the company announced Tuesday. Sundar Pichai, the current CEO of Google and a longtime executive at the company, will take over as CEO of Alphabet in addition to his current role. The cofounders will continue to serve on Alphabet’s board of directors. They also maintain voting control over the business, all but guaranteeing their ability to influence the direction of Alphabet with or without their executive titles. 
“We’ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there’s a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,” they wrote in a letter.
The executive shuffle comes at a time when Google is facing mounting scrutiny. Regulators and politicians in the US and Europe have questioned the company’s size, data privacy practices and potential impact on society. Page, once the face of the company, has largely receded from public view.Page has been absent from the company’s quarterly earnings calls, and notably hasn’t appeared at big tech hearings on Capitol Hill. In 2018, Page was called before the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating foreign election meddling, but didn’t show. Last year, Bloomberg Businessweek published an article headlined “Where in the World is Larry Page?” Meanwhile, Page has been investing in flying car startups.
At the same time, Google is confronting growing tensions with its own employees. Last week, Google dismissed several outspoken workers for allegedly violating its data-security policies. Some employees quickly accused Google of trying to suppress its critics, as well as workers’ attempts to organize.

Five months after it accused Google of publishing lifted song lyrics, music website Genius Media is suing the search giant over what it alleges amounts to anticompetitive behavior that has harmed its business, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
The lawsuit, filed in state court in Brooklyn, NY, on Tuesday, seeks US$50 million in combined minimum damages from Google and LyricFind, a Canadian company that provides the music lyrics.  
The case puts the spotlight on growing concerns that big tech companies like Google, a unit of Alphabet, can stifle smaller competitors through some of their business practices. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have started investigating some of the actions of tech companies. Companies such as Yelp and TripAdvisor are among others that have accused Google of unfairly preferencing its own content in search results.
Genius, based in Brooklyn, claims traffic to its site, where it posts hard-to-decipher lyrics to hip-hop songs and other pop hits, began dropping because Google has been publishing lyrics on its own platform, and alleges some of them were lifted directly from the music site.
Genius holds no copyright claims on the lyrics, but states that lifting lyrics from its website is a violation of its terms of service.

Britain’s competition watchdog on Monday, December 2, announced it was probing Google’s US$2.6 billion buyout of privately held big-data analytics firm Looker Data Sciences, reported The Financial Times. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was considering whether the deal could hurt competition in the UK or other markets and invited comments on the acquisition until December 20.
Alphabet-owned Google announced the cash deal in June, the first major acquisition for its new cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The deal would build upon Google Cloud’s BigQuery, a tool for managing large datasets.

“While we deepen the integration of Looker into Google Cloud Platform (GCP), customers will continue to benefit from Looker’s multi-cloud functionality,” Mr Kurian said in June.
The CMA’s feedback request comes after it emerged this weekend that the European Commission was looking at Google’s data collection practices more broadly. The Commission sent out questionnaires to Google’s rivals about how the search engine gathers data and makes money from it.

European Union  antitrust regulators are seeking details of Google’s data collection practices, according to a document seen by Reuters, a move that could signal yet more regulatory woes for the world’s most popular internet search engine. 
The EU’s executive Commission has handed down fines of more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) to Alphabet unit Google in the last two years and ordered it to change its business practices, following an investigation that showed the company abused its dominance. 
Last week, the EU competition enforcer sent out questionnaires to several companies, asking them about Google’s data practices and giving them a month to reply.
According to Reuters, the focus is on data related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others. 
Companies were asked about agreements providing data to Google or allowing it to collect data via their services in recent years, and whether they were compensated for this. 
Regulators also wanted to know the kind of data sought by Google, how it uses it and how valuable the companies consider such data. Another question asked whether Google and the companies were subjected to contractual terms that prohibit or limit the use of the data.

Google’s US$2.1 billion Fitbit deal is sparking privacy concerns that the search giant will mine the health data of the 27 million people who use the fitness tracking device, The Financial Times (FT) reported on Thursday, November 21.
Privacy advocates and politicians have asked regulators to block the deal, fearing Google will tap Fitbit’s data to launch a healthcare service.
Senator Mark Warner (Democrat – Virginia) said earlier this month there are “serious concerns” the deal could give big tech an advantage in the growing personalized healthcare industry. 
Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), chair of the House Antitrust Committee, has said the deal “would threaten to give [Google] yet another way to surveil users and entrench its monopoly power online.”
The Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center are among the organizations that feel Google should not get control of Fitbit’s health data and “entrench its monopoly power.” They stated that Google should not be handed “yet another way to track our every move.”
Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice-president for devices and services, wrote in the blog post that Google would be “transparent about the data we collect and why.”
“We will never sell personal information to anyone. Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. And we will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move, or delete their data,” he wrote in the post when the deal was announced.
University of Tennessee law professor Maurice Stucke told FT that regulators have to come to a decision whether Google’s access to Fitbit data could give them an unfair competitive edge.
“When you have a company like Google, which has violated privacy laws multiple times . . . you can imagine it will raise significant concerns,” he said. The deal is leading some Fitbit users to ditch the device over fears that their data won’t be safe.
“Google could know which medications I take, and what medical diagnoses I have,” former Fitbit user Mike Carpenter said. “It makes me feel sick to my stomach.”

591,"November 20, 2019",EU: Vestager says Google may be probed over new copyright rules,"


The European Union might look into Google’s compliance with new copyright rules after France raised concerns regarding the US tech giant, the EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in an interview with a European publication on Wednesday.
According to CNBC, Google has faced a combined $9.5 billion in antitrust fines from the EU over the last two years. In 2017, the EU fined Google $2.7 billion for giving preference to its shopping services. Google also faced a record-breaking $5.1 billion charge in 2018 related to its Android mobile operating system. In March, the Commission also announced an additional $1.7 billion fine on Google for blocking rivals in the advertising sector. The search giant is also currently being investigated for its practices on its jobs search tool “Google for Jobs.”
However, in an interview with Euroactiv,Vestager speaks about potentially probing Google over copyright for the first time.
“We’re in contact with the French competition authorities, in order to see what would they do, to see if they would want to handle the question or if we should have a look,” Vestager said.
Her comments come in the wake of concerns raised in France that Google is allegedly dodging copyright rules. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron called on competition authorities to investigate Google on the basis that the company is avoiding remunerating press publishers for showing links to their articles in search results.
France has been the first EU country to implement an EU copyright law last month that aims to allow publishers to be compensated for their work, when displayed online. However, French media firms have complained that Google is refusing to pay for displaying their content.
However, Euroactiv reported that Google referred the publication to a previous statement that read the company is “happy to answer any questions the French Competition Authority may have.”

Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple defended their business practices in responses to detailed questions by lawmakers conducting an inquiry into antitrust issues in the tech sector, reported Reuters.
The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which released the answers on Tuesday (November 18), had sent the queries as part of its probe of the four giants, which face a long list of other antitrust probes. 
The companies, long a symbol of the most dynamic aspect of the US economy, have seen their reputations tarnished by privacy lapses and allegations they abused their perch on top of the market to hurt small and nascent rivals. 
In its responses, Google, which owns YouTube, repeatedly denied favoring its own services over those of competitors in areas such as search, video and internet browsers. 
According to Reuters, it said “the vast majority” of clicks following a Google search go to non-Google websites,that results from its YouTube offering are not given greater weight than video rivals’, and that its word processing and analytics tools are designed to work well with all browsers, not just its Chrome product. 
Despite its huge collection of data on search queries and clicks, Google stated it could not provide much of the data sought by the committee. For example, asked whether it could share how many searches display location information about a business, Google said, “We do not have a standard definition for what searches are considered ‘location searches’ and thus, cannot provide the specific information requested.” 
For its part, Facebook acknowledged cutting off certain third-party apps from its developer platform for replicating core functionalities, such as Twitter’s Vine, which it said replicated Facebook’s own News Feed product. 
Apple answered basic questions about its browser and the commissions it pays in its App Store, and many other things, most of which are generally known. For example, it said exactly two employees had sought to take disputes to arbitration. But asked how much it had spent on its map app that competes with Google, it said only “billions.” 
Amazon.com stated in its response that it uses aggregated data from merchants on its third-party marketplace for “business purposes,” but denied using the data to launch, source or price private-label products.

594,"November 17, 2019",The Rise of Precautionary Antitrust: An Illustration with the EU Google Android Decision,"
By Dr. Aurelien Portuese (St Mary’s University London)1
Introduction 
The Google Android decision2 issued by the European Commission is not only unique in terms of its punitive €4.34 billion fine – but most importantly for its atypical reasoning in a highly complex environment.3 The Decision concerns numerous and inter-connected products such as the following: smart mobile devices; operating systems (“OS”) for smart mobile devices; apps; smart mobile app stores; application programming interfaces (“APIs”); general search services; and web browsers.4 These products are developed in light of Google’s business model, which entails the interaction between online products and services offered (mostly) free of charge for end-users, and online advertising services.5 Google’s ad-funded products and services have shifted from a PC environment to a smartphone environment, illustrated by Google’s acquisition and development of the Android mobile OS,6 in order to effectively compete with Apple’s iOS ecosystem. Google’s business model involves tying Google’s dominant search engine (“Google Search”) with its proprietary mobile apps (the “Google Play Store” and “Google Chrome”), together with conditional licensing and exclusivity payments. Google’s business model has come under scrutiny7 and was found to violate Article 102 TFEU in the present Google Android decision.
The Abuses: Tying, Conditional Licensing, and Exclusivity Payments 
Two types of abusive tying were identified by the European Commission.8 First, Google tied Google Search, where Google is “super-dominant,” with its Google Play Store. Second, Google tied Google Chrome with the Google Play Store and Google Search.
The first instance of abusive tying (of Google Search with the Google Play Store) violated Article 102 TFEU because, absent any objective justification, “(i) the Play Store and the Google Search app are distinct products (…); (ii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores (…); (iii) the Play Store cannot be obtained without the Google Search app (…); and (iv) the tying of the Google Search app with the Play Store is capable of restricting competition (…).”9
The second instance of abusive tying (of Google Chrome with the Google Play Store and the Google Search) app was also found to violate Article 102 TFEU because, absent any objective justification thereof, “(i) Google Chrome is a distinct product from the Play Store and the Google Search app (…); (ii) the Play Store and the Google Search app cannot be obtained without Google Chrome (…); (iii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores and in the national markets for general search services (…); and (iv) the tying of Google Chrome with the Play Store and the Google Search app is capable of restricting competition (…).”10
Thirdly, Google made the licensing of the Google Play Store and Google Search app conditional on hardware manufacturers complying with anti-fragmentation obligations. This conditional licensing was found to constitute abusive conduct, because “(i) entering into the anti-fragmentation obligations is unrelated to the licensing of the Play Store and the Google Search app (…); (ii) Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for Android app stores, and in the national markets for general search services (…); (iii) the Play Store and the Google Search app cannot be obtained without entering into the anti-fragmentation obligations (…); (iv) the anti-fragmentation obligations are capable of restricting competition (…).”11
Finally, the fourth type of abusive conduct the Commission alleged against Google consisted of having designed exclusivity payments in the form of granting revenue share payments to manufacturers conditional on the non-pre-installation of competing general search services on Android devices. Absent any objective justification by Google, the grant of portfolio-based revenue share payments constituted exclusivity payments for abusive default placements. These exclusivity payments were found to constitute abuses of dominant position capable of restricting competition12 and deterring innovation,13 with no objective justification.
These types of abusive conduct were all found to be aimed at protecting and strengthening Google’s dominant position in general search services, thereby increasing its revenues through search advertisements. Having lasted 2748 days,14 the single and continuous infringement led the European Commission to find Google liable, jointly and severally with Alphabet Inc. its holding company, for a fine of €4.34 billion.
The Atypical Reasoning: Relevant Markets and Precautionary Antitrust in Big Tech
The reality of these tying arrangements,15 as well as the absence of objective justification can presumably be disputed, since Google does provide, through Android, a genuine competitor to Apple’s historically incumbent iOS. Be that as it may, the Commission decision more fundamentally relies upon one simple, yet highly arguable, assessment: the relevant product market for Android is the narrow market for freely-licensable operating systems, rather than general operating systems.16 Indeed, on a number of occasions, the Commission’s decision denied that Apple’s iOS was the main competitor to Google’s Android OS.17
Nevertheless, as once noted by Prof. Nicolas Petit, the Commission may have had resorted to “antitrust gerrymandering” when defining Google’s relevant markets: it is “the idea that if antitrust watchdogs draw markets narrowly enough, every company can be made to look like an evil monopolist.”18 In the Commission’s decision, Google Android is said to represent 90 percent of the market for licensable smart mobile OS.19 The Commission, quite disputably, considered any competition between non-licensable mobile OSs (such as iOS and BlackBerry OS) with licensable mobile OSs (such as Android) to amount to nothing more than “indirect constraint[s].”20
Another fundamental aspect of the Google Android decision is the lack of proven consumer harm.21 Harm to end-users is mostly suggested and hinted at, rather than illustrated and proven. Instead, the lessening of competition is the focus of the alleged conduct: the reduction of choice to manufacturers and end-users as well as the deterrence of innovation are, the Commission considers, instances of such lessening of competition. In the Commission’s view, the reduction of choices entailed by Google’s practices constituted abuses of dominant position. Such alleged reduction of choice can be contested.22 It is no longer required to show consumer harm in order to be found to infringe Article 102 TFEU: a reduction of choice without demonstrated consumer harm appears to be sufficient. In light of the complex and highly innovative high-tech sector, such reduction of choice trumps welfare23 in order to conclude of the abusive nature of the conduct at issue.
The absence of demonstrated consumer harm in order to find antitrust injury is not fortuitous, but represents a fundamental alteration of antitrust enforcement, predominantly when it comes to big tech companies. Coupled with the lack of clear knowledge, a shift in the burden of proof, and the lack of a consumer harm requirement in order to find abuse of dominance all reveal the precautionary approach that the European Commission has now embraced. Underpinning EU law’s philosophical traditions,24 the precautionary principle is being surreptitiously transplanted into antitrust enforcement. This approach holds that the lack of clear knowledge25 and the lack of evidenced (or foreseeable) harm26 should not prevent regulatory interventions. These interventions are, from a legal perspective, enabled by both a shift in the burden of proof27 and ex ante measures. In the Google Android decision, it is noticeable that the potential for harm to innovation given a reduced number of choices resulting from Google’s contractual restraints suggests regulatory intervention is needed in order both to prevent irreversible damages and to design an ideal competitive environment more favorable to rivals and to downstream players who would be relieved from contractual restraints.
Whereas traditional antitrust enforcement relies on antitrust injuries demonstrated ex post, including proven consumer harm, precautionary antitrust28 represents a transformational shift to ex ante regulatory measures (interim relief,29 regulatory design) even in the absence of demonstrated consumer harm, together with a shift of the burden of proof in order to prevent future irreversible damages. Under precautionary antitrust, choice trumps welfare, ex ante regulatory interventionism trumps an ex post antitrust liability system, the shifted burden of proof prevails over non-presumed fault, and irreversible damages replace demonstrated consumer harm. To a non-negligible extent, the Google Android decision illustrates the coming to the fore of a form of precautionary antitrust whereby, even without proven consumer harm, competition authorities are not barred from ex ante intervention to protect what can be seen as irreversible damage – an “effective competitive structure”30 – enabling competitors to emerge and compete.

7 Meaning, the ability for Google to offer, through its two-sided ad-funded business model, a “Google experience” alongside an “Apple experience” or a “Microsoft experience.” Google’s business model relates to one of the ecosystems in the market for smart mobile devices and services. See Koerber who argues that “the (agreements) must be seen in the context of competition among “mobile device eco-systems” (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry and others). Most (manufacturers) install the suite of apps on their devices as consumers expect smartphones to come with functionalities and apps “out of the box”….The (agreements) ensures that users – who choose to buy a device with (Google Mobile Services) – get a device with a full set of apps that offer a “Google experience” similar to the “Apple experience” offered  by iOS devices or the “Microsoft experience” offered by Windows Phone device,” in Torsten Koerber, 2014, Let’s Talk About Android – Observations on Competition in the Field of Mobile Operating Systems, German Version: NZKart 2014, 378 – 386, July 4, 2014. 
8 Tying is existential to Android since not only the entire business model of zero-priced Android OS relies on tied revenue-raising services, but also because the alternative is not desired by customers or consumers. Indeed, “bare Android is not what consumers expect when they purchase modern mobile devices” as argued by Benjamin Edelman & Damien Geradin, 2016, Android and competition law: exploring and assessing Google’s practices in mobile. European Competition Journal. Vol.12, pp.159-194, at p.165.

15 The reality of tying can be contested since manufacturers can acquire bare Android – namely without contractual requirements. Indeed, Google’s General Counsel in April 2016 argued that Google’s “partner agreements are entirely voluntary – anyone can use Android without Google,” and Android founder Andy Rubin stated that “Google will include its apps suite with the platform, but since the platform is  open, a manufacturer or operator can remove some or all the applications,” cited in Benjamin Edelman & Damien Geradin, 2016, Android and competition law: exploring and assessing Google’s practices in mobile. European Competition Journal. Vol.12, pp.159-194, at p.166-167.
16 It can be indeed be argued that Google Android does compete with other operating systems, evidenced by the very competitive constraint Google Android exert to its competitors. For instance, because Android is offered for free to manufacturers, competing operating systems such as Symbian and Windows Phone moved from paid operating systems to freely available operating systems. Consequently, the price competition exerted by Android has pushed competitors to bring the price down up to zero in fierce competition with Google Android. See Andreas Constantinou, “Nokia and Symbian to Become One; Royalty-Free, Open Source Roadmap,” Vision Mobile (24 June 2008), available at https://www.slashdata.co/blog/nokia-and-symbian-to-become-one-royalty-free-open-source-roadmap. It can therefore be argued that Android has gained dominance worldwide, not only because of technical superiority and app availability, but mostly because of customers’ price sensitivity – free (yet contractually constrained) products are often preferred over paid-for products. See Avlonitis, G. J. & Indounas, K. A. (2006). Pricing Practices of Service Organizations; Journal of Services Marketing, 346– 356; Monroe, K. B. & Krishnan, R.

17 For instance, at pp.59-60, the Decision states that “The Commission concludes that non-licensable smart mobile OSs such as iOS and BlackBerry OS do not belong to the same product market as licensable smart mobile OSs. From a demand-side perspective, OEMs cannot obtain a licence to use iOS or BlackBerry OS because Apple and BlackBerry do not grant licences to third parties. From a supply-side perspective, neither Apple nor BlackBerry has licensed or announced its intention to license its smart mobile OS to any third party (…)” at pp.59-60.

20 Case AT.40099, Google Android, 18/07/2018, p.61. Moreover, this indirect constraint, exerted by end-users between smartphones and by app developers, is said to “insufficient” (at p.60) because 1) “there are significant price differences between Google Android and IoS devices”; 2) “users of Google Android devices would face substantial costs when switching to IoS devices;» 3) “user show a significant degree of loyalty to their existing smart mobile OS;» 4) “app developers are unlikely to stop developing for Google Android and develop exclusively for IoS,” Case AT.40099, Google Android, 18/07/2018, p.107-108.
21 Google Android does control prices since Android source code are available to manufacturers royalty-free or the level of output, since the Android source code is readily available to manufacturers and app developers.
22 Google has disrupted the operating systems, which was based on proprietary software code until it entered the market. The number of apps developed for Android is an illustration of choices created rather than reduced. Nevertheless, the requirement to pre-install and exclusively use key Google apps (such as Google Maps, Google Search, etc…) potentially came at the expense of potential competitors’ apps. This reduction of choice, justified by the very revenue-raising characteristic of these apps within the Android business model, needs to be counterbalanced with the enhanced choice generated by Android OS as the main competitor to Apple’s IoS.

25 Here, uncertainties about the level of innovation, the reality of any harm, and the internal functioning of ecosystems constitute the necessary lack of knowledge as fundamental criterion of the precautionary principle.
26 Here, no consumer harm was demonstrated – only harm to competition because innovation was allegedly deterred. For instance, the decision concludes that “Google’s conduct deters innovation, tends to harm, directly or indirectly, consumers of mobile web browsers and helps to maintain and strengthen Google’s dominant position in each national market for general search services,” in Case AT.40099, Google Android, 18/07/2018, at p.222. Innovation deterrence is presumably evidenced while consumer harm is only presumed.
27 See for instance, for the mood of the moment, Emily Craig, 2019, Vestager considers shifting burden of proof for big tech, Global Competition Review, 31st of October 2019, available at https://globalcompetitionreview.com/article/1210348/vestager-considers-shifting-burden-of-proof-for-big-tech. This looming shift has surfaced explicitly, yet applied implicitly occasionally, in the Digital Competition Report. For instance, this Report states that « in the context of highly concentrated markets characterized by strong network effects and high barriers to entry (i.e. not easily corrected by markets themselves), one may want to err on the side of disallowing potentially anticompetitive conducts, and impose on the incumbent the burden of proof for showing the pro-competitiveness of its conduct. This may be true especially where dominant platforms try to expand into neighboring markets, thereby growing into digital ecosystems, which become ever more difficult for users to leave,” at p.4. This burden of proof shift clearly refers to the Google Android decision in particular. Also, the Report argues that “(…)w e propose that, to the extent that the platform performs a regulatory function, it should bear the burden of proving that self-preferencing has no long-run exclusionary effects on product markets,” at p.7 clearly referring to Google Shopping decision of 2017.

596,"November 13, 2019","US: Senior Democrat presses DOJ, FTC on Google’s Fitbit deal","


Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s panel on antitrust, on Wednesday pressed top officials at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission over Google’s proposed acquisition of fitness tracking company Fitbit, reported the Hill. 
“Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit would threaten to give it yet another way to surveil users and entrench its monopoly power online,” the Rhode Island lawmaker said during a subcommittee hearing on antitrust in digital markets.
“Do you think we need to consider a merger moratorium for dominant platforms during the course of these ongoing investigations?”
Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, responded that “there’s a lot that can be done short of a merger moratorium.”
“By doing that we might risk actually harming consumers because there could be mergers and transactions that could be pro-competitive,” he added.
Ciclline then suggested a “qualified moratorium — a moratorium unless it was demonstrated to be pro-competitive.”
“I don’t have a clear administration on that but we’d be delighted to explore that with you,” Delrahim responded.
Delrahim told reporters after the hearing that the DOJ does not have unilateral authority to implement a merger moratorium and would need congressional approval.
FTC chairman Joseph Simons added that his agency is “looking at consummated mergers as part of technology enforcement division mandate.”
Google’s proposed $2.1 billion merger of Fitbit has set off alarm bells for privacy advocates.
Cicilline referenced a letter sent by nine public interest groups to the FTC earlier Wednesday asking the agency to block the deal.
“This transaction should not be permitted because Google already holds a dominant position in the digital marketplace, health data is critical to the future of that marketplace, and the data protection concerns stemming from the acquisition will have far-reaching consequences including a dramatic erosion of consumer privacy,” wrote the groups, which included the Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen and the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
A review of the acquisition, which both companies have said is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, could fall under the authority of the DOJ or FTC.

597,"November 13, 2019",US: Google to team with banks,"
Google is planning to launch consumer checking accounts next year in partnership with Citigroup and Stanford University, The Financial Times reported on Wednesday (Nov. 13).
Code-named Cache, the accounts will be handled by Citigroup and a credit union at Stanford University. The branding will reflect the financial institutions and not Google.
“Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,” Google VP of Product Management Caesar Sengupta told FT. “It may be the slightly longer path, but it’s more sustainable.”
Google will not sell account holders’ financial data, Sengupta said, just as it doesn’t share or sell Google Pay data.
A recent McKinsey & Co. survey indicated that 58 percent of respondents said they would trust financial products from Google. That trust factor was higher than Apple and Facebook, but lower than Amazon.
“If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, it’s good for the internet and good for us,” Sengupta said. Google is still mulling whether there will be fees associated with checking accounts, he added.
Technology firms are already proving to be big competitors to traditional banks, with companies like Venmo and Cash App launching debit cards. The delicate balance between bank-FinTech competition and collaboration continues to teeter in the US In the absence of open banking regulations, FinTechs continue to enter the market, collaborating with bank partners to offer their own financial services, which often compete directly with other FIs.
According to research from Accenture, FinTech startups threaten to take a $280 billion piece of banks’ payment revenue pie by 2025 – worth 15 percent. Analysts found that FinTechs’ ability to offer free transaction services could take the greatest portion of banks’ payment revenues, followed by instant payments and app-based virtual wallet services.

599,"November 12, 2019",US: Google’s “Project Nightingale” accused of secretly gathering health records,"
Google secretly gathered millions of patient records across 21 states on behalf of a healthcare provider, in an effort dubbed “Project Nightingale,” reported The Wall Street Journal. Neither the provider’s doctors nor patients were made aware of the effort, according to the report. 
The Wall Street Journal’s Rob Copeland wrote that the data amassed in the program includes “lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, complete with patient names and dates of birth,” and that as many as 150 Google employees may have had access to the data.
Google has confirmed that it partnered with health heavyweight Ascension, a Catholic health care system based in St. Louis that operates across 21 states and the District of Columbia. The company calls itself “a faith-based healthcare organization dedicated to transformation through innovation across the continuum of care.” According to the WSJ, Google is using data from the system to design software that tailors individual patient care using “advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning.”
Forbes reported that as a part of Project Nightingale, Ascension uploaded patient data to Google’s Cloud servers. The idea was that by using the system, Ascension health providers could use a tool called Patient Search to pull up individual patient pages. According to Forbes, which stated it viewed a presentation on the topic, “The page includes complete patient information as well as notes about patient medical issues, test results and medications, including information from scanned documents.”

600,"November 12, 2019",US: AGs meet in Colorado to discuss Google antitrust probe,"
State officials investigating Alphabet’s Google met Monday, November 11, to dive into competition issues surrounding the search giant as they press forward with an investigation into whether the company is violating antitrust laws, Reuters reported.
The officials met privately in Denver with outside experts with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of Google’s businesses and the dynamics of the markets it operates in, including digital advertising.
The gathering comes two months after all but two states opened an antitrust investigation into Google with an initial focus on its advertising. Perhaps about a dozen states sent representatives to the meeting, Reuters reported. 
The gathering was similar to one held in New York in October, where state and federal enforcers from the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission discussed their probe of Facebook. 
The probe of Google, a unit of Alphabet, is being led by the Texas attorney general’s office.  Google had no comment about the meeting in Colorado, but pointed to a blog post from September in which an executive, Kent Walker, said that the company has “always worked constructively with regulators and will continue to do so.” 
Texas sent the search and advertising giant a subpoena on September 9 asking for information about its online digital advertising business, which generates most of Google’s revenue and where Google is a dominant player.

601,"November 6, 2019",US: Google’s Fitbit buy for $2.1B raises privacy concerns,"
Google’s recent acquisition of Fitbit for US$2.1 billion has left many users worried the tech giant may soon have access to their most intimate health information, from the number of steps they take each day to their breathing patterns, sleep quality, or menstrual cycles.
Fitbit, founded in San Francisco in 2007, tracks the health data of 28 million users. In a blogpost following the acquisition on Friday, November 1, Fitbit claimed user data would not be sold or used for Google advertising. “Consumer trust is paramount to Fitbit. Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit’s DNA since day one, and this will not change,” the company said in a statement.
Still, dozens of Fitbit wearers complained on social media over the weekend about the Google takeover. “I tossed my Fitbit into the trash today,” one user tweeted. “I intend to sell my Fitbit and delete my account,” said another.
Google already keeps a trove of information on people, including location data, search history, and YouTube viewing history. The company also creates advertisement profiles of users based on information such as location, gender, age, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, possible weight, and income.
Veronica KB Olsen, a research fellow at Cern in Geneva, said she immediately requested her data be deleted upon hearing news of the merger.
“I am usually careful about big tech companies gobbling up too much data, but especially Google,” she said. “I have a knee-jerk reaction to Google having any of my data. I try to opt out of most of the stuff they do.”

602,"November 4, 2019",US: Congress wants Google’s search algorithms,"
U.S. lawmakers proposed new legislation last week that would require internet platforms to more or less lay bare the intellectual property that drives their business model – their algorithms.
The Filter Bubble Transparency Act targets “large-scale internet platforms” and the so-called “filter bubbles” they create when their “secret algorithms” are used to curate and personalize search returns. Since consumers don’t know what goes into creating those returns, the algorithms create the “filter bubbles” that the Act’s sponsors say are both manipulative to the consumer and harmful to innovation.
In practice, the Act would give consumers a “plain vanilla” search return option, devoid of the “filter bubbles” that lawmakers say are created when their browsing history, prior search queries, devices and locations are used to personalize and curate search results – in other words, garbage.

Joseph Simons, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), says he will withhold from Congress a 2012 staff report that could shed light on the FTC’s now-closed investigation of Google’s search and advertising business, reported CNN. 
In a letter to Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who had requested copies of the report, Simons wrote that said the document is exempt from public disclosure and as a result, “we are not able to honor your request.” 
Staff memos, Simons wrote, reflect “deliberative” and “pre-decisional” views of agency employees. They also could contain confidential information provided by third parties to the FTC, he added, and as such can be withheld under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
“For these reasons, the final recommendation memos in the Google antitrust matter will not be released to the public,” Simons wrote. The FTC closed the Google investigation in early 2013.

604,"November 3, 2019",US: Google’s Fitbit buy faces instant antitrust scrutiny,"
Google’s US$2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit means two of the largest technology companies now dominate the US market for fitness tracking devices and data, and the purchase is already coming under fire from US lawmakers, reported Bloomberg. 
Google and Fitbit expect the deal to face protracted regulatory review in light of the current political focus on competition and privacy issues in the tech industry, a person familiar with the transaction said.
And two of the company’s major critics in Congress urged regulators to conduct just such a thorough review.
“Why should Google be permitted to acquire even more companies while they’re under DOJ antitrust investigation?” Josh Hawley, a Republican US senator from Missouri, posted on Twitter referring to the Justice Department. Representative David Cicilline, who heads the House antitrust investigation into the big tech companies, also criticized the deal.
“Google is signaling that it will continue to flex and expand its power in spite of this immense scrutiny,” said Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island. “Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit would also give the company deep insights into Americans’ most sensitive information — such as their health and location data — threatening to further entrench its market power online.”

605,"November 1, 2019",US: Google to buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion,"
Google said on Friday that it is acquiring Fitbit, the maker of fitness-tracking devices, for $2.1 billion to close the gap with Apple in the growing market for wearable electronics and to add muscle to its expanding hardware business.
The deal is likely to face regulatory scrutiny from agencies already investigating Google for antitrust concerns, because Fitbit collects sensitive health and activity information from users through the device. Heading off a potentially thorny point, Google said it would not use health data gleaned from Fitbit devices in its core advertising business.
“You will always be in control of your data, and we will remain transparent about the data we collect and why,” Fitbit’s chief executive, James Park, said in an email to his company’s customers on Friday morning. “We never sell your personal information, and Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.”

606,"October 31, 2019",US: Google sues Texas in antitrust probe,"
Google sued Texas’ attorney general on Thursday, October 31,  to ensure that its confidential business information will not be disclosed to rivals as he leads a multi-state probe into possible antitrust violations by the Internet search and advertising company.
In papers filed with a Travis County, Texas state court, Google and its parent, Alphabet, said Attorney General Ken Paxton’s hiring for the probe of three outside consultants, including two who have worked for rivals or Google critics, threatens to expose key elements of Google’s business practices, justifying appropriate safeguards.
“We’ve provided millions of pages of documents in response to regulatory inquiries, and we’re committed to cooperating,” said Julie Tarallo, a Google spokesman. “But this is an extraordinarily irregular arrangement and it’s only fair to have assurances that our confidential business information won’t be shared with competitors or vocal complainants.”
Google’s legal salvo comes almost two months after the attorneys general from 51 states, territories and the District of Columbia announced they would probe the company’s business practices for competition concerns.

607,"October 30, 2019",US: States ask internet search rival for evidence in Google probe,"
Texas’s attorney general has sent the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo a demand for documents and records as part of a multi-state antitrust probe into anti-competitive behavior by Google.
According to CNN, the legal request  was sent to DuckDuckGo earlier this month. It asks DuckDuckGo to reproduce any information it has provided to the Justice Department in connection with the federal agency’s own Google antitrust probe.
The move highlights the broad reach of investigators as 50 attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, probe Google’s business for wrongdoing. It underscores how investigators are increasingly seeking testimony from businesses that compete with Google for market share.
In September, Texas kicked off the investigation by sending Google its own civil investigative demand. With more than 200 numbered questions, the demand asked Google to explain its past mergers, its advertising technology and its data collection practices, among other things. A civil investigative demand, or CID, carries the weight of a subpoena.

608,"October 29, 2019",Australia: Google sued by ACCC over location data collection,"
Australia’s competition watchdog is pursuing Google over allegations the tech giant made false or misleading claims about which personal location data it was collecting.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) began proceedings against Google in the federal court in New South Wales on Tuesday, October 29, alleging it breached the law through a series of on-screen representations made as users set up Google accounts on their Android mobile phones and tablets, reported Reuters. 
The ACCC claims that when people set up their Google accounts on phones and tablets between January 2017 and late 2018, they would have incorrectly believed that “Location History” was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user’s location data.
“We allege that as a result of these on-screen representations, Google has collected, kept and used highly sensitive and valuable personal information about consumers’ location without them making an informed choice,” the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said in a statement on Tuesday.
The ACCC has argued that users were not able to make an informed choice about how to stop Google obtaining and retaining their personal data and location information.
A spokesperson for Google said the company was reviewing the allegations and engaging with the ACCC.
It is the first major court case launched by the ACCC against one of the tech giants since the release of the report into digital platforms earlier this year.

Labour has written to the competition regulator calling for Google’s reported acquisition of Fitbit to be halted, at least until a wider inquiry into anticompetitive practices in the technology sector is completed.

610,"October 28, 2019",France: Digital minister says Facebook different from Google on copyright,"
Facebook’s refusal to pay for news in France under new legislation on the neighboring right for publishers does not have the same consequences as Google’s refusal, French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O said Monday, October 28.
“Facebook doesn’t raise the same issues [as Google]. Facebook doesn’t generate the same traffic, it’s not a search engine,” he told French radio France Inter. 
The French government is very unhappy with the way Google decided to implement the EU copyright directive’s neighboring right in the country.
Google changed the way press material appears online instead of signing licensing agreements with press publishers. France’s main press publishers announced they would file an antitrust complaint against the tech company, arguing Google abuses its dominant position.
Over the weekend, publishers also turned against Facebook when it became clear the social media company was not going to pay for licenses either.
“Facebook as such does fall under the scope of the neighboring right. The question is whether we can consider that sharing a press article on your news feed… falls under the neighboring right. That does raise a legal question,” Cédric O said.

611,"October 28, 2019",US: Analysts may question Google on Antitrust investigations during earnings call,"
During a quarterly earnings call on Monday, October 28, financial analysts may be as interested in Google’s ongoing investigations as in reported revenue. 
Reuters reported that the analysts might be looking for details on continuing antitrust investigations, including one currently being done by attorneys general from in 48 U.S. states. 
When asked, Google is expected to respond that it has faced these types of investigations before, and by some of the same organizations. 
Texas recently announced that it was going to spearhead the investigation by the state attorneys general into anticompetitive practices by the search giant and its advertising practices.
Google is likely to say that these types of investigations never lead anywhere, and point to a Federal Trade Commission probe in 2013 that was settled.
“We have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us,” Google wrote in a recent blog post.
However, the probes have aided a new type of fervor for going after Google. Missouri has been investigating Google for two years, and it recently folded its investigation into the larger Texas one. The idea is that with more and more AGs on board, “there’s a lot more firepower,” said Chris Nuelle, a Missouri AG spokesman.
Google parent company Alphabet’s quarterly revenue is expected to come in around 20%, which is its usual rate. Its cloud computing business and YouTube are expected to be large revenue earners. Google does not offer in-depth product level disclosures though, and that could leave investors with more questions than answers about how Google is going to deal with things like more regulatory scrutiny and increasing pushback from advertisers. 
While there have been previous investigations, the interest in Google from regulators and lawmakers has not abated, according to Sally Hubbard, a director at the antitrust-advocacy group Open Markets Institute. Hubbard worked at the New York AG’s office from 2005 to 2012. 
“But the political winds have shifted,” Hubbard said. “There’s a lot more momentum to fix the situation.”

612,"October 24, 2019",France: Media groups to take Google copyright fight to competition watchdog,"
French media firms said Thursday that they would drag Google before the country’s competition regulator over its refusal to pay for displaying their content in the search results, setting up a legal fight over a new EU copyright law.
The APIG press alliance, which groups dozens of national and regional newspapers, said it would also press the French government to take action against the US internet giant.
“We are outraged,” said Jean-Michel Baylet, APIG president and chief executive of Depeche du Midi newspaper in southern France.
“Nobody can flout the law, but that’s what Google is doing,” he said. “The future of the French and European press is at stake.”
International news agency Agence France-Presse, which is not a member of the alliance, said it was preparing a separate complaint.
France in July became the first country to ratify an EU copyright law which was passed this year and came into force Thursday to ensure publishers are compensated when their work is displayed online.
The new rules create so-called neighbouring rights to ensure a form of copyright protection for media firms when their content is used on websites such as search engines or social media platforms.
But Google says articles, pictures and videos will be shown in the search results only if media firms consent to let the tech giant use them for free.
If they refuse, only a headline and a bare link to the content will appear, Google said, almost certainly resulting in a loss of visibility and potential ad revenue for the publisher.

614,"October 23, 2019",EU: Google offers better terms to rival search engines,"
European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is offering better terms to rival search engines that want to appear on Android phones under a US$4.8 billion antitrust decision against the tech giant.
Under the new terms, disclosed online earlier this week, Google will effectively charge other search engines less money, and sometimes no money, to appear on a “choice screen” that allows new Android-phone users in Europe to choose a default search engine.
According to the Journal, the changes show how Ms. Vestager is taking a tougher stance on the US tech giant, two weeks after she acknowledged that the record fines she has slapped on Google weren’t “doing the trick” and that more sweeping remedies are needed. 
“We have been discussing the choice screen mechanism with Google,” a spokeswoman for Ms. Vestager said, adding the talks came after the EU received feedback from search rivals about the choice screen.

615,"October 21, 2019",France: Regulator accuses Google of flouting EU copyright law,"
France has accused American internet giant Google of ignoring “the spirit and the letter” of a Europe-wide copyright law aimed at giving publishers a bigger cut of the economic benefit from online news, reported the Los Angeles Times. 
French President Emmanuel Macron and the country’s lawmakers say they are now looking to sanction Google for adopting what they consider strongarm tactics to avoid paying to publish excerpts from European publications on Google News.
Google responded to the law’s passage by announcing it would stop displaying previews of news articles and use only a headline and link. The company announced French publishers could still ask for snippets to be published, but it would not pay for the right. Google claims it sends 8 billion visitors a month to publishers’ sites in Europe alone.
“Publishers have always been able to decide whether their content is available to be found in Google Search or Google News,” Google wrote in a blog post. “The Internet has created more choice and diversity in news than ever before. With so many options, it can be hard for consumers to find the news they are interested in. And for all types of publishers … it’s important to make sure readers can find their content.”
Google’s announcement brought an angry riposte from Macron, who told journalists on Wednesday, October 16, he would be asking Europe’s competition authorities to examine the move and to “engage in any possible action as soon as possible.”
France is the first European country to put the European Union’s Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market on its statute books, taking effect at the end of October. The European Parliament adopted the directive in March, giving member states two years to pass legislation upholding its requirements.
France’s law requires Google to pay what has been called a “link tax” — effectively a license to display snippets of press articles on Google News.

Apple and three other tech giants have begun to comply with data requests from the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which is investigating possible antitrust offenses.
Alphabet, Amazon, and Google have also begun to provide the requested data, though none of the companies have yet supplied all of the information required.
The leaders of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said late on Tuesday, October 15, that they had begun receiving data from Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, Amazon and Apple as part of their probe into the companies’ potential breaches of antitrust law, reported Reuters. 
The probe is one of several at the federal, state, and congressional level aimed at determining if the companies use their considerable clout in the online market illegally to hurt rivals or otherwise break competition law.
“We have received initial submissions from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook as part of our investigation. While we do not yet have all of the information we requested, we expect that all four companies will provide the information in short order,” the committee’s leaders said in a joint statement.
“We look forward to their continued compliance with the committee’s investigation,” they said in the statement.

617,"October 15, 2019",EU: Google’s antitrust appeal hearings scheduled for February,"
Google’s appeal against a US$2.64 billion fine for antitrust practices in the EU will be heard by a court over a three-day period in February, reported PYMNTS. 
Reuters is reporting that Europe’s second-highest court will hear the case. Google and a tech lobbying group will bring their argument to the Luxembourg-based General Court. The European Commission will be represented by the country of Germany, as well as eight other companies.
The hearings are scheduled for February 12-14, according to Richard Stables, chief executive of British price comparison site Kelkoo, which is on the EU’s side in the case.
The Commission accused Google two years ago of favoring its own search service over that of competitors, levying the fine to punish the search giant and help level the competition field. Google went to the General Court with its appeal, and is also appealing other antitrust decisions.
The British consumer group BEUC and price comparison site Foundem—which is the company that triggered the investigation with its complaints—are supporting the Commission. A French price comparison site called Twenga, the German publishing groups VDZ and BDZV, and the German comparison fashion site Visual Meta are all participating on the side of the Commission.
Google’s problems with antitrust practices are not exclusive to Europe. At the end of last month, Google’s plan to use a new internet protocol caught the attention of congressional antitrust investigators.
In a letter sent to the tech giant on September 13, investigators for the House Judiciary Committee requested information about Google’s “decision regarding whether to adopt or promote the adoption” of the protocol, which would encrypt internet traffic.
House investigators were concerned that the move would give Google an advantage over its rivals by making it harder for others to access consumer data. In addition, a source told The Wall Street Journal that the Justice Department has recently received complaints about the protocol change.

Google’s fight against a record EU antitrust fine related to its Android mobile software received a boost after Europe’s second-highest court allowed Android phone maker Gigaset and HMD Global Oy to intervene in the lawsuit, reported Reuters. 
Google is challenging the European Commission’s €4.34 billion (US$4.8 billion) fine and an order to drop anti-competitive business practices aimed at blocking rivals in internet browsing at the Luxembourg-based General Court.
The EU competition enforcer in its 2018 ruling stated Google gave itself an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks. 
Germany’s Gigaset Communications GmbH and Finland’s HMD Global Oy, which is the exclusive licensee of the Nokia brand for phones, can take part in the process in support of Google, the court announced in a document published on Thursday, October 10.
Judges also allowed tech lobbying group Application Developers Alliance, web browser Opera Software, and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which counts Google among its members, to intervene. 
Commission supporters allowed to intervene are the European Consumer Organisation, lobbying group FairSearch whose complaint triggered the EU case, Czech search engine Seznam, French search engine Qwant, and two German publishing groups, VDZ and BDZV.

Texas officials managing a sprawling investigation of the advertising practices at Alphabet Google have begun receiving data from the search and advertising giant, reported Reuters.

Google, which had no immediate comment for this story, offers free searches, email, and other services, but much of its revenue is from advertising. 
The investigation is in early stages. Texas sent a lengthy request for information to Google last month, with a response date of October 9.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of 50 state AGs that have joined an investigation into accusations of antitrust violations by search and advertising giant Google, said in an interview with the Washington Post that “We’re prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers.” Whether it’s standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed: “All of that’s on the table based on what we learn.
The probe marks the first major US antitrust action against Google in roughly a decade. Previously, Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company’s search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant.
Since then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue key signs that Google and Silicon Valley are in violation of federal law. “Antitrust seems like it hasn’t been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,” he said, later adding: “I think this should have been looked at sooner than it is.”

Google is reportedly considering an acquisition of TikTok-like “Firework,” an app that allows users to make and share 30-second videos with strangers, per The Wall Street Journal. The startup is a US company that was valued at over US$100 million earlier this year. Buying Firework would launch Google back into the social space after it shuttered its struggling Google+ social network in April.
The acquisition would mark yet another big tech company jumping into direct competition with TikTok — it was revealed last week that Facebook is building a TikTok competitor called “Lasso.” TikTok’s rapid rise has turned heads among global tech companies.
The app boasts over a billion downloads and is hugely popular among younger generations, with over 65% of its users under the age of 30, per App Ape Lab. The company represents a credible competitor in the social space, and Facebook has taken notice: In a leaked audio from an internal July Facebook Q&A, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the company’s strategy surrounding Lasso in direct relation to TikTok.

622,"October 8, 2019","“Trust me, I’m fair”: Analysing Google’s latest practices in ad tech from the perspective of EU competition law","
By Damien Geradin &Dimitrios Katsifis (EUCLID Law)


In a first paper released in January 2019, we explained the mechanics of online display advertising and real-time bidding with a focus on the tools and technologies comprising the ad tech market. We identified Google as the leading, and most likely dominant player across the ad tech value chain and expressed the concern that it engages in prima facie anticompetitive conduct, in that it uses its leading ad server to favor its ad intermediation business and exclude competitors. We also explained how the lack of competition across the ad tech value chain enables Google to exploit advertisers and publishers by charging hidden fees for ad intermediation on top of its disclosed commissions. In March 2019, Google announced that it would switch to a first-price unified auction by the end of 2019, arguing that its move would help create a fair and transparent market for everyone. Meanwhile, online advertising has attracted significant regulatory interest in the EU, the USA and Australia. In this new paper, we analyse whether Google’s switch to a unified auction has addressed the concerns we expressed in our first paper. We conclude that this is not the case. Google’s latest switch does nothing to increase auction transparency. Worse, it seems to strengthen Google’s ability to extract hidden margins from its customers, while undermining the competitive pressure exercised by header bidding. If substantiated, Google’s conduct could result in significant welfare losses for publishers, advertisers and ultimately consumers. We conclude our paper by suggesting various structural and behavioral remedies that could help restore competition in ad tech should our concerns be substantiated.

The UK Court of Appeal has unanimously overturned a block on a class-action style lawsuit brought on behalf of four million iPhone users against Google reported the Financial Times. 
The High Court tossed the suit a year ago on legal grounds. However, the claimants sought permission to appeal and that’s been granted.
The case pertains to allegations that Google used tracking cookies to override iPhone users’ privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser between 2011 and 2012. Specifically, that Google developed a workaround for browser settings that allowed it to set its DoubleClick Ad cookie without iPhone users’ knowledge or consent.
In 2012 the tech giant settled with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the same issue agreeing to pay US$22.5 million to resolve the charge that it bypassed Safari’s privacy settings to serve targeted ads to consumers. Although Google’s settlement with the FTC did not include an admission of any legal wrongdoing.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal this Sunday, September 29, Congressional antitrust investigators are scrutinizing plans by Google to use a new internet protocol, concerned that it could give the company a competitive advantage by making it harder for others to access consumer data.
In a letter this month, investigators for the House Judiciary Committee asked Google for information about its “decision regarding whether to adopt or promote the adoption” of the protocol, which the Alphabet Inc. company says is aimed at improving internet security. 
House investigators are also asking whether data collected or processed through the new protocol will be used by Google for any commercial purposes, according to the Sept. 13 letter. 
The Justice Department is aware of concerns over the protocol change and has recently received complaints, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The new standard would encrypt internet traffic to improve security, which could help prevent hackers from spoofing or snooping on websites.
But the new standard could alter the internet’s competitive landscape, cable and wireless companies say. They fear being shut out from much of user data if browser users move wholesale to this new standard, which many internet service providers don’t currently support.

630,"September 25, 2019",US: Josh Hawley urges FTC to release full 2012 Google antitrust report,"
Sen. Josh Hawley (Republican – Missouri) sent a letter on Tuesday, September 24, to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), urging its five commissioners to release the agency’s 2012 report which detailed Google’s anticompetitive policies.
Sen. Hawley sent a letter to the agency’s five commissioners to release the full 2012 report detailing Google’s anticompetitive behavior. Half of the 2012 report released was disclosed in 2015 and detailed that the search engine giant manipulated its search results to bias its own services over Google’s competitors.
“I believe the remaining pages likely contain information critical to the public interest because they may reveal that Google has long been deceiving consumers,” Hawley wrote in his letter to the commissioners.
Sen. Hawley’s letter to the FTC arises as 50 attorneys general have announced an antitrust investigation into Google’s manipulation of the online search and digital advertising markets.
The Missouri senator noted that two years ago, the European Union (EU) fined Google US$2.7 billion for manipulating its search results. Hawley contended that Google was “in fact rigging specific search results to favor the interests of Google’s executives.”
Sen. Hawley noted that the 2012 FTC report noted that, citing internet Google documents, that they manipulated their search engine “to bias ourselves.”
He added “Google was misleading consumers about how its algorithm worked” and that “Google systematically deceived consumers,” which provides “real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets.”

631,"September 24, 2019",EU: Google wins case as court rules “right to be forgotten”,"
The EU’s top court has ruled that Google does not need to remove links to sensitive information in all versions of its search engine worldwide when responding to “right to be forgotten” requests. Reuters reports that the European Court of Justice ruled that Google must only remove links in versions of its search engine meant for use in EU member states.
“There is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject… to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,” the court said.
Google was fined €100,000 (around $110,000) by France’s privacy watchdog CNIL back in 2016 for failing to delist search results globally, and not just in Europe. The requests were made as part of the EU’s so-called “right to be forgotten,” a ruling that was first established back in 2014 which says that internet search providers have a responsibility to remove outdated information that is “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive.”

The EU released a 327-page explanation of its decision to fine Google US$5 billion last year for antitrust violations, providing US regulators with a detailed roadmap for pursuing similar allegations.
Last year, the EU found that Google abused its dominant market position by tying its search app to the Android app store, according to the report. In addition, the EU found that Google improperly entered into revenue-sharing agreements with equipment makers and wireless carriers who agreed not to pre-install competing search services on phones. 
The EU released the details of its ruling as a host of US entities are conducting their own antitrust probes into the company, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, state attorneys general, Congress, and a Federal Trade Commission task force.

Google will make an additional investment of €3 billion (US$3.3 billion) over the next two years to expand its European data centers, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in Finland. 
According to Reuters, the investment plan includes an additional €600 million (US$661.2 million) investment in the Hamina data center in Finland, bringing the total investment in the site to €2 billion (US$2.2 million), Finland’s Prime Minister Antti Rinne told the joint news conference.
“This is fantastic news for Finland,” Rinne said. 
Google already has one data center in Hamina, where it invested €800 million (US$881.6 million) to convert an old paper mill. It stated in May it would invest €600 million (US$661.2 million) in a new data center on the same site.

The Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings in Cincinnati and Cleveland to investigate if the companies are engaging in anticompetitive practices harmful to consumers that could lead to reduced innovation, fewer choices, and higher costs.

Eight states and the District of Columbia joined with the Facebook investigation and all but two states signed onto the Google investigation.

Google Australia managing director Melanie Silva has accused the competition regulator of overlooking more than three billion referrals to Australian news organizations and existing commercial agreements, brushing off the need for a code to govern business deals with local media companies.
Ms Silva hit back against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) recommendation that platforms such as Facebook and Google draw up codes of conduct for how they negotiate commercial deals with media companies, including revenue and data sharing.
“The proposal for regulator-sanctioned negotiation of revenue sharing between platforms and news publishers overlooks existing commercial arrangements between Google and Australian news publishers and the broader value that Google provides through referred web traffic and technology,” Ms Silva wrote in a blog post, summarizing the search and advertising giant’s submission to the Treasury on the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry.
Google has not made its full submission to the Treasury public. Ms Silva’s blog did not address the ACCC’s ruling that there was an imbalance of bargaining power between the tech giants and local media companies. Facebook strenuously denied there was an imbalance in its submission.

A US House of Representatives panel on Friday, September 13, demanded internal emails, detailed financial information, and other company records from top executives of Amazon.com, Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet’s Google, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
Among other requests, the committee asked the firms to provide by October 14 reams of documents, including executive communications and financial statements as well as information about competitors, market share, mergers, and key business decisions.
The dozens of executives named in the requests include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Google’s early leaders Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt.
The companies are likely to resist such carte blanche access, which could set in motion negotiations with the House committee over the scope of materials provided, said William Kovacic, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
The House committee isn’t subpoenaing the records, though it has the authority to do so—a fact that gives lawmakers a stick they can use in negotiations over access.

DIGI, the industry body representing (DIGI)  Google, Facebook, and Twitter has rejected proposals for an industry code of conduct on fake news, warning that the recommendation would turn Australia’s media regulator into the truth police, reported The Australian Financial Review. 
The recommendation included changes to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to assess whether an acquisition would result in the removal of a potential competitor in the marketplace. It also recommended new considerations to include the significance of data and technology in accessing M&A.
“Mergers and acquisitions in the technology sector are a crucial driver of innovation and investment, as they offer an incentive for entrepreneurs who start companies, for whom selling their company is commonly the end goal,” DIGI wrote said in its submission to the Treasury ahead of the government’s response to the ACCC’s report.
“Ensuring that start-ups can successfully exit their venture, through acquisition from large technology companies, is key to ensuring growth and development of Australia’s technology sector. Exit fees can create a virtuous cycle, where founders use that capital to create another successful company.”
Google, Facebook, and Twitter are all expected to put in their own submissions to the ACCC’s final report.

California and Alabama are the two states that haven’t joined an investigation into Google’s market dominance, reported Fox Business.
The attorneys general for the two states are sitting out the investigation announced Monday, September 9, and California is under special scrutiny as the home of Silicon Valley and Google’s headquarters. According to Fox, the offices of both attorneys general have declined to elaborate on why they are not taking part.
Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than US$820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it’s fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google’s dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.
Google expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the US and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Monday, September 9, announced an antitrust investigation into Google, with the participation of 50 attorneys general. The probe comes as Silicon Valley faces increasing scrutiny from the government over what critics say are monopolistic business practices, reported CNBC. 
The investigation will be a bipartisan operation conducted by the attorneys general of 48 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. The only two states not participating in the probe are California, where Google is based, and Alabama. Paxton said the group had just recently sent Google a demand for information. 
“It’s an investigation to determine the facts,” Paxton said during a press conference outside the US Supreme Court building in Washington, DC. “Right now it’s about advertising, but the facts will lead where they lead.” 
The announcement was made by a small group of attorneys general which included Paxton, Karl Racine of Washington, DC, and Doug Peterson of Nebraska. Paxton said his office will serve as the head of a leadership team for the investigation, which will meet about the probe every week. Each state can be as involved as it wants to be. “It will be a very open process,” Paxton said.

Hot on the heels of a $170m (£139m) settlement, agreed with US regulators on Wednesday over claims it had been breaching children’s privacy law with its YouTube site, the search giant looks set to face yet another investigation.
This time, though, it can expect more than a rap on the knuckles. The probe, expected to be launched next week by more than half of the US’s state attorneys general, would mark a significant coordinated action to rein in the internet giant – and could very well be Google’s toughest hurdle yet.

New evidence submitted for an investigation into Google’s collection of personal data in the European Union reportedly accuses the search giant of stealthy sending your personal user data to advertisers, reported the Financial Times.


The evidence was submitted to Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, the main watchdog over the company in the European Union, by Johnny Ryan, chief policy officer for privacy-focused browser maker Brave, according to a Financial Times report Wednesday, September 4. 
Ryan reportedly said he discovered that Google used a tracker containing web browsing information, location and other data and sent it to ad companies via webpages that “showed no content,” according to FT.
This could allow companies buying ads to match a user’s Google profile and web activity to profiles from other companies, which is against Google’s own ad buying rules, according to the FT.

Texas leads the group of 30-plus attorneys general, which plans to announce the probe on September 9, the source said.
Google stated that it was cooperating with the state officials. “We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,” Google representative Jose Castaneda said.
Over the summer, some state attorneys general met privately with officials from the Justice Department, which announced its own broad review into big tech, to discuss their antitrust concerns. The agency’s antitrust leader, Makan Delrahim, later said at a conference in August that the federal government is coordinating with state leaders, which he numbered at more than a dozen, but declined to offer further details about the agency’s plans.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is fining Google between US$150 million and US$200 million to settle the whole debacle with its subsidiary, YouTube, allegedly breaking children’s privacy law, Politico reported first on Friday, August 30. 
While details about the settlement haven’t been officially announced, a person familiar with the matter told Politico the measure gained FTC approval with a 3-2 vote along party lines, seeming to confirm similar reports from the Washington Post last month. After gaining FTC approval, the settlement will go on to the Justice Department for review.
Reports of the FTC’s investigation into the online video platform originally surfaced in June after several privacy groups claimed YouTube collected data on its youngest viewers without parental consent in an effort to serve them ads. This would violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which limits how companies can scrape data from users younger than 13.

Google publicly disclosed its acquisition of homework helper app Socratic in an announcement this week, detailing the added support for the company’s AI technology and its relaunch on iOS. The acquisition apparently flew under the radar.
According to one founder’s LinkedIn update, that was in March 2018. Google declined to comment when asked for specifics about the acquisition.
Socratic was founded in 2013 by Chris Pedregal and Shreyans Bhansali with the goal of creating a community that made learning accessible to all students.
Initially, the app offered a Quora-like Q&A platform where students could ask questions that were answered by experts. By the time Socratic raised $6 million in Series A funding back in 2015, its community had grown to around 500,000 students. The company later evolved to focus less on connecting users and more on utility.

Google faces another antitrust allegation in the European Union—this time focused on its job search service. A group of 23 job search websites sent a letter to EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager claiming the search giant abused its dominant position at their expense, according to Reuters.
The company launched the service in 2017, and later amped it up by adding information on salary and the ability to search for jobs by location.
The rival companies alleged that Google’s putting a large widget for its service at the top of people’s job searches is unfair because it doesn’t have to spend any money marketing the service, while traditional job search companies do. They asked Vestager to temporarily order Google to stop doing this while she looks into its practices, Reuters reported.
“We confirm we have received the letter and we will assess it,” a European Commission spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. Vestager, who has been examining job search on Google, leaves office October 31. But a person familiar with the review told Reuters that Vestager is preparing an “intensive” handover so that her successor does not drop it.

Last month, Google announced it would set aside US$750 million worth of land and US$250 million in financing to spur developers in the San Francisco Bay Area to build at least 20,000 homes and renovate other housing over the next decade.

654,"July 9, 2019","US: Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon said to testify at Congressional antitrust hearing next week","
Representatives from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon will be appearing at a hearing with US House Committee on the Judiciary next week to discuss antitrust issues, according to a reports by Politico and The Washington Post.
The Post reported that the companies will be sending legal and policy executives, including Kyle Andeer, Apple’s vice president for corporate law and chief compliance officer and Matt Perault, the head of global policy development at Facebook. Neither the companies nor a spokesman for the committee immediately responded to requests for comment.
The hearing will mark another opportunity for lawmakers to discuss their growing frustration with tech companies, which have until recently been able to largely operate without meaningful regulation. But lawmakers have signaled an appetite to punish big tech firms following a series of high profile scandals — including disinformation campaigns by Russian and Iranian operatives aimed at disrupting the US political process and its elections.

655,"July 8, 2019",India: Google probe sparked by junior antitrust researchers,"

Two junior Indian antitrust research associates and a law school student were behind a complaint that sparked a probe into Google’s alleged anti-competitive practices in the country, reported Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered a full-blown investigation into Alphabet’s Google in April for alleged abuse of its Android platform to hurt rivals, but the complainants’ names came to light only when the order was made public last week.
The case was filed by Umar Javeed and Sukarma Thapar, who work as research associates at the CCI, and Umar’s brother Aaqib, a law school student who interned with the CCI briefly in 2018, their LinkedIn profiles showed. All three declined interview requests for this article.
Though it’s unusual for CCI researchers to file cases with the watchdog, antitrust lawyers said, there is nothing wrong with it. They acted in their personal capacity, a senior government official said, adding that all are aged in their 20s.

According to a report from Bloomberg, the UK’s antitrust authority is starting a long-awaited investigation into the dominance of social media giants including Alphabet’s Google and Facebook in digital advertising markets.
The Competition and Markets Authority said that if it found that the companies’ market power was harming competition it would consider bringing in a stricter regulatory regime. The new rules could limit how the firms set prices with advertisers, it said. Some separation of business units may also be appropriate, the regulator said.
The CMA is joining other European regulators in examining how the online advertising market functions. French and German antitrust authorities have separately been looking at the market, with France’s competition agency flagging the scale of Google’s ad offering and data as a potential concern. Data protection authorities are also scrutinizing the advertising bidding process and how it may share personal information.

The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) wants the chance to speak to antitrust enforcers set to investigate Amazon and Google’s alleged anti-competitive practices.
RILA, whose members include Walmart, Target and Best Buy, among others, said it is ready and willing to voice its concerns with the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
“It’s pretty clear to us that the FTC and different relevant regulators should be taking a much closer look at these platform companies,” said Nicholas Ahrens, vice president of innovation for RILA, in an interview, according to Bloomberg. “We are here to help.”
In addition to RILA, companies such as Oracle, Yelp, Tripadvisor and News Corp have also spoken up about what they believe is competitive harm imposed by major technology platforms. In fact, the retailers’ group has already spoken on the topic to the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee, as well as recently wrote a letter to the FTC accusing Amazon and Google of creating an “information bottleneck.”
RILA also warned that the tech companies have the power to favor their own products over sellers on their platforms, collect data about competitors and allow for the spread of counterfeit goods.
It should be “quite concerning to the commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches consumers,” the trade group said i...

658,"June 30, 2019",India: Google found guilty of misusing Android dominance in India,"
Google appears to have misused its dominant position in India and reduced the ability of device manufacturers to opt for alternate versions of its Android mobile operating system, Indian officials found before ordering a wider probe in an antitrust case.
A 14-page order from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), reviewed by Reuters last week, found Google’s restrictions on manufacturers seemed to amount to imposition of “unfair conditions” under India’s competition law.
Reuters reported last month that the CCI had launched a probe in April against Google for its alleged abuse of Android’s dominant position to block rivals, but the contents of the directive detailing the initial assessment upon which that investigation was ordered have not been previously revealed.
The Indian case is similar to one Google faced in Europe, where regulators imposed a US$5 billion fine on the company for forcing manufacturers to pre-install its apps on Android devices. Google has appealed against the verdict.

Spain’s National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC), which is preparing sanctions against media company Atresmedia, has enjoined the company to participate in a public consultation on the digital advertising market in Spain.
Atresmedia stated in a letter sent to the CNMC that “there is a problem of excessive concentration with the digital duopoly held by Google and Facebook throughout the entire value chain.” Thus, the television station joins associations such as the Spanish Association of Advertisers, the Advertising Media Association of Spain, and several others that have offered their opinion to the CNMC on the subject.
Atresmedia claims that “the interdependence of concurrent factors in the process of buying and selling video and display advertising allows (Google) to polarize the competitive dynamics of the online advertising market, even without price being a decisive element.” Atresmedia also accused Google and Facebook of having “established vertical integration in a single and complex advertising service,” reducing the capacity and incentive for potential competitors.

Brazil’s Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) has put aside a complaint over alleged anti-competitive practices by Google, accused of copying the content of its competitors to use the results in its search mechanism. The Brazilian competition authority decided not to follow up the case, not being able to verify the violation.
The complaint filed by the company E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia, which controls the e-commerce platforms Buscapé and Bondfaro, accuses Google of copying its product evaluation information, presenting said results as its own information.
CADE analyzed search results published between 2011 and 2016, and concluded that no material evidence could be found regarding the publication of content not authorized by the company. Google, in a statement, said it was satisfied with the decision. “We are confident that our products and services operate in accordance with Brazilian laws and we will continue to collaborate with the agency.”

Así, la televisora se une a asociaciones como la Asociación Española de Anunciantes, la Asociación de Medios Publicitarios de España y varias más que han ofrecido su opinión a la CNMC respecto al tema.
Atresmedia asegura que «la interdependencia de los factores concurrentes en el proceso de compraventa de publicidad de vídeo y display le permite (a Google) polarizar la dinámica competitiva del mercado de la publicidad on-line, incluso sin que el precio sea un elemento decisivo. Atresmedia también acusó a Google y FB de haber “establecido una integración vertical en una única y compleja prestación publicitaria”, reduciendo la capacidad y el incentive de posibles competidores.

This follows the European Union having fined Google over abuse of Android’s market dominance last year.
The CCI director general has issued letters to several handset makers including Samsung, Xiaomi, Karbonn and Lava, seeking information on terms and conditions of agreements with Google. The CCI also wants to know if Google imposed any restrictions on using the company’s mobile apps and services over eight years beginning April 2011.

According to Reuters shareholder activists want Google parent Alphabet Inc to break itself up before regulators force the world’s biggest internet ad seller to split into different pieces.
SumOfUs, a US-based group that aims to curb the growing power of corporations, is set to make that proposal at Alphabet’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday at an auditorium at the company’s offices in Sunnyvale, California.
“Officials in the US & EU continue to be concerned about Alphabet’s market power in view of restrictions on monopolies,” the proposal reads. “We believe that shareholders could receive greater value from a voluntary strategic reduction in the size of the company than from asset sales compelled by regulators.”

The US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are gearing up to investigate whether Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters earlier this month.

By Patience Haggin and Kara Dapena

Google is the dominant player in online advertising, one reason the U.S. Justice Department is laying the groundwork for potential antitrust action against the tech giant. It has a 37% share of the $130 billion U.S. digital ad market, according to research firm eMarketer, but understanding Google’s full clout requires a deeper look at the sector.
Google is the major force at every layer between advertisers and websites, providing tools used in the many steps of purchasing and selling online ads—whether they are meant to run on Google’s own platforms or sites around the web. Critics say the company packages and prices its products in ways that thwart competition and allow it to take an unreasonably large cut of online ad transactions.
A Google spokesman declined to comment. The company is prepared to show U.S. regulators that while it has an enviable place in online advertising, it doesn’t have monopolistic pricing power, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The mainstay of Google’s business is search. It has close to 80% of the U.S. market for search ads, accounting for the bulk of its $116.3 billion in total ad revenue last year.

El Consejo Administrativo de Defensa Económica (CADE) de Brasil abrió una investigación para analizar supuestas prácticas anticompetitivas relacionadas al sistema operativo Android, de Google, en un proceso preliminar que podría conducir a investigaciones más robustas. 
CADE ha cuestionado las prácticas anticompetitivas adoptadas por la empresa, rechazadas por la Comisión Europea en una decisión revelada en Julio del año pasado. En aquella ocasión, la CE multó a Google por 4,300 millones de euros. Al CADE le interesa averiguar si dichas prácticas también violan leyes económicas en Brasil, perjudicando a los consumidores locales. 
Entre las prácticas analizadas y consideradas como anticompetitivas se encuentra la obligación de pre-instalar la aplicación de búsqueda o el navegador de Google (Chrome y Google Search), así como pagos realizados a fabricantes para garantizar dicha instalación, así como para impedir la venta de aparatos con versiones del sistema operativo Android no aprobadas por la empresa. 
Google ha comentado que “Android permitió la conexión de millones de brasileños a internet, a hacer de los celulares más accesibles y acelerar su popularización. Vamos a trabajar con el CADE para demostrar cómo es que Android permitió que el mercado brasileño se tornase más competitivo e innovador, y no lo contrario.”

667,"June 13, 2019",EU: Regulator wants info on Google antitrust actions,"
European Union officials are looking for feedback on Google’s attempts to shut down two antitrust investigations.
 
Sources revealed to Bloomberg that Google started showing a box with links to rival websites in March in addition to the usual search results in response to the EU investigating complaints that less search traffic was going to these competitor sites.
Regulators have reportedly sent out screenshots of Google’s box showing three restaurant booking sites, asking various travel companies for their opinions on the sites. In addition, the EU asked recruitment companies about how links to job websites have been displayed. The companies have until June 13 to send initial responses.
The links box is similar to a solution Google has already been using to comply with a 2017 EU order that required the tech giant to give equal treatment to other shopping comparison websites. It’s a fix that its rivals, including Yelp, don’t believe is enough to remedy the situation.
“The amount of traffic Google has stolen from the web has doubled over Vestager’s term, and attempting to put a Band-Aid on that problem with a rival links proposal doesn’t address the core problem,” Luther Lowe, Yelps’ government affairs vice president, said in an interview on Wednesday, June 12.

The investigation is still at a preliminary stage. The Brazilian regulator based its inquiry on the EU competition fine against Google last year and whether the same practices were used in Brazil.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for the head of the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division to recuse himself from working on any investigations of Alphabet’s Google or Apple because of his past lobbying for both companies.
Warren wrote to Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who oversees the Antitrust Division, in a letter dated Tuesday, June 11, that his past work advocating on behalf of the tech giants would create the appearance of a conflict of interest as the agency oversees antitrust scrutiny of both companies. The Massachusetts senator sent a similar letter calling for Delrahim’s recusal to a Justice Department ethics official.
“As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government,” Warren’s letter said. “American consumers and markets deserve the confidence that the DOJ will conduct any antitrust investigation into Google or Apple with integrity, impartiality, and with the best interest of competitive markets and consumers in mind.”
Warren’s letter came days after the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission divvied up antitrust oversight of Google, Facebook.com, Amazon.com, and Apple.

Apple’s former general counsel Bruce Sewell recently said the deal to make Google the default search engine for Safari on iPhones and Macs is worth billions and took about four months of daily negotiations to complete, according to a report by CNBC.
“The Google negotiation for example, between Apple and Google over search, probably took us four months,” Sewell said, adding that he was “meeting almost every single day” with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and also with Kent Walker, general counsel for Google.
“And then with myself and either Tim [Cook] or Eddy Cue who was my counterpart on that deal. They’d be at Google or we’d be at Apple almost every day, it’s just one example there are a lot of those kinds of negotiations or lawsuits that just completely suck up all your time,” he said.
The comments were taken from a Youtube video at Columbia Law School where Sewell was interviewed by a student about his long career in law.
Apple never said just how much it gets paid by Google, but court documents show that Google paid Apple $1 billion in 2014. Another estimate puts the amount at $9.5 billion last year. Sewell worked for Google from 2009 to 2017. Safari is the second most popular search engine after Google.

Google made US$4.7 billion from the work of journalists last year via search and Google News, taking a huge cut from the online ad revenue of media houses which lost a crucial source of income, resulting in many of them getting shrunk or closed, reported the New York Times.
News is a significant part of Google’s business, according to a study to be released on Monday, June 10, by the News Media Alliance (NMA), which represents more than 2,000 newspapers across the US.
The journalists who create that content deserve a cut of that US$4.7 billion, president and chief executive of the NMA David Chavern was quoted as saying by The New York Times.
The California-based internet giant made the amount from the work of news publishers in 2018 via search and Google News, it reported.
That US$4.7 billion is nearly as much as the US$5.1 billion brought in by the United States news industry as a whole from digital advertising last year, the report claimed.

673,"June 9, 2019","Antitrust, Free Speech and Google","
By Mark Epstein, Wall Street Journal
Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign promised to use antitrust law against oligopolies it said were “destroying an American democracy that depends on a free flow of information and freedom of thought.” The Justice Department’s investigation of Google may appear to fulfill this pledge. But Makan Delrahim, who heads the antitrust division, has voiced skepticism.
In a 2018 address, he rejected the notion that “antitrust enforcers should step beyond consumer welfare and think about . . . values like the free speech the First Amendment protects.” He worried it would lead to subjective enforcement because “Republican and Democrat prosecutors, or those of any party or political orientation, carry with them their own perceptions of what is good and bad for our democracy.”
Yet platform neutrality isn’t a strictly partisan issue. When Facebook temporarily blocked Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign ad in March, she tweeted: “I want a social media marketplace that isn’t dominated by a single censor. #BreakUpBigTech.” Her Republican colleague Ted Cruz agreed: “She’s right—Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.”
The Justice Department does have authority to consider how Google’s dominance affects the marketplace of ideas, and federal prosecutors routinely make decisions with partisan policy implications when enforcing campaign-finance, election-fraud, and voting-rights laws.

674,"June 6, 2019",US: Google pays $2.6B for data analytics Software company,"
Google’s parent company Alphabet announced on Thursday, June 6, that it is buying data analytics company Looker for US$2.6 billion, according to a report from Reuters.
The acquisition will be the first under new Google Cloud Chief Executive Thomas Kurian. The company’s cloud computing sector trails Amazon’s and Microsoft’s when it comes to revenue and methods. However, analysts say Google Cloud’s BigQuery, which handles large datasets, is an attractive system in terms of customer attraction.
Kurian said focusing on analytics makes sense, as he aims to close some gaps in the cloud unit. He also said that Looker and Google Cloud are similar in a cultural sense. They share some customers as well, like Blue Apron and Hearst Communications.
“When we looked at how do we broaden our portfolio, (data and analytics) is a segment where we have strength,” Kurian said. Looker is “complementary and completes our analytics foundation.”
Looker was founded in Santa Cruz, California in 2012. It has about 800 employees and has raised US$281 million in venture capital. Last year, it was valued at US$1.6 billion.
Kurian’s plan for the cloud unit is to focus on specialized software rather than general tools.

675,"June 6, 2019",EU/US: Kelkoo contacts US antitrust authorities over Google,"

British ecommerce search engine Kelkoo has contacted antitrust regulators in the US over Google’s increasing market dominance.
According to Reuters, the price comparison site made the move because it believes that European rules to ensure fair competition aren’t as effective as they should be.
Kelkoo and many other technology companies have accused the internet search giant of unfair practices over the way in which it promotes its products and services.
In March, the firm became the fourth biggest net contributor to the EU budget having been slapped with nearly €9 billion in fines over the past two years. That includes the €1.49 billion (US$1.7 billion) fine it received from the EU for anti-competitive conduct through AdSense.
An investigation concluded that Google had abused its market dominance for a decade after it prevented other companies from competing in the online search advertising intermediation sector.
“The Commission found that Google’s conduct harmed competition and consumers, and stifled innovation,” stated the Commission in March.
“Google’s rivals were unable to grow and offer alternative online search advertising intermediation services to those of Google.”
But despite the fact that Google has faced heavy fines from European lawmakers, Kelkoo has suggested that more needs to be done.

As was expected, Google is appealing a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) fine laid against it by the European Commission related to its AdSense advertising business, reported CNBC.
In March, the executive arm of the European Union slapped Google with its third antitrust fine, this time for abusing its dominance in the online advertising market through its AdSense business. The EU said Google’s practice of restricting online search advertisements from competitors was “illegal” under the bloc’s antitrust rules.
The Telegraph first reported that Google had filed an appeal for the latest fine in the General Court of the European Union in Brussels on Tuesday. Google confirmed the action in an email to CNBC Wednesday.
A European Commission spokesperson told CNBC: “The Commission will defend its decision in Court.”
Since 2017, the EU has charged Google with two other fines totaling nearly $8 billion for anti-competitive practices with its Android devices and comparison shopping service, which the company also appealed.

677,"June 2, 2019",US: Regulators divide scrutiny of Amazon and Google,"
US antitrust regulators have divided oversight of Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, putting Amazon under the watch of the Federal Trade Commission and Google under the Justice Department, the Washington Post said on Saturday.
Amazon could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators which puts the e-commerce giant under the watch of the trade commission, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The development is the result of the FTC and Justice department quietly dividing up competition oversight on both of the American tech giants, Amazon and Google, the newspaper said adding that the FTC’s plans for Amazon and the Justice Department’s interest in Google were not immediately clear.
The FTC’s plans for Amazon and the Justice Department’s interest in Google are not immediately clear. But the kind of arrangement brokered between the Justice Department and the FTC typically presages more serious antitrust scrutiny, the likes of which many Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought out of fear that tech companies have become too big and powerful.

678,"June 2, 2019",US: DOJ reportedly preparing Google antitrust probe,"
The Justice Department (DOJ) is laying the foundation for a potential antitrust investigation of Google, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The DOJ’s Antitrust Division in recent weeks has been laying the groundwork for the probe, the people familiar with the matter said. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the DOJ, previously conducted a broad investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action, though Google made some voluntary changes to certain business practices.
The renewed probe may focus on Google’s search business, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The shift has come with multibillion-dollar antitrust fines for Google from the European Union. Facebook has come under intense fire over Russian use of its platform to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. Policy makers also are increasingly skeptical of internet companies’ privacy practices, as well as their potential to create other public harm.

Some big-name websites have issues with the new Chromium-based version of Microsoft Edge, including Google-owned YouTube, which is refusing to work with the new browser, reported Bloomberg.
Samuel Maddock created a browser that worked well, but because it was based on Chromium, he needed another Google product called Widevine to authenticate users and prevent video piracy. He sent Google a request, outlining the project, and waited.
“You have these gatekeepers like Google that decide which projects can work and if you’re not granted that permission you’re screwed,’’ Maddock said.
It’s the redesigned version of YouTube that’s causing problems. Visitors to the site using the Chromium-based version of Edge are greeted by the error message: “Your browser is not supported. Try it with the latest Google Chrome.” The old design of YouTube remains accessible.

Publishers may share audience data in order to provide greater visibility to their advertisers. The platform can also be opened up to other players in the sector.
Some companies belonging to the Media Association (AMI) have criticized that the platform was made public without waiting for the rest of the AMI to review and decide whether to join, missing the opportunity to present it as a common project by the country’s publishing community.

Chair of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC), Rod Sims, has flagged closer global scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions by digital platforms as one of the key recommendations of its digital platforms review due to be handed down next month.
The ACCC head said Facebook’s US$1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 was an example of how global digital platforms shut-down threats to their market dominance by buying disruptive competitors.
“There is a growing debate, both in Australia and overseas, as to whether the process of competition for the market is adequately protected by the forward-looking substantial lessening of competition test applied to mergers,” Sims said.
“We have examined this issue in our Digital Platforms Inquiry. In our view, Google and Facebook have commercial incentives to strategically acquire nascent firms even if the chance of these firms ultimately posing a competitive threat is small.”

Google is complying with an EU order to boost competition in online shopping, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Wednesday, May 22, brushing aside complaints from rivals demanding more regulatory action, reported Reuters.
Hit with a €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion at the time) fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service, Google has since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the measure appeared to be working.
“Now we are in a situation where in 75 percent of queries there would be at least one rival to Google in the shopping box and 40 percent of clicks would go to a merchant hosted by one of the rivals,” Vestager told reporters on the sidelines of a Centre for European Reform event.
“This means we do not have a non-compliance case but at the same time also means that we keep monitoring monthly developments,” she added.
Open Internet Project, a Google critic, however argues that the situation has not improved.
“By putting these Google-powered Shopping Units at the top of every relevant results page, above more relevant comparison services, Google continues to reserve the important market for comparison shopping services to itself,” Open Internet Project said in a statement last week.

Google is halting a business relationship with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, in what is seen as a blow to the company that has been on the radar of the US government.
According to a report in Reuters citing a source familiar with the matter, Google is suspending all business with Huawei that requires it to transfer hardware, software, and technical services. The only exception, noted the report, is when it’s publicly available via an open source licensing. Reuters noted that the move on the part of Google could hurt Huawei’s smartphone business because it won’t be able to access updates to the Android operating system. It will also lose access to Google Play Store, YouTube, and Gmail, noted the report. The source told Reuters Huawei will only be able to use the public version of Android. It won’t have access to proprietary apps or services offered by Google, the source told Reuters.
The move on the part of Google comes after the Trump Administration last week added the Chinese telecom company to a blacklist, which means it won’t conduct trade with the company. The blacklist makes it very difficult for Huawei to do business with companies in the US Following that, the Commerce Department in the US stated it was looking at scaling back some of the restrictions on the company to prevent any interruptions to existing network operations and equipment.

Italy’s antitrust authority has become the latest international regulatory body to open an anti-competition investigation into Google, joining the European Union and the Competition Commission of India, reported CNBC.
The regulator opened the probe on Thursday, May 16, after energy company Enel Group complained that Google wouldn’t allow the “Enel X Recharge” app to work with Android Auto. Enel Group was created by the Italian government in 1962, and it was privatized in 1999, though its biggest shareholder is currently Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Google allows third-party developers to develop Android Auto-compatible versions of their apps, but only if they offer media or messaging services. Enel X Recharge is mostly dedicated to helping drivers find charging stations for electric cars.
The authority confirmed that the proceeding will be completed by May 30 next year. This comes just a month after the Italian authority began a preliminary investigation into Amazon over alleged abuse of its dominant position in e-commerce and logistics services.

El año pasado, la Comisión de Competencia de la India (CCI) comenzó a investigar la queja, que es similar a la que enfrentó Google en Europa, lo que resultó en una multa de € 4,34 mil millones (US $ 5 mil millones) a la compañía.

Esa decisión, que fue confirmada por la segunda fuente, no se ha informado previamente y la orden de la investigación completa no se hizo pública.
“Es un caso sólido para el CCI, dado el precedente de la UE”, dijo la primera fuente. “El CCI ha encontrado (preliminarmente) que Google abusó de su posición dominante”.

India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into Alphabet’s unit Google for allegedly abusing the dominant position of its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals, reported Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year started looking into the complaint, which is similar to one Google faced in Europe that resulted in a €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine on the company.
In mid-April, the CCI decided there was merit in the accusations made in the complaint and ordered its investigation unit to launch a full probe, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
That decision, which was confirmed by the second source, has not been previously reported and the order calling the full investigation was not made public.
“It is a strong case for the CCI, given the EU precedent,” said the first source. “The CCI has (preliminarily) found Google abused its dominant position.”
The probe would be completed in about a year and Google executives will likely be summoned to appear before the CCI in coming months, the source said.

By Christian Bergqvist (University of Copenhagen) & Jonathan Rubin (MoginRubin LLP)
During the late 2000s, several jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S., opened investigations into potential antitrust violations by the Internet search firm, Google, for alleged bias in the ranking of the links returned in response to search queries. While the EU investigations in 2017 resulted in a record EUR 2.42 billion fine (with further proceedings pending), the U.S. proceeding came to a close in 2013 with a brief statement by the Federal Trade Commission exonerating Google of antitrust law violations. These diametrically opposed outcomes occurred despite the similarity at the core of the single-firm antitrust doctrine that prevails on the two sides of the Atlantic and the near indistinguishability of the factual allegations of Google’s conduct raised in the two jurisdictions. In this paper, we outline and compare the merits of the two cases in an attempt to reconcile the different outcomes, with a particular focus on the theories of harm examined by the two agencies and the supporting evidence they considered. We ultimately observe that the EU in this case applied a more encompassing legal standard for abuse than in past cases. Specifically, the EU Google Search (Shopping) matter appears to have moved away somewhat from the characteristically American consumer welfare standard, as employed by the FTC in its consideration of Google search.

By Yolanda Redrup
Renowned US competition lawyer Howard Shelanski has pushed back against moves by regulators to treat Facebook and Google as publishers, saying any laws dictating how the tech giants display content or refer users to news sites would be overreaching.
Mr Shelanski, who is in Melbourne this week for a Melbourne Law School conference on market competition laws, said some regulatory reform was necessary, particularly around data privacy and mergers and acquisitions, but he urged the competition regulator and the federal government to take a slowly-but-surely approach to any changes.
“It [the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] is treating the platforms, particularly Facebook, like a media outlet and refers to it having a news referral market … but that conclusion needs some careful thought because a lot of what Facebook does is let news sources reach an audience and let individuals share content they themselves have taken action to find,” he told The Australian Financial Review.
“A lot of news traffic Facebook has very little to do with – it’s just the locus of exchange for people on the edge of the platform. “We have to be very careful in saying that Facebook is taking action to affirmatively refer people to news sites. That needs a closer look.”
Mr Shelanski, who is a partner at law firm Davis Polk and former regulatory tsar under the Obama administration, advises Facebook on competition law.

Competition in Display Ad Technology: A Retrospective Look at Google/Doubleclick and Google/Admob It conducts a retrospective analysis of the Google/DoubleClick and Google/AdMob merger reviews, and concludes that agencies were right to reject complaints that the transactions would lead to anticompetitive effects. To the contrary, a review of competitive indicia available today show that display advertising and ad tech continue to be marked by constant disruptive innovation, growing output, new entry and expansion, and large numbers of players competing with differentiated offerings. If vertically integrated ad tech players attempted to engage in anticompetitive behavior, advertisers and publishers could, and would, take their business elsewhere, whether to other vertically integrated providers or to popular point players.

Google’s Irish operations are coming under closer scrutiny from Europe over corporate tax affairs, reported Bloomberg. Irish authorities held “in- depth” talks with European Union officials late last year on whether the company complied with European Union rules limiting tax perks provided by European governments.
The review was preliminary and might not lead to any formal investigation, the person with knowledge of the review said. According to another person, an EU investigation isn’t imminent and some Irish authorities are optimistic that initial conversations proved sufficient to avoid a more extensive probe of the company’s tax arrangements. Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe discussed a potential tax case with EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, one person said.
The EU has been clamping down on efforts by multinationals to reduce their tax bills in Europe. The European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives from Ireland.
Apple, which has its European headquarters in Cork, deposited €14.1 billion in disputed taxes and EU interest into an escrow account late last year. The company is appealing against the decision, along with the Irish Department of Finance, which denies there was a sweetheart deal.

Berlin-based Idealo GmbH said Friday it had submitted the complaint to the state court in Berlin. Idealo said its suit is based on a 2017 decision by the European Commission to fine Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.74 billion) for giving unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service in violation of EU competition rules.
Google representatives said they hadn’t received the suit and could not comment.

In a statement, Blackburn said she hoped the “bipartisan effort” would “shed light” on the country’s largest tech companies.
Klobuchar and Blackburn in the letter asked the FTC to disclose whether it is investigating Google and to provide details on ongoing investigations into major online platforms.
“We understand that the FTC does not typically comment on nonpublic investigations, but the public discussion surrounding Google and other companies’ conduct have made this a uniquely important national issue,” the senators, both prominent tech critics, wrote in the letter.
“Accordingly, we respectfully request that the FTC consider publicly disclosing whether it is conducting an investigation of Google and/or other major online platforms and describe, in general terms, the nature of the conduct under examination in any such investigations,” they added.
The FTC, the federal agency overseeing consumer protection and antitrust cases, closed an antitrust probe into Google without a major enforcement action in 2013.

697,"March 31, 2019","US: FTC, State AGs to team up to investigate Google, Facebook","
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is gearing up to hold talks with state attorneys general about Facebook and Google’s position in the technology space.
According to a report in Bloomberg citing Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, the meeting had been slated for this week but will be rescheduled.  It’s common for states to work with federal agencies including the FTC and Justice Department when looking into potential misdeeds. By teaming up, states can share the resources and information. “What we have here is different layers of problems all surrounding big tech as a whole,” Landry told Bloomberg TV. “These are issues that attorneys general around the country on both sides of the aisle have been discussing for quite some time now.” At Google, he pointed to its role in online ads as an antitrust and consumer protection concern. “Would the FTC allow Chase or Goldman-Sachs to own the Nasdaq?” Landry said. “The answer to that would be absolutely not.”
Attorneys general have teamed up to investigate if Google ran afoul of any antitrust or consumer protection laws, while the FTC is looking into the Cambridge Analytica issue at Facebook. The now-defunct political consulting company accessed data on 87 million Facebook users in the run up to the 2016 US Presidential election without users’ permission.
The coordination between states and the FTC follows on news this week that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is suing Facebook over running...

698,"March 26, 2019","US: Google, Amazon, and Facebook all spent record amounts last year lobbying","
Google, Amazon, and Facebook spent record amounts to influence the US government in 2018. They poured a combined $48 million into lobbying last year, up 13 percent from 2017, according to Bloomberg.
Amazon.com reported spending $3.7 million in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to $14.2 million for the year, more than the record $12.8 million the company spent in 2017.
Although the online retailer has faced less ire in Washington than Facebook and Google, it’s had its share of criticism, including allegations by Trump that it doesn’t pay its fair share of US Postal Service costs to deliver its packages.
These companies run the risk of antitrust regulationas well as laws that could inhibit their ability to collect data and, by extension, revenue. Google’s, Amazon’s, and Facebook’s lobbying efforts largely go toward market and data regulation issues, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
Industry critics also say some tech companies have grown too big and too powerful, leading to suggestions by politicians and organizations, on the left and the right, that the companies be broken up.

Czech search engine Seznam urged Google on Friday to disclose more details about its plan to boost rival search apps in Android smartphones, saying it continued to lose users due to what it said were Google’s anti-competitive practices.
Seznam, which attracts as much advertising spend as Google in the Czech Republic, took its grievance to the European Commission nearly three years ago.
It subsequently joined lobbying group FairSearch whose complaint triggered the European Commission’s investigation into Google’s mobile operating system Android which ultimately led to a record 4.34 billion euro (£3.7 billion) fine.
“Time is running out, every day makes a difference. Seznam is losing market share because of Google’s search engine installed by default on mobiles,” said Michal Feix, Seznam’s former chief executive and now a partner at a consultancy advising the company.

The European Commission said Google, a division of Alphabet, had prevented third parties using its AdSense advertising service from displaying search advertisements from Google’s competitors.
* Below is a timeline of Google’s antitrust cases in Europe:
* March 20 2019 – EU antitrust enforcers slap a 1.49 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) fine on Google because it hindered rivals in online search advertising for a decade.
* July 18 2018 – EU antitrust regulators hand down a record 4.34 billion euro fine to Google over its Android mobile operating system after a three-year long investigation.
* June 27 2017 – EU fines Google 2.4 billion euros for thwarting rivals of shopping comparison websites.
* July 14 2016 – EU sets out another charge against Google’s shopping service. It also accuses the company of preventing third parties using its AdSense product from displaying search advertisements from Google’s competitors – a third case against the company.

701,"March 20, 2019",EU: Google fined US$1.7B for AdSense violations,"
Google has been fined €1.49 billion (US$1.7 billion) by the European commission for abusing its monopoly in online advertising.
The latest fine takes the total the company has been fined by the EU Competition Commission to €8.24 billion over the past two years, for abusing its power in markets, ranging from shopping search to mobile phone operating systems.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s Competition Commissioner, said, “Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate – and consumers the benefits of competition.”
The case focused on Google’s AdSense business, which generates text advertisements for third-party websites based on the searches performed on their sites. In 2006, Google told certain websites they would have to use AdSense exclusively in exchange for a higher share of the search revenue generated on their sites.

While Google is making ad changes to appease European Union regulators, it isn’t enough to help its rivals, according to Yelp.
Two years ago, the European Commission fined Google a whopping US$2.7 billion for violating antitrust rules by using its search engine to promote its own services over its rivals. Google was also hit with a €4.34 billion euro (US$4.91 billion) fine last year for using its Android operating system to block competitors, and is now facing another antitrust fine from the EU in the coming weeks over its AdSense advertising product.
In an effort to appease EU regulators, Google is now attempting to boost rivals like Kelkoo, a French price-comparison search service.
“Last week, Google announced a new Ad placement on its search pages: Comparison Listing Ads (CLAs). Merchants who are working with the small number of Google-approved CSSs (Comparison Shopping Services) taking part in this program will benefit from the additional qualified traffic that these CSSs provide,” Kelkoo wrote said in a blog post. “Google will launch CLA in beta over the next few weeks. Kelkoo is one of the selected few partners that are able to provide this opportunity,” Kelkoo wrote to its merchants.
But Luther Lowe, SVP of public policy for Yelp, wrote in a blog post that Google’s latest efforts only deliver a “marginal percentage of clicks” to rivals as it steers most traffic to its own services.

The Mississippi Attorney General (AG) revealed that his office is preparing an antitrust case against Google, accusing the tech giant of controlling a “pipeline” of data.
“We attorneys general have authority under consumer protection acts to do both,” said Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, according to CNBC, on Monday (March 18). “So it’ll be a multifaceted suit or, hopefully, we can get a settlement if we can get some agreement with them.”
Hood said he wants all the major tech companies to adopt practices similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While he would rather the companies present their own proposals on how they plan to implement those regulations, his office is preparing the lawsuit that could lead to a settlement.
“At some point in the future, there will be a reckoning. It’ll either be in Congress or in a court of law,” he said. “If we don’t have successful legislation, [the] court is going to rule to the effect that a person’s private information is the equivalent of their intellectual property, and that companies have to pay people for it.”
In a statement to CNBC, Google said, “Privacy and security are built into all of our products, and we will continue to engage constructively with state attorneys general on policy issues.”

The company subsequently offered to allow price-comparison rivals to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms. But competitors said the measure failed to create a level playing field.
Earlier this month, Google introduced a new link on its search results which aims to drive more traffic to price comparison rivals.
British competitor Kelkoo said on its blog that it was one of several companies selected to try out the new link which will initially be available in Germany, France and the Netherlands.

Google y su compañía matriz, Alphabet, podrían enfrentar una multa antimonopolio de la Unión Europea en las próximas semanas por su producto publicitario AdSense, informó Reuters, citando a una persona familiarizada con el asunto. La multa esperada sería menor a las dos multas anteriores que Google ha recibido de la UE.
En 2016 la Comisión Europea inició un tercer caso antimonopolio contra Google, afirmando que el servicio de búsqueda estaba impidiendo que terceros que utilizaban AdSense mostraran anuncios de los competidores de Google. En ese momento, Google tenía el 80% del mercado del euro en anuncios de búsqueda y aparentemente había mantenido su práctica publicitaria contra la competencia durante 10 años.
Google respondió cambiando las condiciones de Adsense en sus contratos con terceros y dándoles mayor capacidad para mostrar anuncios de sus competidores. La comisionada de Competencia, Margrethe Vestager, dijo que estaba dando los toques finales al caso.
Google recibió una multa de €4,340 millones (US$4,910 millones) el año pasado por usar su sistema operativo Android para bloquear a los competidores. Anteriormente, vio una multa de 2,400 millones de euros en 2017 por el bloqueo de la competencia en los sitios de comparación de compras.

Google and its parent company Alphabet could be facing an antitrust fine from the European Union in the coming weeks over its AdSense advertising product.
Reuters, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported the fine could come in the next few weeks, and that it will be smaller than the two previous fines Google has been dealt by the EU.
In 2016, the European Commission started a third antitrust case against Google, claiming the search engine was stopping third parties who were using AdSense from displaying ads from competitors of Google.
At the time, Google had 80% of the Euro market for search ads, and had apparently kept its anti-competition ad practice up for 10 years.
Google responded by changing the Adsense conditions in its contracts with third parties and giving them more ability to display ads that were competing.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said she was putting the final touches on the case.
Google was hit with a €4.34 billion (US$4.91 billion) fine last year for using its Android operating system to block competitors. Previously, it saw a 2.4 billion euro fine in 2017 for the blocking of competition on shopping comparison sites.
The Commission might not be done with Google, as it asked Google if it demotes local competitors in its search engine. The results of that inquiry could lead to an additional case.

Alphabet’s Google has rejected calls by Australia’s competition regulator for tougher scrutiny of its operations, denying that it enjoys market power in online searches and advertising, documents published on Monday, March 4, showed. The global giant was responding to recommendations made late last year by the watchdog, such as increased scrutiny and a new regulatory body to monitor the dominance of tech giants in online advertising and news markets.
“The preliminary report bases many of its recommendations on the mistaken premise that Google has market power in search, search advertising, and news media referrals,” Google wrote in a statement published by the regulator.
“Google faces fierce competition from other providers, including vertical search sites like Amazon, Expedia, Domain and Carsales.com, many of which users access directly through mobile apps.”
The regulator had claimed the enormous market power of firms such as Google, which has a 94% share of web searches in Australia, and their opaque methods for ranking advertisements, gave them the ability and incentive to favor their own businesses over advertisers. In preliminary recommendations that are subject to change, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) also claimed the new regulator should have powers to investigate how the companies rank advertisements and news articles.

This tax would be chargeable on any revenues digital companies make on Kiwi users in New Zealand, even if they maintain only a tiny subsidiary company on our shores. It would be in the range of two to 3%.

Google and Facebook’s Next Big Fight
By Lionel Laurent
For many people, it probably sounds a little rich to hear the European Union accuse Silicon Valley of being a graveyard of innovation. But that’s where we are in 2019. Regulators are hitting the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. with a flurry of antitrust fines and data-privacy probes, implying that they regard tech billionaires as more John D. Rockefeller than Nikola Tesla.
The end-game, according to Brussels’ top data watchdog, is to make sure new startups aren’t blown out of the water by Big Tech (or gobbled up), which should ultimately benefit consumers by allowing them more choice.
Tackling this so-called “kill zone,” where fledgling tech companies are acquired or copied out of existence by deep-pocketed incumbents, is a prime ambition for European Data Protection Supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli, nicknamed “Mr GDPR” after the data-privacy law. When I met him in Brussels recently, Buttarelli checked off the barriers to entry for a startup: It needs to first outbid the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook and others for engineering talent; then sell its product through an app store probably run by Google or Apple Inc.; and finally compete against big players with established networks and huge cash piles. And even it clears all these hurdles, it’s still vulnerable to being taken out.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been reviewing a case for the past six months that is similar to one Google faced in Europe that led to a fine of €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) by antitrust regulators last year, three of the sources said. Google has challenged that order.
The European Commission found Google had abused its market dominance since 2011 with practices such as forcing manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser, together with its Google Play app store on Android devices.
“It is on the lines of the EU case, but at a preliminary stage,” said one of the sources, who is aware of the CCI investigation.

Online platforms including Google, Facebook, and Apple should be regulated in how they distribute news content, according to a new UK government report.
The report, published Tuesday, February 12, stated a state regulator should ensure tech firms are taking steps to help users identify trustworthy, reliable news on their platforms, reported CNBC. It stated the regulator would require companies like Facebook and Google to build on initiatives they have already established to weed out fake content.
“This task is too important to leave entirely to the judgment of commercial entities,” the report read.
Online sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been under fire for allowing fake content to spread on their platforms. The companies have been investing in security measures to eliminate false accounts and misinformation, but the UK government report claimed these efforts should be enforced by a government agency.
“The experience of the last decade has shown that it is perfectly possible for social media platforms to be immensely profitable while simultaneously carrying a large quantity of fake news,” it stated.

719,"February 11, 2019",Australia: ACCC will keep pressure on Google and Facebook,"
According to a report from the Sydney Morning Herald, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman, Rod Sims says Facebook and Google must shoulder the blame for cuts to thousands of journalism jobs in Australia over the past decade, and that the rise of the digital platforms at the expense of traditional media is not simply a case of “creative destruction.”
“I was getting the response of people saying ‘isn’t this just creative destruction? You know, classic Schumpeter, the way the world works?’” he said in an interview ahead of the speech. “Well… it isn’t. This isn’t just like the car taking over from the horse and buggy, or more recently, Uber taking over from the taxi.”
In December last year, the ACCC released interim findings from its 12-month investigation into the digital platforms, finding that Google and Facebook’s market power is hurting traditional media companies.

720,"January 31, 2019",France: Regulator orders Google to take measures on advertising,"
France’s competition regulator has ordered Google to take measures regarding some of its advertising methods, claiming these methods had hit French firm Amadeus which runs a directory service in France.
“Google will need to quickly clarify the rules for its Google Ads online advertising platform that apply to electronic paid information services in order to make them more precise and intelligible and to ensure their application under non-discriminatory conditions,” the regulator said in a statement.
Its decision comes a few weeks after France’s data protection watchdog fined Google €50 million (US$57.5 million) for breaching European Union online privacy rules, the biggest such penalty levied against a US tech giant.

721,"January 29, 2019",EU: Google GDPR complaint suggests personal data misuse,"
A General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaint shows that Google may have misused people’s personal data and categorized them in highly sensitive ways, according to reports.
Google’s ad technology apparently labels users depending on their internet activity, noted a report in TechCrunch. What’s more, they’re labeled with tags like cancer, mental health, right- or left-wing politics or even sexually transmitted diseases.
These sensitive topics get shared with potentially thousands of third party companies through a live ad-auction process called real-time bidding (RTB).
The RTB complaint was filed last year by Dr Johnny Ryan from the browser Brave; Michael Veale, a researcher at University College London; and Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group. They say there are “wide-scale and systemic breaches of the data protection regime by Google and others.”
“There is no legal justification for such pervasive and invasive profiling and processing of personal data for profit,” the complaint said.
Polish anti-surveillance NGO Panoptykon Foundation has also joined in the complaint.
“Ad auction systems are obscure by design,” Katarzyna Szymielewicz, president of the NGO said. “Lack of transparency makes it impossible for users to exercise their rights under GDPR. There is no way to verify, correct or delete marketing categories that have been assigned to us, even though we are talking about our personal data. IAB [The Interactive Advertising Bureau] ...

Google announced Wednesday, January 23, it would appeal a record €50 million (US$56.5 million) fine imposed by France’s data regulator for failing to meet the EU’s strict new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The fine was by far the biggest-yet for breaking the European Union’s new privacy rules that came into effect last May.
France’s data watchdog, the CNIL, announced the fine Monday claiming that Google made it too difficult for users to understand and manage preferences on how their personal information is used, particularly with regard to targeted advertising.
“We’ve worked hard to create a GDPR consent process for personalized ads that is as transparent and straightforward as possible, based on regulatory guidance and user experience testing,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
“We’re also concerned about the impact of this ruling on publishers, original content creators and tech companies in Europe and beyond. For all these reasons, we’ve now decided to appeal.”
The CNIL found that despite changes implemented by Google since last year, it was still failing to respect the spirit of the new rules.

France’s data privacy watchdog has fined Google €50 million (US$57 million), the first penalty for a US tech giant under new European data privacy rules that took effect last year, reported the Walls Street Journal.
The National Data Protection Commission (CNIL) announced Monday, January 21, it fined the US internet giant for “lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent” regarding ad personalization for users.
Implemented in 2018, the sweeping privacy rules, commonly referred to as GDPR, have set a global standard that has forced Google and its tech peers in Silicon Valley to rethink their data-collection practices or risk sky-high fines. The US lacks a similar, overarching federal consumer privacy law, a deficiency in the eyes of privacy rights advocates that has elevated Europe as the world’s de facto privacy cop.
Despite Google’s recent changes to comply with the EU rules, the CNIL announced in a statement that “the infringements observed deprive the users of essential guarantees regarding processing operations that can reveal important parts of their private life since they are based on a huge amount of data, a wide variety of services and almost unlimited possible combinations.”

In cooperation with the Austrian competition authority (BWB) the Bundeskartellamt conducted an administrative proceeding against Google, Mountain View and Eyeo, Cologne for concluding anticompetitive agreements.The proceeding was terminated after the companies amended a so-called “whitelisting contract” between them which had originally significantly restricted Eyeo’s independent entrepreneurial ad-blocking activity.
Under the name “Adblock Plus”, Eyeo offers programs which can be integrated into standard web browsers to stop adverts from appearing on websites visited by users (ad blockers). The company offers advertisers and advertising marketers the possibility to exclude certain ads from the ad-blocking process (whitelisting). To qualify for exclusion advertisements must meet certain “acceptable ads” criteria, which define them as less intrusive from the user’s perspective. Eyeo demands a fee from larger advertisers and advertising marketers for its whitelisting service. It also concluded a contract with Google for this service.
Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt: “As the Federal Court of Justice also recently decided, ad blockers are a legal tool. It is understandable that consumers are interested in controlling the type and amount of online advertising they see. The offer of ad blockers is an integral part of the competitive process in online advertising services. Regulations in contracts aimed at restricting the offer of ad blockers are t...

Según informes de Bloomberg, la Comisionada de Competencia de la Unión Europea, Margrethe Vestager, anunciará una nueva multa contra el servicio de publicidad AdSense de Google en las próximas semanas.
La UE declaró en 2016 que Google obstaculizó la competencia por los anuncios en línea con su producto AdSense for Search, que coloca publicidad en sitios web, incluidos minoristas, operadores de telecomunicaciones y periódicos. Si bien su participación en el mercado europeo es superior al 80%, AdSense contribuyó con menos del 20% de los ingresos publicitarios totales de Google en 2015, un porcentaje que ha disminuido constantemente desde 2010.
La compañía ya ha acumulado 6,700 millones de euros (US$7,600 millones) en multas y enfrenta una mayor sanción si no obedece las órdenes de la UE para cambiar su comportamiento.
En julio, la Comisión impuso una multa de 4,300 millones de euros a Google en el caso de Android, exigiendo que la empresa cambie la forma en que coloca las aplicaciones de búsqueda y de navegador web en los dispositivos móviles con Android. Un año antes, Google recibió una multa de 2,400 millones de euros (y luego de US$2,700 millones), luego de que los reguladores lo acusaran de sesgar los resultados para frustrar los servicios de búsqueda de compras más pequeños.

727,"January 17, 2019",EU: Google facing third antitrust fine?,"
 
According to Bloomberg, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is set to announce a penalty targeting Google’s AdSense advertising service in the coming weeks.
The EU stated in 2016 that Google hindered competition for online ads with its AdSense for Search product which places advertising on websites, including retailers, telecommunications operators and newspapers. While its European market share is more than 80%, AdSense contributed less than 20% of Google’s total ad revenue in 2015, a percentage which has declined steadily since 2010.
The company has already racked up 6.7 billion (US$7.6 billion) in fines and faces a potential threat of more if it doesn’t obey EU orders to change its behavior.
The Commission in July fined Google a record €4.3 billion (then US$5 billion) in the Android case, demanding that the company change the way it puts search and web-browser apps onto Android mobile devices. A year earlier, Google received a then-record €2.4 billion (then US$2.7 billion) penalty after regulators accused it of skewing results to thwart smaller shopping search services.
EU Commissioner Vestager has rejected claims she’s singling out US tech giants for special treatment.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent EU Google decisions made waves around the world. In large part, this was because they involved a huge and innovative digital economy platform and were the highest fines yet imposed by the EU. However, the decisions are also notable for their reliance on key insights from behavioral economics.
Behavioral economics may not have been mentioned explicitly in the Google Shopping decision, but the Commission’s case hangs on the fact that the “more favorable positioning” of results on the Google search page leads to increased traffic and click-throughs. As such, the case effectively relies on a behavioral tendency called saliency...

The probe follows a complaint that Alphabet Inc’s Google unit had “abused its dominant position and made the efforts of other companies difficult,” the authority stated.
The investigation will include companies Google Reklamcilik ve Pazarlama, Google International, Google, Google Ireland Limited, and Alphabet, it stated.
In September, the authority fined Google some 93 million Turkish lira (US$17.38 million) for violating Turkish competition laws with its mobile software sales.

The European Commission’s recent action against Google regarding the licensing terms for Android appears to undervalue results of the business model competition that has taken place in smartphone operating systems. Apple, Microsoft, and Google entered the smartphone market with different approaches: Apple vertically integrated software and hardware; Google went two-sided; and Microsoft offered fee licenses. Two of those approaches have succeeded and one has failed, but the great irony of the situation is that now that consumers have spoken, the EC seems to be pushing Google to undertake a dominance pivot and to switch to a business model that consumers rejected.

Yelp and US-based nonprofit Consumer Watchdog had jointly sought to help the EU in the court case. Their request was denied.
The court also rejected requests to intervene in the case from digital advertiser Connexity and from two groups, ICOMP and FairSearch, which the court stated couldn’t prove they represented businesses affected by the EU probe. FairSearch’s members include Oracle, Naspers, and TripAdvisor.

It discusses the definition of the relevant market and competitive constraints in the case, including the potential constraint from Apple. It also offers thoughts on the theory of harm in the case and suggests that Google Android may be better perceived as a case concerning refusal to deal than tying. Finally, the article discusses some of the implications of the decision and notes the growing importance of objective, commercial justifications in the context of technology markets where services are monetized in very different ways by different providers.

This is the first time Pichai has appeared before Congress since Google declined to send him or Alphabet CEO Larry Page to a hearing on foreign election meddling earlier this year. That slight sparked anger among senators who portrayed Google as trying to skirt scrutiny.

The hearing culminates a tough year for big tech companies, as lawmakers and the public have become increasingly skeptical about Silicon Valley’s effects on democracy, misinformation and privacy. Tuesday’s proceedings have tested the soft-spoken executive’s ability to remain cool and confident while defending Google in the face intense questioning.

Australia’s competition watchdog on Monday, December 10, recommended tougher scrutiny and a new regulatory body to check the dominance of tech giants Facebook and Alphabet’s Google in the country’s online advertising and news markets.
The recommendation, in a preliminary report on the US firms’ market power, comes days after Australia passed laws forcing tech companies to help police access private user data, and amid growing concern from authorities worldwide about the giants’ commercial behavior and distribution of so-called “fake news.”.
The report outlines the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) concerns regarding the market power held by these key platforms, including their impact on Australian businesses and, in particular, on the ability of media businesses to monetize their content. The report also outlines concerns regarding the extent to which consumers’ data is collected and used to enable targeted advertising.
“Digital platforms have significantly transformed our lives, the way we communicate with each other and access news and information. We appreciate that many of these changes have been positive for consumers in relation to the way they access news and information and how they interact with each other and with businesses,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.

Speaking at a press conference at the Slush tech conference in Helsinki, Finland, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the EU’s probe involving Google’s AdSense service would “not be done before New Year’s.” Vestager said last month the investigation was nearing an end which could potentially mean a fine for the search giant.
The EU started investigating Google over its Adsense ad service in 2016, accusing the tech giant of hiding advertisements from competitors in its search function. Google has denied the charges. It is the third antitrust case the European Commission has brought against Google.

EU antitrust regulators have asked Google’s rivals if the internet search giant unfairly demotes local search competitors, according to a questionnaire seen by Reuters.
Google has been fined a total €6.76 billion (US$7.7 billion) in the last 17 months for favoring its comparison shopping service and for using its dominant Android mobile operating system to reinforce its search engine market power.
The EU competition authority’s interest in local search services followed a complaint by US search and advertising company Yelp and rivals in the travel, restaurant, and accommodation industries.
It sent questionnaires to Google rivals last month, asking for details of the company’s practices and the impact on competing services between January 2012 to December 2017.
Regulators also wanted to know if rivals experienced an impact in the operation of their local services as a result of major search algorithm changes by Google, including the introduction of its Panda 4.0 algorithm.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said at a hearing on oversight of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on November 27 that big technology firms aren’t entitled to Americans’ trust and may be violating antitrust laws.
Blumenthal called for privacy legislation to protect consumers, and said the FTC has “fallen short” on protecting consumer privacy.
Separately, FTC Chairman Joe Simons saidys at the hearing that he needs more authority on privacy protection and supports legislation to address the issue.
In April of 2015, Facebook stopped allowing developers to access data about users’ friends. But in 2014, when Kogan’s app scraped the data, Facebook allowed developers to glean information about users’ friends, subject to their privacy settings. Facebook’s terms of service prohibited developers from sharing that information.
On Tuesday, November 27, Blumenthal also criticized Google for having waited more than seven months to notify people that Google+ exposed consumers’ data to outside parties.

742,"November 28, 2018","Google, “our” God?","

When grappling with competition issues in the digital economy, Google is often the first name to come up.
The tech powerhouse has been in the firing line of competition authorities in Europe. Its business model and strategies have sparked intense debate about what big data and big analytics mean for competition and how or even whether antitrust enforcers should respond.
And, yet, for users who share their most intimate details with the search engine, Google has been equated with a “modern-day God”.
In this episode of Competition Lore, I am delighted to share the opportunity that I had to discuss these and related issues with Google’s Chief Economist, Hal Varian.
Hal was not only generous with his time but with his views ranging from general topics such as the role of economics and populism in antitrust to specific issues raised by the European Commission’s decisions against in the Shopping and Android cases.
Aside from setting up the interview, Google had no other input to the production of this episode.
Hal hinted in the episode at a second edition of his co-authored best-selling book; let’s hope we can hold him to that!  But if you want to read the first edition, it is Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy.
The episode features an interjection from Professor Scott Galloway with his thesis that Google is a “modern day God”. You may find his book, The Four, of interest or you could listen to his TED Talk.

Russia’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, is looking to fine Google for failing to remove banned websites from its search results, reported Reuters. The regulator is also seeking to have Google join a state registry that lists websites banned by the country.
Russia is reportedly planning to enact harsher penalties for tech companies that break its laws. Three sources told Reuters that the country may soon be able to fine firms up to 1% of their annual revenue in Russia if found to be in violation of Russian regulations.
A final decision in the case will be made in December, the watchdog announced.
Over the past five years, Russia has introduced tougher internet laws that require search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services, and social networks to store Russian users’ personal data on servers within the country.

Un grupo conformado por servicios de comparación de compras europeos ha escrito una carta abierta a la Comisionada Europea de Competencia, Margrethe Vestager, quejándose de que Google no ha obedecido la decisión de la Comisión adjunta respecto a la multa impuesta en junio de 2017, en castigo a actividades monopólicas.
“Mientras que sus rivales están obligados a rechazar la gran mayoría de sus ganancias, las ofertas de Google Shopping no cuestan nada”, afirma la carta abierta. “Sus ofertas son solo cuentas internas sin sentido, pagadas de un bolsillo de Google a otro.”
“La dura realidad es que una subasta de pago por ubicación es fundamentalmente incompatible con el concepto de comparación de compras (o, de hecho, cualquier otra forma de búsqueda vertical).
“Como resultado, pocos rivales han optado por participar en la subasta de CSS (servicios de compras de comparación) de Google y, cuando lo han hecho, los CSS auténticos que emplean un modelo de inclusión pagada amigable para el usuario han luchado por superar a servicios como Google Shopping que, desde 2013, utiliza un modelo de pago por colocación hostil para el consumidor “.
En 2017, Vestager le impuso a Google una multa antimonopolio de 2,420 millones de euros (US$2,700 millones) por promover artificialmente su propio servicio de comparación de precios en su plataforma de compras en línea antes que los servicios rivales.

A group of European comparison shopping services have penned an open letter to European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, complaining that Google isn’t playing along with the Commission’s ruling attached to its June 2017 antitrust fine.
“While rivals are compelled to bid away the vast majority of their profits, Google Shopping’s bids cost it nothing,” the open letter claimed. “Its bids are just meaningless internal accounting, paid from one Google pocket into another.
“The harsh reality is that a pay-for-placement auction is fundamentally incompatible with the concept of comparison shopping (or, indeed, any other form of vertical search).
“As a result, few rivals have chosen to participate in Google’s CSS (comparison shopping services) auction and, when they have, genuine CSSs that employ a consumer-friendly paid-inclusion model have struggled to outbid services like Google Shopping that, since 2013, employ a consumer-unfriendly pay-for-placement model.”
In 2017, EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager issued Google a €2.42 billion (US$2.7 billion) antitrust fine for artificially promoting its own price comparison service on its online shopping platform ahead of rival services.

A “link tax” might mean the end of Google News in the EU.
Richard Gingras, the search engine’s vice-president of news, said while “it’s not desirable to shut down services,” the company isn’t happy with Brussels’ current proposal to charge a link tax for using news stories. The move aims to to help struggling news publishers so that they’re paid if their articles appear in search results.
He told the Guardian that the future of Google News in the region could depend on whether the EU is willing to make changes to the legislation. “We can’t make a decision until we see the final language,” he said.
Gingras added that Spain enforced a similar tax in 2014, leading the company to shut down Google News in the country. Gingras claims that caused a fall in traffic to Spanish news sites.
“We would not like to see that happen in Europe,” said Gingras. “Right now what we want to do is work with stakeholders.”
In addition, Gingras noted that Google News is not a direct profit-making business for the company.
“There’s no advertising in Google News. It is not a revenue-generating product to Google. We think it’s valuable as a service to society. We are proud to have it as part of the stable of properties that people have,” he said.

747,"November 7, 2018",EU: Google AdSense case nearing end,"

EU regulators are close to wrapping up their third case against Alphabet unit Google involving its AdSense advertising service, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Wednesday, November 7, reported Reuters.
The comments by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager come four months after the Commission levied a record €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine against Google for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals.
That followed a €2.4 billion fine imposed on the company last year after it thwarted rival shopping comparison websites.
The European Commission in 2016 opened a third case when it accused Google of preventing third parties using its AdSense product from displaying search advertisements from Google’s competitors.
“We are approaching the end of that investigation,” Vestager told reporters at the Web Summit in Lisbon when asked for an update on the investigation.

Google Search (Shopping) as a Precedent for Disintermediation in Other Sectors – The Example of Google for Jobs
By Thomas Hoppner, Felicitas Schaper & Philipp Westerhoff (Hausfeld RA LLP)
With its Google Search (Shopping) decision of 27 June 2017 the European Commission set the legal framework for the assessment of any favouring of Google-own services on its general search results pages. Using the example of the recent launch of Google for Jobs in Europe, this article examines the scope of this precedent. To this end, the authors (i) summarise the finding of the Google Search (Shopping) decision, (ii) describe the functioning, launch and economic consequences of Google for Jobs in Europe and (iii) analyse this launch from a competition law perspective.
The article concludes that Google for Jobs is an online recruitment service akin to a job board or job search aggregator that is separate from Google’s general search service. Google’s favouring of Google for Jobs on its general search results pages as compared to competing services is capable of foreclosing the competition on the market for online recruitment services. Thus, Google’s conduct constitutes an abuse of dominance under the legal framework set by the Google Search (Shopping) decision.

Europe’s Attacks on Google Are Backfiring
By Editorial Board
 

You have to hand it to Europe’s regulators. They rarely miss a chance to antagonize an American tech company, no matter what the cost to their own people.
In a blog post on Tuesday, Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced that it will start charging phone-makers that want to pre-install some of its apps and services for devices sold in Europe. This was the entirely predictable result of an antitrust ruling by the European Commission in July, in which it imposed a record $5 billion fine on Google and demanded that it shape up without specifying exactly how.
What the commission objected to was an arrangement Google had with smartphone makers. It offered them its Android operating system free of charge and granted them access to its Play app store so long as they pre-installed certain Google apps on their phones. Although consumers could access plenty of non-Google alternatives with a click or two, the commission felt this added exertion amounted to an improper barrier to competition.
In fact, the bargain had worked perfectly well for the company and consumers alike. It helped Google’s products spread around the world, boosted its user base, and kept the resulting data flowing into its servers. That data, in turn, helped make its products — Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube — better and better. Consumers reaped the benefits at both ends: cheaper smartphones and free produc...

752,"October 16, 2018",EU: Google to charge smartphone makers for Google Play,"
US tech giant Google will charge smartphone makers a licensing fee for using its popular Google Play app store and also allow them to use rival versions of its Android mobile operating system to comply with an EU antitrust order, reported the New York Times.
Google, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced the changes on Tuesday, three months after the European Commission handed it a landmark €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine for using its popular Android mobile operating system to hinder rivals.
The new arrangement is the latest sign of global technology companies adjusting their business practices in Europe to account for stiffer regulations.
Online privacy regulations adopted in May have forced companies in Europe to add new data protection policies that restrict how people are tracked across the internet. Germany has adopted tough laws to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation that require Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to take down more content or risk fines — a strategy other countries in the region are considering. A copyright law being negotiated in the European Union would also limit what articles and videos a website can post online without a license.
Google announced it would sell a license for a package including its Google Play app store, Gmail, YouTube, and Maps. Another license will be available for companies wanting to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser, allowing handset makers to partner with rival services.

“We have now filed our appeal of the EC’s Android decision at the General Court of the EU,” Google said in an email. It had previously said it would take the case to Europe’s second highest court in Luxembourg, quoted Reuters.
EU competition enforcers had said Google’s illegal practices included forcing manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store on their Android devices,
The EU antitrust authorities said the company also paid manufacturers to pre-install only Google Search and blocked them from using rival Android systems.

Google is readying an appeal of the European Union’s record €4.34 billion (US$5 billion) fine, which it was slapped with in July over its Android mobile operating system.
According to the Financial Times, Google has until Wednesday, October 10, to file an appeal with the European Court of Justice against the European Union decision which was meted out in July.
The ruling outlawed contract restrictions that enabled Google to maintain its dominant search position over the years. The EU’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in July that Google was involved in three practices that prevented rivals with the ability to compete and innovate, including forcing Android phone makers to preinstall the Chrome browser and search app. The Commission also found Google paid phone makers and network operators incentives that were deemed anti-competitive to pre-install only Google’s search app. It also was charged with preventing companies from using rival Android operating software on handsets. Google denied any wrongdoing in the case, noted the Financial Times.
The paper noted that it could take years for the appeals to work their way through the European Court of Justice, but that Google has until October 28 to address the issues Vestager alleges. If the European Commission finds Google didn’t make moves to fix the allegations it can be fined up to 5% of its average daily worldwide turnover, noted the report.

“We had another compliance report… and we see improvements in numbers but we are still following it very, very closely and have taken no decision yet,” Margrethe Vestager said at the Globsec Tatra Summit, according to Reuters.
Vestager’s remarks came just after Google submitted its second report to the commission in its work to ease competition concerns spurred by its shopping comparison tool.


The European Commission, had originally fined Google US$3 billion in 2017 for abusing its market dominance to prop up its shopping comparison tool. The company displayed its price comparison chart at the top of its search results, which the EU stated was unfair and would give it an advantage over startups trying to make their tools.

Google came up with the offer after being hit by a fine for €2.4 billion (US$2.79 billion) in June 2017 for using its search engine market power to boost its own comparison shopping service. It is required to provide periodic reports on the proposal.
The European Commission in June announced competition was improving after the world’s most popular internet presented a first report which showed more competition for ads at the top of a search page.
Rivals, however, have disputed its claim of creating a level playing field and want more regulatory action, reported Reuters.

Pichai also met with senior Republican lawmakers on Friday to discuss their concerns, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.
After the meetings, it was announced that Pichai has agreed to testify before the US House Judiciary Committee later this year over Republican concerns that the company is biased against conservatives and that he will also attend a meeting with President Donald Trump.
McCarthy told reporters after the meeting that the meeting was “very productive” and “frank.”
“I think we’ve really shown that there is bias, which is human nature, but you have to have transparency and fairness,” McCarthy said. “As big tech’s business grows, we have not had enough transparency and that has led to an erosion of trust and, perhaps worse, harm to consumers.”
Republicans want to question Google about whether its search algorithms are influenced by human bias. They also want to probe it on issues such as privacy, classification of news and opinion and dealing with countries with human rights violations.
Google has repeatedly denied accusations of bias against conservatives. Pichai left the meeting without comment.

On Friday, September 28, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is scheduled to privately meet with some of the top Republican lawmakers in Washington, DC.
Later this year, Pichai also is scheduled to attend a public hearing at a House Judiciary Committee in November after the midterm elections.
The announcement came two weeks after Google failed to send a high-level representative to appear before the Congress Intelligence Committee along with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The move was sharply criticized by lawmakers and media alike. In advance of the hearing, Google offered its chief legal officer Kent Walker, who was rejected by the Congress committee which wished to see Pichai or the Alphabet CEO Larry Page.
“I look forward to meeting with members on both sides of the aisle, answering a wide range of questions, and explaining our approach,” Pichai said in a statement published by the Wall Street Journal. “These meetings will continue Google’s long history of engaging with Congress, including testifying seven times to Congress this year.”
The meeting with Pichai was organized by the House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R – CA) who has repeatedly criticized major tech companies over the past few months. He said Google “has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China.”

“Because of their critical role in American society, it is essential that American citizens are protected from anticompetitive acts by dominant online platforms,” the order reads. It adds that consumer harm—a key measure in antitrust investigations—could come “through the exercise of bias.”

763,"September 23, 2018",Turkey: Investigation ends in fine for Google,"
Rekabet Kurumu, the Turkish competition authority, has slapped a US$15 million fine on Google for violating local competition laws, the regulator announced on its website on Thursday, September 20.
The investigation into Google’s violation of local competition laws was initiated in March 2017, when the regulator was tasked with finding out whether Google’s contracts with equipment producers (in addition to its mobile communications systems and for providing services) contravened local competition laws.
The competition authority stated Google, Google International, and Google Reklamcilik were given six months to make the necessary changes in order to “reinstill effective competition in the market and end the violation.”

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry would like to see Google, Facebook and other major social media behemoths broken up like the federal government did to Standard Oil more than a century ago, reported the Advocate.
Landry says the internet giants are suppressing conservative agendas, stifling competition, and infringing on antitrust laws. “This can’t be fixed legislatively,” Landry told The Advocate Tuesday. “We need to go to court with an antitrust suit.”
Landry, will go to Washington, D.C. next week to push that solution to US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions set a Sept. 25 meeting with about a half dozen Republican state attorney generals.
As president of the National Association of Attorneys General, Landry and other state attorney generals have been looking for months into what they call the anti-competitive practices of Google, Facebook and Twitter. Landry said they acted after hearing many complaints that the companies, accidentally or not, routinely freeze out conservative viewpoints.

Según un informe de Reuters, las compañías, que también incluyen a Amazon, Apple y Charter Communications, se presentarán ante el Senado el 26 de septiembre para explicar sus políticas de privacidad, dijo John Thune, senador republicano y presidente del Comité de Comercio del Senado. El senador dijo que también piensan testificar sobre “cómo planean abordar los nuevos requisitos de la Unión Europea y California, y qué puede hacer el Congreso para promover expectativas de privacidad claras sin perjudicar la innovación”.

AT&T, Twitter, Alphabet’s Google and three other major web and internet service companies plan to testify before a US Senate panel later in September to lay out their consumer data privacy practices.
According to a report in Reuters, the companies – which also include Amazon, Apple and Charter Communications – will appear before the Senate on September 26 to explain their approaches to privacy, said John Thune, the Republican senator and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The senator said they will also testify as to “how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation.”
Those expected to testify, according to the report, include Google’s chief privacy officer, Twitter’s global data protection officer and Apple’s vice president of software technology.
The comments from the senator come a day after The Internet Association, a group that represents Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, among other technology and internet companies, said it supports data privacy rules in the U.S. that are more modern, but urged lawmakers to approach the issue nationally. According to a different report in Reuters, the trade group wants the rules to preempt a new regulation on the books in California that comes into effect in 2020.

Arizona’s top prosecutor is investigating Google for its location tracking practices, the Washington Post reported. The investigation follows the revelation that Google continues to store users’ location data even if they have turned off Location History.
According to a public filing cited by the Washington Post, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich has hired an outside law firm to help investigate a tech company for potential Consumer Fraud Act violations related to the “storage of consumer location data” and “tracking of consumer location…even when consumers turn off ‘location services’ and take other steps to stop such tracking.”
The document was dated just over a week after an investigation by the Associated Press found that Google devices and services store time-stamped location data even for users who believed they had turned off that data collection. The AP verified its findings with the help of researchers from Princeton University.
Ryan Anderson, a spokesman for the Arizona attorney general, acknowledged that there have been “recent bombshell reports depicting how the tech industry handles consumer data and what companies are doing with that information,” including the AP story, which “highlighted Google’s apparent tracking of consumer movement even if you opt out of such services.”

The absence of Google was a major disappointment for lawmakers on the Committee, who kept a seat open in the hearing room to exhibit the company’s lack of participation alongside Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.
According to the Wall Street Journal, in noting the empty chair with a placard bearing Google’s name, senators chided the internet company for failing to publicly address key issues around the use of online platforms.
“Given its size and influence, I would have thought that leadership at Google would have wanted to demonstrate how seriously it takes these challenges and to actually take a leadership role in this important discussion,” Senator Mark Warner (D, VA) said in his remarks. “Unfortunately, they didn’t choose to make that decision.”

En una entrevista ofrecida la semana pasada a Bloomberg News, el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, intensificó sus críticas dirigidas a empresas de tecnología. Trump dice que estas empresas favorecen los puntos de vista liberales y dijo que podrían estar en una “situación de antitrust”. Pero Trump dijo en repetidas ocasiones que no puede hacer comentarios públicos sobre si deberían dividirse.

El último ataque de Trump a las compañías de tecnología comenzó el martes 29 de agosto cuando afirmó, sin ofrecer pruebas, que la función de búsqueda de noticias de Google favorecía a los medios liberales en lugar de conservadores, y dijo: “¡Esta es una situación muy grave! ¡Se abordará!” En una reunión sostenida en la Oficina Oval, dijo a los periodistas que Google de Alphabet, Facebook y Twitter “están pisando terreno muy, muy problemático”.

According to an interview last week with Bloomberg News, US President Donald Trump is stepping up his criticism of technology firms. Trump says they are favoring liberal points of view and said they may be in a “very antitrust situation.” But Trump repeatedly said he can’t comment publicly on whether they should be broken up.
“I won’t comment on the breaking up, of whether it’s that or Amazon or Facebook,” Trump said in an Oval Office interview. “As you know, many people think it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them. But I just, I won’t comment on that.”
Trump’s latest attack on the technology companies began Tuesday, August 29, when he claimed—without providing evidence—that Google’s news search function favored liberal over conservative outlets, tweeting that “This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” Later, in a meeting in the Oval Office, he told reporters that Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, and Twitter “are treading on very, very troubled territory.”

Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate potential anti-competitive effects in Google’s search and digital advertising practices shortly after President Donald Trump made several unfounded or false claims about anti-conservative bias on Google search.
Hatch sent FTC chairman Joseph Simons a letter Thursday, August 30, in which he expressed concern about “recent reports on Google’s search and digital advertising practices.” Hatch’s letter cites a variety of “disquieting” reports.
The senator mentioned a 60 Minutes segment from MaY that highlighted Google’s massive size and power over other web companies, as well as a July controversy over third-party app developers which were given access to Gmail message content.
He also mentioned that Google has “decided to remove from its platforms legal businesses that the company apparently does not agree with” — which could be a reference to Google blocking gun sales from its shopping platform, blocking ads from disreputable drug and alcohol treatment centers, or simply banning YouTube channels.
Earlier this summer, Simons said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.

Executives from three major tech companies are due to appear before Congress next Wednesday to talk about their role in protecting the integrity of November’s midterm elections, but senators are threatening to put an empty chair in Google’s place. The potential move is a sign of lawmakers’ increasing dissatisfaction with the company.
The Senate Intelligence Committee invited leaders from Facebook, Twitter and Google to a hearing on their role in “protecting elections from misinformation and disinformation.” The companies have faced intense scrutiny since it emerged that a Russian government-linked disinformation campaign wreaked havoc on their platforms during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey agreed to attend. The committee also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai, but the company offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of Global Affairs, in his place.
“We want to talk about solutions. We’ve asked for the most senior executives. … [Google] ought to be part of this discussion and dialogue,” Warner said on “Power Lunch.”
“Chances are there’s going to be an empty chair there. And I think there will be a lot more questions raised that could have been actually dealt with if they sent a senior decision-maker and not simply their counsel.”

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday, August 28, that the Trump administration is “taking a look” at imposing regulations on Google following the president’s tweet Tuesday morning accusing the search giant of favoring news outlets critical of him in search results.
Trump tweeted early Tuesday morning that Google’s search results only show reporting from what he labeled the “fake news media.”
“They have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out.”
Google, in a statement, stated its searches aren’t politically biased, “When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds. Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology.
“Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users’ queries,” Google continued. “We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.”

The KFTC conducted an on-site probe into Google Korea for the past three weeks to check whether the Korean branch of the US internet giant has been exerting pressure on local game companies to release their games exclusively on its app store.
This came about four months after the KFTC surveyed local mobile game developers and distributors in April about whether Google Korea pressured them to launch their games only through the Google Play store or not to release their games through other app marketplaces.

Google earned its dominance on merit, not by abusing antitrust law
By Pascal Salin 
The European Union’s regulatory bodies seem to be particularly hostile to Alphabet GOOG, +0.54% . In June 2017, the European Commission fined the company €2.42 billion ($2.75 billion) for breaching EU antitrust rules, after concluding that, “Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service.”
Then, last month, the Commission went after Google again, fining it €4.34 billion ($4.94 billion) for “illegal practices regarding Android mobile devices.” Google had made agreements with mobile-device manufacturers and network operators “to pre-install the Google Search app and browser app (Chrome).” Moreover, it seems that the European Parliament and several EU member states would like to dismantle Google by separating its search engine from other possible revenue sources.
There is no doubt that Google holds a unique position on the internet. In terms of search activity, it has commanded around 90% of the market for over a decade, leading many soi-disant defenders of competition to denounce it for “abusing” its “dominant position.” But most of these attacks are driven by a mix of misconceptions and questionable claims of harm by Google’s competitors.

The talks reportedly began in early 2018 and the internet giant narrowed partnership candidates to three firms in late March.
It is not immediately clear if the plans will proceed in the wake of increasing trade tensions between China and the United States, the report said.
Google, which quit China’s search engine market in 2010, has been actively seeking ways to re-enter China, where many of its products are blocked by regulators.
Through local partnerships, Google aims to run its internet-based services through the domestic data centers and servers of Chinese providers, similar to the way other US cloud companies access that market, the report said.

EU engaged in antitrust gerrymandering against Google
By Nicolas Petit 
With its US$5 billion fine against Google, the European Commission (EC) just applied to the search giant an old US political trick: gerrymandering; the idea that if antitrust watchdogs draw markets narrowly enough, every company can be made to look like an evil monopolist.
Evidence of competition among Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG) is all over the place. Three weeks ago, Facebook launched Instagram TV, throwing the gauntlet at Google on online ads.
But to an antitrust hammer, everything looks like a nail, and in Brussels, antitrust officials see a Google monopoly everywhere they look. Recently, the EC declared Google dominant on the Android operating system for mobile phones. Just about a year ago, it found Google dominant in general internet search services.

How E.U.’s Google Fine Explains High Cellphone Costs in the US
By Luigi Zingales
The knee-jerk reaction to the European Union’s decision to fine Google US$5.1 billion is to blame the Europeans. How can it be possible that in Europe the antitrust authorities determined that Google abused its dominance in the smartphone market when in America it did not?
It’s not the first time. Just last year the European Commission (the administrative arm of the European Union) fined Google US$2.8 billion for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in the search engine market, a charge that the American Federal Trade Commission had dropped a few years earlier. Is this the first salvo in an incoming trade war or a form of tax-thy-neighbor policy?
It would be both wrong and dangerous to just blame the Europeans. Wrong, because there is reliable evidence that the European Commission does not target American companies: It is just as tough with all firms, including domestic ones.

Teachout made her stand outside the offices of The New York Daily News, which laid off half of its reporters two days before. She said all of those jobs could’ve been saved if the “parasites” and “bridge trolls” at Facebook and Google shared their wealth with news organizations.
As a constitutional lawyer, Teachout claimed the solution is stronger antitrust protections. If elected, she would work with other attorneys general to determine whether Facebook and Google are abusing their power.
“There isn’t actually a competitive market,” Teachout said via a Facebook Live stream.
Teachout ran for the candidacy of the Democratic party to the governorship of New York in the 2014 elections, with running mate Tim Wu of Columbia Law School, and received 34% of the vote.

Hawley released a statement saying, “If the European Commission’s allegations are true, Google’s conduct may have violated both federal and state antitrust laws… Google’s alleged conduct does not merely undermine free and efficient markets; it undermines fundamental consumer privacy interests by excluding companies that would compete with Google by providing greater protections for users’ personal information.”

785,"July 24, 2018",US: Elizabeth Warren backs EU antitrust fine for Google,"
Earlier this week Senator Elizabeth Warren sat down with CNBC’s John Harwood to discuss an array of issues, from President Donald Trump to the economy.
Here, she talked about the European Union’s fine of Alphabet’s Google and how the US pursues antitrust enforcement.
Q: The European Union just fined Google US$5 billion. You like that?
A: Look, they made their case, and they make a pretty strong case. What’s bothers me is…
Q: The president criticized it and said, “That shows that Europe is going after American companies.”
A: No. What it shows is that Europe is serious about antitrust laws, Europe is serious about anti-competition laws, and the United States is lagging. We were once the leaders in the world on this, and no more.

786,"July 23, 2018",EU: Google attempted to settle the Android antitrust case in 2017,"
The European Union hit Google with a second large fine. The new US$5 billion penalty is almost double the US$2.8 billion punishment Google received last year. This time around it wasn’t for antitrust practices related to search as was the case in 2017. Android was at the center of this antitrust investigation, reported Bloomberg.
Not only does Google have to pay the fine, but it will also have to alter its Android distribution contracts with Android vendors and carriers to avoid future fines. Google, threatening that Android might not remain free after the ruling, said it will appeal the decision.
A new report reveals that Google secretly attempted to settle the case, but it was too late for any settlement talks, according to the EU.
According to Bloomberg, which talked to the EU’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Google’s settlement proposals came in the weeks after the June 2017 fine in the Google Search case.
Google waited at least a year too long to open settlement talks. Vestager said the company would have had to “reach out immediately after” getting the EU’s initial complaint or statement of objections.
“That didn’t happen in this case, and then, of course, it takes the route that it has now taken,” Vestager said. “So no surprises.”

787,"July 19, 2018",US: FTC to look closely at EU’s US$5b Google fine,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Joseph Simons told lawmakers Wednesday, July 18, that he will look at the European Union’s move to fine Google US$5 billion for antitrust violations pertaining to the Android mobile operating system.
Reuters, citing comments Simons made during a hearing in front of lawmakers, reported the FTC head said he spoke with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager about the fine earlier in the week. “We’re going to read what the EU put out very closely,” Simons told a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, according to Reuters. When asked about the control Google and Apple have over the smartphone industry, Simons said that markets that are dominated by a small number of companies are where antitrust issues often arise. “There are the two of them, so they compete pretty heavily against each other,” said Simons, according to Reuters.
The EU fine stems from an inquiry by antitrust regulators at the European Union into whether or not Google abused its position with the Android OS, which is on more than 80% of the smartphones around the globe, by favoring its own mobile apps and services including its search engine. Google has the right to appeal the fine. Google argues that its OS, which manufacturers don’t have to pay to install on mobile devices, actually boosted competition among smartphones and resulted in lower prices.

788,"July 19, 2018",EU: Google to appeal antitrust ruling,"
Google said Thursday it will appeal the astronomical US$5 billion fine levied against it by the European Union for violating antitrust laws with its Android system. The company also angrily accused the EU of attacking its open source business model.
The Android operates on a free, open platform for smartphones, so critics said the decision could have dire ramifications for other open source systems.
The EU said that to obtain the free system, phone manufacturers had to include a bundle of Google services, such as its search bar and Chrome browser.
“Google has imposed illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general Internet search,” the EU said in its statement announcing the fine.
In a more detailed blog post, Google doubled down on its position to argue that Android has helped bring choice to the market by enabling 1,300 different companies to develop 24,000 smartphones, and bringing over one million apps to users.
Google argued that phone makers aren’t obligated to pre-load its apps and that, even if they do, there are alternatives that have racked up significant download numbers. In particular, the company namechecked browser apps Opera Mini and Firefox, both of which have over 100 million downloads, and UC Browser, which has been downloaded more than 500 million times.

789,"July 18, 2018","EU: EC rules Google abused OS power, fined €4.3b","
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of the European Union’s antitrust body, announced on Wednesday, July 18, that Google “engaged in illegal practices to cement its dominant market position in internet search.” The European Commission decided to impose a fine of €4.3 billion (US$5.0 billion) and called on the company to put an effective end to these practices within 90 days, or face penalty payments.
Although the amount of the fine sets a new record, the main impact of the ruling is that it threatens the hold that Google has on the internet search market, from which it derives its main sources of revenue. Further to this, pundits have claimed that these remedies may come too late and that the company must be broken up.
The announcement had been anticipated for some weeks and took place after a meeting of national competition agencies that the Commission rescheduled from July 10 to July 17, apparently to avoid controversy over US President Donald Trump’s presence at the NATO summit held from July 9 to July 12.
In her announcement, Commissioner Vestager referred to “three types of restrictions that Google has imposed on mobile device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic goes to Google Search:
First, Google has required manufacturers to pre-install the Google search and browser apps on devices running on the Android mobile operating system. Manufacturers had to do this if they wanted to be able to sell devices with the Google app store.

790,"July 18, 2018",EU. Google Hit With $5.1B EU Android Fine,"
Alphabet’s Google was slapped with a $5.1 billion antitrust fine from the European Union over what the EU calls an abuse of the Android operating system.
After the Wall Street Journal reported Google could get hit with the fine later Wednesday (July 18) — a formal decision on the fine was made at a meeting of EU commissioners following a presentation by Margrethe Vestager, the competition chief. The fine stems from an inquiry by antitrust regulators at the European Union into whether or not Google abused its position with the Android OS, which is on more than 80 percent of the smartphones around the globe, by favoring its own mobile apps and services including its search engine. Google has the right to appeal the fine. The appeal of the case has been rejected by the EU in the past, noted the paper.
Google argues that its OS, which manufacturers don’t have to pay to install on mobile devices, actually boosted competition among smartphones and resulted in lower prices. It also said the allegation that it hurt third-party apps by highlighting its own is untrue because manufactures install all sorts of apps on the devices and consumers have the option to download any apps they want.

According to Bloomberg, an alternative to Google’s Play Store called Atoipode has complained to EU antitrust regulators alleging that the Alphabet unit had prevented its service from working on some users’ phones and tablets.
Aptoide claims antivirus software integrated into the Android operating system thwarted users when they downloaded and tried to use the app store on their devices, allegedly in violation of the bloc’s competition rules.
Aptoide said the Android antivirus program, Google Play Protect, was nudging users through a notification to uninstall the app store from their devices, warning them the program could download harmful apps. For those that choose to keep Aptoide despite the warning, the app store no longer functions and can’t install apps, the company said.

El congresista Todd Rokita, republicano conservador por el estado de Indiana, ha pedido al gobierno federal que vuelva a abrir una investigación antimonopolio sobre el buscador de Google, informó el semanario The Hill.
En una carta enviada el jueves a la Comisión Federal de Comercio y el Departamento de Justicia, Rokita señaló que Google controla más del 85% del mercado de búsquedas en Internet, un aumento importante comparado al 71%  que abarcaba en 2012, cuando la FTC investigó a la empresa.
“Estas condiciones del mercado son, en parte, lo que impulsó a los reguladores europeos a tomar medidas contra Google”, escribió Rokita en la carta, que fue reportada por primera vez por Axios. “Es hora de que sus agencias vuelvan a abrir revisiones de Google para garantizar que sus prácticas comerciales cumplan con la ley”.
Un portavoz del jefe antimonopolio del Departamento de Justicia, Makan Delrahim, dijo que habían recibido la carta y que estaba siendo revisada.
El año pasado, la Unión Europea emitió una multa antimonopolio de US$2.7 mil millones contra Google por dar mayor prioridad a su propio servicio de comparación de compras por encima de sus rivales en los resultados de búsqueda. Los reguladores europeos también tienen otras dos investigaciones antimonopolio en curso contra la empresa.

In a letter Thursday to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, Rokita noted that Google controls over 85% of the internet search market, up from 71% when the FTC staff investigated Google in 2012.
“These market conditions are in part what prompted European regulators to take action against Google,” Rokita wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Axios. “It is time for your agencies to reopen reviews of Google to ensure that its business practices comply with the law.”
A spokesman for the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said he had received the letter and is reviewing it.
Last year, the European Union issued a record US$2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google for elevating its own comparison shopping service over rivals’ in its search results. European regulators also have two other ongoing antitrust investigations into the company.

795,"July 5, 2018","Germany: Telecom regulator head going after Google, Facebook","
Jochen Homann, the president of Germany’s telecom regulator Bundesnetzagentur, is going after Google and Facebook, contending that their messaging and email services should face the same regulation as telecom companies in the country.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Homann said that with the lines between telecom providers and web-based services getting blurred there must be equal regulatory treatment. “It cannot be right that a company providing traditional telecommunications services has to meet certain regulatory requirements, like those concerning data protection, while a company providing comparable services over the web does not,” he told the Financial Times. Since 2014 the Bundesnetzagentur, or Federal Network Agency, has been embroiled in a legal fight with Google after telling the company it had to register Gmail as a telecommunications operator. By doing that Google would face regulatory requirements around data protection and security and the requirement to provide information to police. The case is before the European Court of Justice, noted the Financial Times.
Homann told the paper the lawsuit against Google is a test case and that if it is victorious it would prompt a crackdown on a more broader level. “We want European companies to have a level playing field when it comes to data protection, public safety and registration requirements. That would apply to messaging services such as WhatsApp, Facebook and all the others that offer similar services,” he said. “We have shown the way forward. We want these companies to meet the same regulatory requirements in principle as conventional telecommunications companies, for example when it comes to messaging services. Companies should be aware of the direction we are going in.”
While Google wouldn’t comment to the Financial Times on the case it did say that the German regulator isn’t acting in lockstep with the rest of European countries. “The particular importance of this question arises from the potential consequences . . . for other communication services and from the impact on other EU member states,” Google said in a statement to the Financial Times. “The Bundesnetzagentur is the only supervisory authority in Europe that . . . regards the registration of Gmail as a telecommunications service as necessary.”

Google’s and Facebook’s Dubious Bitcoin Bans






By Mark Epstein
If Calvin Coolidge’s observation that “advertising is the life of trade” remains true, the new bans by Google and Facebook on cryptocurrency ads threaten the fledgling industry’s existence. Coolidge in a 1926 address hailed advertising for spurring competition, but today these two companies control a large chunk of the digital-advertising market. A company or industry that has been shut out by Google and Facebook will find it nearly impossible to reach an internet audience.
Courts and regulators have limited the scope of rules involving “refusal to deal” arrangements, whereby a dominant company denies competitors access to essential products and services. But the anticrypto move by Google and Facebook still raises antitrust concerns. Google Pay and Facebook Messenger include peer-to-peer payment services, which compete against multibillion-dollar cryptoexchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Both Google and Facebook may soon enter the cryptocurrency market directly. Last month, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed that Google had approached him about helping to develop a cryptocurrency project. Facebook has also announced it will launch a group to explore blockchain technology.
The digital duopoly’s closest competitors in the online-ad market, Amazon and Microsoft , also have online payment systems and ban cryptocurrency promotions. In effect, four of the eight largest companies in the world control an online-advertising oligopoly and are denying competitors access to these services.
In Lorain Journal v. U.S. (1951), the U.S. Supreme Court held that while a business may usually “refuse to accept advertisements from whomever it pleases,” it may not refuse ads to harm its competitors. The case involved a Wisconsin newspaper that refused to sell ad space to anyone who also advertised over a local radio station. In 2016 the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against 1-800 Contacts for pressuring its competitors to withdraw advertising from certain online searches. The agency is still pursuing the enforcement, and an administrative law judge initially found in its favor.
These cases aren’t perfectly analogous to the cryptocurrency ad ban, but they point to key questions. If an advertiser can’t restrict its competitors from advertising on Google, how can Google itself do so? If a small-town newspaper can’t refuse ads to harm its competitors, why are the largest communications platforms in the world allowed to do the same?
Facebook and Google would likely respond that their motive isn’t to limit competition. Facebook claimed the policy was developed because cryptocurrencies are “frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.”

Su respuesta: las compañías tecnológicas deberían tratar de trabajar rápidamente con el gobierno para encontrar una solución, a diferencia de lo que Microsoft hizo durante su mandato, cuando se enfrentó a una demanda antimonopolio del gobierno.
“No estoy tratando de decir  ‘ay de mí’, pero recuerden que recibimos una demanda antimonopolio en Microsoft por parte del [Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos]. Esto del gobierno […] es algo serio. Y sabiendo lo que sé ahora, habría resuelto los problemas”, dijo Ballmer.
“Creo que debimos haber resuelto antes cómo arreglar las cosas. No creo que haya sido útil para nuestra empresa el camino que tomamos. Creo que la industria de la tecnología ahora podría […] repetir esa experiencia “.
Continuó: “Creo que aceptar completamente que las cosas no son como deben ser, y ponerse a trabajar en esos temas de tal manera que la gente entienda que lo tomamos en serio, en lugar de que la industria tecnológica parezca generalmente arrogante.”
Facebook ha estado plagado de escándalos, desde la propagación de propaganda rusa hasta el escándalo de Cambridge Analytica. Google, Microsoft y Amazon se han visto sacudidos por las protestas internas de sus empleados contra los contratos de la compañía con órganos militares y policiacos. Existe un cuestionamiento cada vez mayor respecto a si la industria tecnológica tiene demasiado poder, e incluso se ha sugerido la necesidad de tomar acciones antimonopolio.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, Microsoft’s former chief executive Steve Ballmer was asked how he sees the current storm clouds over the tech industry playing out. His answer: Tech companies should try to work quickly with government to find a solution—unlike what Microsoft did under his tenure, as it faced an antitrust suit from the government.
“I’m not trying to do a ‘woe is me’ thing, but remember we got by an antitrust lawsuit at Microsoft by the [US Department of Justice]. This government stuff […] it’s serious stuff. And knowing what I know now, I would have resolved the issues,” Ballmer said.
“I think we should have figured out how to settle matters out earlier than we did. I do not think it was helpful for our company, the path we took. I think the tech industry right now […] could well repeat that experience.”
He went on, “I think fully accepting that things are not the way they need to be, and going to work on those issues in a way that people understand you are serious about, as opposed to the tech industry generally appearing arrogant, I understand that.”
Facebook has been beset by scandals, from the spread of Russian propaganda to Cambridge Analytica scandal. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been roiled by internal employee protests against company contracts with the military and law enforcement agencies. There is growing scrutiny of whether the tech industry has too much power, and suggestions of antitrust action are being thrown around.
Ballmer is urging the tech industry to get over it, accept there’s a problem, and work with regulators to fix it.

After Google reforms there are signs some rivals are benefiting, Europe’s competition chief said on Monday.
The comments from European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager come amid calls from Google’s competitors for her to take more drastic action against the world’s most popular internet search engine.
A year after being hit with a record €2.4 billion ($2.8 billion) fine by the European Commission, Google has yet to create a level playing field, according to rivals such as British comparison shopping sites Foundem and Kelkoo and others in the travel search, digital mapping and publishing markets.
Google’s proposal involves allowing competitors to bid for ads at the top of a search page aimed at giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.
Vestager said she was aware of the rivals’ concerns but cited figures to show that competition was improving.
“We know from our monitoring there’s been a steady increase in the numbers over the last few months. The most recent figures show at least one rival appears in about one-third of new shopping boxes as compared to 15 percent of the shopping boxes back in March,” she told a European Parliament hearing.

French retailer Carrefour has announced a strategic partnership with Google that will enable new distribution models and commerce experiences for shoppers in France.
The partnership centers around three initiatives: A new buying experience from Carrefour across Google platforms (Assistant, Google Home and a new experience on the Google Shopping website in France); the opening of an innovation lab in Paris this summer in partnership with Google Cloud, where Carrefour engineers will work side-by-side with Google Cloud AI experts to co-create new consumer experiences; and a training program to accelerate the digital transformation of Carrefour Group.
More than 1,000 employees of Carrefour will be trained with the support of Google Cloud in six months, and Google Cloud’s G Suite productivity and collaboration solutions (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Hangouts, Docs, etc.) will be deployed to more than 160,000 Carrefour employees.
Alexandre Bompard, CEO of Carrefour, said, “I would like to thank the Google teams, both in France and the United States, for this strategic partnership for our two groups. This alliance makes Carrefour the first partner of Google on grocery eCommerce in Europe, creating a strong bond between the two companies. It also marks an important step in the new story written by Carrefour since the announcement of the Carrefour 2022 plan. It allows us to accelerate our digital evolution and get a head start in deploying the omnichannel approach we want to offer our customers.”
The partnership enables Google to deliver its technology and skills in AI, cloud and new consumer shopping interfaces to Carrefour, while the retailer offers its product expertise and knowledge in logistics and sales.
Sébastien Missoffe, VP and managing director of Google France, said, “Shoppers today are saddled with disconnected experiences through the shopping journey, which often lead to abandoned shopping carts and low customer satisfaction and loyalty. Customers want assistive, simple and personalized experiences that help them make decisions on what to buy, assist with easily building baskets across surfaces, and provide a seamless checkout. With Alexandre Bompard and his team, we wanted to explore new distribution models and eCommerce technologies to deliver simple, frictionless and deeply relevant experiences for shoppers in France. I’m happy we’re contributing to Carrefour’s digital transformation through the deployment Google Cloud Platform and G Suite’s collaboration tools.”

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is calling for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open a new investigation into Google and how it wields its market dominance.
Ellison, the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asked the FTC’s commissioners in a letter on Friday to look into the Google search practices that led to a massive fine from the European Union.
“The FTC should determine whether Alphabet has engaged in similar conduct in the United States and whether such conduct violates the FTC Act,” Ellison wrote, referring to Google’s parent company.
Last year, the EU hit Google with a record $2.7 billion fine for elevating its own comparison shopping service in the company’s search results at the expense of rivals.  The FTC let Google off the hook after its own investigation into those practices in 2012.
Ellison urged consumer protection agency to re-examine the company in light of its massive growth  since the Obama-era investigation.
“Google’s full-year revenue was $50,175,000,000. In 2017, the company posted full-year revenue of $110,855,000,000,” Ellison wrote. “Given that the company has more than doubled in size since the last time the FTC opened an investigation, Google’s persistent and increasing dominance since 2013 further justifies opening a new investigation.”
Ellison also asked the agency for information on how it’s monitoring the company’s compliance with a 2011 consent agreement settling deceptive privacy charges.

802,"May 28, 2018","EU: Facebook, Google get hit with GDPR suits totaling US$8.8b","
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is newly on the books in the European Union, but that hasn’t stopped Facebook and Google from being hit with a handful of lawsuits having to do with how they share data.
The Verge, citing the lawsuits, reported they are seeking to hit Facebook and Google with fines that collectively amount to around US$8.8 billion. The lawsuits were filed by Max Schrems, an Australian activist who has long criticized how the companies collect data on their users.
Under the new regulation, companies have to provide clear consent and justify why they are collecting data on their users, as well as clarify what they intend to do with it. They are also required to overhaul their privacy and data collection policies to better protect consumers.
Google and Facebook have been addressing GDPR before it was law, rolling out new policies and products to better protect the data, but Schrems said in the lawsuit that those steps aren’t enough. Specifically, the lawsuit states that the method the companies use to get consent for their privacy policies – asking users to click a box to access the service – gives consumers an all-or-nothing choice, which is a violation of GDPR.
“They totally know that it’s going to be a violation,” Schrems told Financial Times. “They don’t even try to hide it.”
According to the report, the raft of lawsuits is broken down based on the product, with one being lodged against Facebook and two against Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook owns. A lawsuit against Google’s Android operating system has also been filed.
Both companies argue that their measures comply with the GDPR requirements. “We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages, and are committed to complying with the EU GDPR,” Google said in a statement to The Verge. Meanwhile, Facebook said, “We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the GDPR.”

803,"May 24, 2018",US: Yelp targets Google’s employees in antitrust campaign,"
Yelp and TripAdvisor have formed a coalition targeting Google employees, asking them to make Google’s effective monopoly on internet searches fair for its competitors.
The coalition, called “Focus on the User,” is led by Yelp and TripAdvisor and also consists of a few progressive activist organizations. It plans on targeting Google employees through online ads with an animated video they produced that explains why Google’s current practices are anti-competitive, Recode reported Wednesday, May 23.
The argument against Google is that the search engine is placing its own content, such as its shopping site, above its competitors in search results. Since 90% of all internet searches are done on Google, the site has an effective monopoly on the industry, making it especially susceptible to anti-competitive behavior.
Google has also faced complaints of violating antitrust laws before. Yelp recently filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the European Union and the European Union’s Competition Commission fined Google US$2.8 billion for placing its shopping content in before its competitors in 2017.

Yelp has renewed a European antitrust complaint against Alphabet’s Google, seeking to gain traction on a longstanding accusation that the search giant unfairly promotes its own services in results, reported The Financial Times.
A similar complaint Yelp filed in 2014 has not led the European Union to issue a formal charge against Google, nor have letters and testimony to US regulators led to charges.
But the company said it has strengthened its complaint by looking at the EU’s ruling last year that Google misused its dominance in product shopping search results. Google is appealing a $2.9-billion fine in that case.
Yelp also took into account Google’s rebuttal to an antitrust complaint in Brazil related to shopping results.
The heart of Yelp’s concern remains the same: That Google’s local search tools, such as business listings and reviews from Google Maps, receive top billing in results while links to Yelp and other sources of potentially more helpful information are listed much lower.

805,"May 21, 2018",EEUU: Senadores buscan investigar  servicio de rastreo de ubicación de Google,"
Dos senadores del gobierno estadounidense solicitaron a la Comisión Federal de Comercio (FTC, por sus siglas en inglés) que revise de nuevo los servicios de localización ofrecidos por Google. 
Los senadores demócratas Richard Blumenthal y Edward Markey emitieron su llamado,  – calificado como imposible de ignorar,  –  a fines de la semana pasada, pidiendo a la FTC que “abra una investigación sobre los posibles actos y prácticas engañosas utilizadas por Google para rastrear y convertir en productos básicos a los consumidores estadounidenses”. 
El núcleo del problema es si las personas que dicen “sí” a la función de historial de ubicaciones en Android se dan cuenta de que se pueden recopilar sus ubicaciones incluso cuando los Servicios de localización están desactivados. Esto se debe a que el GPS es solo la fuente más precisa de datos de ubicación: si Google conoce un punto de acceso Wi-Fi, por ejemplo, iniciar sesión le dará a la empresa una ubicación bastante precisa para un dispositivo.
En la carta, los senadores dicen, “tenemos reservas importantes sobre la falla de Google para explicar claramente cómo los datos de ubicación son recopilados y utilizados por la compañía”.
Google ya había respondido a una solicitud anterior de esta información en respuesta a una carta del par con fecha de diciembre de 2017, pero siguen insatisfechos porque, aunque Google afirmó que todos los servicios son “optativos”, sospechan que la elección de los usuarios es demasiado fácil. Google enfrenta una investigación similar en Australia.en Australia.

806,"May 20, 2018",US: Google shares drop due to a 60 Minutes feature on antitrust threat,"
Google parent Alphabet shares fell more than 1% in early trading Friday amid reports that CBS’s flagship news program, 60 Minutes, is preparing a feature on global online advertizing giant.
Sixty Minutes said it would air a segment on Sunday May 20 titled “The Power of Google” that will focus on “its critics who say the company has stifled competition, and an antitrust enforcer who is taking action.”
Alphabet Google division was fined a record €2.42 billion (US$2.7 billion) by the European Commission last June for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving itself an advantage in comparison shopping services. The company appealed the decision in September.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, will be interviewed on the 60 Minutes segment, her office said Friday. Vestager fined Google a record US$2.7 billion last year over its shopping search service. The Mountain View, California-based company faces possible further fines in two separate EU probes into Android mobile phone software and Google’s online advertising contracts.

807,"May 17, 2018",India: Google says antitrust ruling could cause ‘irreparable” harm’,"
Alphabet’s Google has said an Indian antitrust ruling that found it was guilty of search bias could cause“irreparable” harm and reputational loss to the company, according to a legal document reviewed by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) fined Google $20 million for abusing its position in online web search and also slammed the company for preventing its partners from using competing search services. After the ruling, Google had said the verdict raised only “narrow concerns”, but in its plea challenging the CCI’s ruling the search giant signaled the impact could be far greater.
The order, the company said, “requires Google to change the way it conducts business in India on a lasting basis and the way it designs its search results page in India”, according to a copy of its plea which was seen exclusively by Reuters.
The CCI, among other things, had ordered Google to stop imposing restrictions on its direct search agreements with other publishers.
Allowing the CCI’s findings to be implemented “without appellate scrutiny would cause Google irreparable reputational loss”, the company said, while seeking a stay on the ruling.

808,"May 16, 2018",US: Senators ask FTC to investigate Google’s Location tracking,"
Two US senators have asked the nation’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take another look at Google’s location harvesting.
Democrat Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey fired off their request-that-can’t-be-ignored late last week, asking the FTC to “open an investigation into the potential deceptive acts and practices used by Google to track and commoditize American consumers.”.
The core of the issue is whether people who say “yes” to the location history feature in Android realise that their locations can be gathered even when Location Services are off. That’s because the GPS is only the most accurate source of location data—if a Wi-Fi hotspot is known to Google, for example, then logging into it will give the company a fairly accurate location for a device.
In the letter, the senators say, “we have significant reservations about Google’s failure to clearly account for how location data is collected and used by the company.”
Google had already replied to a previous request for this information in response to a December 2017 letter from the pair, but they remain dissatisfied, because while Google claimed all services are “opt-in,” they suspect users’ choice is too easily forced. Google is facing a similar complaint in Australia.

809,"May 14, 2018",Australia: ACCC investigating Google over user data,"
Google is being investigated by the Australian competition regulator for allegedly spying on Android phone users and having them pay for the privilege, according to a report by The Guardian.The watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is looking into claims by tech company Oracle that Android devices send to Google information on searches, what is being viewed, and location data, even if location services are turned off. Oracle also claims that the country’s millions of Android users unwittingly pay their phone providers to send the data to Google. Meanwhile, Google told Quartz that it has permission from users for all of this and that customers don’t have to foot the bill.
Oracle went to the ACCC as part of a broader inquiry into digital platforms that is looking at the impact search engines like Google and social networks such as Facebook are having on publishers, advertisers, and consumers in Australia. The inquiry launched before it was revealed that Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest the data of 50 million Facebook users without their permission, and ignited a global debate over data privacy. Facebook’s data practices are under investigation elsewhere in the world.

In a setback to Google India, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on Friday, May 11, announced the payments made by it to the parent firm Google Ireland constitute a royalty under the Indian law, as well as under the India-Ireland Double Tax Avoidance Treaty (DTAA), and therefore are subject to withholding tax.
Some tax experts estimate that Google may have to pay a tax of around Rs 400 crore following the order.
A Google spokesperson said the company would file an appeal in the high court “as this ruling is an inaccurate representation of our business operations in India.”
The company said it complies with all tax laws in India and pays all applicable taxes. “The order is also a clear departure from previous judgments on the issue and is not in line with India’s double taxation avoidance agreement,” it said.
The latest ruling came on an appeal by Google India against the decision of the Bengaluru bench of the ITAT.

News Corporation, del magnate Rupert Murdoch, acusó a Facebook y Google de llevar a cabo ”prácticas anticompetitivas” durante una investigación realizada a los gigantes tecnológicos lanzada el jueves 3 de mayo por el regulador australiano de competencia.
Un total de 57 compañías de medios, anunciantes y grupos de periodistas presentaron sus casos por cambios en las operaciones de los titanes de internet, informó la Comisión Australiana de Competencia y Consumidores (ACCC).
News Corp, el principal grupo de periódicos del país, así como su principal competidor, Fairfax Media y varias emisoras encabezaron la acusación, argumentando que el dominio de Facebook y Google sobre la publicidad digital ha minado significativamente la industria de las noticias.
“Varias plataformas digitales poseen un poder sustancial en el mercado y están aplicando prácticas anticompetitivas que impiden a editores como News Corp Australia competir bajo sus propios méritos”, dijo la compañía en un comunicado de 144 páginas.
“Estas prácticas tienen el potencial de dañar profundamente la creación, distribución y consumo de noticias y el periodismo en Australia”.
Murdoch y otros ejecutivos de la compañía, que también controla importantes medios internacionales como The Wall Street Journal y The Times of London, llevan tiempo instando a Facebook y Google para tomar pasos y ”nivelar el campo de juego”, incluyendo propuestas como pagar a las compañías de noticias por el contenido que FB y Google comparten.

Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation accused Facebook and Google of “anti-competitive practices” in one of dozens of submissions to a probe of the tech giants released Thursday, May 3, by Australia’s competition watchdog.

News Corp, the country’s main newspaper group, its main competitor Fairfax Media and commercial broadcasters led the charge in arguing that Facebook and Google’s dominance of digital advertising significantly undermined the news industry.
“A number of digital platforms possess substantial market power and are engaging in anti-competitive practices that prevent publishers such as News Corp Australia from competing on the merits,” the company said in a 144-page submission.
“These practices have the potential to profoundly damage the creation, distribution and consumption of news and journalism in Australia.”
Murdoch and other executives from the company, which also owns The Wall Street Journal and the Times of London, have long led calls for Facebook and Google to “level the playing field” and pay news companies for their content.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday, April 27, asked Google to deposit 10% of the Rs136.86 crore (US$20.5 million) penalty imposed on it by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for “infringing antitrust conduct”, while admitting the company’s appeal against the antitrust regulator’s February 7 order.
A bench headed by S.J. Mukhopadhyay further directed Google to keep displaying, as per the CCI order, a disclaimer in its Commercial Flight Unit box indicating clearly that the “search flights” link placed at the bottom leads to Google’s Flights page, and not the results aggregated by any other third-party service provider, so that users are not misled.
“NCLAT has accepted our appeal for review of aspects of the CCI decision and its associated findings,” a Google spokesperson said.
The CCI had found Google guilty of abusing of its dominant position in “Online General Web Search and Web Search Advertising Services” markets in India through practices leading to search bias and search manipulation.

814,"April 24, 2018","EU: New privacy rules to aid Google, Facebook?","
As tech corporations around the world face mounting pressure from regulatory bodies and consumers seeking more control over their online privacy, new regulation from the European Union could actually serve to strengthen America’s most powerful data-driven advertising businesses, especially in relation to smaller ad tech companies with less-known brands or that don’t have relationships with end-users, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Silicon Valley digital giant Facebook, which has seen its shares weighed down by investor fears over more regulation following a series of scandals regarding its use and protection of troves of consumer data, is seen as gaining its lead against smaller names when Europe’s sweeping new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is enacted next month. 
Brussels wants its new GDPR to stop tech giants and their partners from pressuring consumers to relinquish control of their data in exchange for services. The EU would like to set an example for legislation around the world. But some of the restrictions are having an unintended consequence: reinforcing the duopoly of Facebook and Alphabet’s Google, reported the WSJ.

815,"April 17, 2018",South Korea: KFTC investigates Google Play over marketplace abuse,"
Google Play is currently under investigation by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). It appears the ubiquitous marketplace could have been abusing its position to pressure game developers to launch their games exclusively on the Google Play platform. With allegations on the horizon, the KFTC has to do its due diligence and investigate said claims.
The Korea Herald reported that the KFTC has been interviewing mobile game studios in a bid to determine if there’s any truth to the claims levied against Google Play. The organization has been asking specifically if Google asked them to either “launch their games only through specific app marketplaces” or to “not launch their games via other app marketplaces.” Neither is an acceptable practice, so this is likely going to produce some interesting results when the surveys are completed.
For South Korea, where more than 90% of the population uses mobile devices running on Google’s Android operating system, Google Play dominates the app marketplace ecosystem.
Apple’s App Store accounted for 24.5%, while One Store, jointly operated by Korea’s three carriers SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus and portal website operator Naver, accounted for 11.6%, according to the report.
The KFTC’s investigation came after major mobile games, including NCSoft’s “Lineage M” and Netmarble Games’ “Lineage 2 Revolution”, were launched in Korea last year via Google Play and Apple’s App Store, but not One Store.

Europe’s top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager, has made it her mission to stem alleged anti-competitive abuses by big American tech companies, threatening as recently as last month to break up Alphabe Google, reported Reuters.
But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google – this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Android-powered smartphones – is likely to show just how difficult it is, even for a committed trust-buster like Vestager, to dent the power of the U.S. giants.
The final ruling, expected within the next few months, will likely involve a multi-billion-dollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps, people familiar with the European Commission’s thinking say.
The decision, which is expected to hew closely to recommendations made in 2016 soon after the probe began, will almost certainly leave Google’s market dominance intact because the incentives to stick with the company are so strong, say industry executives, analysts and even its foes.
Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft’s mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital, said it was “virtually impossible” that any EU penalty would “change anything massively for Google.”

Search giant Google has decided to appeal against a judgement from India’s competition watchdog that found it guilty of “search bias.” The company has now filed an appeal with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), reports Reuters.
The report quotes sources claiming that Google filed the appeal with NCLAT on Monday, April 9. The appeal comes after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a fine of Rs 1.36 billion (US$20.95 million) on the search giant back in February. The top watchdog said Google abused its dominance in the online web search, and online search advertising markets. Google has not directly offered a comment on its appeal.
However, a CCI official has said that its judgement was “robust”, and it plans to defend its verdict at the NCLAT. “Google was found to be indulging in practices of search bias and by doing so, it causes harm to its competitors as well as to users,” the CCI said in its 190-page judgment.

818,"March 27, 2018",US: Appeals court hands Oracle victory over Google in copyright case,"
A US appeals court on Tuesday resurrected a multi-billion dollar copyright case brought by Oracle against Google.
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Google’s use of Oracle’s Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, reversing a 2016 jury verdict.
The court sent the case back to a U.S. judge in San Francisco for a trial to determine how much compensation Google owes Oracle. Oracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages.
The dispute, which could have far-reaching implications for the entire software industry, has divided Silicon Valley for years between those who develop the code that makes software steps function and those who develop software programs and say their “fair use” of the code is an exception to copyright law.
“It’s a momentous decision on the issue of fair use,” lawyer Mark Schonfeld of Burns & Levinson in Boston, who’s been following the case and isn’t involved. “It is very, very important for the software industry. I think it’s going to go to the Supreme Courtbecause the Federal Circuit has made a very controversial decision.”

819,"March 26, 2018",EU: Competition chief holds threat of breaking up Google,"
The EU’s antitrust head Margrethe Vestager won’t rule out breaking up Google, saying the EU has “grave suspicions” about its dominance in Internet search.
Reuters, citing comments Vestager made to the UK’s Telegraph, reported Vestager said the ability to break Google up has to remain a real threat. The comments come as Google faces new rules from the European Union on its practices with small businesses that use Google services. Meanwhile, Reuters noted that in 2017, the antitrust head said that additional cases against the Internet search giant were likely to happen. Those comments come months after the European Commission (EC) levied Google with a record US$2.97 billion fine and told it to no longer favor its shopping service over others. In June the EC determined that Google cooked its search results so as to benefit its own shopping services—and disadvantage the services of others. Apart from the hefty fine, the EC gave Google 90 days to “stop its illegal conduct” and offer other price comparison services the chance to compete on a balanced playing field.
The EC is also currently creating new regulations for eCommerce, app stores and search engines. The idea behind the new rules is to get the companies to be more transparent about how they rank and list results and why some services get delisted and others don’t. The proposal would mandate tech firms such as eBay to disclose how they determine rankings and how algorithms are deployed, described generally (the algorithms themselves will not be explicitly disclosed). Any changes in terms and conditions must be announced 15 days prior to implementation, and the smaller firms must be given “individualized” descriptions of reasons for suspension or delisting. The proposal is set to be published next month and then must be approved by the European Parliament and by national governments, said Reuters.

821,"March 14, 2018",US: Google to bans cryptocurrency ads,"
Alphabet’s Google has decided not to run any ads for cryptocurrencies as part of its efforts to clamp down on advertisements that run afoul of its policies.
First spotted by Reuters in a post, the company said the new policy kicks off in June and bans ads for things like binary options, cryptocurrencies and related content and financial spread betting, among other things. The move comes as cryptocurrencies have garnered a lot of attention, even with regular investors. With wild price swings, governments around the world have been warning about the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.
Separately, Scott Spencer—Director of Sustainable Ads at Google, said in blog post that in 2017, the company removed more than 3.2 billion ads that violated its advertising policies, amounting to more than 100 bad ads per second. “This means we’re able to block the majority of bad ad experiences, like malvertising and phishing scams, before the scams impact people,” wrote Spencer. “We blocked 79 million ads in our network for attempting to send people to malware-laden sites and removed 400,000 of these unsafe sites last year. And, we removed 66 million ‘trick-to-click’ ads as well as 48 million ads that were attempting to get users to install unwanted software.”
What’s more, Spencer said that last year Google removed 320,000 publishers from its ad network for violating publisher policies and blacklisted close to 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile apps. He said the company also rolled out technology that helps protect advertisers by removing Google ads from individual pages on websites that violate its policies and as a result were able to remove 2 million pages each month. Spencer noted that after Google expanded its content policy in April, it removed Google ads from 8,700 pages. “We’re constantly updating our policies as we see new threats emerge. Last year, we added 28 new advertiser policies and 20 new publisher policies to combat new threats and improve the ads experience online. This year, we updated several policies to address ads in unregulated or speculative financial products like binary options, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange markets and contracts for difference (or CFDs),” wrote Spencer. “We also updated our gambling ads policies to address new methods of gambling with items that have real-world value (e.g., skins gambling). And we will introduce a new certification process for rehabilitation facilities, allowing legitimate addiction treatment centers to connect with people in need. Our work to protect the ads ecosystem doesn’t stop here—it’s ongoing.”

Why the Government Shouldn’t Break Up Google
By Andrea O’Sullivan
Has Google’s market dominance been a net negative for consumers and innovation—and should government antitrust regulators intervene?
Historically, Google’s algorithymic innovation fueled the profitable development of ad-based internet monetization and enabled Google to invest in breakthroughs in mapping, messaging, email, smartphone, and artificial intelligence technology. If something was hot in Silicon Valley, Google probably had something to do with it, or they soon acquired the firm that did.
What was once revolutionary eventually became common technology. Now, every day, hundreds of millions of satisfied internet users enjoy a handful of free Google services that improve their lives without even really thinking about them.

Google should be hit with further sanctions because last year’s US$2.6 billion EU fine has done nothing to improve competition, the search giant’s opponents have claimed.
Nineteen companies and organisations, several of which launched the complaints that led to last year’s record antitrust penalty, have signed an open letter to Europe’s Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.
They say that the changes introduced to Google’s search results since the fine have been “ineffective” and claim that consumers and competition continue to suffer. If the Commission agrees with the complainants, the company faces further multi-billion euro fines.
The EU fined Google €2.4bn (US$2.7 billion at the time) last June after a seven-year antitrust investigation, with complainants saying it was exploiting its search monopoly to promote its online shopping service, at the expense of price comparison websites.
As well as paying the fine, in September Google introduced its own “remedy” that allowed other companies to bid against its own shopping service for the prominent advertising slots when shoppers search for items such as televisions, sunglasses and handbags.

In a broad-ranging inquiry into the impactof digital platforms, such as Google and Facebook, who have up-ended advertising markets across the world, the (ACCC) is calling for submissions from a range of media players, new and old, by April 3.
“While these technological changes have brought many benefits for consumers, this inquiry will have a particular focus on examining whether the changes affect the quality and range of news supplied to Australian consumers,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.
The wide-ranging inquiry will also look into how the tech giants use algorithms to present news and whether users truly “understand what data is being collected about them” as well as how it’s used.
According to the ACCC head, one of the inquiry’s main goals is to make the tech giants more transparent.
“Our aim is also to understand better the digital platforms’ business models and how they operate behind the scenes, and the evolving nature of the way consumers search for and receive news in Australia,” Sims said.

In merger cases involving the big platform operators, the EU Commission has difficulties to analyze markets properly. The joint venture of Sanofi and Google illustrates the shifts taking place in the economy. In particular, producing companies lose the customer interface where a platform squeezes in. Traditional competition law tools do not get the gist of such cases. The integration of markets through digitalization cannot be analyzed with a narrow market definition approach. Access to data and financial means need to be seen as key for market power analysis. Data portability, a remedy the Commission relies on, is a second-best solution only.

Two of the world’s largest tech companies control a nonprofit group that is the main complainant in a landmark European antitrust inquiry against Google reported Politico. Oracle and Naspers, two of the world’s largest tech companies, control a nonprofit group that is the main complainant in a landmark European antitrust inquiry against Google, according to documents obtained by Politico.
The two companies hold legal authority over FairSearch, an organization that filed the first antitrust complaint in 2013 against Google’s Android mobile operating system, according to regulatory filings with Belgian authorities. FairSearch says it represents Google rivals concerned with the search giant’s alleged illegal conduct in Europe. But records filed with Belgian authorities indicate that, in fact, executives from Oracle and Naspers are the group’s only members with legal authority over its activities.
None of the other FairSearch members, including several small European tech startups, have official voting rights over the group’s actions, which include hiring some of Brussels’ best-known legal advisers and lobbyists as part of the organization’s anti-Google campaign.
Oracle and Naspers’ exclusive control of FairSearch raises questions about the transparency of EU lobbying and highlights the risk that competition investigations can be taken hostage by warring corporate interests.

The European Commission is investigating whether Google has done enough to resolve concerns that led to a €2.42 billion (at the time, US$2.7 billion) antitrust sanction in June, sending rival sites a list of questions to see if they benefited from the search giant’s remedies.
The online newspaper Politico acquired a questionnaire indicating that Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s competition boss, could be preparing for a new assault against Google, raising the prospect of further fines.
Google’s rivals argue that the response to a June verdict concerning its Google Shopping service fell far short of re-establishing fair competition in the EU.
To level the playing field, they claim that Vestager should use her powers to hit the company with fines for non-compliance that could potentially go up to €12 million (US$14.9 million) a day. Backdated to end-September, when Google was meant to comply, that could mean a total fine of up to €1.6 billion (US$2 billion).
The EC wants copies of agreements between price comparison websites and their five largest merchants in each country where they operate, as well as detailed information on pricing.
The regulator also wants to know how much feedback Google provides when rejecting bids to place ads, and how much data it shares about the performance of ads that are displayed.

February 2018

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
Google Shopping: beware of ‘self-favouring’ in a world of algorithmic nudging By Nicolo Zingales (Sussex Law School)1
Introduction
On 27 June 2017, the European Commission closed its investigation in the Google Shopping case. It found a breach of article 102 TFEU in relation to Google’s “more favourable positioning and display of its own comparison shopping service compared to competing comparison shopping services” (hereinafter, “the conduct”).2 The Commission’s Decision is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it constitutes the first application of the leveraging theory in an algorithmic context, where as a result of certain algorithmic design choices3 a dominant undertaking systematically directs (“nudges”) consumers towards its own goods or services in a secondary market. Google apparently did not see it coming, as it argued both in the proceedings before the European Commission and in the appeal it lodged against the Decision4> that the Commission used a novel theory of abuse, and therefore in accordance with its previous practice should not have imposed a fine. However, the Commission rejected this argument, noting that it had already used a self-favouring theory to establish abuse in a number of cases.5 It therefore imposed a fine of almost 2.5 billion euros and ordered Google to take a...

829,"February 12, 2018",India: Autoridad de competencia multa a Google por abuso de dominio,"
El regulador antimonopolio de la India ha impuesto una multa de 1.36 mil millones de rupias (US$21.17 millones) a Google por “sesgo de búsqueda” y abuso de su posición dominante, representando el más reciente revés regulatorio para el buscador de Internet más popular del mundo.
El regulador ha estado investigando a Google desde 2012 cuando un sitio web llamado Matrimony.com y Consumer Unity & Trust Society presentaron una queja respecto a las prácticas de Google, argumentando que el gigante tecnológico ha manipulado los resultados de búsqueda para promocionar sus propios servicios y los de sus socios.
La orden del regulador es el más reciente revés en temas de competencia para Google. El año pasado, la Comisión Europea impuso una multa récord de €2.4 mil millones (US$3 mil millones) a la compañía por favorecer su servicio de compras y degradar ofertas rivales. Google ha apelado contra la multa del regulador asiático.

830,"February 11, 2018","After antitrust suit Google, Getty from alliance.","
Photography and artwork from Getty Images can be seen across the web on everything from news sources to corporate websites. Google has now signed an agreement with Getty Imagesfor a global multi-year partnership that will allow Google to use Getty images content throughout its array of products and services.
According to Google’s engineering director Cathy Edwards, changes will be made effective immediately to begin using content sourced from Getty Images. As part of the deal, Google will help improve attribution given to contributors that generate content for Getty Images. Having a client with as much reach as Google can certainly help build brand awareness.
For everyday users of Google products, the changes may not be immediately obvious. Over time, Google may decide to start implementing more artwork and professional photography since it has just gained the right to access and use millions of new images.
Although Google now has significantly more content at its disposal, don’t expect more free images to show up in search. Searching for images via Google will find plenty of Getty Images’ photographs, but a license must be purchased before the full size image can be used. Even though Google has signed a licensing agreement for use of images, it is unlikely that the agreement allows display of protected works outside of specific products.

831,"February 8, 2018",India: Antitrust watchdog fines Google for abusing dominant position,"
India’s antitrust watchdog on Thursday, February 8, imposed a 1.36 billion rupees (US $21.17 million) fine on Google for “search bias” and abuse of its dominant position, in the latest regulatory setback for the world’s most popular internet search engine, reported the Washington Post.
The regulator has been investigating Google since 2012 when a website called Matrimony.com and the Consumer Unity &Trust Society complained about Google’s practices.
According to the complaints, Google manipulated search results to promote its own and partner services.
The Indian watchdog’s order is the latest antitrust setback for Google. Last year, The European Commission imposed a record €2.4 billion  ($3 billion) fine on the company for favoring its shopping service and demoting rival offerings. Google has appealed against the order.

832,"January 30, 2018",EU: Google rivals insist on tougher penalties from EC,"
According to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, January 29, Google submitted the first of regular reports to EU authorities on its remedy measures. Should the EU find Google’s remedies don’t adhere to its decision, it could impose fines as high as 5% of the company’s global daily revenues for each day Google doesn’t comply.
Competitors point to several reasons why they want the remedy changed. Some say they have higher fixed costs than Google, making it harder to match Google’s bids. Others complain that ads they place via Google click directly through to their clients’ websites, rather than their price-comparison engine, depriving competitors of a chance to add value and woo internet users.
Some rivals also allege Google has continued to demote their websites in its general search results since the EU decision, which also alleged such demotions. Kelkoo CEO Richard Stables says the firm’s revenue from general search traffic dropped by 62% last year, to €2.3 million (US$2.9 million). In 2018, he projects a two-thirds drop to €800,000 (US$992,329).
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a December interview that the shopping case will “remain on our working desks for some time” and that she and her team were “getting wiser by the day” about Google’s measures.

On Monday, January 7, Israel’s antitrust regulator said it will look at the business practices of internet giants such as Facebook and Google to make sure they are not stifling competition, according to Reuters.
“We will look closely at the activity of the internet giants to see whether they are abusing their power and breaching the Anti-Trust Authority’s rules,” the head of the authority, Michal Halperin, told parliament’s Economic Affairs Committee.
“The big internet companies, such as Google and Facebook have a sufficient presence in Israel in terms of antitrust laws … the law applies to them even if they are not registered in Israel,” Halperin said.
According to Reuters, the authority will examine whether such companies were misusing their advantages in order to push other players out and monopolize the market, she said.
Representatives for Facebook and Google who were at the meeting said they were law abiding and provided a platform for Israeli businesses to thrive.
Israel’s traditional media market faces a crisis in the digital age as advertising shrinks and revenues fall. Google and Facebook take an estimated 80% of advertising revenues in Israel of between US$436 million and US$494 million a year.

The lobbying group representing major internet players like Amazon, Netflix, and Google said it plans to join the legal battle over the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) move last month to repeal net neutrality.
The Internet Association (IA) said it would act as an “intervenor” in expected litigation over the FCC’s action. What that means is that the group wouldn’t be filing its own lawsuit, but would join a legal action filed by others. Public interest groups and some state attorneys general have said they intend to challenge the repeal in court.
“The final version of Chairman Pai’s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers,” Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, said in a statement. “This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet. IA intends to act as an intervenor in judicial action against this order and, along with our member companies, will continue our push to restore strong, enforceable net neutrality protections through a legislative solution.”
The FCC, in a 3-2 party-line vote, repealed rules that ban internet providers from blocking or throttling content, or from creating “fast lanes” that would be for sale to sites that want speedier access to consumers. They left in place rules that require that ISPs disclose how they handle internet traffic.
The FCC posted the final text version of its action earlier this week, and it is expected to enter the Federal Register in the coming weeks.

Inc., también determinaron el tamaño de la multa.
La multa, impuesta en junio, fue de más del doble de una multa anterior de mil millones de euros para Intel y venía acompañada de la amenaza de más multas diarias para Google si no cumplía con una orden de ofrecer igual trato a los servicios rivales de comparación de precios. Las grandes cifras para los grandes nombres de la tecnología han sido un tema para la Comisionada de Competencia de la UE, Margrethe Vestager, quien ordenó a Apple Inc pagar unos 13 mil millones de euros en impuestos el año pasado.

In the document the EU explained “the need to ensure that the fine has a sufficiently deterrent effect not only on Google and Alphabet but also on undertakings of a similar size and with similar resources,” The “particularly large” revenue of Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc., also determined the size of the fine.
The penalty, levied in June, was more than double an earlier 1 billion-euro fine on Intel and came with a threat of more daily fines for Google if it didn’t comply with an order to offer equal treatment to rival shopping-comparison services. Big numbers for big technology names have been a theme for EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who ordered Apple Inc to pay back some 13 billion euros in taxes last year.

Axel Springer, the largest digital publishing house in Europe, is joining the News Media Alliance, a trade group which represents and lobbies on behalf of the print and digital news industry. It is the first time a non-American publisher is joining the alliance, which will benefit from having a vocal and powerful partner as media companies wrangle with how to survive in the digital age. 
“For us, it’s a new beginning of working on political matters in the United States and it’s very important that different publishers … are defining their interests toward search engines and news aggregators so we compete on a level playing field and to get a value chain that helps both sides to survive,” said Dietrich von Klaeden, Axel Springer’s senior vice president for public affairs. 
The news publishing business used to be highly defined by geography, but as internet and social media companies continue to serve users across the globe, the News Media Alliance and Axel Springer said they, too, shouldn’t be bound by borders.
News Media Alliance president David Chavern said in an interview that having Axel Springer on board will bring expertise in their fight for ad dollars with Facebook and Google, which according to several estimates, take up more than three quarters of online digital advertising money. Axel Springer is the largest digital publisher in Europe and owns some of the biggest German papers like Bild and Die Welt. Axel Springer is also partnered with POLITICO Europe and owns the US-based website, Business Insider.

A report from Haaretz on Monday, December 11, stated that Google is facing scrutiny by Israel’s antitrust agency following a complaint from video advertising platform Artimedia.
“For the first time ever, Google has come into the crosshairs of Israel’s Antitrust Authority, which has begun examining the implications of its dominance of the internet advertising market as a possible restraint of trade,” reported Haaretz on Monday. “The authority, which confirmed it has begun looking into the matter, has until now refrained from doing so because it never received an official complaint nor has it found any indication that the law was violated.”
“As a result, Google has never been declared a monopoly nor have any restraints been placed on its ad business,” they explained, adding, “Now, however, Artimedia, an Israeli platform for video advertising has filed a complaint.”
The complaint argues that Google’s advertising services “illustrate Google’s tremendous conglomerate power, which extends across the digital advertising continuum in all its forms.”

With Broadcom’s Qualcomm buyout offer, Microsoft and Google have expressed private concerns over the potential purchase. That is, at least according to sources close to the matter. Both companies — along with other unnamed tech companies – have expressed several concerns.
The first concern is the possible influence Apple may have over the deal. The second concern revolves around Broadcom’s reputation for cutting costs over investing in upcoming technology. So far, a Qualcomm buyout hasn’t come to fruition as Qualcomm hopes to get more out of Broadcom.
Qualcomm has recently rejected Broadcom’s offers. The company has since nominated a new board of directors earlier this week. Broadcom has even considered boosting its offer. Though, the Snapdragon chip maker has expressed antitrust concerns. Even so, Qualcomm has asked Google and Microsoft — among other tech companies — to keep their concerns private.
Of course, there’s a possibility that Apple will benefit greatly from the Qualcomm buyout. Qualcomm currently provides chips for both the iPhone and iPad. Though, legal battles between Qualcomm and the Cupertino company have strained the relationship. Broadcom chief Hock Tan has expressed a positive outlook moving forward if his company buys Qualcomm.

We take that very seriously. The point of a decision is that it should work,” she told a news conference.  “This is a case that will remain on our working desk.”
Google, the world’s most popular Internet search engine said it would subject its own shopping service to the same criteria as rivals, mainly by giving them the opportunity to bid for ads at the top of a search page. Competitors have criticised the proposal, saying they do not have Google’s financial clout to bid for the top advertising spots.
Failure to address the Commission’s concerns could expose Google to fines up to 5% of its average daily worldwide turnover.

The Australian government said Monday, December 4, that it would open an inquiry into Facebook and Google and their impact on the media industries.
The move was announced by the Australian Consumer & Competition Commission (ACCC). It follows a revamp of media laws in September this year.
The ACCC said that it would look at “the impact digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms are having on competition in media and advertising services markets.” A preliminary report will be published early December 2018, with a final report due early June 2019.
“The ACCC will look closely at longer-term trends and the effect of technological change on competition in media and advertising,” Rod Sims, the ACCC chairman, said. “We will also consider the impact of information asymmetry between digital platform providers and advertisers and consumers.”
The probe comes as several traditional Australian media companies, especially in the print and television sectors, have witnessed declines in advertising revenue. Hemorrhaging cash, the free-to-air Ten Network recently went into administration and was subsequently bought at a distress price by CBS.

How Google Perceives Customer Privacy, Cyber, E-Commerce, Political and Regulatory Compliance Risks
By Lawrence J. Trautman (Western Carolina University)
Abstract:     By now, almost every business has an internet presence. What are the major risks perceived by those engaged in the universe of Internet businesses? What potential risks, if they become reality, may cause substantial increases in operating costs or threaten the very survival of the enterprise?
This article discusses the relevant annual report disclosures from Alphabet Inc. (parent of Google), along with other Google documents, as a potentially powerful teaching device. Most of the descriptive language to follow is excerpted directly from Alphabet’s (Google) regulatory filings. My additions about these entities include weaving their disclosure materials into a logical presentation and providing supplemental sources for those who desire a deeper look (usually in my footnotes) at any particular aspect. I’ve sought to present a roadmap with these materials that shows Google’s struggle to optimize their business performance while navigating through a complicated maze of regulatory compliance concerns and issues involving governmental jurisdictions throughout the world. International cyber crime and risk issues follow, with an examination of anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist, and other potential illegal activity laws.
The value proposition offered here is disarmingly simple — at no out-of-pocket cost, the reader has an opportunity to invest probably just a few hours to read and reflect upon the Alphabet Inc. (Google) multiple-million-dollar research, investment and documentation of perceived Internet, e-commerce, cyber, IT, and electronic payment system risks. Hopefully, this will prove of value to those either interested in the rapidly changing dynamics of (1) electronic payment systems, (2) those engaged in Internet site operations, or (3) those engaged in fighting cyber crime activities.

“When a company has access to as much consumer information as Google does, it’s my duty to ensure they are using it appropriately,” said Hawley, a Republican who is mounting a campaign for US Senate. “I will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.”
Hawley’s investigation also will look at whether Google has misappropriated content from competitors. Yelp wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission in September contending that Google has violated a 2012 settlement by allegedly scraping photos from Yelp reviews for its own search results.

La UE se prepara para multar a Google por su imperio publicitario multimillonario. La investigación de alto perfil sobre su sistema operativo Android continuará hasta el próximo año.
La Comisionada europea de la competencia, Margrethe Vestager, se está preparando para golpear al gigante informático con una multa antimonopolio por su sistema AdSense, su poderosa red publicitaria. Se espera una decisión al respecto en las próximas semanas.
Será la segunda multa en menos de un año, luego de que se ordenara a Google pagar €2,400 millones de euros ($2,100 millones de dólares) en junio por abusar de su posición dominante como herramienta de búsqueda en Internet para promocionar su servicio de compras en línea.
Se espera que la Comisión Europea multará a Google por su software móvil Android este año, pero según fuentes de Bruselas, la investigación ha quedado relegada ya que los funcionarios de la UE deben sortear diversas rondas de proceso y diligencia, por lo que es probable que la reunión se posponga hasta el próximo año.
Por ahora, será más probable ver una multa por abuso de dominio contra AdSense, la red de anuncios administrada por Google que aparece en otros sitios web. La Comisión alega que los contratos de Google con otros sitios web han violado la ley de competencia impidiéndoles utilizar las redes publicitarias de otras empresas dentro de los resultados de búsqueda de esos sitios web.

The EU is preparing to fine Google over its multi-billion dollar advertising empire as a high-profile investigation into its Android operating system is pushed back to next year.
Europe’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is gearing up to hit the web giant with an antitrust penalty over AdSense, its powerful advertising network, with a decision expected in the next few weeks.
It will be the second fine in less than a year, after Google was ordered to pay €2.4 billion (US$2.1 billion) in June for abusing its internet search monopoly to promote its online shopping service.
The European Commission was expected to fine Google over its Android mobile software this year, but according to Brussels sources the investigation has taken a back seat as EU officials go through extra rounds of due diligence, and is now likely to run into next year.
A fine for abusing the dominance of AdSense, the Google-run network of adverts that appear on other websites, is now likely to come first. The Commission alleges that Google’s contracts with other websites broke competition law by preventing them from using other firms’ advertising networks within those websites’ search results.

The European Union on Monday denounced the “shocking” revelations on the way top companies and dignitaries. EU finance ministers meeting for regular talks in Brussels will discuss tax avoidance on Tuesday after a trove of leaked documents exposed the great lengths to which the global elite will go to avert paying a fair tax.
The findings have emerged as part of the Paradise Papers released late Sunday by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which was behind the similar Panama Papers made public last year.
EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager, who has cracked down on EU countries making illegal tax breaks to Apple and Amazon, lauded the journalists who made the latest revelations.
“Congratulations and thanks to ICIJ for all the work done on Paradise Papers. It enables the work against tax avoidance, for transparency,” said Vestager in a tweet.
Also this week in a conference in Lisbon, Vestager hit out at technology companies for undermining democracy and allowing “fear” and “greed” to drive anti-competitive behavior. Ms Vestager singled out Google, Facebook and Apple for cutting corners and distorting competition by abusing their market dominance.
“We want free markets but we understand the paradox of free markets which is that sometimes we have to intervene. We have to believe that it’s not the law of the jungle but the law of democracy that works.” Vestager said.
“The motives that are breaching competition law are as old as Adam and Eve,” Ms Vestager said. “It’s about greed. Fear. And when you combine that with power you get a very poisonous cocktail.” she added.

7 years ago, Google bought airline data company ITA. The US Department of Justice cleared the deal with the condition that Google open the data to others for five years. This week, Google removed some companies’ access to ITA’s data, specifically, by discontinuing a service called QPX Express, a small business service. Google will continue to offer data to large customers.
The move has received criticism from entrepreneurs and antitrust watchdogs, who see it as further proof of Google parent company Alphabet’s outsized power.
On one website, Hacker News, in a message board frequented by startups, founders complained about the lack of an affordable, reliable data feed and the perils of relying on a tech giant to do business.
In a statement, a Google spokesperson said the company cancelled the small-business offering “given the low interest among our travel partners.”

The Bloomberg report further noted that “Google contends that a fine “was not warranted” on grounds that the European Commission put forward a novel theory and previously signaled the case could be solved without a financial penalty by initially seeking an amicable solution with the Alphabet unit.”
The details of Google’s court appeal at the EU’s Luxembourg-based General Court were revealed Monday in the bloc’s Official Journal.
Google also said in its appeal that the Commission “fails to take proper account of the competitive constraint exercised by merchant platforms” in its decision to fine the Mountain View, California-based firm for abusing its market power to edge out smaller shopping search rivals.

Facebook, Google and Twitter have a lot at stake when they show up in Washington on November 1 to testify at congressional hearings about the role their technologies played in Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential elections.
To face the lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees that day, the internet companies are sending in their legal muscle: the general counsels. That way, the companies avoid putting their chief executives — Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Google — in the spotlight to deal with questions and the full-blown public relations crisis over whether they are contributing to an undermining of democracy.

If the promise of mobile payments is speed and convenience, delivering on the promise – and turning it into practice – is a bit tougher.
Small screen, small window of time to get the transaction done. Session timeouts? You’ve had ‘em, no doubt, perhaps fumbling through passwords and shipping address details. The idea of commerce anytime, anywhere may give way to frustration anytime, anywhere.
To that end, Google said Monday that online checkout is going to get a bit speedier. The concept, rather simply, is: Google as mobile wallet.

857,"October 15, 2017",US: Democrat asks FTC to make Google probe file public,"
Representative Keith Ellison has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to release the complete findings and analysis from the Commission’s Google investigation, which concluded in 2013 without any findings of antitrust violations.
“We write to request the Federal Trade Commission make public the reports by the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Economics documenting the complete findings and analysis in the Google antitrust investigation that concluded in 2013.” His letter last week to Acting Chair Olhausen said.
While the FTC did not find any reason to crack down, Ellison points out that in June, the European Union fined Google a record US$2.7 billion for violating EU antitrust rules, saying it had “abused its market dominance in search” and gave “illegal advantage” to its own comparison shopping service over competitors.
Ellison wants the documents by November 30.

Open web content distribution firm, Relay Media, has been acquired by Google as the search giant looks to improve mobile web page speed.
Importantly, the move will equip Google with Relay Media’s accelerated mobile pages (AMP) converter technology, and a platform to enhance speed and overall experience.
Google’s AMP is the focus of the Relay AMP converter, making its direct integration a logical move for overall, core improvements.
Details of the deal have not yet been disclosed, with Google remaining quiet regarding the announcement so far.
Relay Media made the situation clear on its homepage, it said: “We’re excited to announce that Google has acquired Relay Media’s AMP Converter technology… Service for current customers will continue uninterrupted as we transition the Relay Media AMP Converter to Google’s infrastructure. We’re pausing new publisher on boarding as we focus on the integration effort.”

Google critic takes on tech giants
By Harper Neidig
Barry Lynn has been pushing the government to crack down on corporate power for 16 years, but his ideas never received as much attention as when they cost him his job at a Google-sponsored think tank.
After parting ways with New America over the summer, Lynn has launched a new independent group to raise awareness about the threats posed by corporate giants.
Lawmakers are increasingly willing to confront tech leaders on a growing list of issues, and Lynn’s transition comes as authorities are investigating whether Russians used Google, Facebook and Twitter to sow division during last year’s election.
“I think people are understanding just how poorly structured these institutions are, how sloppily they were built,” Lynn tells The Hill. “It’s not just a matter of the fact that these people have too much power, it’s also that they are sloppy in the use of their power.”
Lynn’s argument found the spotlight in August, when The New York Times reported that he and his Open Markets team had been ousted from New America after clashing with Anne-Marie Slaughter, the think tank’s president. Slaughter was angry about a statement Lynn had issued praising the European Union’s decision to hit Google with a record $2.83 billion fine for antitrust violations.
According to the Times, Google, one of the think tank’s biggest funders, had complained to Slaughter about the statement, leading to her firing Lynn and his team of scholars. Slaughter has disputed the Times story, insisting that the decision to part ways with Open Markets had nothing to do with Google.

860,"October 2, 2017",US: Google drops “first click free”,"
Google will try to help newspapers and other publishers boost subscriptions by ending a decade-old policy that required them to provide a limited amount of free content before people were asked to pay for it.
The “first click free” policy at the world’s biggest search engine was loathed by publishers because while the stories, videos and images appearing on Google have been free for its users, it is expensive to produce.
Publishers had been required to provide at least three free items under the search engine’s previous policy.
Publishers will now be allowed to decide how many, if any, free articles they want to offer readers before charging a fee, Richard Gingras, vice president of news at Google Inc., wrote Monday, October 2, in a company blog post.
For people who intentionally sought to skirt paywalls, the policy allowed readers to type a headline into Google and get free access to a story without having it count against a monthly free article limit, said Kinsey Wilson, an adviser to New York Times CEO Mark Thompson.

Un grupo de ejecutivos de las empresas Facebook, Google y Twitter han sido invitados a testificar ante el Congreso de Estados Unidos mientras legisladores continúan investigando la supuesta interferencia del gobierno de Rusia en las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, informaron fuentes dentro del comité.
El comité de inteligencia del Senado habría llamado a los ejecutivos a testificar en una audiencia pública el 1 de noviembre de 2017.
“Durante el mes entrante celebraremos una audiencia abierta con representantes de varias empresas de tecnología para entender mejor cómo Rusia utilizó herramientas y plataformas en línea para sembrar la discordia e influir en nuestras elecciones”, dijo Adam Schiff, representante demócrata del comité, junto al representante republicano Mike Conaway.
Aunque los representantes no especificaron qué compañías de tecnología serían convocadas, Facebook y Google confirmaron que habían recibido invitaciones del comité del Senado.
El miércoles, Donald Trump publicó un tweet acusando a Facebook de ser siempre “anti-Trump”, agregando que las redes de televisión y publicaciones como The New York Times y el Washington Post también han sido anti-Trump.
“Pero la gente era Pro-Trump! Virtualmente ningún presidente ha logrado lo que hemos logrado en los primeros 9 meses y la economía rugiendo “, agregó.
El fundador y líder de Facebook Mark Zuckerberg respondió posteriormente a los tweets de Trump en forma de un post en Facebook, diciendo que tanto Trump como los liberales están acusando al gigante de los medios sociales de influir en los resultados electorales.
“Ambas partes están molestas por las ideas y el contenido que no les gusta. Eso es lo que es el tener una plataforma abierta a todas las ideas “, dijo Zuckerberg en el post.
Facebook dijo la semana pasada que entregará al Congreso de los Estados Unidos todos los anuncios vinculados a Rusia que podrían haber tenido la intención de influir en las elecciones de 2016 en Estados Unidos.
A principios de esta semana, Roskomnadzor, agencia reguladora de las comunicaciones en Rusia, dijo que bloqueará el acceso a Facebook el próximo año si el gigante de las redes sociales no cumple con una ley que exige que los sitios web almacenen datos personales de ciudadanos rusos en servidores rusos.

Executives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been asked to testify to the United States Congress as lawmakers continue to investigate Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election, committee sources have said on Wednesday, September 27.
The Senate intelligence committee asked that the executives testify at a public hearing on November 1, 2017.
“In the coming month, we will hold an open hearing with representatives from tech companies in order to better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election,” the committee’s Democrat representative Adam Schiff and Republican representative Mike Conaway said.
While the representatives did not specify which technology companies would be testifying, Facebook and Google confirmed they had received invitations from the Senate committee.
Early Wednesday, Trump posted a tweet accusing Facebook of always being “anti-Trump”, adding that television networks and publications such as The New York Times and the Washington Post, have also been anti-Trump.
“But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring,” he added.
Facebook founder and frontman Mark Zuckerberg subsequently responded to Trump’s tweets in the form of a Facebook post, saying both Trump and liberals are accusing the social media giant of influencing election results.
“Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like. That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like,” Zuckerberg said in the post.
Facebook last week said it will turn over to the US Congress Russian-linked ads that may have been intended to sway the 2016 US election.
Earlier this week, Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it will block access to Facebook next year if the social media giant does not comply with a law requiring websites to store personal data of Russian citizens on Russian servers.

863,"September 27, 2017",EU: “We will ‘actively’ watch Google’s remedies” says Vestager,"
European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said on Wednesday (27 September) that the institution would “actively monitor” a set of remedies proposed by Google to open up its shopping service to competitors as from tomorrow.
Google will have to submit a report to inform the Commission about how they are implementing the decision. The first report is due early next year, and the company will continue producing reports for a period of five years.
The Danish Commissioner did not confirm whether she was happy with the solutions proposed by the ‘tech’ giant.
She insisted on the importance of Google fully applying the remedies communicated to the EU executive last month. “It is for Google to show that they will do it, and we will monitor it actively,” the commissioner said.
The EU executive accused Google last June of abusing its dominant position by giving “illegal advantage” to its comparison web service (Google Shopping) in search results.

864,"September 26, 2017",EU: Google to create new unit for shopping service to avoid more fines,"
Alphabet’s Google unit later this week will make its shopping service a stand-alone business within Google’s operations and require it to bid against other sites for ad placement at the top of search results, says a person familiar with the company’s plans.
The company is making the change to try and satisfy European antitrust regulators and avoid further fines, said a person who requested anonymity in exchange for details about the plan. The plan was previously reported by Bloomberg.
The shopping unit would remain part of Google, but would not be integrated with the search business as it is today. The way that shopping ads are displayed may also be slightly redesigned.
In June, EU regulators assessed a fine on Google of a record €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion), the largest doled out by Brussels for a monopoly abuse case, following a seven-year-long investigation.
Regulators claimed that the company abused its search market dominance to give its Google Shopping service an advantage over other retailers.
Google, which makes most of its money from advertising, has argued that the European Commission’s theory “just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online.”
“They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social media sites, and online ads served by various companies,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a blog post.

Duty to Treat Downstream Rivals Equally: (Merely) a Natural Remedy to Google’s Monopoly Leveraging Abuse
By Thomas Hoppner (Technical University Wildau)
Abstract:    Google has argued that, in its comparison shopping decision, the European Commission created a novel rule that a dominant company may not favour its own services. Such a rule, it is claimed, would only be justified where the company provided an ‘indispensable service’ as defined in the narrow case law on refusals to deal. This argument, however, confuses the identified abuse with the imposed remedy. The Commission imposed the obligation, to treat rival services like its own services, as a remedy. This remedy does not address a corresponding abusive discrimination or refusal to deal, but effectively brings a monopoly leveraging to an end. Google’s self-promotion is abusive only because it also fulfills long-established criteria for an anti-competitive extension of dominance from a primary market to a distinct, but related, secondary market. An ‘indispensable service’ is not required for this type of abuse.

Busting antitrust myths about Amazon, Google and Facebook
By Adam B. Summers
Can a business become too successful? Can it serve its customers too well? It can, if you are a government economist or bureaucrat — or a less efficient rival with political connections.
There are increasing calls for large technology firms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook to be brought to heel by the government, and even to be forcibly broken up to prevent any one unit from becoming too powerful. But, when markets are allowed to remain free, it is consumers that have the ultimate power, and traditional models of monopoly and competition tend to rely on economic fallacies, rather than focusing on what truly benefits consumers, which should be the ultimate standard.
The latest antitrust cries came when Amazon announced its $13.7 billion bid in June to purchase organic grocer Whole Foods. This, despite the fact that Whole Foods has just a 1.3 percent market share, compared to 7 percent for Kroger (parent of Ralphs) and about 14 percent for No. 1 Walmart, not to mention significant new competition from German-based Aldi and Lidl, which are both just breaking into the U.S. market.
A lot of the fear comes from Amazon’s ability to disrupt other industries, from online book-selling to cloud computing, but the idea that it is destroying vast swaths of brick-and-mortar retail business is overstated, to say the least. Amazon has doubtless had a significant effect on retail sales, and now accounts for 43 percent of all online retail sales in the U.S., though even this statistic is misleading, as half of those sales comes from third-party sellers using Amazon’s platform, and online sales still only make up a little more than 8 percent of all retail sales. In fact, Moody’s Investors Service recently concluded, Amazon is actually the weakest of the main U.S. firms, based on operating results.

Last year Google hired Caroline Atkinson Obama’s former economic advisor in an effort to deal with their antitrust concerns. Atkinson, who is an experienced diplomat and would steer its global policy efforts, is stepping aside. Atkinson however will not be leaving Google, she will stay on as chief policy adviser
Leslie Miller, a Google policy director based in California, is filling in the top policy role on an interim basis. “Caroline will be focusing on external-facing work and priorities, and Leslie will manage the team,” a Google spokesman told Bloomberg.
The staffing changes comes as the Alphabet unit negotiates terms in the European Union in the aftermath of a record antitrust fine and big technology companies face rising regulatory scrutiny in the US, including a renewed call for tougher competition enforcement.
Atkinson’s tenure was distinguished primarily by the antitrust case in Europe. In June, the EU slapped Google with a record US$2.7 billion fine for abusing its market position to favor its shopping search service. Google is working to appease the agency’s requests to avoid further penalties.

869,"September 18, 2017",EU: Google offers auction of prime shopping space as remedy,"
As it aims to stave off further EU antitrust fines, Google has offered to auction prominent space on its shopping search service against its own bids for the same space, four people familiar with the matter said. Google’s bids would purportedly be capped to a maximum in advance.
Google is under pressure to come up with a big initiative to level the playing field in comparison shopping, but its proposal was roundly criticised by competitors as inadequate, the sources said.
EU enforcers see the antitrust case as a benchmark for investigations into other areas dominated by the US search giant such as travel and online mapping.
Google has already been fined a record €2.4 billion (US$2.9 billion) by the European Commission for favouring its own service, and could face millions of euros in fresh fines if it fails to treat rivals and its own service equally.
In its proposal submitted to the European Commission on August 29, the company said it would allow competitors to bid for any spot in its shopping section known as Product Listing Ads, the sources said.
Since then, Google has sought feedback from four to five competitors, which was overwhelmingly negative, the sources said.

Gab, una red social independiente popular entre activistas conservadores, ha presentado una demanda ante un tribunal federal acusando al gigante tecnológico Google de abusar de su poder de mercado al eliminar al servicio de sus tiendas de aplicaciones online.
El mes pasado Gab dijo haber sido retirada de Google Play Store después de que la empresa recibiera quejas sobre el servicio, el cual se había convertido en un refugio para el discurso de odio y temas Nazis. Gab llamó aún más atención cuando el fundador de la página web neo-nazi ‘The Daily Stormer’ decidió, temporalmente, hacer de Gab su nueva plataforma mientras lucha por mantener en línea al periódico, después de que varios servicios de Internet retiraran su apoyo.
La publicidad generada incrementó el éxito de la campaña de crowdfunding de Gab. Gab, que afirma contar con 250,000 usuarios, ha dicho que también ha sido rechazada en numerosas ocasiones por la App Store de Apple.
En la demanda Gab afirma que Google violó la ley antimonopolio al simplemente eliminar su aplicación. Los fundadores de Gab insisten en que su aplicación no es de corte político, sino más bien un refugio para la libertad de expresión en todo el espectro.

Gab, an independent social network popular with conservative activists, has filed a lawsuit in a federal court accusing Google of abusing its power after the search giant removed the upstart from its app store.
Last month, Gab complained that it had been banned from Google’s Play Storefollowing complaints that the service had become a haven for hate speech and Nazis. Gab drew additional attention when the founder of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer decided to at least temporarily make Gab his new home while he struggled to keep Stormer online after several internet services revoked their support.
The ensuing publicity did accelerate the success of Gab’s crowdfunding campaign. Gab, which says it now has 250,000 users, has said it has also been rejected numerous times from Apple’s App Store.
In the lawsuit, first reported by the Washington Post, Gab claims that Google violated antitrust law by giving its app the boot. Gab’s founders insist that the site is not political in nature, but rather a refuge for free speech across the spectrum.

Inside the new battle against Google
By Danny Vinik
One of the biggest, most embarrassing divorces in the normally quiet world of Washington think tanks blew into the open earlier this month, when writer Barry Lynn and nine others defected from New America. Lynn said they were pushed out of the influential Democratic think tank after he wrote a post this summer criticizing Google, one of its key funders. Anne-Marie Slaughter, who heads the foundation, called the story reporting the news “false”—then wrote a long Medium post walking her charge back.
Whatever the final trigger for the split, its roots lay far deeper than this summer’s scuffle. The Google controversy marked the most public emergence of an intellectually combative group jostling for a role as the new economic brain of the Democratic Party.
Lynn’s group, called Open Markets, has spent six years arguing that the Democrats have become too comfortable with corporate money and power, and need to rally around a new principle: breaking up monopolies. As the party remains locked in a struggle to reboot itself, unable to craft a unifying vision in the Trump era, Lynn and his group are trying to push it into a new fight against global corporate titans, targeting big companies like Google by name, and arguing that it’s time to use federal antitrust law to chip away at their influence. They see the fight as both a boon to democracy and a political framework that could excite voters in a new, more energized populist moment.

This article provides some initial thoughts on the European Commission’s infringement decision in Google Search. Pending a review of the full decision, the article briefly discusses three critical issues that go to the heart of the decision. The article offers thoughts on the abuse, the theory of harm and the remedy underlying the Commission’s decision. It finds that, as of yet, important questions about these three aspects still remain and irrespective of how the Commission deals with these in the full decision, the Google Search case raises important questions about the correct application of the European prohibition of abuse of a dominant position.

A group of antitrust experts has launched their own independent organization after they were pushed out of the New America think tank two weeks after raising criticisms of Google.
The new group is called the Open Markets Institute, and its goal is “to protect this country’s economy and democracy from corporate monopolies that undermine opportunity, competition, choice, and — as we have now personally experienced — freedom of expression.”
Open Markets is headed by Barry Lynn, the former New America scholar whose praise of the European Union’s decision to fine Google US$2.7 billion for antitrust violations led to clashes with New America president Anne-Marie Slaughter.
Lynn’s dismissal raised waves as Google critics claimed that the firing was due to Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt putting pressure on Slaughter.
Slaughter has said that Lynn’s ouster was a personnel issue and that Google had no say in her decision.

875,"September 12, 2017","US: Yelp accuses Google of scraping, breaking settlement","
The ongoing Yelp vs. Google battle continues. Once again, the user-generated review site is accusing the search behemoth of scraping content off Yelp, mainly photos, to use in the search results it offers Googlers.
The practice is in direct violation of a 2013 regulatory settlement between Google and other companies, which stemmed from a 2012 complaint filed by Yelp with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). At the time, Yelp’s argument focused on two major points: that Google unfairly used other sites’ content in order to better its own products (like Google Places and search results), and that Google excluded competitor results in a “search bias.” The settlement — which saw Google agreeing to stop scraping other sites’ content if they chose to opt out — was called by some a mere “slap on the wrist.”
And according to Yelp, Google’s at it again. The Hill reports a recent internal investigation found that “over one hour, Google pulled images from Yelp’s servers nearly 386,000 times for business listings in Google Maps.” In other words, Googling a restaurant might still result in several Yelp-owned images popping up.
“This is a flagrant violation of Google’s promises to the FTC,” Yelp’s public policy chief Luther Lowe said in a letter of complaint to the Commission, “and the FTC should reopen the Google case immediately.”
An FTC spokeswoman confirmed that the agency had received the letter and would study it carefully, but declined to comment further.

Google has launched its appeal against Brussels in a fightback over its record monopoly abuse fine. The search giant has filed an appeal to the European Commission over its €2.4bn (US$2.7 billion) antitrust penalty.
The Commission hit Google with the fine in June after finding the company had illegally abused the dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping over smaller comparison sites. Google is facing further multi-billion euro fines from the Commission over its Android software and online advertising network.
The company filed its appeal following a victory for Intel in a separate competition case. Europe’s highest court last week said a €1.1 billion (US$1.3 billion) fine against Intel, levied in 2009, should be re-examined.
EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is investigating Google in three cases, as well as tech giants Apple, Facebook and Qualcomm.
The €2.4 billion fine (US$2.7 billion, at the time it was levied) against Google for illegally exploiting its 90% search market share led to its parent company Alphabet’s profits falling by 30% in July. Google said it “respectfully disagreed” with the EU decision.
Brussels’ war against tech companies has included orders to pay large fines and unpaid tax bills. It has drawn criticism from US politicians who have accused the EU of protectionism and bias.
Google has had to change its search results or face further fines worth 50% of its turnover. The company must implement plans it submitted in August by the end of this month. Vestager said the proposals pointed “in the very right direction”, but the company will be closely monitored for a number of years.
Decisions in the Android mobile software and AdSense advertising cases are expected later this year.

Un nuevo informe afirma que Google está en las etapas finales de un proceso de adquisición del total, o parte del fabricante de teléfonos inteligentes, HTC.
El canal de noticias taiwanés Commercial Times reveló la noticia, siguiendo una historia anterior que sugirió que HTC, con sede en Taiwán, estaba interesada en la venta. A pesar de ser uno de los fabricantes de smartphones más populares en los Estados Unidos, HTC ha sufrido varios lanzamientos de teléfonos inteligentes sin éxito. Recientemente comenzó una división separada que vende dispositivos de realidad virtual.
Mientras que CBNC mantiene sus dudas sobre el informe, se menciona que Google podría estar interesado en HTC porque construye el Google Pixel y sería un buen ajuste para la empresa, ya que sigue prestando servicios a los consumidores con su marca “Pixel” smartphone.
Además, Commercial Times dijo que la mala posición financiera de HTC y el deseo de Google de “perfeccionar [la] integración de software, contenido, hardware, red, nube [y] AI” es la fuerza motriz detrás del interés de Google en una adquisición. Google podría hacer una “inversión estratégica” o “comprar equipo de I + D de smartphones de HTC” para que el equipo [de realidad virtual] se vuelva suyo.

A new report claims that Google is in the final stages of an acquisition of all or part of the smartphone maker, HTC.
Taiwanese news outlet, Commercial Times, revealed the news, following up on a previous story that suggested Taiwan-based HTC was interested in a sale. Despite once being one of the more popular smartphone makers in the United States, HTC has suffered from several consecutive unsuccessful smartphone launches. It recently started a separate division that sells virtual reality headsets.
While CBNC is skeptical about the news report, it does note that Google could be interested in HTC because it builds the Google Pixel and would be a good fit for company, as it continues to service to consumers with its “Pixel” smartphone brand.
In addition, Commercial Times said HTC’s poor financial position and Google’s desire to “perfect [the] integration of software, content, hardware, network, cloud [and] AI” is the driving force behind Google’s interest in an acquisition. The news outlet said Google may make a “strategic investment” or “buy HTC’s smartphone R&D team” so that the [virtual reality] team would exist as its own.

879,"September 10, 2017",EU: Google begins fight over €2.4b fine,"
Google is expected to start fighting back against Brussels this week when the company lodges an appeal against its record monopoly abuse fine.
The internet giant is expected to file the response to the European Commission’s €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion) penalty on Monday, September 11, the deadline for submitting an appeal.
Google, which is facing further multi-billion euro fines in the coming months over its Android software and online advertising network, has been weighing up a challenge since it was fined in June and the company’s hand was strengthened last week when Intel won an appeal over its own €1.1 billion (US$1.3 billion) fine for breaking competition law.
Google’s appeal will extend the seven-year tussle between the company and the EU over allegations it exploited the dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping service at the expense of small price -comparison websites.
The €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion) fine in June was the biggest for breaking competition law in the EU’s history, eclipsing the $1.1 billion (US$1.3 billion) Intel was ordered to pay eight years ago. Swallowing it led Google’s parent company Alphabet to report a 30% fall in quarterly profits in July.
Vestager said that by prominently displaying links to its shopping service in Google results and relegating rival price comparison sites, it had illegally exploited the 90% market share enjoyed by its search engine to gain a leg up in online shopping.

Companies such as Google Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. could benefit in pending antitrust cases from a ruling by the EU’s highest court allowing Intel Corp. to fight claims that its pricing policies hurt competition.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) doesn’t often rule on competition cases, and it rules against the European Commission even less frequently. Its Sept. 6 ruling giving Intel another shot at appealing a 1.06 billion-euro ($1.26 billion) fine in effect hands the EC a defeat by reversing a lower court decision that completely affirmed the EC’s case.
The opinion also answers some questions about how companies can defend themselves against abuse of dominance challenges in the EU — issues that are front and center in the high-profile cases against Google and Qualcomm ( Intel Corp. v. European Commission , E.C.J., C 413/14 P, 9/6/17 ).

881,"September 3, 2017",EU: Vestager says “Google still great company”,"
Google is still very much a force for good and has many positive attributes, according to the EU’s competition commissioner who slapped the tech giant with a US$2.7 billion fine earlier this year.
“This is a decision about legal behavior that they (Google) should and can correct,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said about June’s fine for the US firm. However, she added that Google doesn’t have a bad attitude towards competition.
“In other respects, Google is a wonderful company, very, very innovative and they have brought us innovation that has changed our lives,” she told CNBC on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum Saturday.
The US tech giant has been investigated by the European Commission on several fronts for concerns over competition. It inclusively received a €2.42 billion (US$2.7 billion) fine in June for giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. This past week, Google reportedly submitted details of how it planned to stop favoring its shopping service and comply with the EU order

882,"August 30, 2017",US: Google criticized for think tank firing,"
The New America Foundation, a prominent Washington, DC think tank that’s heavily funded by Google, has parted ways with one of its most influential scholars after he criticized Google’s growing monopoly power.
The scholar is Barry Lynn, founder of New America’s Open Markets program and a leading advocate of stricter enforcement of antitrust laws. In June, Barry Lynn, who was a scholar at New America, posted a statement praising the European Union’s record US$2.7 billion fine against Google. Lynn ran a team, Open Markets, that researched competition policy and was increasingly critical of giants like Google and Amazon.
Google executive chairman and former CEO Eric Schmidt criticized Lynn’s statement to the think tank’s CEO, Anne-Marie Slaughter, according to The New York Times.
The statement reportedly disappeared from the think tank website but returned hours later. According to the Times, word of Schmidt’s displeasure spread across the think tank.
Slaughter fired Lynn days later, saying in an email obtained by the Times that “the time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways.” Slaughter told Lynn in an email that his firing was “in no way based on the content of your work” but said he was “imperiling the institution as a whole.”
Lynn told the Times he believed his dismissal was because he criticized Google.
“Google is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling the strings,” Lynn told the Times. “People are so afraid of Google now.”
In a tweet, Slaughter called the Times story “false” and said the think tank would publish a full statement later Wednesday, August 30.
Shortly after The New America Foundation published a statement in response to the Times article. In the release, Slaughter patently denies any accusation that “Google lobbied New America to expel the Open Markets program because of this press release.” She writes that Lynn’s “repeated refusal to adhere to New America’s standards of openness and institutional collegiality meant that we could no longer work together as part of the same institution.”
A Google representative also said, “We support hundreds of organizations that promote a free and open Internet, greater access to information, and increased opportunity. We don’t agree with every group 100% of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group’s independence, personnel decisions, and policy perspectives.”

883,"August 30, 2017",EU: Google starts to comply with EU antitrust order,"
Google has offered up plans and a glimpse of how it will seek to comply with antitrust directives from the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Reuters reported Tuesday.
The plans center around behavior in which the internet giant favored its own shopping platform over rivals, giving prime search displays to its own displays, the newswire stated. The company had been ordered by EU regulators to not only come up with a detailed plan by Tuesday (a deadline it met) but also stop those practices by September 28.
That GDPR deadline, should it be missed, would bring some financial bite to the Alphabet-owned Google, with penalty payments in the offing of as much as 5% of the company’s global sales volume. Based on trailing figures, in 2016, that could be at least US$12 million daily, as estimated from a top line of US$90 billion.

Alphabet’s Google is set to sketch out to the European Union’s antitrust authority on Tuesday, August 29, how it plans to implement the regulator’s recent order to stop illegally tipping the scales in favor of its own comparison-shopping service, according to Reuters.
The European Commission (EC), which has for roughly seven years been investigating Google for breaching the bloc’s antitrust rules in various areas, in June fined Google a record €2.42 billion (US$2.91 billion) for discriminating against rival comparison-shopping sites in search rankings.
As part of the decision, the EC at the time also ordered Google to overhaul its shopping search results by late September so that the company treats its competitors’ offerings and its own shopping service equally.
Google was due to notify the EC by Tuesday about how it plans to implement the decision — a deadline it is expected to meet, according to the people. Google declined to provide any details of the pending proposal.

885,"August 24, 2017",Google: Ad Blocking Chrome Extension Raises Antitrust Issues,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Capitol Forum
On August 10, The New York Post reported Google notified 700 publishers that the built-in Chrome ad blocker coming out next year will block their ads. The article previews the inherent conflict of Google serving as a gatekeeper for digital ads while also competing against publishers for ad dollars. Google’s plan to include an ad blocker extension in Chrome is likely to exacerbate calls for antitrust enforcers to investigate Google’s dominance throughout the vertical stack composed of the Android operating system, Chrome browser, Google search engine and search ads business—each of which occupy the number one market position.
A close look at ad blocking reveals a surprising lack of public information about the terms of Google’s “whitelisting” agreements with ad blocking companies, agreements in which Google pays to un-block its ads. Two companies—AdBlock and AdBlock Plus—control over 90% of the desktop ad blocking market in the U.S. and Europe and have the apparent power to interfere with billions of dollars in Google ad revenue. AdBlock was purchased in 2015 by an undisclosed buyer, whose identity remains a closely guarded secret.
For their part, publishers have refused to pay ad blockers for whitelisting, and the head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), Randall Rothenberg, has referred to such payments as “extortion.” Google’s chrome extension appears to be a move to take control of ad blocking and sheds light on the high stakes for Google of reducing the threat ad blockers pose to its business model.
In researching this article, we spoke to experts on the digital advertising ecosystem and ad blocking, who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity. We also asked Google for comment, and the company directed us to its public comments Building a Better Web For Everyone and Helping Publishers Bust Annoying Ads.

When Walmart goes to war for retail dominance, it does not kid around about it. The last year has seen the nation’s once-largest retailer spend billions on web-based acquisitions (most notably its US$3 billion Jet.com buy), cut its prices (to the chagrin of its suppliers), add grocery pick-up and roll out Walmart Pay nationwide. And those are just the individual efforts — Walmart has also been all about playing nicely with others this year as well. Recently, Big Blue announced it is rolling out grocery delivery with Uber and installment loans (in a pilot) with Affirm.
But wait, Walmart had one more hit to sneak in under the buzzer this week — it will also be teaming up with Google to take on Amazon in the emerging world of voice shopping.
Google, starting in September, will offer hundreds of thousands of Walmart items via its voice-controlled Google Assistant, according to Walmart’s head of eCommerce, Marc Lore. He also noted that with the tie-in, Walmart will be offering the widest selection of any retailer on the platform.
Both giants have another giant they are hoping to take on, and maybe weaken some — Amazon.

Google is aiming to improve its relationship with publishers by working on new tools that will help news outlets sell subscriptions.
According to a news report in The Wall Street Journal citing Google, the paper reported the internet search giant is testing a first-click-free policy, in which Google search users get access to article search results that require a subscription. Google may reduce the number of free articles users can access to three a day, noted the paper, citing a person familiar with the plans. Google, noted the report, thinks sampling articles could help publishers sell more subscriptions.
The Wall Street Journal reported Google is testing the tool with The New York Times and The Financial Times. Google is testing sharing Google data, on which users are most likely to purchase subscriptions. Talks with other publishers are happening at the moment. However, the changes being tested may not end up happening, noted the report.

Earlier this year, Google lost an antitrust case in Russia over the restrictions it places on Android devices. As part of a settlement with the country’s antimonopoly agency, the FAS, the US tech giant has made changes to its Chrome app, which now prompts users to select a default search engine when it launches for the first time.
In a blog post, Russian search engine Yandex described the change as a “huge milestone” and said it had been working for it “for a long time.” Google is Yandex’s biggest rival in Russia, with the latter holding 55% of the market (compared to Google’s 40%) by Yandex’s own count. As users switch from desktop to mobile, asking them to actively choose a search engine (rather than burying that choice in the settings menu) makes a big difference.
Yandex says in a blog post:
Previously, Google search was the default search on Chrome on all Android devices; a different search engine could only be selected by accessing the application settings. Now, with the most recent version of Chrome Mobile (v.60), users are prompted to select their default search engine when the Chrome app launches. This is a huge milestone for Russian users and something we have been working towards for a long time.
As one of the largest internet companies in Europe, and the leading search and mobile applications provider in Russia, access to platforms is critically important to Yandex. We are excited that Russian consumers can now easily choose their preferred search engine on their Android devices.

Beyond ‘Hipster Antitrust’: A Critical Perspective on the European Commission’s Google Decision
By Angela Daly (Queensland University of Technology)
Abstract:      This contribution offers a critical socio-legal perspective on the European Commission’s Decision in the Google Shopping investigation. In particular, three outstanding issues, concerning Google’s data collection, algorithmic transparency and the beneficiaries of the Decision are explored. The Decision does not address all the problems associated with Google’s platform power. However, it is argued that competition law, even modified from the current More Economic Approach as the antitrust hipsters suggest, is not able to do this alone, but has to be part of a multi-regime response involving regulation and consumer law.

891,"July 31, 2017",US: Bannon says Google-Facebook merit utility treatment,"
Google spent the most it ever has in a single quarter trying to influence elected officials in Washington, according to The Guardian. Google spent $5.93 million between April 1 and June 30, more than any other corporation in the second quarter. That’s about 40 percent more than it had spent during the same period last year.
After Steve Bannon’s recent comments that Google and Facebook should be regulated as utilities, it is likely Google will only increase its lobbying expenditure in the next few months.
Bannon says that tech firms like Google and Facebook should be regulated as utilities, according to sources who have spoken with him on the issue.
His efforts on this issue came before Congressional Democrats released their “Better Deal” policy planning objectives last week, which included a vague call to crack down on corporate monopolies. The policy platform did not single out Google, Facebook or Amazon, but many see confronting the giants’ monopolistic practices as inevitable.
Google, for its part, is not going to wait idly for regulations to come to materialize. The company has spent almost US$6 million lobbying the US capital over the past three months alone, reports the Guardian. The number puts Google on track to overtake Comcast to become the top corporate lobbying spender in the US.

Russian antitrust watchdog, Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), is looking into the violations of country’s anti-monopoly law by some of the biggest search engines such as Google and Yandex, Russia’s Sputnik reported Monday.
An enquiry has been initiated into the matter after the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion (US$2.85 billion) in June over the abuse of its dominant position in the search engine market. EC said Google preferred results from its own shopping services. The company has been told to stop the violations within three months or pay fine equivalent to 5% of its daily turnover.
The Russian anti-monopoly agency has said it was looking into the European Commission’s findings on Google.
“Undoubtedly, on our own initiative, we are studying how the search engine companies are behaving in Russia, whether they make preferential placements of their resources. This work is currently underway… We don’t have the analysis of the share [of the market] ready, but there are probably two dominants, Yandex and Google… FAS is analyzing the behavior of the largest players of the search engine market,” Elena Zaeva, the head of the agency’s Department for Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technologysaid.
The FAS official noted that there had been no complaints similar to the one that prompted the European Commission to launch its case against Google.
In April, the FAS and Google ended their two-year long dispute over the US technology giant pre-installing its own applications on all Android devices sold in Russia, with Google agreeing to pay the fines and to refrain from restricting the installation of competitors’ applications, including on the home screen in default position.

From Microsoft to Google: eyes wide shut on predatory innovation? By Dr. Thibault Schrepel
On June 27, 2017, the European Commission (“Commission”) has fined Google 2.7 billion dollars1 for having abused its dominant position by giving illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. According to the Commission, Google had notably “demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results.” We do not know – yet – if that demotion was purely contractual, but if it also involved technical changes, it would mean that Google has implemented practices of  predatory  innovation. We shall soon know, once a non-confidential version of the decision will be made public.
And we are already expecting another decision to be released against Google, in the Android case. In its statement of objections,2 the European Commission held that Google imposed restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. Some of them are technical – those related to anti-fragmentation, for instance.
These strategies – without making any assumption about their legality in these particular cases – are falling within the definition of predatory innovation which covers the “alteration of one or more technical elements of a product to limit or eliminate competition.”3 And they are implemented on a daily basis.

894,"July 19, 2017",EU: Google “right-to-be-forgotten” case referred by France to ECJ,"
EU judges will have to decide whether Alphabet’s Google has to remove certain web search results globally to comply with a previous privacy ruling after France’s supreme administrative court referred the issue to the top EU court.
Google has gone head to head with the French data protection authority, CNIL, over the territorial scope of the so-called “right to be forgotten,” which requires the world’s biggest search engine to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results under searches for people’s names.
Having been fined €100,000 (US$115,000) by CNIL in March 2016 for not delisting across national borders, Google appealed to France’s supreme administrative court, which on July 20 passed the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).
The dispute with CNIL arose after the ECJ ruled in 2014 that search engines such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing must comply with the “right to be forgotten”. Though Google did so, it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France, arguing that to do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent on the territorial reach of national laws.
Peter Fleischer, Google’s global privacy counsel, said in a written statement, “We’ve been defending the idea that each country should be able to balance freedom of expression and privacy in the way that it chooses, not in the way that another country chooses.”

Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Conversation
The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that European antitrust regulators have declared war on American tech giants.
On June 27, the European Union imposed a €2.4 billion (US$2.75 billion) fine on Google for giving favorable treatment in its search engine results to its own comparison shopping service. And Germany’s antitrust enforcer is investigating Facebook for asking users to sign away control over personal information.
In contrast, American antitrust enforcers have shown little interest in these companies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) did open an investigation into whether Google has a search bias, but closed it in 2013, despite recognizing that it “may have had the effect of harming individual competitors.”
Anti-Americanism, however, does not explain these starkly different approaches. Europe targets homegrown companies with the same ferocity. Last summer, for example, the EU fined a cartel of European truck-makers even more than it did Google.

A French court annulled a €1.1 billion (US$1.3 billion) tax adjustment imposed on Google by France’s tax authorities, saying Wednesday that the way the California firm operates in France allows it to be exempt from most taxes.
The French tax administration had argued that Google was required to pay taxes in France for 2005-2010 because the American company and its Irish subsidiary sold a service for inserting online ads to clients in France through its Google search engine.
But the Paris administrative court ruled that Google Ireland Limited doesn’t have a “permanent establishment” in France via the French company Google France, another subsidiary of California-based Google.
The court added that Google France doesn’t have the human resources or the technical means to allow it to carry out the contentious advertising services on its own.
The French government can appeal the decision.
Google has minimized its tax bill in France and other European countries by keeping its headquarters in Ireland, where rates are lower. The strategy has helped Google boost its profits and stock price.
In their ruling, the judges noted that the ads ordered by French clients could not be put online by the employees of Google France themselves because any ad orders ultimately needed approval from Google Ireland Limited.

This comes just days after Google was hit with a record antitrust fine by the European Union. The judges could rule as soon as Wednesday to determine whether Google illegally avoided French taxes by routing sales in the country out of Ireland.
“The backlash has been unrelenting because tax populism and Google-bashing are on the rise among certain politicians,” said Maximilien Jazani, a tax lawyer in Paris. The case could have “extremely harmful” side effects because any change in how tax law is interpreted would apply to all companies and could deter investment in France, he said.

898,"July 10, 2017",US: Newspapers to bid for antitrust exemption to tackle Google and Facebook,"
The news industry is banding together to seek a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in an effort to fend off growing competition from Facebook and Google.
Traditional competitors including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, as well as a host of smaller print and online publications, will temporarily set aside their differences this week and appeal to federal lawmakers to let them negotiate collectively with the technology giants to safeguard the industry.
Antitrust laws traditionally prevent companies from forming such an alliance which could see them becoming over-dominant in a particular sector. However, the media companies are hoping that Congress will look favorably on a temporary exemption, particularly given the recent clampdown on the technology industry which saw Google slapped with a US$2.7 billion antitrust fine.
The campaign is led by newspaper industry trade group News Media Alliance and it is intended to help the industry collaborate in order to regain market share from Facebook and Google, which have been swooping in on newspapers’ distribution and advertising revenues.
The two companies currently command 70% of the US$73 billion digital advertising industry in the US, according to new research from the Pew Research Centre. Meanwhile, US newspaper ad revenue in 2016 was US$18 billion from US$50 billion a decade ago.
The News Media Alliance argue that, despite their growing dominance in news distribution, Facebook and Google lack the resources and ability to guarantee the accuracy of reporting upheld by reputable news associations. Facebook in particular came under fire during the 2016 US presidential election when it failed to suitably monitor the news content on its platform and was seen to host unverified articles.
“(Facebook and Google) don’t employ reporters: They don’t dig through public records to uncover corruption, send correspondents into war zones, or attend last night’s game to get the highlights. They expect an economically squeezed news industry to do that costly work for them,” David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, wrote in an opinion piece published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal.

Confused EU Regulators Slam Google
Nobody can pinpoint the exact origin of the phrase “Can’t see the forest for the trees,” but that hasn’t stopped countless people all over the internet debating its proper citation, grammar and philosophical interpretation.
Where there appears to be common ground, however, is in what the phrase means: Being so focused on the details of one thing can cause people to lose perspective and miss a much more important and relevant bigger picture — often at their peril.
It’s also a great metaphor for what we just witnessed last week when the European Commission found Google guilty of anti-competitive practices over its Google Shopping product and levied a record $2.7 billion fine on them.
This ruling comes seven years after an investigation was opened into these alleged “anticompetitive practices” (November 2010) and two years after Google was formally charged (April 2015).
The saga is well-documented, so I’ll spare you the lengthy narrative. The Cliff Notes version is that a bunch of tiny websites convinced the Commission that Google’s Shopping product put them at a disadvantage when consumers were searching for products. Google Shopping is the little carousel of product images that consumers see at the top of Google’s search results page and for which marketers pay to be there.
These little guy sites, who pushed the Commission to open an investigation in the years leading up to 2010, had some big help — Microsoft.

The EU might soon reveal a verdict in the Android case, and Google could face a second record fine. EU antitrust regulators are seeking a second opinion in the investigation into Google’s Android operating system from a panel of experts, Reuters explains. The experts are part of a so-called devil’s advocate review panel, meant to look at the Commission’s conclusions in the case in order to ensure that they are robust. The regulator is reportedly thinking about tacking on another record fine.
The EU charged Google in April 2016 with using its dominant position in the smartphone business to hinder competition. The practices that the Commission targeted include Google’s requirements from Android device makers: Google asks its partners to preinstall Google Search and Google Chrome on Android devices to be able to install the Google Play store app that users might want. Google’s contracts, the EU says, also prevent OEMs from using other versions of Android.
The European Commission concluded its investigation into Google’s search practices a few days ago, handing the California-based company a record fine of €2.4 billion(US$2.7 billion), which was more than twice as large as the fine given to Intel in a previous case. Apart from the Android probe, the EU is conducting yet another investigation on Google’s AdSense business.

When European antitrust regulators announced a €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion) fine against Google in late June, few people had more reason to celebrate than Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, reports Vox.
Stoppelman argues that Google has hurt Yelp by artificially putting links to Google’s own Yelp competitor — previously named Google Places and renamed Google My Business in 2014 — ahead of Yelp’s in Google search results; Yelp argues that results like that are destroying its business. Yelp is the online destination for customer reviews of local businesses, or it was. Yelp is having a harder time getting eyeballs on the site because Google places results from Yelp beneath results linked to its own mapping service.
Google was hit with the largest fine European antitrust regulators have ever handed down last week—US$2.7 billion. Although that fine was not directly relevant to local business search, it does raise the possibility of further questioning of Google favoring results from its own digital products over those from other companies.

904,"June 26, 2017",Europe Hits Google With Massive $2.7 Billion Fine,"
The European Union’s competition watchdog slapped a record 2.42 billion euro (US $2.72 billion) fine on internet giant Google on Tuesday for breaching antitrust rules with its online shopping service.
European regulators said “Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service.”
It gave the Mountain View, California, company 90 days to stop or face fines of up to 5 percent of the average daily worldwide turnover of parent company Alphabet.
The European Commission, which polices EU competition rules, alleges Google elevates its shopping service even when other options might have better deals.
The Commission said Google “gave prominent placement in its search results only to its own comparison shopping service, whilst demoting rival services. It stifled competition on the merits in comparison shopping markets.”
Google maintains it’s just trying to package its search results in a way that makes it easier for consumers to find what they want.
“When you shop online, you want to find the products you’re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That’s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,” Kent Walker, senior vice president at Google, said in a statement.
“We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” he said.
The fine is the highest ever imposed in Europe for anti-competitive behavior, exceeding a 1.06 billion euros penalty on Silicon Valley chip maker Intel in 2009.

905,"June 26, 2017",Rusia: Google es bloqueado brevemente,"
El acceso a Google.ru fue bloqueado brevemente por el regulador de Internet de Rusia , a raíz de un sitio web involucrado en un fallo fiscal federal de junio de 2016.
El jueves por la tarde, la dirección web del portal en ruso de Google apareció durante aproximadamente tres horas en una lista negra mantenida por Roskomnadzor, el regulador federal de internet y medios de comunicación, en relación con una sentencia dictada el año pasado contra un servicio de apuestas en línea.
“Google [estaba redirigiendo tráfico] a una empresa corredora de apuestas, que había sido subida al registro de sitios restringidos por una decisión del servicio de impuestos “, dijo el jefe de Roskomnadzor, Aleksandr Zharov, a la agencia de noticias Interfax.
“Google Rusia ha cumplido con todos los requisitos, eliminado todo y, respectivamente, ha sido removido del registro único”, dijo a Interfax.
Varios proveedores de servicio de Internet importantes ya habían comenzado a bloquear el acceso a Google.ru antes de que el regulador lo eliminara de su lista negra, informó The Times.
Leonid Levin, jefe de la comisión de política de información, tecnologías de la información y comunicaciones de la Duma de Rusia, dijo a los periodistas que el pedido inicial de Roskomnadzor demostró “que no hay intocables en el campo legal ruso e incluso los actores principales  no deben abusar de su posición interactuando con sitios web que participan en actividades ilegales”.

906,"June 25, 2017",South Korea: KFTC reviews Google and Facebook’s market dominance,"
The Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), under the new leadership of former civic activist Kim Sang-jo, seems to be targeting major global IT companies – Google and Facebook – in regard to collecting information that are considered key elements of the so-called fourth industrial revolution technologies.
In his interview with Yonhap, Kim said the antitrust agency is “reviewing” whether there has been any monopolizing of information or violation of related antitrust regulations using the companies’ dominant influence in the market.
“The networks are installed through [Korean] taxpayer’s money but they are sweeping the information without paying the cost,” Kim told Yonhap.
The KFTC Chairman said in the case of fourth industrial revolution technologies – big data, cloud storage system, Internet-of-Things and artificial intelligence – network effects, where demands for certain goods and services increase with more people using them, play a pivotal role.
As a result, he said, once companies take the lead, late comers have difficulty in entering the market, which deters fair competition.
Kim said it is the KFTC’s role not only to reform the conglomerate-reliant economic structure, but also to create the basic market structure for new future industries. This is not the first time that Google has been investigated by the Korean antitrust agency.

907,"June 25, 2017",EU: Clifford Chance and Cleary lead as Google faces large fine,"
Clifford Chance (CC), Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and Covington & Burling are advising as the European Union prepares to come to a decision on the first stage of a three-pronged probe into the search group’s practices.
EU officials are reportedly poised to fine the search engine more than $ 900million for abusing its search market dominance by steering European consumers to its Google Shopping service.
The three law firms were first called up in 2015, when Google was accused of anti-competitive behaviour by the European Commission.
Cleary is representing Google with a team led by London-based competition partner Maurits Dolmans and Brussels-based counterparts Thomas Graf and Robbert Snelders.
Meanwhile, CC is advising the complainants on the case with a team led by partner Thomas Vinje, who is legal counsel and spokesman for lobby group FairSearch Europe, alongside antitrust partner Dieter Paemen.
The regulator has not formally disclosed the names of complainants, although a number of companies have gone public with their complaints. These include French legal search engine eJustice and British price comparison site Foundem.

908,"June 22, 2017","Russia: Google banned briefly, over 2016 tax ruling","
Google was briefly banned by Moscow’s internet watchdog Thursday over a website at the center of a June 2016 federal tax ruling, Russian media reported.
The web address for Google’s Russian language portal, Google.ru, appeared for about three hours Thursday afternoon on a blacklist maintained by Roskomnadzor, Russia’s federal internet and media regulator, in connection with a ruling made last year against an illegal online betting service, The Moscow Times reported.
“Google was redirecting to a bookmaker, which was on the tax service register of restricted websites,” Roskomnadzor chief Aleksandr Zharov told the Interfax news agency, as translated by state-owned media.
“Google Russia has fulfilled all the requirements, deleted everything and, respectively, has been removed from the single registry,” he reportedly told Interfax.
Several major internet service providers had already begun blocking access to Google.ru before the regulator removed it from its blacklist later Thursday afternoon, The Times reported.
The head of the committee on information policy, information technologies and communications in Russia’s State Duma, Leonid Levin, told journalists Thursday that Roskomnadzor initial order demonstrated “that there are no untouchables in the Russian legal field and even major internet-players must not abuse their positions by interacting with websites engaged in illegal activities.”

909,"June 18, 2017",EU: Google faces record antitrust fine,"
European antitrust officials are preparing to hit Google with a potentially record fine by the end of August over some of the Silicon Valley giant’s search services, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition chief, is in the final stages of ruling on the case, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly. Any financial penalty is expected to be larger than the fine of 1.06 billion euros, then about US$1.4 billion — at the time the highest ever — that Intel was forced to fork out for antitrust abuses in Europe in 2009.
As well as the fine, European officials could also force Google to alter how it operates in the region, and potentially elsewhere, to give rivals a greater ability to compete.
The case, linked to claims that Google diverted traffic from competitors’ services to favor its own comparison shopping site, is one of three investigations that the European Union’s executive arm has opened against the search giant. The other two involve Android, the company’s mobile software, and some of Google’s advertising products.
European officials claim that the company favored many of its own digital services, including search and online maps, over those of rivals. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

910,"June 4, 2017",EU: Google is going ahead with controversial Ad Blocking plans,"
Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users, and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that don’t meet certain standards.
The Alphabet subsidiary says it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable, and the standards being built into the browser come from an industry group rather than Google. But that hasn’t stopped some from criticizing the idea, since Google controls a significant share of the online ad market.
Google and Facebook dominate the digital advertising industry; the two companies reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all digital ad revenue growth in 2016. And antitrust experts and media industry leaders are concerned about any move — like next year’s ad blocker release first reported by the Wall Street Journal — that would give the tech conglomerates even more market power.
“I don’t love that Google is kind of imposing a solution through Chrome,” said David Chavern, leader of the News Media Alliance, an industry association for print and digital news organizations. “It’s sort of saying ‘Here, publishers, this the deal. Take it or leave it.’”

911,"May 22, 2017",EU: Google antitrust cases in near end,"
EU antitrust regulators will rule in the “next few months” whether Alphabet’s Google abused its dominance of internet searches and other areas, a senior European Commission official said on Monday, an outcome that could lead to a hefty fine.
The world’s most popular internet search engine has been in the Commission’s crosshairs since 2010 over the promotion of its own shopping service in internet searches at the expense of the services of rivals.
The EU competition enforcer opened a second front against Google last year as it charged the company with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.
It has since leveled a third charge, that of blocking rivals in online search advertising. This relates to Google’s “AdSense for Search” platform, in which Google acts as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. These searches produce results that include search ads.
“In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android,” Tommaso Valletti, the Commission’s chief competition economist, told a conference organized by the University of Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy.
The Commission has already warned Google that it would be fined if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. Sanctions could reach 10 percent of annual global turnover for each case.

913,"May 4, 2017",Italy: Google settles £259m tax bill to end criminal investigation,"
Alphabet’s Google has agreed to pay around EUR306 million ($334 million) in back taxes in Italy, settling one of multiple legal and regulatory battles that have dogged the tech giant in Europe.
The settlement ends one of several probes into Google’s tax arrangements in the European Union, as governments maintain the pressure on other US giants they accuse of tax evasion.
The tax probes come as Brussels and national capitals crack down on what they view as corporate tax abuse, both by pushing to change international tax rules and by investigating companies that have struck deals with low-tax jurisdictions to slash their tax bill.
Thursday’s agreement between Google and Italy relates mainly to corporate taxes the Italians say Google failed to pay between 2009 and 2015. Rome alleges Google routed more than EUR1 billion in Italy-based revenue to its office in Ireland, where tax rates are far lower.
A company spokesman said that of the EUR306 million in back taxes, EUR303 million was attributed to Google Italy, with the rest to Google Ireland. As part of the deal, Google will agree to pay taxes on future income — largely related to advertising sales — generated in Italy, according to Italian tax authorities.

Google is planning to introduce ad-blocking technology to Google Chrome, the world’s most popular web browser, a move that could cause uproar in online media and potentially lead to antitrust scrutiny.
Chrome, which is used by more than half of the world’s billions of web users, could introduce the feature on its mobile and desktop browsers in the coming weeks, according to reports.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner who is already leading multiple investigations into Google’s dominance, said she would “follow this new feature and its effects closely”.
Ad blockers disable particular pieces of code when loading web pages, which means the adverts many websites rely on for revenue do not load and are rendered invisible. Google introducing ad blocking, however, would have massive implications.

PayPal and Alphabet Google deepened their relationship with a new agreement that enables payments through the tap of a phone from PayPal accounts at thousands of new retail locations.

This makes PayPal a funding option when people use Android Pay in locations including Walgreens Boots Alliance drug stores and Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. PayPal was added as a payment method for Google’s Play app and digital content store almost three years ago.
Now people will have the option of linking their PayPal accounts to Android Pay, giving PayPal additional reach. Meanwhile, Google hopes the move will make Android Pay attractive to more users amid its battle with rival ApplePay, a similar service that that has no PayPal partnership.

Google has agreed to pay $7.8m in fines and rewrite contracts with smartphone manufacturers under a settlement with Russia’s anti-monopoly watchdog over access to the Android operating system.
The settlement ends a two-year legal battle after regulators — acting on a complaint filed by Yandex, Google’s main competitor in Russia — found that Google apps were being given prominence over rivals on Android-based smartphones.
Under the agreement, which is to last for six years and nine months, Google will have to sign new contracts with manufacturers that allow them to pre-install competitors’ apps on Android phones’ home screens.
Google and Yandex agreed that further versions of Chrome and the Android search widget will give Russian users the option of switching to Yandex’s search engine.
The changes, which will take place in the next few months, will come as default on new Android phones and be implemented in future versions of Chrome for phones already in use. “We are happy to continue to offer our services to users in Russia,” Matt Sucherman, deputy general counsel for Google, said in a statement.

The proposed settlement provided for an injunction, a release of the class’s claims, and a request for $2.2 million in attorney’s fees. Judge Lucy Koh rejected the proposed settlement because it fails to require Google to disclose the fact that they intercept, scan and analyze the content of e-mails from non-Gmail users.
Additionally, the settlement was rejected on the grounds that it provided no authority proving that the proposed injunction would bring Google within compliance of CIPA or ECPA. Ultimately, the court was unable to conclude that the proposed settlement was fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable.

Google Android after Microsoft: some thoughts on the proceedings brought against Google for abuse of a dominant position
By Giulia Funghi & Alessandro Rosanò (University of Padua)
Abstract:     In April 2015 the European Commission opened an antitrust proceedings against Google with regard to its business practices related to Android, the famous smarthpone and tablet operating system. According to the Commission, Google has abused of its dominant position in that it has allegedly required or incentivised smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively pre-install Google’s own applications or services, prevented smartphone and tablet manufacturers from developing and marketing modified and potentially competing versions of Android, tied or bundled certain Google applications and services distributed on Android devices with other Google applications, services, and/or application programming interfaces of Google. The purpose of the article is to find a solution to the case in light of the judgment passed by the Court of First Instance of the European Union in Microsoft and show that Google’s business practice does not amount to a violation of competition rules in that it protects both consumers and free competition.

Denmark’s Data Protection Agency has received a complaint about Alphabet’s Google. A Danish consumer watchdog claims it is breaking privacy laws by not capping the amount of time personal data is stored on Google’s servers.
As reported by the Reuters news agency, web companies such as Google and Facebook face increased scrutiny over how and where they store location and search history data from users of smartphones and mail accounts.
“The consumer council Taenk would like the Data Protection Agency to assess whether Google’s indefinite data collection complies with consumer’s basic right to privacy,” the watchdog stated in the report seen by Reuters.
“We have become aware of the fact that Google today has 9-10 years of data on users with a Google account,” the report stated.
In July last year Google changed its data storage practices to comply with requests by Italy’s privacy regulator. Google had to make it clear how users’ data was used and guarantee its deletion within a specified time frame.

Open Internet Project, whose members include Axel Springer and Getty Images, on Tuesday accused Alphabet unit Google of imposing anti-competitive curbs on Android smartphone makers, its second complaint against the US tech giant.
The group, which lodged a complaint about Google’s comparison shopping service with the European Commission about three years ago, urged the EU competition authority to take action.
“Google once again, in breach of EU antitrust rules, abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators, aiming to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search,” OIP said in a statement.
Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the regulator would assess the complaint. Google has said Android boosts rather than hurts competition.
The world’s most popular internet search engine has been in the EU crosshairs since April 2016, accused of using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.
Regulators said such tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser to get access to other Google apps.
The stakes are high for Google, which makes billions from advertising sales on Android phones through its apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail. It faces a fine up to 10 percent of its global turnover and an order to end anti-competitive practices if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

923,"March 6, 2017",Turkey: Google faces new antitrust investigation,"
Antitrust concerns about Google’s tying of its app store and services to use of the Android OS are spreading, as Turkey’s Competition Board has opened an inquiry, reversing an earlier decision.
Russian search company Yandex filed a complaint with the board in 2015, alleging that Google requires smartphone manufacturers to pre-load Google Play Store, Google Play Services and Google Mobile Services on any Android devices they sell, and to make Google Search the default search provider on those devices.
Such behavior would be a concern for Yandex, which offers app store, mobile mapping and search services of its own.
Yandex had filed similar complaints against Google elsewhere too, including in Russia and the European Union, while a similar case in the US was triggered by other complainants.
The Turkish complaint fizzled in December 2015, when the competition regulator ruled that there was no need for an inquiry since smartphone buyers were free to download other applications to the devices they purchased.
Unhappy with the ruling, Yandex appealed to the Ankara District Administrative Court, which in October 2016 suspended the board’s initial ruling.
On Monday, however, the board decided to launch an investigation into the business practices of Google, Google International, and its Turkish advertising and marketing subsidiary Google Reklamcılık ve Pazarlama.

According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google’s policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court.

Alphabet’s Google has been given until the end of October, the fourth extension, to rebut EU antitrust charges that it uses its dominant Android mobile operating system to block competitors, the European Commission said on Monday.
The Commission in April said the US technology giant’s demand that mobile phone makers pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps harms consumers and competition.
The EU watchdog had initially set a July 27 deadline for Google to respond to the charges. This had been extended three times at the company’s request, with the previous deadline September 20.
The new deadlines are Oct. 31 for the Android case and October 26 and October 13 for cases relating to online search advertising and shopping.
In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favoring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results while the AdSense case centres on the company’s measures which block competitors in online search advertising.
“In each of these cases, Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file. In line with normal practice, the Commission analyzed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defence,” Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email.
The EU antitrust enforcer intends to hit the company with deterrent fines in the Android and shopping cases, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters.
Google can be fined up to $7.4 billion, or 10 percent of its global turnover, for each case if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

In January, Google filed a complaint with the Supreme Court against a Moscow court’s ruling that its appeal against Federal Antimonopoly Service fines could not be heard by the Intellectual Property Court as requested by the company.
The Supreme Court economic dispute panel has decided to uphold the lower court’s decision, according to information published on its website. Details of the ruling were not published as the hearing was held behind closed doors.
Google has filed a total of three lawsuits against FAS and asked the service to extend the terms of complying with antitrust laws and paying its fines, a request turned down by the service. The FAS decision has been confirmed by two arbitration courts. The last appeal is currently with the Moscow District Federal Arbitration Court. The next hearing is due on February 28.
FAS seeks to fine Google $7.6 million for violating the country’s antitrust rules on the pre-installed mobile applications market. The violations included pre-installing a number of its apps along with Google Play, as well as precluding the installation of apps made by other companies. The case was launched after a complaint by Google’s local rival Yandex.
The antitrust watchdog called Google’s appeals “delaying tactics” after the company failed to stop its violations as well as failing to pay its multibillion-dollar fine.

927,"February 13, 2017",South Korea: Google investigated for practice against Samsung,"
Korea’s antitrust agency is investigating whether Google blocked Samsung from developing its own mobile operating system, reigniting an issue that first surfaced six years ago.
The investigation is expected to have a global impact considering that other smartphone manufacturers here and abroad, including LG Electronics, have made similar agreements with Google as Samsung did.
In a recent report submitted to the National Assembly, the Fair Trade Commission said it is currently investigating whether Google limited competition of the mobile OS market in light of new facts that have emerged and a changed market situation since its last decision.
In 2011, Google and Samsung Electronics signed a mobile application distribution agreement (MADA). That same year, the two leading Korean Web portals Naver and Daum (which was later acquired by Kakao) filed a complaint with the FTC claiming that Google forced smartphone manufacturers to pre-load its apps on the home screen of phones, including a default search engine, in exchange for use of the Android OS system for free. The Korean companies claimed that was meant to limit competition.
After investigating for two years, the FTC cleared Google on grounds that the manufacturers installed Google apps out of necessity and that there was no evidence of Google enforcing its powers to limit competition. Additionally, the FTC said it saw no major impact on the market as Naver dominated the local search engine market with a market share of 70 percent at the time.
However, that situation changed in May after the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement between Google and Samsung was disclosed. In the contract, the Korean smartphone maker agreed to load Google’s software package consisting of 12 apps, including its search engine, YouTube and Gmail on the main screen.

BT has become the first major telecoms company to back Google in a battle with EU regulators, defending the “stability and compatibility” of the Android operating system, which is in the sights of anti-trust regulators.
The EU says Google stifles competition by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install its search function and browser to access its other apps, such as Google Play, on Android.
EU regulators were already investigating the US company over the promotion of its own shopping service in its search engine before they opened a second front last year.
“We can confirm that our legal team has written to the European Commission regarding their investigation,” said a spokesman for BT.
“We told them BT is free to pre-install its own or third party apps on devices alongside pre-loaded Google apps.”
It was not clear why BT, which bought the EE mobile phone brand last year, had decided to go public on its position.
The EC has said that Google keeps a grip on the development of Android, which is an open source system, by requiring phone manufacturers to agree not to sell devices running on modified versions if they wanted to pre-install Google apps.
Critics claim Google is stifling innovation and the development of competing platforms, but BT said tight control over the platform was a positive not a negative.
“We also said that, as an app provider, we value the ongoing stability and compatibility of operating systems, whether they are ‘open source’ or ‘closed source’,” the spokesman said.

The proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner has drawn censure from both sides of the political aisle, as well as a Senate hearing that looked into the potential for the combined company to become a monopoly according to Taplin of The New York Times.
But if we are going to examine media monopolies, we should look first at Silicon Valley, not the fading phone business.
Mark Cuban, the internet entrepreneur, said at the meeting of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last week that the truly dominant companies in media distribution these days were Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.
“Facebook is without question in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for content delivery,” he said.
Look at the numbers. Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Facebook are among the 10 largest companies in the world. Alphabet alone has a market capitalization of around $550 billion. AT&T and Time Warner combined would be about $300 billion.
Alphabet has an 83 percent share of the mobile search market in the United States and just under 63 percent of the US mobile phone operating systems market. AT&T has a 32 percent market share in mobile phones and 26 percent in pay TV. The combined AT&T-Time Warner will have $8 billion in cash but $171 billion of net debt, according to the research company MoffettNathanson. Compare that to Alphabet’s balance sheet, with total cash of $76 billion and total debt of about $3.94 billion.

931,"December 4, 2016",Russia: Antitrust watchdog says Google will not ‘get off with fines’,"
Google will not “get off with fines” in the case of competition law violation, Head of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service Igor Artemyev said on Friday.
“They will not get off with fines. The thing is that there are so many different possibilities. Russia, a large state, will protect itself and the interests of consumers,” he said in an interview with NTV.
It was reported earlier that the Moscow Arbitration Court has decided to transfer Google’s appeal lodged against a judgement made by courts upholding the legality of the decision by FAS, to the intellectual property rights court.
In September 2015, the Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled that Google and Google Ireland. had breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex.

932,"November 16, 2016",EU: Google CEO to meet with Vestager,"
Google’s chief executive will meet with the European Union’s antitrust chief in Brussels on Friday, a week after Google filed its latest response to the EU’s barrage of antitrust cases against the search giant.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, will meet with the EU’s Margrethe Vestager, at the tail end of a short European trip this week, Google said on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the European Commission—the bloc’s antitrust regulator—confirmed the meeting, and said that it would cover antitrust issues.
The face-to-face discussion is the first between Mr. Pichai and Ms. Vestager since February. It comes as Google is bogged down in three sets of formal antitrust charges from the EU, covering multiple areas of its business, including its Android mobile operating system and its shopping-search service.
Google last week responded to allegations that it abuses the dominance of Android to promote its own search engine and apps by arguing that the operating system has helped competition rather than undermining it.
A week before, the company also rebutted allegations that it abused its dominance to promote its shopping service and a niche advertising product.
If the EU deems Google guilty, the regulator could impose hefty fines in each of the three cases and require that Google overhaul its operations in parts. The tech giant could also face costs and delays associated with years of legal battles, against the EU as well as private litigants seeking compensation for damages.

Google ha rechazado acusaciones por parte de la Unión Europea relativas al mal uso de su poderoso sistema de publicidad en línea. Google rechazó haber utilizado el dominio de mercado de Android para bloquear la entrada de competidores.
La empresa ha sido acusada de utilizar una posición dominante en el mercado de los teléfonos inteligentes en Europa para obligar a los fabricantes de dispositivos a pre-instalar servicios de Google, al mismo tiempo que dejan fuera a otros competidores. La Comisión Europea, en voz de la Comisionada Margrethe Vestager, emitió una serie de objeciones contra Google en abril de éste año.
Google defendió su posición, recalcando la naturaleza de código abierto de su istema operativo. Comparó también a Android con sus rivales de Apple y Microsoft. De acuerdo con datos de google, los dispositivos Apple cuentan con 39 apps instaladas, todas de Apple, mientras que 39 de las 47 aplicaciones pre-instaladas en el teléfono Lumia 550 de Microsoft son también de la propia compañía.
En un artículo publicado el jueves Kent Walker, abogado de Google, expresó que “la respuesta presentada el día de hoy demuestra cómo el ecosistema de Android busca un equilibrio entre los intereses de los usuarios, desarrolladores, fabricantes y operadores de redes. Android no ha dañado la competencia, la ha hecho crecer.”

934,"November 10, 2016",EU: Google responds: “Android hasn’t hurt competition”,"
Google—as expected—has dismissed the European Commission’s charge that the ad giant abused Android’s dominance to block its competitors in the market.
The company is accused of using Android’s position as the dominant smartphone operating system in Europe to force manufacturers to pre-install Google services while locking out competitors.
Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent a so-called Statement of Objections to Google in April.
On Thursday, the multinational corporation defended its position and spoke of the open source nature of the Android operating system. It also compared a typical Android smartphone to rivals Apple and Microsoft. According to Google, 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple on iPhone 7, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft.
In a blog post on Thursday, Google general counsel Kent Walker said: “The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.”

935,"November 8, 2016",EU: Google says Commissioners don’t understand antitrust law,"
In an effort to soften the European Commission’s inquiry into business practices, Google has claimed that those bringing charges against it do not fully understand antitrust law.
Kent Walker, senior VP and general counsel, took to the company’s corporate blog to respond to the commission’s concerns over how it has prevented rival sites and services from competing in the areas of online advertising and sales. In his blog post, Walker was quick to point out that the Commission had failed to acknowledge the role that Amazon plays in how consumers shop online.
Google’s comparison shopping engine, “Shopping” is currently under investigation in the EU for the way in which it makes it more difficult for competing sites to attract users due to the large user base that the search engine currently has. Though the company sees Amazon as a rival, the Commission does not believe that it can even be considered one as it has paid other shopping comparison sites for referrals in the past.
Walker went on to claim that the reason online shopping has evolved into what it is today is as a direct result of competition, saying: “All of these services — search engines, price comparison sites, merchant platforms, and merchants — compete with each other in online shopping. That’s why online shopping is so dynamic and has grown so much in recent years”.

Russia’s antitrust watchdog has given Google and Google Ireland until the end of November to comply with the country’s competition laws when pre-installing apps on Android phones, the watchdog told Russian news agencies.
Google has been entangled in an antitrust dispute with the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service over its practices of bundling apps for its Android platform.
Failure to comply with the order could mean a 500,000 ruble ($7,825) fine on top of the existing fine of 438,000 rubles imposed in early August. The company is already contesting the FAS’s decision to fine the company.
In early August the antitrust regulator said FAS and Google had failed to settle the dispute out of court.

937,"November 6, 2016",UK: Dropbox and Google commit to ‘fairer’ deals for customers,"
Cloud service providers have agreed to give customers fairer deals, following a review by a UK government watchdog.
Google, Dropbox, BT and Mozy have all agreed to terms set out by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which are designed to provide a more transparent experience for cloud customers, including changes to contracts and price increases.
In a statement today, the four companies committed to a number of changes, including an assurance that customers will be given “clearer information about how they can cancel if they don’t want to accept proposed changes, and how and when they can get refunds”.
The cloud providers will also give more notice to customers when price increases or contract changes are coming, and that transparency of auto-renewing contracts will be improved.
Launched in December 2015, the CMA’s review found that some cloud storage providers were using contract practices that could breach consumer protection law.
“People increasingly rely on cloud storage as a safe and convenient place to keep family photos, music and important documents,” said Nisha Arora, CMA senior director for consumer enforcement. “It is vital they are treated fairly and are not hit by unexpected changes to prices or storage levels.”
“We are pleased that these four companies have followed the three others which agreed commitments earlier this year to improve their terms and conditions. We want to ensure that companies treat their customers fairly and comply with consumer law; those that don’t are at risk of enforcement action,” added Arora.

938,"November 3, 2016","EU: Google formally rejects antitrust charges, says evidence is lacking","
Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines.
The US technology giant’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and US rivals.
The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time.
Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals.
“We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ‘favoring’ – that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said.

939,"November 2, 2016",EU: German minister aims to escalate crackdown on Google,"
Germany’s justice minister has called for reform of European competition law to make it easier for authorities to crack down on Google, in a further sign of the deteriorating relationship between Berlin and Silicon Valley.
Heiko Maas said antitrust rules provided “little leverage for dealing with Google’s market dominance” and had to change. European competition law needed to be rewritten “to apportion a bigger role to consumer protection”, he added.
His comments come against the backdrop of repeated clashes between big US technology firms on the one hand and Brussels and Berlin on the other over issues ranging from competition and tax to online privacy.
Mr Maas said Google had more than 95 per cent of the German search market, yet “we still don’t know what criteria it uses to rank its search results” and whether it favoured its own services.
He said he used Google’s search engine all the time, “but I would like objective results, and not results that first and foremost serve Google’s commercial interests”.

The European Union is granting Google a week-long extension to respond to charges claiming the company is abusing its dominance in online search advertising.
The Mountain View, Calif. company now has until Nov. 3 to respond to antitrust concerns over Adsense, its search advertising project, European Commission spokesman Richard Cardoso told Reuters.
“Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file. In line with normal practice, the commission analyzed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defense,” Cardoso wrote in an email to Reuters.
Google has previously received multiple extensions to formally respond to EU antitrust charges over its comparison shopping service and Android operating system.
Adsense is the third Google product to raise antitrust concerns with the European Commission — the executive arm of the European Union. The Commission argues that Google has taken advantage of its leader in the online advertising market to maintain its dominance and block competitors.

The EU’s antitrust regulator, who has accused Alphabet unit Google of stifling competition in three separate cases, left open the possibility of further action against the US technology giant.
Complaints have been made about Google’s practice of copying content from websites without payment in what is known as scraping. Complainants include News Corp, Getty Images and German publishers.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s Competition Commissioner said this was not on her radar for now but did not rule out future action. She is concentrating on the three ongoing cases, the first of which has dragged on since 2010. Antitrust cases typically take between three to eight years or even longer.
“We are not taking any decisions yet,” Vestager told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organized by the International Bar Association on Friday.
The European Competition Commission has in the last year charged Google of using its market power to promote its own products at rivals’ expense after a spate of complaints from European and US companies.

EU regulators who are investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power have has not extended their scrutiny to its tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the EU’s antitrust chief said on Monday.
Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now.
“So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one,” Vestager told reporters.
She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google’s 130-million-pound back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticized as a derisory amount.
Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission’s antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation.
“I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time,” she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday.
“But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law.”
Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her.

Alphabet has been given yet another extension to file its respond to charges in Europe that it has misused the dominance of its Android mobile platform to lock out competition by promoting its own services over and above others.
Reuters reported the extension today, which gives the company until the last day of this month to file its rebuttal, and follows another extension last month — at the time touted as Google’s last — which pushed the deadline from September 7 to September 20. The original EC deadline for Google’s response was in April so we’re heading for six months later already at this stage.
At the weekend Reuters reported the EC is preparing to fine the company in the Android probe — citing a charge sheet it had seen, although it did not provide details of the size of the impending fine.
The charge sheet also apparently includes an EC instruction to Google to cease making payments to smartphone makers as an incentive to pre-install its apps.

An amicable agreement can be signed between Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service and Google at any stage of case hearings, as long as the US giant admits violations and fixes them, the service’s Deputy Director Anatoly Golomolzin said Monday.

The antitrust agency found Google guilty for abusing its dominant position on the local market of preinstalled application stores and ordered it to revise contracts with device manufacturers, when the US company used to force producers to install application store Google Play along with other programs.
The agency  fined Google $6.79 million, although the pay date expired in late August.

Dos mujeres dedicadas a la composición musical han presentado una demanda contra la unidad de competencia del Departamento de Justicia (DOJ), la cual ha sugerido anular los contratos existentes de las artistas para beneficiar al gigante de la tecnología Google. 
En un punto clave para el caso, el DOJ propone que tanto BMI y la ASCAP deben aceptar el otorgar licencias al 100% – asegurando que otras empresas que contratan licencias de reproducción solo deban negociar con un compositor, sin necesidad de consultar a otros co-escritores y compositores secundarios. 
La demanda presentada por las mujeres sostiene que el DOJ ha rebasado su autoridad al formular esta propuesta, acusando personalmente tanto a la Fiscal Loretta Lynch y su asistente directa, la Fiscal Genral Renata Hesse. Hesse estuvo involucrada durante años en temas de competencia para Google, cliente del despacho en que ella trabajaba, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.
Como Fiscal General y jefa de la división de competencia del DOJ, Hesse ha sido la principal arquitecta de una controversial propuesta, la cual obligaría a los compositores musicales a entregar todos sus derechos al momento de vender su obra. La llamada “Licencia al 100%” afectaría a compositores estadounidenses, al igual que canadienses y británicos. 
“Trabajé extensamente para Google en temas de competencia” admitió Hesse en 2008. Los detractores de la propuesta consideran esta propuesta como parte de una tendencia por parte del DOJ, en la cual el gobierno del presidente Obama ha nombrado a numerosos funcionarios con vínculos cercanos a Silicon Valley para tomar puestos clave en las agencias reguladoras, incluyendo la FCC y FTC – supuestamente agencias “independientes” bajo la supervisión del Congreso.

Two independent women songwriters are suing the US antitrust department of the Department of Justice over its proposal to rip up songwriters’ contracts to make them more Google-friendly.
Crucially, in the remarks, the DoJ proposes that both ASCAP and BMI must accept 100 per cent licensing – so Spotify and other giant music licensees only need to negotiate with one songwriter, without bothering to check with named co-writers.
The lawsuit argues that the DoJ overstepped its authority in its plan, and also names as defendants both the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, and acting assistant A-G Renata Hesse, who for some years worked on antitrust issues for Google, a client of her then employer, law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.
As deputy attorney general at the DoJ and head of its antitrust division, Hesse is the architect of a proposal to compel songwriters to hand over their rights. The so-called “100 per cent licensing” proposal ensnares not just US songwriters, but British authors and composers too.
“I did a lot of work for Google on [antitrust],” Hesse admitted in 2008. Critics see the DoJ’s desire to rip up songwriters contracts as part of a broader trend, in which the Obama Administration appointed Silicon Valley-friendly officials and Obama supporters in key regulatory posts at the FCC and the FTC, nominally “independent” agencies that report to Congress.

In light of this commercial success and certain disputed business practices, Android has come under substantial attention from competition authorities. We present key aspects of Google’s strategy in mobile, focusing on Android-related practices that may have exclusionary effects. We then assess Google’s practices under competition law and, where appropriate, suggest remedies to right the violations we uncover.

Google had appealed the ruling while FAS said an out-of court deal was possible should Google admit to violations of antitrust laws and pay a fine.
“The talks with Google on the issue of the settlement agreement have come to nothing. Now it’s up to the court to draw a line under this case,” Interfax quoted Elena Zaeva, head of FAS’s Department for Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technology, as saying.
Zaeva was quoted as saying a court would hear Google’s appeal on Wednesday.

958,"August 14, 2016",South Korea: Google being investigated for antitrust claim,"
South Korea’s antitrust regulator said on Friday it is looking into whether Google has violated the country’s anticompetition laws, acknowledging formal scrutiny of the global internet search company for the first time.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission disclosed the investigation in a brief statement, without commenting on the nature of the probe nor any potential antitrust violations. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month the KFTC inspected Google’s Seoul headquarters in July.
The antitrust body’s statement came after a local media report said the KFTC had decided to clear Google of anticompetition charges involving the pre-loading of the company’s apps on smartphones running on the Android operating system.
Google, whose corporate parent is Alphabet, declined to comment.
While it wasn’t clear whether the probe would lead to any formal charges, the investigation opens another regulatory front for Google. The firm was fined $6.8 million in Russia on Thursday and faces multiple European Union antitrust charges.
The KFTC has investigated Google before. In 2013, the regulator cleared Google of wrongdoing following a probe into whether the company hurt competition by forcing smartphone makers using Android to pre-load its search engine on the handsets.

959,"August 11, 2016","Russia: Light tap on the wrist, $6.7m dollar antitrust fine for Google","
Russia’s antimonopoly watchdog fined Alphabet Google 438 million rubles on Thursday for competition violations, the latest step in a long-running and high-profile legal battle.
The fine comes ahead of a court appeal later this month by Google against the watchdog’s ruling that it violated laws by bundling, or pre-loading, a suite of apps on mobile phones for sale on the Russian market. The legal battle goes to the heart of a struggle for Russian market share between Google and Russian technology company Yandex, which specializes in internet and mobile phone-related goods and services.
“The fine itself is just a fine. What will decide things going ahead is the court case that will either help or hurt Yandex’s distribution of products and services on Android,” said Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital.
Google said it had received notice of the fine and would analyze it closely before deciding next steps.
“In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia,” Google said in a statement.
The Russian watchdog last fall ordered Google to end violations of antitrust laws in a victory for Yandex NV, which has a rival internet search engine.

960,"July 25, 2016",UE: Google comienza su “Campaña de Encanto” con $450 millones,"
Google utiliza tácticas de cabildeo ‘suaves’ y ‘duras’ en sus intentos por evitar sanciones por parte de las autoridades de competencia europeas. La empresa de tecnología se ha lanzado al ataque, intentando ganar adeptos en Europa mientras se enfrenta a una serie de complicaciones de competencia, en conflicto directo con los reguladores antimonopolio del viejo continente.
Cálculos independientes han determinado que Google habría apartado aproximadamente $450 millones de dólares para llevar a cabo su ‘cabildeo suave’ o ‘soft lobbying’ entre 2015 y 2017. La campaña, mediante la cual Google buscará ganarse el “corazón y la mente” del público europeo, incluirá cursos de entrenamiento digital para docentes en Irlanda, así como una exhibición de arte interactivo en el Instituto Cultural Google ubicado en París.
En 2014 Google gastó hasta $4.2 millones de dólares en campañas buscando congraciarse con la clase política en Bruselas y la Comisión Europea. Esto es bastante menos de lo que Google gastó en el mismo periodo ($17 millones) para cortejar a Washington D.C.
Hacia finales del año, Google espera gastar otros $75 millones adicionales para ayudar a unos 2 millones de ciudadanos europeos a “aprender las habilidades digitales, como el comercio electrónico y la mercadotecnia (basadas en los mismos productos de Google), lo cual impulsa el importante objetivo de los políticos europeos que buscan crear un Mercado Único digital que pueda dar un mayor estímulo al crecimiento económico.”

961,"July 21, 2016",South Korea: Android investigation leads to Google office inspections,"
South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission said it conducted an investigation into Google Inc. over allegedly forcing smartphone makers to use Android operating system in their handsets.
In 2013, after two years of investigation, the FTC acquitted Google of harming competition by pressuring mobile phone makers to preload its search engine when offering Android to those producers.
The FTC had reviewed the case and eventually came to the conclusion to dismiss the charges, saying that Google’s preload requirement does not restrict competition as the market share remains approximately 10 percent.
Industry sources said the FTC returned to looking into the allegations again after the European Union brought similar charges against Google for anticompetitive behaviors earlier this year.

962,"July 20, 2016",EU: Google Goes on $450M “Charm Offensive”,"
Google is using hard and soft lobbying to endear itself to Europeans while the EC continues to slap the company with antitrust complaints.
Google is running a “charm offensive” in Europe, wooing the public as it faces a growing list of antitrust objections from regulators there, The New York Times reported July 19.
The Times estimates Google’s earmarked spending for “soft lobbying,” for the time between 2015 and 2017 to be approximately $450 million. Such heart-and-minds campaigns include free digital training courses for Irish schoolteachers and a high-tech interactive art exhibition at Google’s Cultural Institute in Paris.
In 2014, Google’s spending on political lobbying in Brussels, the seat of the European Commission, reached $4.2 million, according to the report (which added that Google spent significantly more—$17 million—that same year lobbying in Washington).
By year’s end, The Times added, Google will spend another $75 million to help approximately 2 million Europeans to learn “digital skills like e-commerce and online marketing (often based on the company’s own advertising products), an important goal for European policy makers, who are trying to create a digital single market to jump-start economic growth.”

963,"July 18, 2016",EU: Google boss speaks on taxes and Brexit,"
Amidst various charges slammed against it by the European Union, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has defended the company, warning of the potential fallout from the exit of Britain from the EU.
Speaking on current tax issues being faced by Google in some European countries such as France and Spain, Pichai said that while his company respected tax laws, governments need to do more to guarantee “better results”—emphasizing that Google invested “very heavily” in Europe where it employed 14,000 people.
The European Union has been throwing the books at Google in the last couple of years—especially accusing the company of unfair dominance as regards some of its products. Last week, Google was slammed with more charges as the EU slammed more charges as regards AdWords and AdSense.
Speaking to Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper on some of the tax charges brought against the company, Pichai said “As a global company, we find ourselves between the conflicting priorities of international tax law.
“Based on the structure of existing tax law, most companies pay the bulk of their taxes in their home countries.” He said his company had not violated any law in the books; short of advising governments to take proper action if they wanted to ensure more revenues remained at home, per The Daily Mail.
On Brexit (Britain’s recently concluded referendum to exit the European Union), the Google CEO said it was important for Google to operate in a “unified digital market” in Europe. Pichai said it was a “challenge” for a multinational company “to come to terms with different laws and regulations in each country.”
“This complexity makes greater engagement difficult, which also plays out in investment,” the Google CEO; adding that Brexit won’t pose much of a problem to large companies who were better able to deal with such issues than the smaller ones.

By Su-Wan Wang & Elizabeth Xiao-Ru Wang –
The Taiwanese Competition Authority has recently confronted issues surrounding Google’s search practices. A number of independent providers of digital map programs complained to the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (“TFTC”) about Google’s search result algorithms. These firms alleged that Google’s search results gave Google Maps favorable placement on its search results pages, reflecting an unfair competitive practice. The map providers also claimed that Google’s conduct deprived them of business opportunities, resulting in a loss of revenue, and violating Taiwan’s competition statutes. In responding to these concerns, the TFTC conducted a multi-year investigation and closed the probe in the summer of 2015 with a finding of no violations.
This article explains how the TFTC examined whether Google had market dominance, and whether Google’s conduct constituted an abuse of dominance. The authors go on to describe the two primary economic tests employed by the TFTC for the agency’s refusal to deal analysis, the essential facility test and the profit sacrifice test.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai hit back Sunday at accusations that the global internet giant failed to pay enough taxes in Europe, and warned of the potential fallout from Britain leaving the EU.
As Google faces a raft of fiscal probes across the continent, Pichai told Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the US company invested “very heavily” in Europe and employed 14,000 people there.

He said that Google respected the laws on the books, and that governments would have to take action if they wanted to ensure more revenues stayed at home.
“Only the further development of the global tax system by politicians can lead to better results,” he said.
Asked about a Brexit or British exit from the EU following last month’s watershed referendum, Pichai underlined the importance to Google of a “unified digital market” in Europe.
He said it was a “challenge” for a multinational company “to come to terms with different laws and regulations in each country”.

966,"July 14, 2016",EU: Antitrust regulators open third front against Google,"
EU regulators have brought a third antitrust charge against Alphabet Inc’s Google, accusing it of blocking rivals in online search advertising, a move that raises the pressure on the company to modify its practices or face hefty fines.
The European Commission on Thursday also reinforced an existing charge against the world’s most popular Internet search engine that its search results favor Google’s own shopping service over those of rivals.
“Google has come up with many innovative products that have made a difference to our lives. But that doesn’t give Google the right to deny other companies the chance to compete and innovate,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a news conference in Brussels.
The Commission said it had sent two charge sheets known as “statements of objections” to Google.
The first accuses Google of having abused its 80 percent market share in the placement of search advertising on third party websites.
This relates to Google’s “AdSense for Search” platform, in which Google acts as an intermediary for websites such as those of online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers, with searches producing results that include search ads.
“We have also raised concerns that Google has hindered competition by limiting the ability of its competitors to place search adverts on third-party websites, which stifles consumer choice and innovation,” Vestager said.

Google won extra time from European Union regulators to defend itself from European Union antitrust allegations that it wields its power over smartphone software to crush competition for mobile applications.
Alphabet Inc.’s Google now has until Sept. 7 to respond to a statement of objections sent in April, said Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the European Commission. The company sought additional time to review evidence held by regulators, he said.
The EU “will carefully consider Google’s response before taking a decision on how to proceed” with the case, he said. Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from Bloomberg.
By sending a statement of objections, the EU paved the way for potentially huge fines and radical changes to the way the company does business. The move came a year after the EU issued a formal complaint over Google’s comparison-shopping service. Regulators are also preparing objections targeting Google’s advertising business and an additional complaint over an older probe into its shopping-search service.

Las autoridades reguladoras de la competencia en la Unión Europea han anunciado que prepararán una nueva ronda de cargos formales en contra de Alphabet Inc y su empresa insignia Google. Los cargos derivan de las acciones de Google en su servicio de compras en línea. 
La llamada ‘declaración suplementaria de objeciones’ seguramente incrementará la gravedad de las acusaciones de la UE en contra de Google, a quien acusa de utilizar su dominio sobre los servicios de búsqueda en internet para dar ventaja a su propio servicio de ventas. El caso podría crear importantes precedentes para la empresa norteamericana y su comportamiento en otros mercados, como los on sus servicios locales y de búsqueda de viajes. 
La comisión europea no ha emitido comentarios al respecto. Google también ha mantenido el silencio en cuanto al anuncio. La comisión presentó los primeros cargos contra Google en abril de 2015, acusando a la empresa de dar preferencia a su propio servicio de compras en los resultados de búsqueda. 
La jefa en materias de competencia de la UE, Margrethe Vestager, ha dicho que continúan las preocupaciones acerca del abuso de Google, facilitado por su dominio del sector de las búsquedas en internet.

European Union competition regulators are preparing to issue an additional layer of formal charges as soon as late July against Alphabet Inc.’s Google over its behavior with its shopping service, according to people familiar with the matter.
The so-called supplementary statement of objections will likely sharpen the EU’s previous accusations that Google uses its dominance in search to favor its own service in the shopping market, according to one of the people familiar. That could shape the case to create possible precedents for how the US tech firm also operates in other domains, including with its local or travel services.
The European Commission, the bloc’s antitrust body, declined to comment. Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Commission first filed formal charges against Google in April 2015 for favoring its comparison-shopping service in search results.
The EU’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager then said she continues to have concerns that Google is also abusing its dominance with those other search services.

Autoridades hacendarias de España realizaron una inspección sorpresa en las oficinas de Google España, en lo que es el más reciente de muchos dolores de cabeza regulatorios para el gigante tecnológico estadounidense. 
La inspección fue llevada a cabo en las oficinas centrales de Google en Madrid, así como en un espacio de incubadora para proyectos tecnológicos ubicado en la capital española. La operación, autorizada por una corte local, involucró a más de 30 investigadores. 
Google España emitió un comunicado e el que declara: “Cumplimos con las leyes de impuestos en España, tal y como lo hacemos en todos los países en que opera Google. Estamos cooperando con las autoridades españolas para responder todas sus dudas, como siempre.”
Según comentarios de funcionarios cercanos al caso, la investigación en España es similar a otras investigaciones llevadas a cabo contra la empresa en otros países europeos, notablemente en Francia e Italia. 
En todos los casos, las inspecciones se enfocan en la política de Google de canalizar la mayoría de sus ingresos en Europa a través de la economía de Irlanda, la cual tiene niveles de impuestos bajos. De tal manera, la empresa reduce sus responsabilidades fiscales en el mercado europeo. Irlanda ha sido un destino popular para las grandes multinacionales que operan en Europa, incluyendo a Apple.

A court rejected a petition from Google, seeking to have the regulator’s decision annulled. Management staff at the regulator said that the size of the fine could be reduced from 7 percent to 1 percent of annual revenue, if the company reaches an amicable settlement.

973,"June 30, 2016",Spain: Tax inspectors raid Google’s Madrid office,"
Spanish tax inspectors raided the offices of Google in Spain on Thursday, the latest in a series of regulatory worries for the US technology group in Europe.
The raids took place at Google’s Spanish headquarters in central Madrid and in a tech incubator run by the group in the capital. They were authorised by a Madrid court and involved more than 30 officials and investigators.
Google Spain said in a statement: “We comply with Spanish tax laws just as we do in all countries where we operate. We are co-operating with the authorities in Spain in order to answer all their questions, as always.
According to one official briefed on the case, the Spanish probe is similar to the recent string of high-profile tax investigations launched in other European countries, most notably in France and Italy.
They all centre on Google’s policy to channel the bulk of its European earnings through low-tax Ireland, and so limit the group’s fiscal liabilities in other European markets where it does business. Apple has also come under fire from European regulators over its tax arrangement with Ireland, which has long been a popular jurisdiction for US technology groups and multinationals.

974,"June 27, 2016",EU: Google could face yet another antitrust complaint,"
Despite the turmoil in Europe from Brexit last week, it’s business as usual for European antitrust regulators as they prepare what could be a third formal antitrust “Statement of Objections” against Google. According to Bloomberg a third complaint, surrounding Google AdWords agreements, is probably on the way:
EU officials sent the search giant’s critics requests to allow their evidence to be shared with Google, said the people, who asked not to be named because the case is private. One request was sent as recently as last week, one person said. Such a move is typically a precursor to a formal EU statement of objections cataloging how a firm may have violated EU antitrust law.
The potential charges come more than five years after the initial investigation was announced. The probe focuses on exclusivity provisions in Google AdWords and search contracts with publishers, which allegedly prohibit them from using other services.
The investigation was dormant for some time and revived earlier this year at the behest of European Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager. Beyond this, Google is contending with two formal antitrust complaints in Europe, involving “search bias” in shopping search results and surrounding app pre-install rules in Android contracts.
Given the information above and the trajectory of the Commission’s moves, it appears that Google will be fighting a third antitrust battle in Europe relatively soon.
Last year Google’s made roughly $75 billion in revenue. The Commission has the power to levy fines of up to 10 percent of global revenues. And though it’s unlikely, it’s hypothetically possible that Google could soon be facing potential exposure of up to $21 billion.

Protecting Competition vs. Protecting Competitors: Assessing the Antitrust Complaints Against Google
Geeta Gouri (Independent) & Michael A. Salinger (Boston University)
Abstract:      We examine the merits of competition cases brought against Google with respect to alleged search bias. The four key steps in a structured investigation into an alleged abuse of dominance/monopolization/unfair method of competition are:
1) characterization of the conduct,
2) market definition,
3) assessment of market power, and
4) assessment of competitive effects.
Of these, the last step is the most important as it addresses the ultimate issue in the investigation. We analyse the fourth step and argue that the behaviour at issue is competitive. We then go through the first three steps and show that while economically sound analysis of those steps clarifies the proper answer to the fourth step, an overly mechanistic approach to those steps can obscure clear analysis in the fourth step.

977,"June 6, 2016",US: Supreme Court rejects Google’s appeal in AdWords case,"
The US Supreme Court on Monday rejected Google’s bid to throw out a class action lawsuit involving claims that the company deceived California advertisers about the placement of Internet ads through its Adwords service.
The court’s decision not to hear the case leaves in place a September 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that the litigation could move forward as a class action representing advertisers who used the service between 2004 and 2008. Google is part of Alphabet.
The 2008 lawsuit accused Google of violating California fair advertising laws because it misled advertisers about where the ads would be placed. The Adwords service was primarily aimed at placing ads next to relevant Google Internet search results. But the plaintiffs said Google should have disclosed that ads would also appear in undesirable places such as error pages and undeveloped websites known as parked domains.
A federal district court judge in 2012 ruled that the case could not move forward as a class action in part because each advertiser would receive different damages. Each advertiser would have paid a different sum for the ads in question, the judge said. The appeals court reversed the district court, prompting Google to ask the Supreme Court to intervene.
Under a 2011 US Supreme Court precedent involving claims brought by employees against Wal-Mart Stores, class actions can move forward only if each plaintiff has a similar claim and that claim can be resolved on a class-wide basis.
The Supreme Court has shied away from taking new class action cases since the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia, who had authored the 2011 Wal-Mart ruling. Scalia had been a leader of the court’s moves in recent years to curb class action litigation, although that trend was not borne out in three class action cases decided during its current term.

Google ha salido triunfante de un importante caso de violación de derechos de propiedad intelectual en contra de Oracle,  evitando así el pago de supuestos daños por los cuales Oracle exigía hasta $9,000 millones de dólares. El fallo a favor de Google establece también un principio legal que podría tener un fuerte impacto en el desarrollo de la industria del software. 
El fallo de la corte federal de San Francisco llegó tras casi 4 días de deliberación por parte del jurado, el cual debió considerar una serie de temas complejos relacionados a la forma en que el código de computadora es desarrollado, permitiendo a distintos sistemas interactuar en un mundo cada vez más conectado entre sí. 
El caso surge de la decisión por parte de Google de utilizar parte del código de Java – una plataforma de programación adquirida hace tiempo por Oracle – durante el desarrollo del sistema operativo Android Mobile. El software copiado formo parte esencial en el desarrollo de Android por parte de desarrolladores externos, quienes lo utilizaron para determinar las interfaces de programación que deben actuar como “ganchos” para así permitir a distintos programas y aplicaciones interactuar entre si. 
Oracle ganó un caso en corte de apelaciones, la cual habría declarado que los API de Java estarían protegidas por la ley de derechos de autor. Sin embargo, éste jueves el jurado en cambio se mostró a favor de Google y su argumento, en el cual sostiene que el material utilizado quedaría cubierto por la doctrina de “fair use” (uso justificado), el cual permite el uso de material protegido bajo ciertas circunstancias. 
Oracle inmediatamente se declaró opuesto al fallo, diciendo que “encontramos numerosas bases para presentar una apelación”. La empresa anunció que llevará el caso al circuito federal de apelaciones – el mismo que anteriormente apoyó la protección de los API.

981,"May 26, 2016",US: Google beats Oracle in $9bn copyright case,"
Google has won a high-profile copyright case against Oracle, fending off a $9bn damages claim and establishing a legal principle that is likely to have a broad impact on software development.
The verdict, in federal court in San Francisco, came after nearly four days of jury deliberations over complex issues to do with how developers write code to allow systems to link effectively in the increasingly interconnected online world.
The case was triggered by Google’s decision to use some of the code from Java — a software platform later acquired by Oracle — when it was developing its Androidmobile operating system. The software it copied played a key role in helping outside developers write apps to run on Android, determining the so-called application programming interfaces that act as “hooks” to enable different programs to interoperate.
Oracle had already won an appeals court ruling that the APIs were covered by copyright law. But on Thursday the 10-person jury sided with Google’s argument that the internet company was covered by “fair use”, the doctrine which allows use of copyrighted material in limited circumstances.
Oracle immediately said it believed “there are numerous grounds for appeal”, and that it would bring the case to the federal circuit — the same court that had earlier upheld its claim that copyright law should apply to APIs.

The antitrust controversy swirling around Alphabet, the holding company for Google, just escalated a bit further. A shareholder this week filed a lawsuit that claims senior executives and the board of directors violated their duties to the company by blessing anti-competitive arrangements related to Android software.
In a 53-page complaint filed in state court, shareholder Robert Jessup accuses Alphabet CEO Larry Page, President Sergey Brin, and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt of mismanagement that could lead to $7.4 billion in fines at the hands of the European Commission, which is suing Google on a raft of antitrust charges.
“For years, the Board has allowed Alphabet to use Android as a Trojan Horse for other services offered by the Company – imposing anticompetitive restrictions on device manufacturers and developers through licensing arrangements for proprietary Android technology and applications,” the complaint reads.
The complaint also names board members, including renowned venture capitalist John Doerr and Stanford University President John Hennessy, as well as members of the firm’s audit committee. The lawsuit asks the defendants to compensate Alphabet for harm the company may suffer as a result of antitrust charges, and it asks the court to shake up Alphabet’s leadership structure.

983,"May 24, 2016",France: Paris police raid Google’s offices in €1.6 billion  tax investigation,"
Parisian police have raided Google’soffices in the French capital, reportedly as part of an investigation into the company’s alleged tax evasion.
France is trying to get €1.6 billion in back taxes out of the company. As elsewhere in Europe, the authorities think Google owes a lot of money for having funnelled proceeds through its Irish subsidiary.
According to Le Parisien, the raid took place early this morning, with around 100 investigators taking part.
“We comply with the tax law in France as in every other country in which we operate,” Google said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with the authorities in Paris to answer their questions, as always.”
The tax affair is not the only worry for Google in France at the moment. The French competition authority on Monday launched an inquiry into the exploitation of Internet users’ data in the online ad industry, in which Google is one of the major players, and the firm is also in a legal fight with the French privacy watchdog, CNIL, over its application of the so-called right to be forgotten.

984,"May 23, 2016",France: Watchdog launches online ad inquiry with Google in its sights,"
The French competition authority launched an inquiry on Monday on the exploitation of Internet users’ data for the online advertising industry, putting major personal data collectors such as Alphabet’s Google in its sights.
The inquiry, which includes a public consultation starting early next year, will result in non-binding recommendations but may become the basis of a formal antitrust investigation if infringements are observed.
“Can everyone access these data, which are fundamental inputs of this business activity? Are there exclusion strategies being put in place?” Bruno Lasserre, president of the France’s antitrust regulator, told a press conference.
Google, the world’s most popular Web search engine, collects data globally from Internet users and companies via the free professional and personal services it offers online and on smart mobile devices.

985,"May 19, 2016",France: Google fights Right-to-Be-Forgotten fine at top court,"
Google has taken a fight against France’s privacy watchdog to the country’s highest administrative court, challenging a March decision to fine it 100,000 euros for failing to remove “right-to-be-forgotten” requests from global search results.
“As a matter of both law and principle, we disagree with this demand,” Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel said in a blog post Thursday. “We comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. But if French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries — perhaps less open and democratic — start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach?”
CNIL, the French data protection commission, levied the fine on Alphabet Inc.’s Google in March after a tussle that started with a 15-day ultimatum last year for the Mountain View, California-based company to comply with the order. The French probe was triggered by several complaints from people who wanted the search engine to delete search results that pointed to personal information about them. While Google removed links from its French “.fr” domain, it didn’t take them off the “.com” domain visible to European web users.
The European Union’s highest court in a precedent-setting rulingin May 2014 created a right to be forgotten — allowing people to seek the deletion of links on search engines if the information was outdated or irrelevant. The case provoked a furor, with Google creating a special panel to advise it on implementing the law. The group opposed applying the ruling beyond EU domains.

986,"May 16, 2016",EU: Google could face record 3 billion euro antitrust fine,"
Google could face a record antitrust fine of around €3 billion from theEuropean Commission in the coming weeks.
The European Union has accused Google of promoting itsshopping service in internet searches at the expense of rivalservices in a case that has dragged on since late 2010.
Following three failed attempts at a compromise in the past six years, Google is believed not to have any plans to settle the allegations unless the EU’s Antitrust Commission changed its stance.
Google will also be banned from continuing to manipulate search results to favour itself and harm rivals.
The Commission can fine firms up to 10 per cent of theirannual sales, which in Google’s case would be a maximum possiblesanction of more than €6 billion (£4.7 billion).
The biggest antitrustfine to date was a €1.1 billion fine imposed on chip-makerIntel in 2009.
But the Telegraph reported the fine was likely to be in the region of €3 billion.

La directora de competencia de la Unión Europea, Margrethe Vestager, ha revelado que podría abrir un tercer frente en su enfrentamiento con el gigante informático Google, toda vez que la comisión analiza la posibilidad de llevar a cabo una investigación sobre los servicios de publicidad de la misma. 
Vestager, quien ya ha presentado quejas contra la empresa por casos relacionados a su sistema operativo Android, así como a su servicio de tienda en línea, ha dicho que buscarán resolver este nuevo caso “en un tiempo razonable. Espero que podamos darlo por terminado, o llegar a una conclusión preeliminar”. La investigación será tomada de forma separada de los otros casos, por lo que “llevará su propio ritmo”. 
La funcionaria de origen danés ha causado revuelo tras presentar cargos contra Google, acusando a la empresa de abusar de su poder como el principal proveedor de sistemas operativos para plataformas móviles del mundo para intentar imponer sus servicios de búsqueda y navegación a sus clientes y millones de usuarios.

988,"May 15, 2016",EU: Vestager considers third antitrust case against Google,"
European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may open a third front in her battle with Google as she studies whether to escalate a probe into the Internet search giant’s advertising services.
Vestager, who has already sent complaints to the company over its Android mobile-phone software and shopping service, said she wants to reach a decision on the latest case within a “reasonable time frame.”
“I hope that we can end that or come to a preliminary conclusion,” Vestager said of the probe into Google’s AdWords service. The investigation is separate from the other cases and “has its own rhythm,” she said at an event in Brussels on Friday.
The Dane, who recently turned 48, hit the headlines when she sent Google an antitrust charge sheet last year. She took another swipe last month, accusing the company of wielding its power as the world’s leading phone software supplier to impose its search and Web programs on billions of mobile users.

989,"May 12, 2016",US: FTC looking at reopening antitrust investigation against Google,"
Alphabet’s Google search engine faces intense antitrust scrutiny in Europe over its business practices. That scrutiny may spill over into its home country, the US.
Federal Trade Commission officials have recently restarted discussions about whether Google has abused its position as the country’s dominant search engine by favoring its own products over competitors in search results, according to Politico. The FTC discussions signal “renewed agency interest” in a potential antitrust examination, Politico reports, after the agency investigated similar allegations in 2013.
That inquiry concluded after the FTC found no wrongdoing. A new investigation would have to show that Google had used its dominant position to unfairly squash competition and limit consumer choice.
The agency has also held recent meetings about Google’s mobile operating system, Android.
The discussions come as a handful of tech companies control increasing amount of the time consumers spend online, how they navigate the web, and get information. That ultimately means fewer choices for consumers, a phrase that sets off alarm bells among regulators.

FAS, the watchdog, had been expected to discuss the fine on Wednesday after postponing a decision in April but again put off the decision following a request from the company, RIA quoted a FAS official as saying.
The regulator ruled last September that Google had broken the law by requiring pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices running on its Android operating system, following a complaint by Russia’s Yandex.

991,"May 2, 2016",South Korea: Antitrust regulators get tough on Google,"
The nation’s media watchdogs plan to revise a law that will allow Android users to delete Google’s “non-removable” preinstalled apps.
The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) and the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) voiced a consensus that legal measures were necessary to stop customers from falling victim to such monopolistic schemes.
“The KCC is in talks with the MSIP over completing the revision no later than July,” said an official. “There are guidelines for the same issue, but they have been under no legal compulsion. Some business operators have not followed the guidelines, hurting users’ rights.”
The MSIP previously issued the guideline to make non-essential apps that come bundled with the phone removable. The number of preinstalled apps has been scaled back over the past two years since the measure took effect in January 2014, according to the MSIP. But the regulator said this has failed to “completely root out” the so-called “bloatware.” Most such apps have become user-removable due to the guidelines, but still some 10 Google apps remain uninstallable.
The KCC official added the EU’s recent decision over Google is another major reason for the law revision.

992,"April 27, 2016",EU: Getty Images files antitrust complaint against Google,"
Photo agency Getty Images has filed a formal complaint with the European commission against Google over its alleged abuse of the company’s search dominance.
Google is accused of distorting search results in favour of its own services, including Google Images, Shopping, Maps and several others, affecting competitors from media companies such as Getty to travel sites and price comparison companies.
Getty’s latest complaint, following its registration as an “interested third person” in June, revolves around Google Image search, which displays images from across the internet in response to picture or word search terms.
The image company’s complaint specifically calls out changes made to Google’s Image search in 2013, which it says created “captivating galleries of high-resolution, copyrighted content” and “promoted piracy, resulting in widespread copyright infringement”.
“Because image consumption is immediate, once an image is displayed in high-resolution, large format, there is little impetus to view the image on the original source site. These changes have allowed Google to reinforce its role as the internet’s dominant search engine, maintaining monopoly over site traffic, engagement data and advertising spend,” Getty said.

The substantive analysis in an antitrust case is not affected by the number of complainants nor their identity,” Brussels’ spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso told Ars.
Microsoft first filed a complaint against Google’s alleged anti-competitive search business practices in Europe a little over five years ago in March 2011. The software giant said in a statement: “Microsoft has agreed to withdraw its regulatory complaints against Google, reflecting our changing legal priorities.

994,"April 25, 2016","UE: Acusaciones contra Google sin motivo político, asegura Vestager","
La decisión de dar inicio a los procedimientos por violación a leyes de competencia contra el gigante tecnológico Google no tiene motivos políticos, aseguró la líder del área de competencia en Europa, un día después de que la empresa fuese acusada de abusar su posición dominante en el mercado de teléfonos móviles con su sistema operativo Android. 
El miércoles pasado, la Comisión Europea – rama ejecutiva de la UE – dijo que ya habría informado a Google que la empresa se encontraba en violación de las reglas antimonopolio relacionadas al sistema operativo Android. La comisión ha dicho que lo que el requisito que tiene Google para que los fabricantes pre-instalen los servicios de Google, como Search y Chrome, representan un daño a la competencia. 
Android es un sistema de código abierto que es utilizado por el 80% de los teléfonos móviles en el mundo.  
Éste no es el primer conflicto regulatorio entre Google y la UE. El gigante de internet ya está enfrentando cargos por promover su propio servicio de compras en las búsquedas de internet, dañando a productos rivales. El caso se ha prolongado desde finales de 2010. 
Sin embargo, la Comisionada de Competencia, Margrethe Vestager, ha dicho que no se trata de un ataque con motivaciones políticas, contra Google u otra empresa. 
“Incluso si alguien tuviese un objetivo político, o sentimientos apasionados sobre etas empresas, nosotros debemos pasar la prueba de los tribunales eventualmente, y la corte no quiere oír sobre sentimientos y política. Quieren los hechos del caso… por lo que no podemos interferir de forma política… pues de lo contrario nos arriesgamos a perder todo” dijo Vestager.

995,"April 21, 2016",EU: Google antitrust charges over Android not political says Vestager,"

The decision to bring antitrust proceedings against US tech giant Google was not politically motivated, Europe’s competition chief told CNBC, a day after the company was accused of abusing its dominance in the mobile market with its Android operating system.
On Wednesday, the European Commission – the executive arm of the European Union (EU) – said it had informed Google that the company is in breach of the bloc’s antitrust rules relating to Android. The Commission said Google’s requirement that device manufacturers to pre-install Google services such as Search and its Chrome web browser was hampering competitions.


Android is open-source and run on over 80 percent of the world’s mobile phones.
This is not the first regulatory clash between Google and the EU. The internet giant is already battling EU charges of promoting its own shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival products, a case which has dragged on since late 2010.
But European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said this is not a politically motivated attack on Google or US companies.
“Even if anyone had a political goal or had feelings or a passion about companies, well our test is with the courts eventually and the court will hear nothing about feeling and politics, they want the facts of the case…and therefore we cannot interfere politically…because otherwise we risk to lose it,” Vestager told CNBC in a TV interview on Thursday.

996,"April 21, 2016",US: Consumer watchdog seeks FTC action against Google,"
A consumer watchdog has asked the Federal Trade Commission to file suit against Google on antitrust grounds over its Android operating system.
The call came after the European Union initially concluded this week that Google had abused its dominant position in search by putting restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile broadband ISPs in violation of EU antitrust rules.
Consumer Watchdog says Google has the same power and employs the same practices in the U.S. “Our antitrust enforcers need to step up and do their job instead of letting the Europeans do it for them,” said John Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog.
The FTC investigated Google’s search practices but closed that investigation in 2013. There wastalk earlier this year on Capitol Hill about asking the FTC to reopen that investigation given new concerns about Google favoring its own content in local search.

997,"April 20, 2016",EU: charges Google with abusing its Android dominance,"
The European Commission has informed Google of its preliminary view that the company has, in breach of EU antitrust rules, abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators.
The Commission’s preliminary view is that Google has implemented a strategy on mobile devices to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search. In today’s Statement of Objections, the Commission alleges that Google has breached EU antitrust rules by:

requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google’s Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps;
preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android open source code;
giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices.

The Commission believes that these business practices may lead to a further consolidation of the dominant position of Google Search in general internet search services. It is also concerned that these practices affect the ability of competing mobile browsers to compete with Google Chrome, and that they hinder the development of operating systems based on the Android open source code and the opportunities they would offer for the development of new apps and services.

998,"April 19, 2016",Canada:  Antitrust probe ends well for Google,"
Google won a significant antitrust victory on Tuesday in Canada when the country’s Competition Bureau concluded that the company doesn’t use its dominant market position to harm rivals.
The Canadian investigation focused on six discrete aspects of Google’s business, including how it displays search results and how it treat its own services such as “Google Maps” and “Google Flights.” In a major win for the company, the regulator found Google’s search practices are dictated by user experience and are not intended to squelch rivals:
“Although Google frequently makes changes to the algorithm it uses to rank search results, evidence obtained over the course of the investigation indicates that Google’s changes are generally made to improve user experiences,” the Competition Bureau said in a statement.
The regulator did, however, describe the manner in which Google sells its flagship AdWords search ads as “problematic,” and ordered the company to change the terms of its contracts to make it easier for clients to end ad campaigns.
In a statement, Google’s general counsel, Kent Walker, declared the company was happy with the outcome.
