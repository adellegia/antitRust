0,"March 10, 2019",US: Judge ends NCAA cap on athlete compensation,"
A judge has ruled against the NCAA in a federal antitrust case, opening door for players to receive more compensation. On Friday night  US District Judge Claudia Wilken said that the NCAA cannot “limit compensation or benefits related to education” for athletes playing Division I men’s or women’s basketball or Bowl Subdivision football.
Wilken said these athletes may receive are scholarships to complete undergraduate or graduate degrees at any school. The judge also appeared to open the possibility of athletes being able to receive cash or cash-equivalent awards based on academics or graduation, albeit under some constraints.
At the same time, however, her 104-page ruling prevents athletes from receiving unlimited benefits, as the plaintiffs had hoped.
The NCAA “may continue … to limit compensation and benefits that are unrelated to education,” Wilken ruled.
She also said that the association may adopt a definition of compensation and benefits that are “related to education.”
Wilken wrote that the changes to the NCAA’s current system will take effect in 90 days, but will be stayed if either side appeals.
The outcome represents a partial victory for plaintiffs who were seeking to have the association’s limits on athletes compensation in favor of allowing conferences to determine what athletes can receive.

1,"March 10, 2019",US: J&J can’t arbitrate Remicade antitrust case argues Rochester,"
A drug wholesaler is urging a federal appeals court to not send a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson (J&J) of seeking to suppress competition for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade to arbitration.
Remicade has been on the market since receiving FDA approval in 1998. From 1998 to 2016, J&J had what the suit calls a monopoly on the market, as it was the only product that contained the active ingredient infliximab.
Rochester Drug Cooperative told the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in a brief on Thursday, March 7, that a federal judge in Philadelphia correctly determined its antitrust claims did not fall within the scope of an arbitration agreement it had signed with J&J.

2,"March 10, 2019",EU: Deutsche Bank agrees to informal merger talks with Commerzbank,"
Deutsche Bank’s top executives have agreed to hold discussions with rival Commerzbank about a potential merger, as Germany’s two biggest banks explore strategic options after suffering prolonged performance and share-price declines, people close to the banks said.
The informal talks reflect a deepening willingness by Deutsche Bank’s management board to engage in a possible tie-up, though executives this week continued to see a potential merger as one option, some of the people said.
The agreement by Deutsche Bank’s management board to hold talks was earlier reported by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. One person close to Deutsche Bank said the agreement was made in the latter half of February. The management board is composed of top executives and is responsible for setting its strategy with oversight from the so-called supervisory board of the bank.

3,"March 10, 2019",US: Dems want to know if White House interfered in AT&T/TW merger,"
On Thursday two US House Democrats asked the White House and Justice Department to turn over documents that could show whether Republican President Donald Trump sought to intervene in the regulatory review of AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner.
In letters released on Thursday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs a panel overseeing antitrust issues, asked them to turn over records after The New Yorker magazine reported this week that Trump directed then-National Economic Council director Gary Cohn to use the Justice Department to block the deal.
The pair wrote that if accurate, Trump’s involvement would “constitute a grave abuse of power.” Last week, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling rejecting a Justice Department challenge to the deal filed in November 2017.
The letters cited the New Yorker article reporting that Trump called Cohn into the Oval Office “along with John Kelly, who had just become the chief of staff, and said in exasperation to Kelly, ‘I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened! I’ve mentioned it 50 times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked!’

4,"March 10, 2019",Here’s how we can break up Big Tech,"

By Elizabeth Warren

Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn’t exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It’s a great story — but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.
In the 1990s, Microsoft — the tech giant of its time — was trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government’s antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.
The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive — which pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services. Aren’t we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?

The European Commission has accepted commitments offered by top Hollywood film studios and Sky UK on their pay TV services that will allow European Union consumers to access films via satellite or online when they are outside Britain and Ireland, reported the Financial Times.
Thursday’s agreement smashes the country-by-country licensing regime that has dominated the sales of exclusive pay-TV content such as sports matches and new films. Disney, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros have promised not to enforce or reintroduce restrictions that prevent any European broadcaster selling its services beyond its home market to customers who make unsolicited requests for their services, so called passive sales.
Sky UK has promised to not seek to have the studios enforce the territorial restrictions on rivals. The promises apply to satellite and online services as well as video on demand.

According to an exclusive from Reuters Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel will not go very far in concessions to gain approval for a planned steel venture. Reuters quoted four people familiar, adding their offer might not be enough to satisfy the European Commission.
The two companies last year struck a deal to combine their European steel units to create the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, a move that must be cleared by the European regulators.
Brussels last month sent a statement of objections in its antitrust review of the transaction, effectively asking for remedies in exchange for approval in three areas — electrical steel, galvanized steel for car parts, and packaging steel.

Amazon Is Flooding D.C. With Money and Muscle: The Influence Game
By Naomi Nix
After building out a powerful influence machine in Washington over the last few years, Amazon is going on the attack.
The Seattle-based company is pushing aside trade groups it doesn’t like and creating new ones it does. It’s dispatching senior executives to woo antitrust enforcers. And it’s poaching senior staff from government agencies and congressional offices.
Federal records show that Amazon.com Inc. lobbied more government entities than any other tech company in 2018 and sought to exert its influence over more issues than any of its tech peers except Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Last year, Amazon spent $14.2 million on lobbying, a record for the company, up from its previous high mark of $12.8 million in 2017. The $77 million that the nine tech companies in the charts below spent in 2018 to lobby Washington looks minuscule next to the $280 million spent by pharmaceutical and health-care products companies. Tech has, however, pulled ahead of the $64 million that commercial banks spent—and Amazon in particular has a cachet that allows it to punch above its weight at times. Of the nine, only the $21 million Google spent on lobbying beat Amazon’s total. Since 2012, Amazon has ramped up spending by more than 460 percent—much faster than its rivals.

March 2019
CPI EU News Column edited by Thibault Schrepel, Sam Sadden & Jan Roth (CPI) presents:
CPI EU News: FCO Facebook Quadriptych
In early February 2019, the German Bundeskartellamt (“FCO”) announced its highly anticipated and “ground-breaking” Facebook decision. CPI EU News is pleased to present a Quadriptych of four short articles on this hot topic from a great panel of authors.
The FCO concluded that Facebook infringed German competition law by violating the European General Data Protection Regulation. The case is the first to establish an infringement of competition law rules where the practices were in conflict with data protection principles… thus, “straddling the line between competition policy and data protection.”
Some authors argue that the decision “ultimately pushes competition law far beyond its natural confines.” Others opine that the case “may represent an important step into European competition law’s future in digital markets.” What consequences might this case have beyond Germany?

9,"March 6, 2019",US: Judge drops hearing into Sinclair after failed Tribune merger,"
A US administrative law judge has dropped a hearing into Sinclair Broadcast’s US$3.9 billion bid to purchase Tribune Media because the deal had failed and further proceedings would be an “academic exercise.”
But Administrative Judge Jane Halprin said in an order released on Tuesday, March 5, allegations that Sinclair, the largest US broadcast station owner, may have misled regulators “are extremely serious charges that reasonably warrant a thorough examination.”
Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which has 192 stations, in August. A month earlier the Federal Communications Commission referred the deal for a hearing, questioning Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them.

Dollar Tree announced Wednesday, March 6, it will close up to 390 Family Dollar stores this year and convert another 200 into Dollar Tree locations. Additionally, while trimming Family Dollar stores, it will open 200 others in an updated format, while adding 350 new Dollar Trees.
The merger, after a bidding war, was supposed to revive Family Dollar and give it more heft to better compete with rivals Dollar General and Walmart. Instead, sales at Family Dollar have lagged behind competitors, dragging down performance at Dollar Tree.
Dollar Tree is accelerating plans to close or renovate Family Dollar stores, responding to investor concerns that the merger isn’t paying off. On Wednesday, Dollar Tree stated it plans to close up to 390 Family Dollar stores this year and convert about 200 more to Dollar Tree shops. Executives have previously said Dollar Tree would renovate at least 1,000 Family Dollar stores this year. The company had around 8,200 Family Dollar stores and 7,000 Dollar Tree stores at the end of the latest quarter.

T-Mobile has spent US$195,000 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington since April of 2018, according to a letter the company sent to two Democratic lawmakers, a sharp increase matched by spending at other hotels in the nation’s capital since the telecom giant announced a merger with Sprint requiring Trump administration approval.
“These hotel expenses cover a variety of types of business-related activities … including the cost of meeting space, catering, business center services, audio/visual equipment rental, lodging meals, taxes and other incidental expenses,” T-Mobile Vice President Anthony Russo wrote in a February 21 letter to Representative Pramila Jayapal (Dem-Washington) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (Dem-Massachusetts).
Before April 29th, 2018, the day news of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger was reported, just two top company officials had stayed at Trump’s hotel: Both CEO Tom Legere, and Executive Vice President David Carey stayed at the hotel overnight on August 30, 2017.
The company’s boost in spending at the president’s hotel as its megamerger is being considered by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who say it shows that Trump is profiting from his office.

The British competition authority is preparing legal action against secondary ticketing platform Viagogo, to find the company in contempt.
“Although some improvements have been made since we first demanded action to address areas of non-compliance, further checks have shown there are still issues of concern,” the competition authority announced in a statement.
CMA took Viagogo to the High Court in August, after the secondary ticketing website ignored multiple demands to comply with consumer law. Viagogo later agreed to comply with the competition watchdog’s demands, including providing face value tickets and ending speculative listings.

“As a result of media speculation, those regulations required Aon to make the disclosure at a very early stage in the consideration of a potential all-share business combination,” Aon stated Tuesday.
One day later, Aon disclosed in a second press release that it was no longer pursuing the transaction. “Aon today confirms that it does not intend to pursue this business combination,” the company stated.

Now multiple Democratic lawmakers are vowing to, in the words of Senator Chris Van Hollen, “get to the bottom of it.”
Representative Adam Schiff tweeted on Monday, March 4, “I’ve long feared Trump would use the instruments of state power to carry out his vendetta against the press he has attacked as the ‘enemy of the people.’ Congress must find out whether Trump did just that by seeking to interfere in a merger or raising postal rates on Amazon.”

In an interview Tuesday, March 5, Klobuchar a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, argued that public anger over high prescription drug prices, privacy violations by tech companies and a string of megamergers shows how US laws need to change.
Does the United States have a monopoly problem?
We have a major monopoly problem. We’ve seen a 50 percent increase in mergers in the last five years, and we’ve seen now a number of trillion-dollar companies. It doesn’t mean every big company is bad; it just means we’re seeing more and more consolidation of power. The problem is, our antitrust laws haven’t attacked changes in the kinds of businesses we have.
Let’s start with the courts. You have conservative decision after conservative decision on antitrust. [Supreme Court Justices Brett M.] Kavanaugh and [Neil M.] Gorsuch have a number of opinions that are actually more conservative than where the court has been, in terms of how they interpret the [antitrust] laws.
Which industries pose the biggest antitrust problems, in your view?
First is tech. We haven’t been able to move privacy legislation for years. The second area is pharma, where literally they have three lobbyists for every member of Congress. You’re starting to see common drugs like insulin that have bee...

Newmont also stated its previously announced Goldcorp acquisition, in January, offered better benefits.
“The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont’s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared with Barrick’s proposal,” Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg said. A merger of Barrick and Newmont would create a gold-mining giant with annual production of more than 10 million ounces. However, Barrick has not offered a premium, telling shareholders they would benefit from the value created by merging the two companies
A deal will ultimately be decided by a small group of shareholders who own both companies. Newmont’s Mr Goldberg and Tom Palmer, who will take over from Mr Goldberg later this year,  will meet shareholders this week, including BlackRock, the largest shareholder in Newmont.

Dubai’s DP World has asked an Indian court to halt an investigation into alleged antitrust violations at the country’s largest container port in Mumbai, claiming saying the regulator was seeking excessive information, a court document seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year announced said it suspected antitrust violations by DP World and Denmark’s Moller-Maersk at the terminals they operate at state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
The CCI’s investigation followed a complaint by Singapore’s PSA International Pt, which alleged that Maersk and DP World businesses created barriers to hinder the growth of PSA’s terminal by colluding on certain charges they levy at JNPT.
In December, a Mumbai high court declined a DP World plea to quash the investigation. Last week, DP World again approached the court to halt the probe, according to a court filing dated February 28 seen by Reuters.
The CCI’s investigation unit had on February 21 issued a “requisition notice” to DP World to provide information and documentation for conducting its antitrust investigation, the court filing showed.

18,"March 4, 2019",US: Trump reportedly asked Gary Cohn to block AT&T-Time Warner merger,"
 

A new report about the close relationship between Fox News and President Donald Trump states the President personally asked a top White House aide to make sure the Justice Department (DOJ) stopped AT&T from purchasing Time Warner.
Ever since the DOJ sued in 2017 to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, theories and accusations of political animus has swirled around the antitrust case.
At the heart of the theories is Trump’s public dislike of CNN, which was a division of Time Warner. The company that has since been renamed WarnerMedia, which also includes networks such TNT and HBO, in addition to CNN.
In a new piece for the New Yorker, investigative journalist Jane Mayer reports that a few months before the DOJ filed its lawsuit, Trump pressured Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, to tell the DOJ to block AT&T’s Time Warner deal.
According to Mayer’s source, Trump called Cohn and then Chief-of-Staff John Kelly into his office and said to Kelly, “I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened! I’ve mentioned it fifty times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked.”
After the two men walked out of the Oval Office meeting, Cohn told Kelly not to follow through with the president’s request, according to Mayer’s report.

On Monday, March 4, Qualcomm kicked off a patent challenge to Apple, capping off a two-year legal strategy to put pressure on the iPhone maker before a major antitrust lawsuit between the two goes to trial in April.
Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of mobile chips, alleges in federal court in San Diego that Apple violated three of its patents, and is asking for tens of millions of dollars or more in damages.
The patent case is part of a two-year series of lawsuits around the world between the companies. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent practices to protect a dominant position in the chip market, and Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without compensation.
“Qualcomm could really use a win to bolster the view that its robust patent portfolio is entitled to protection,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tamlin Bason. But he added that, because Qualcomm is unlikely to get a court order banning sales of infringing iPhone models, the chipmaker may not gain much leverage against Apple if it wins the trial.

David Cicilline, the head of the House antitrust subcommittee, has suggested imposing a version of the Glass-Steagall rules—which forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking—on the technology industry. His comments add to growing calls from senior figures in the Democratic party to curb the market power held by the likes of Facebook, Google, and Amazon.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Cicilline said, “One of the things that we did in the financial services space is Glass-Steagall, where you separate out functions.
“It’s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information, a Glass-Steagall for the international [technology companies].”
Last week, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was setting up a task force to look at competition specifically in the technology industry, which will go as far as reviewing deals that have already been completed. Announcing the task force, Bruce Hoffman, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, pointed out that the agency had the power to force companies to unwind mergers if it decided to.

22,"March 4, 2019",US: Amazon to open grocery stores post merger,"
Amid Amazon’s efforts to grow its reach in the food space, the eCommerce retailer is reportedly looking to launch grocery stores in multiple big U.S. cities. The company is reportedly aiming to open a location in Los Angeles as soon as the close of 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Unnamed sources cited by the paper claim the retailer has inked leases for a minimum of two more locations, scheduled for the beginning of 2020. However, the report cautioned that the store openings are not guaranteed. The Journal also stated the grocer is in discussions to open shopping center locations in Chicago and Washington, DC, among other cities.
While it was not specified whether the stores would be branded with Amazon’s name, they will reportedly diverge from the company’s Whole Foods Market brand. The sources claim the retailer’s planned locations are not designed to be direct rivals with Whole Foods, and will offer a different, lower-priced selection of items.
Last year, Amazon was looking to expand its fleet of Whole Foods stores around the country, enabling more shoppers to use its fast delivery service. According to reports at the time, Whole Foods aims to have locations in more suburban areas. The retailer has been gaining customers since it was acquired by Amazon, but prior to the deal had been in layoff mode with slowing store growth.
At the same time, the report noted that if Amazon follows through with those plans, it would bring more competition to the supermarke...

23,"March 4, 2019",EEUU: Nuevo grupo de trabajo investigará a Grandes Empresas de Tecnología,"
El anuncio de la Comisión Federal de Comercio se produce en medio de crecientes preocupaciones en los EEUU y otros lugares respecto a las plataformas tecnológicas dominantes como Google, Facebook y Amazon.
La FTC se negó a nombrar compañías o acuerdos específicos que analizaría, pero dijo que consideraría revisar los acuerdos que ya se han completado, con miras a buscar una desinversión.
Los funcionarios de la FTC han dicho que el mandato del Grupo de Trabajo Tecnológico incluirá revisar las adquisiciones que ya han sido aprobadas, lo que señala mayores problemas regulatorios para un sector que ya se encuentra a la defensiva tras una serie de escándalos por la forma en que explota los datos de sus consumidores.
“Estamos encantados de que la FTC esté comprometida”, dijo Robert Engel, portavoz principal de Free and Fair Markets Initiative, un grupo activista que se ha dirigido a Amazon.com Inc. por lo que considera un comportamiento monopólico. Los funcionarios de la FTC “tienen una oportunidad real, especialmente si se enfocan en los principales delincuentes”.

24,"March 4, 2019",EEUU: DOJ no apelará contra decisión sobre fusión de AT&T-Time Warner,"
La empresa de telecomunicaciones AT&T salió victoriosa el martes, 26 de febrero, frente a los intentos por parte de la administración de Trump de bloquear su compra de Time Warner por US$85,400 millones, ya que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos (DOJ) declaró que no se opondría a un fallo de la corte aprobando el acuerdo.
La adquisición fue vigilada de cerca en los círculos políticos después de haber sido atacada por el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, quien se opuso debido a la relación con la cadena de noticias CNN de Time Warner, a la que ha acusado de transmitir notas falsas o “Fake News”.
El panel de tres jueces en el Tribunal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia de EEUU falló unánimemente a favor del acuerdo el martes y dijo que el argumento del gobierno, sosteniendo que la fusión daría como resultado precios más altos para el consumidor, fue “poco convincente” -un esfuerzo del DOJ para bloquear el trato.
Fue la segunda gran victoria de AT&T contra el DOJ, preparando el escenario para que el proveedor de servicios inalámbricos número 2 del país integrara su negocio con WarnerMedia, así como su nueva unidad de publicidad Xandr.
“Estamos agradecidos de que el Tribunal de Apelaciones haya considerado nuestras objeciones a la opinión del Tribunal de Distrito. El departamento no tiene planeado buscar más revisiones”, dijo el portavoz del Departamento de Justicia, Jeremy Edwards, en un co...

El gobierno francés podría imponer un impuesto sobre la renta del 3% a 30 gigantes de Internet, incluyendo Google, Amazon, Facebook y Apple, a partir de enero, anunció el ministro de Finanzas, Bruno Le Maire.
Describiendo al impuesto digital como “justicia fiscal”, Le Maire dijo al diario Le Parisien que potencialmente se recaudarían US$570 millones para gastos de gobierno. Cualquier empresa con ingresos globales de más de US$853 millones y ventas francesas por encima de US$28 millones se gravaría con el 3% de los ingresos.
El gabinete discutirá la propuesta este miércoles 6 de marzo, antes de ser presentada al parlamento. “Un sistema de impuestos para el siglo XXI tiene que basarse en lo que tiene valor hoy, y eso es la información”, dijo Le Maire.
Señaló que los gigantes digitales pagan alrededor de 14 puntos porcentuales menos en impuestos que las pequeñas y medianas empresas europeas.
“Vierten sus productos en los mercados sin siquiera pagar el impuesto al valor agregado, y casi ningún otro impuesto. Es intolerable. En la misma facturación, deberían pagar el mismo impuesto “, dijo Le Maire.

CollegeNET and The Common Application released the following joint statement today:
“The Common Application and CollegeNET have agreed to resolve and dismiss the lawsuit brought by CollegeNET in May 2014. The matter has been resolved in a way satisfactory to the Parties pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement whereby, without admitting liability, Common Application has agreed commencing with the 2019-2020 application season to modify certain of its challenged practices.”
This antitrust litigation was filed by CollegeNET in federal court almost five years ago. The lawsuit alleged that Common Application had violated federal antitrust law by maintaining its monopoly through anticompetitive business practices in the market to process online undergraduate applications.

Walmart has named an in-house antitrust veteran to fill its newly created chief antitrust counsel position, about a month after StarKist agreed to a $20.5 million settlement with the big box retailer to resolve antitrust claims stemming from a price-fixing conspiracy.
Suzanne Wachsstock, who built American Express global antitrust and trade association compliance program during her nearly 12-year tenure there, has been named chief antitrust counsel,
Suzanne Wachsstock will join Walmart on March 4 from American Express Co., where she built the company’s global antitrust and trade association compliance program during her nearly 12-year tenure as vice president and antitrust counsel there, according to her LinkedIn profile and an email from a Walmart spokesperson. In her new role, Wachsstock, who will be based in Walmart’s Washington, D.C., office, will lead all of its antitrust matters globally, the email said, adding that, “as Walmart’s business continues to evolve, we are always evaluating where we can acquire talent to support the business.”
In a notice distributed to the company’s global governance team, Karen Roberts, Walmart’s executive vice president and general counsel, said: “Suzanne’s prior experience leading global antitrust counseling and compliance, mergers and acquisitions, litigation, investigations, and strategy, makes her a perfect fit for this role.”

28,"March 3, 2019",France: New digital tax in the works,"
France plans to slap a 3% revenue tax on 30 Internet giants, including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, starting in January, according to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Sunday.

Declaring the digital tax as “fiscal justice,” Le Maire told Le Parisien newspaper that potentially $570 million could be raised for France. Any company with global revenue of more than $853 millon and French sales above $28 million would be taxed 3% of revenue.
The cabinet will discuss the proposal Wednesday before it is presented to parliament. “A taxation system for the 21st century has to built on what has value today, and that is data,” Le Maire said.
He noted the digital giants pay about 14 percentage points less tax than European small- and medium sized companies.
“They pour their products onto markets without even paying value-added tax, and hardly any other tax at all, it is intolerable. On the same turnover they should pay the same tax,” Le Maire said.

29,"March 3, 2019","UK: Experian, ClearScore cancel merger","

Experian has backed down over its $275m merger with credit rating checker rival Clearscore after a watchdog warned it could harm competition in the sector.
“Taking into account subsequent interaction with the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority), Experian does not believe that the CMA will approve the proposed acquisition of ClearScore on satisfactory terms,” Experian said in a statement.
The CMA had warned in November that the 275 million pound ($364.35 million) deal could stifle development of digital products that help customers understand personal finances.


Experian, a FTSE 100 company, wanted to expand in Britain with the purchase of ClearScore, which provides free access to credit reports and scores, and introduces consumers to personal financial products.

30,"March 3, 2019",US: Thales takeover of Gemalto green lighted with conditions,"
The US Justice Department said on Thursday it was requiring Thales to divest its general purpose hardware security module business in order for Thales to proceed with its proposed acquisition of Gemalto.
French defense electronics maker Thales and Netherlands-based chipmaker Gemalto are the world’s leading providers of GP HSMs, which generate keys and encrypts data, and are significant direct competitors in the United States, the Justice Department said in a statement.
Thales, Europe’s largest defense electronics group whose largest shareholder is the French state, announced the $5.4 billion deal in December 2017. The company is seeking to boost its presence in the booming security services market, which includes encryption and biometric passports.

The Swiss company, which has a market value of SFr3.3bn ($3.3bn), agreed to acquire its rival this week and said it expected to have completed the takeover by the third quarter.

However, the funding mechanism for the deal could prove a high hurdle for it to clear after Freenet, which owns almost a quarter of Sunrise’s shares, said it would not support a SFr4.1bn rights issue to pay for the deal and pay down some existing debt.

German drugs and lab supplies maker Merck offered US$5.9 billion, including debt, for Versum Materials, in a cash deal that tops an offer from US rival Entegris, reported the Financial Times.
The unexpected counter bid for Versum, which makes critical components used in semiconductors, would bolster Merck’s performance materials unit as chipmakers and their suppliers seek to capitalize on the wave of devices that will soon connect to the internet.
Merck announced it had offered to pay US$48 a share in cash for Versum, roughly 52% above Versum’s share price before its all-stock deal with Entegris was announced and 16% higher than its closing level on Tuesday. The US$5.9 billion deal value includes the assumption of Versum’s outstanding debt.

The Federal Trade Commission announcement comes amid increasing concerns in the US and elsewhere about dominant tech platforms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. The FTC declined to name any specific companies or deals it would look at, but said it would consider reviews of tie-ups that have already been completed, with an eye toward seeking an unwinding or divestment.
FTC officials say the Technology Task Force’s mandate will include reviewing acquisitions that have already been approved, pointing to bigger regulatory headaches ahead for a sector already on defense for how it exploits data from consumers.

“We’re thrilled the FTC is engaged,” said Robert Engel, chief spokesman for the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, an activist group that has targeted Amazon.com Inc. for what it views as monopolistic behavior. FTC officials “have a real opportunity, particularly if they focus on the main offenders.”

35,"February 28, 2019",US: DOJ will not appeal AT&T-Time Warner merger decision,"
AT&T emerged victorious on Tuesday, February 26, over the Trump administration’s attempts to block its US$85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner as the US Justice Department (DOJ) stated it would not fight an appeals court ruling approving the deal.
The acquisition had been closely watched in political circles after coming under fire from US President Donald Trump, who opposed it because he saw it helping Time Warner’s CNN unit, which he has accused of broadcasting “fake news.”
The three-judge panel on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in favor of the deal on Tuesday, saying that the government’s case that the merger would result in higher consumer prices was “unpersuasive.” The decision ended a 15-month effort by the DOJ to block the deal.
It was AT&T’s second major court victory against the DOJ, setting the stage for the No. 2 wireless carrier to integrate its WarnerMedia business as well as its new Xandr advertising unit.
“We are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion. The department has no plans to seek further review,” DOJ spokesman Jeremy Edwards said in a statement.
Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ’s antitrust division, telephoned AT&T General Counsel David McAtee and Time Warner’s former general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, to congratulate them on the court victory, according to a source familiar with events.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has cancelled its merger investigation into Experian’s anticipated purchase of ClearScore.
Experian and ClearScore provide credit-score checking and financial product comparison services in the UK. These services allow people to understand their finances and choose loans and credit cards online.
In November 2018, the CMA published provisional findings as part of its in-depth, Phase 2, merger inquiry. These set out concerns that the merger of 2 of the largest credit-score checking firms in the UK could result in less intense competition in the sector.
The CMA provisionally found that the merger could stifle product development, by substantially reducing the pressure to continue to develop innovative offers and to make other improvements in services, and so negatively impact consumers.
Experian and ClearScore decided not to continue with the deal.

40,"February 26, 2019",US: DOJ loses appeal seeking to block AT&T-Time Warner merger,"
The federal government on Tuesday lost its second court challenge to AT&T’s $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner, a blockbuster deal that has already begun to reshape much of the media industry.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the government’s claim that a lower court had applied antitrust laws incorrectly in allowing the merger to proceed. Justice Department lawyers have argued that the combination of the two companies would reduce competition and hurt consumers.
“The government’s objections that the district court misunderstood and misapplied economic principles and clearly erred in rejecting the quantitative model are unpersuasive,” Judge Judith W. Rogers wrote on behalf of the panel.
The decision cements one of the biggest losses for the Justice Department’s antitrust division in a generation. The DOJ lawsuit, filed in November 2017, was the first major antitrust action under the Trump administration, and the case marked the first time in 40 years the government fully litigated a case challenging a “vertical” merger that combined two companies that didn’t compete head-to-head.

German utility RWE has won EU antitrust approval to buy the renewables businesses and nuclear electricity generation assets of E.ON, the European Commission said on Tuesday, February 26.
“The Commission concluded that the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the European Economic Area,” an EU executive said in a statement.
On completion, RWE, Germany’s biggest electricity producer, will become Europe’s third-largest renewable energy provider behind Spain’s Iberdrola and Italy’s Enel.
The Bundeskartellamt also cleared the planned acquisition of a minority stake of 16.67% in E.ON by RWE. The planned acquisition is part of an extensive exchange of business activities between the two undertakings. The Bundeskartellamt’s decision comes at the same time as the clearance by the European Commission of the planned acquisition of E.ON assets by RWE. The European Commission’s examination of the acquisition of a majority stake in and control over Innogy by E.ON is still ongoing.
The part of the overall transaction to be examined by the Bundeskartellamt mainly concerns the market for the generation and first time sale of electricity, e.g. to wholesalers, distributors, and large industrial customers, but not the sale of electricity to final consumers.

42,"February 25, 2019","Privacy and Competition: Friends, Foes, or Frenemies?","
The debate about data-rich tech companies has led to calls for changes to consumer privacy law, competition law, or both. Europe has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, limiting the collection, use, and sharing of consumer data, which may raise competitive hurdles for some players. It also includes a data portability requirement, which may reduce lock-in and spur competition. Some have also advocated using competition law to impose new controls and obligations on entities that collect consumer data. U.S. antitrust law has considered data about and generated by consumers in merger cases and has even imposed data sharing as a remedy. There are calls to go further and treat consumer data as an essential facility and force big tech companies to share it. The essential facilities theory is in tension with the premises behind new privacy laws, which are that there is an abundance of consumer data and that consumers want less, not more, sharing of their data. This article explores the challenges and limits to these theories and the tension they create between reducing and widening access to consumer data. Can privacy and competition values live in harmony as friends, will some of these proposals make them enemies, or is it a bit of both?

43,"February 25, 2019",Data Protection and Antitrust: New Types of Abuse Cases? An Economist’s View in Light of the German Facebook Decision,"
Many services on the Internet are seemingly offered for free. People do not have to pay for them, at least not with money. The present article argues that it is rather difficult to conceive what use of data would constitute an exploitative abuse of market power in these markets – the issue which has been at heart of the German investigation into Facebook’s data combination practices. In particular, the question emerges as to what the appropriate benchmark for exploitative data abuse cases should be. Requiring dominant firms to behave more like competitive firms would be rather absurd if small firms without market power violate privacy standards more often than larger firms. Moreover, if users are not aware of what kind of data is collected and how this data is used due to a lack of transparency, as has been suggested in the German Facebook case, this appears to be, by and large, a problem of asymmetric information which is not necessarily related to market power. Overall, portraying excessive data usage as being analogous to excessive pricing is fraught with several difficulties. In contrast, it is easier to conceive that not granting third-party access to data may be an obstructive abuse of market power. Moreover, as data is – in contrast to many other facilities – non-rival in use and – at least in some cases – not associated with significant investment expenditure, the legal threshold for third-party access should generally be lower than for classical essential...

44,"February 25, 2019",US: Ruling on DOJ appeal of Time Warner expected soon,"
The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit could rule Tuesday, February 26, on the government’s last-ditch attempt at undoing AT&T’s  merger with media firm Time Warner, reported Bloomberg.
 
The Department of Justice appealed a court ruling that allowed AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner to proceed. AT&T closed the acquisition on June 15, though WarnerMedia continues to operate separately. Under an agreement with the Justice Department, AT&T promised to put Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting in a business unit separate from AT&T’s DirecTV business. It also agreed to a firewall between the two. That agreement, which was intended to prevent a full integration of the companies if the government prevails in its appeal, expires Thursday.
Because the appeals court issues its opinions on Tuesday and Friday mornings, it would have to rule Tuesday on the Justice Department’s appeal before AT&T can end the separation agreement and proceed with the integration.
The decision could have far-reaching consequences for both sides, reported Bloomberg. If the court ules for the Justice Department and sends the case back to Judge Richard Leon for reconsideration, it would cast a cloud over a deal AT&T says it needs to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Amazon.com.

45,"February 25, 2019",US: Khan may join Cicilline’s staff in the House,"

Lina Khan, who wrote a semi-viral Yale Law Journal article about Amazon, is in talks to join the staff of the congressional panel overseeing antitrust issues, according to the Daily Beast.
She comes from a school of antitrust thinkers who have called for breaking up Facebook.
Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has made no secret of his interest in taking on major internet companies as the newly minted chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust. Now, Khan, who did not respond to requests for comment, could become an ally in that work. The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department enforce antitrust laws by taking major corporations to court; changes on the Hill could mean increased pressure on them to do so.
“A lot of members don’t hire qualified staffers, especially on complicated issues like antitrust, which hinders their ability to get things done,” said a federal lobbyist who works on antitrust issues and spoke anonymously because of client concerns. “This is a person qualified for the job, who will supercharge Cicilline’s oversight work.”
“In hiring Lina, Cicilline will be more successful in pushing regulators to scrutinize the anti-competitive activity of companies like Facebook,” the lobbyist added.

46,"February 25, 2019","US: Visa, Mastercard, banks settle card fee suit","
In a settlement that has been given preliminary approval by a federal court in New York, Visa and Mastercard, along with bank defendants, have agreed to provide roughly US$6.24 billion in settlement funds. The funds are subject to a deduction that is said not to exceed US$700 million, according to a notice authorized by the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
According to the notice, which was released on Friday, February 22, “The defendants say they have done nothing wrong and the Court has not decided who is right, but the parties have agreed to a settlement. The Court has now given preliminary approval to this settlement.” That potential arrangement stems from a class action suit that contended that “Visa and Mastercard, separately, and together with certain banks, violated antitrust laws and caused merchants to pay excessive fees for accepting Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards” per the notice.
Merchants can either eventually file a claim and ask for payment, object to the settlement, or exclude themselves from the settlement class. Those merchants that file a valid claim and do not exclude themselves from the settlement class “will get money from the class settlement fund” if the settlement is approved, according to the announcement. A claim’s value is said to be determined by the “actual or estimated interchange fees” of a merchant’s payment transactions with Visa and Mastercard between January 1, 2004 and January 25, 2019...

47,"February 24, 2019",UK: KKR wants Asda after Sainsbury problems,"
Private equity group KKR is exploring a bid for UK supermarket chain Asda after a planned £7.3 billion takeover of the UK’s Sainsbury looks set to collapse.
The US buyout firm is thought to be working with Tony De Nunzio, a former Asda chief executive officer and now a senior adviser to KKR, according to the Financial Times.
The Sunday Times, which first reported KKR’s interest, reported that Tony De Nunzio, a senior adviser at the buyout group, would become the company’s chairman if it manages to strike a deal. Mr De Nunzio served as Asda’s finance director and later its chief executive before stepping down in 2005.
KKR has experience operating in the retail sector. Its acquisition of pharmacy chain Alliance Boots and its subsequent combination with US rival Walgreens stands as its most profitable investment over the past three decades.

Renault, Nissan, PSA Group, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and Jaguar Land Rover are being investigated by the European Commission for possible antitrust violations on car parts, a German magazine reported.
The probe centers around whether the companies colluded to raise prices by as much as 25% on car parts, with the help of consulting firm Accenture. The Commission’s investigation started in December, Der Spiegel reported, without stating where it got the information.
This would be the second large-scale investigation by the Commission into European carmakers. The regulator opened a probe in September into whether Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW colluded on clean-emissions technology for cars.

Nokia does not expect the possible exclusion of Chinese companies on security grounds to delay the rollout of next-generation 5G services in European markets, reported Reuters.
Debate is raging in Europe over whether to heed calls from Washington to bar China’s Huawei Technologies, even as big telecoms operators warn that such a move could set back the deployment of 5G by years.
According to Reuters, Nokia  CEO Rajeev Suri downplayed concerns that a reduced field of vendors could slow network upgrades. The real reasons for Europe’s growing 5G lag behind the United States are hold-ups in issuing spectrum to operators, as well as high auction costs in countries such as Italy, he said.
“I think you cannot say that you know the situation caused by some of this will delay 5G rollout or that others are not capable or ready to provide equipment. That would not be accurate,” Suri said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress, the industry’s main annual gathering in Barcelona.

According to Baxter International, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has closed an antitrust probe examining possible communication among producers of intravenous saline solutions during supply shortages that created higher prices.
Baxter, which received a grand jury subpoena in 2017 as part of the investigation, said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, February 21, that the DOJ informed it on November 30 of its decision to end the probe.
Other companies that in April 2017 disclosed receiving subpoenas as part of the investigation included Pfizer and ICU Medical, which earlier that year had acquired Pfizer’s global infusion therapy business.
Those companies have stated the New York attorney general has also sought records regarding business practices in the IV saline industry. Baxter in its SEC filing said it is cooperating with that investigation.
Baxter, Pfizer, ICU Medical, and the DOJ did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.
The DOJ’s probe came amid a shortage of IV solutions that dated back to late 2013, when producers began notifying hospitals they might experience delivery delays.
The solutions are among the most basic, commonly used hospital supplies needed to hydrate patients.
The US Food and Drug Administration in January 2014 added the solutions to its drug shortage list, at the time saying the shortage was triggered by factors including increased hospital demand, potentially related to flu season.

The EC probe on alleged price fixing is focusing on Norwegian salmon, despite raids taking place in the UK at the Scottish operations of Mowi (formerly Marine Harvest), Leroy Seafood Group, SalMar and Greig Seafood.
“We cannot comment on whether this [the EC probe] will lead to our own inspections or other activities towards this sector in Norway. But of course we will follow the EC-case with interest,” Kari Bjorkhaug Trones, director of investigation with Konkurranse Tilsynet, the country’s competitor authority, told Undercurrent News.

To win approval for the US$2 billion deal, the companies agreed to sell NxStage’s bloodline tubing set business, the agency stated. Fresenius and NxStage together dominate the market for the single-use plastic tubes used during dialysis, the agency stated.
The five FTC commissioners split along party lines in voting on whether to approve the merger. The three Republicans—Joseph Simons, Noah Phillips, and Christine Wilson—voted “yes,” while Democrats Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter dissented.

Chile’s LATAM Airlines has asked Brazil’s antitrust regulator CADE to boost its voting stake in LATAM Airlines Brazil to 51%, formalizing a controlling interest in Brazil’s No. 2 airline reported Reuters.
In December, Brazil’s then-President Michel Temer signed an executive order allowing foreigners, for the first time, to own up to 100% of domestic Brazilian airlines. That temporary measure will expire by June if not ratified by Congress.
While the move is the first concrete action in Brazil following Temer’s executive order, it will have little practical effect. In its financial statements, LATAM Brazil already says the Chilean company is its “indirect controller.” In 2012, Chile’s Lan merged with Brazil’s Tam, resulting in the creation of LATAM.

55,"February 20, 2019",UK: Regulator condemns Sainsbury’s-Asda deal,"
Britain’s competition regulator has dealt a blow to Sainsbury’s planned US$9.5 billion takeover of Walmart’s Asda, stating the supermarket groups are unlikely to be able to address its “extensive” concerns about the deal.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated the proposed acquisition could result in consumers facing “higher prices, reduced quality and choice, and a poorer overall shopping experience across the UK,” and expressed skepticism that selling stores alone could fix those problems.
Walmart-owned Asda is the UK’s third-largest supermarket chain, while Sainsbury’s is second. The takeover, agreed in April, would create the market leader, overtaking Tesco. The companies have insisted the combination would lead to lower prices.
The CMA disagreed, identifying 629 areas where there could be a substantial lessening of competition in supermarkets, more than the 463 it identified in its initial investigation,  and a further 290 areas where online competition could be reduced. There were smaller overlaps in convenience stores, where Asda is not a big participant, but it cited 132 locations where competition in petrol and diesel retailing could be reduced.

Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro has hired the investment banking unit of Banco Santander Brasil to revive efforts to sell its liquefied petroleum gas distribution unit, reported Reuters.
Petrobras, as the company is known, had agreed in 2016 to sell Liquigas Distribuidora to local rival Ultrapar Participações in a process managed by the investment banking unit of Itau Unibanco Holding.
But the 2.8 billion-real (US$753.86 million) deal was blocked by Brazil’s antitrust watchdog CADE in February 2018.
Petrobras’ new CEO Roberto Castello Branco in December announced the oil company would seek to sell US$26.9 billion in assets between 2019 and 2023, after it missed a prior US$21 billion divestment target for 2017-2018.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reached a settlement with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries over charges that its agreements with rivals impeded consumer access to lower-priced generic drugs, reported Reuters.
Under the terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, the FTC will dismiss its claims against Teva and its affiliates in three outstanding cases, and the parties will modify certain terms in their 2015 consent decree. Teva will not pay any additional money to the FTC as part of this settlement, the company announced.
“This settlement represents another milestone in the Commission’s unwavering commitment to put an end to harmful reverse-payment agreements,” said FTC chairman Joseph Simons, adding, “This broad settlement prevents the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs from entering into collusive agreements that prevent price competition by keeping generic drugs off the market.”
“We are very pleased to put these litigations against the FTC behind us,” said Brendan O’Grady, executive vice president and head of North America Commercial at Teva. “We also appreciate the FTC’s willingness to modify our consent decree to eliminate certain administrative burdens that will make it easier for us to navigate the patent issues that are critical to our business,” he noted.

Traditional media has been transformed by technological change and across the world, governments and regulators are contemplating the impact of the disruption on the production and consumption of news.
Central to this consideration is the influence of digital platforms, Google and Facebook particularly, which now in large part shape what news content we consume and when and how we consume it. Crucial to the platforms’ role as news gateways is the advertising that funds their business models, transferring revenue substantially away from news organisations in favour of the search and social media giants.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been conducting an inquiry into the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising markets and has recently released its preliminary report.

A federal judge has rejected standing challenges brought by numerous pharmaceutical companies in an attempt to dismiss several antitrust and consumer protection class action claims leveled by entities that either purchased or resold generic drugs at allegedly inflated prices, reported Law.com
The defendants, which consist of 25 pharmaceutical companies, had argued that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring claims based on state laws in jurisdictions where the class representatives did not either purchase or resell the drugs at issue. Specifically, the defendants contended the plaintiffs did not have Article III standing to bring the claims.
US District Judge Cynthia Rufe of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in her 48-page decision from Feb. 15, said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit “has not definitively answered” the question of how courts should balance the interplay between Article III standing and class standing. However, Rufe said the plaintiffs’ allegations showed a “substantial and shared interest” in proving the alleged misconduct in the states outlined in the complaints.
The consolidated multidistrict litigation In re Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation stems from a wide-ranging federal probe that in 2016 led two pharmaceutical executives to plead guilty to price-fixing charges.

Facebook is not currently in EU regulators’ crosshairs, but it may well be in future because of the crucial role played by data, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Tuesday, February 19.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s comments came two weeks after the German cartel office ruled that the world’s largest social network abused its market dominance to gather information about users without their consent.
Vestager said she has no case against Facebook regarding its market power for now but nevertheless was monitoring the market.
“We have some concerns. One thing is that we don’t have an open case now, that doesn’t preclude we don’t have a case in future. We are looking at the market very closely,” she told a European Parliament hearing.
The European Commission has previously indicated that Facebook’s issues could be better handled by privacy enforcers rather than by competition regulators.
Vestager has taken on tech giants including Google and Qualcomm in recent years and handed down million-euro fines for abusing their market power.

Facebook, which has been under fire for months over data scandals, expressed openness to new regulation.
According to a report in Reuters citing Facebook’s public policy manager Karim Palant, the executive said the social media giant is “open to meaningful regulation.” His comments came following calls by lawmakers in the U.K. for large tech companies to have to meet a code of ethics to prevent fake news from spreading and for preventing users from abusing the platforms. “We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform,” Reuters quoted Palant as saying. Facebook is “not the same company” even a year ago, with the social media giant already instituting a lot of changes, the executive noted.
The comments from Palant come on the heels of reporting by The Wall Street Journal that the company could pay a multi-billion dollar fine to the Federal Trade Commission to settle an inquiry by the regulator into its privacy practices. An exact amount hadn’t been agreed upon as of last week, but the fine is expected to be the largest to ever be imposed by the FTC on a technology company.  Google in 2012 paid $22.5 million to the FTC to settle an inquiry into how it handles data.

Uber, the ride-hailing startup, filed a lawsuit against the city of New York last week seeking to overturn a rule that puts a cap on the number of drivers that work for ride-hailing companies that can operate in the city.
According to a report in The Verge citing the lawsuit, Uber has an issue with the law, which is the first in the country and has been on the books since August, halting the issuance of new licenses to ride-hailing drivers for 12 months. Uber wants the law thrown out, fearing the city could make it a permanent cap.  The New York City Council also signed off in August on a minimum pay standard for drivers.
Backers of the law say it’s needed to enable the city to examine the impact ride-hailing has on congestion in the city, but Uber argues it amounts to a practice of banning first and studying later.
“Rather than rely on alternatives supported by transportation experts and economists, the City chose to significantly restrict service, growth, and competition by the for-hire vehicle industry, which will have a disproportionate impact on residents outside of Manhattan who have long been underserved by yellow taxis and mass transit,” argued Uber in the lawsuit, according to The Verge. “The City made this choice in the absence of any evidence that doing so would meaningfully impact congestion, the problem the City was ostensibly acting to solve.”

El nuevo regulador examinará las prácticas competitivas, la protección de datos personales y hará recomendaciones en temas de competencia, de acuerdo con una presentación realizada el miércoles por un panel asesor del gobierno.
El nuevo organismo también elaboraría nuevas directrices para evaluar si las fusiones y adquisiciones pueden provocar un monopolio sobre los datos de mensajería o datos personales.
El gobierno espera finalizar los planes para el nuevo regulador antes del verano, pero aún no se sabe cuándo estaría en pleno funcionamiento.

YouTube se ha opuesto vigorosamente a los cambios propuestos a las leyes.
El texto final de las normas debe ser confirmado formalmente por el Parlamento Europeo, que celebra elecciones en mayo, así como por el Consejo de la UE. Después, los estados miembros de la UE tendrán 24 meses para adoptar las nuevas normas dentro de sus leyes nacionales.

66,"February 17, 2019",US: DOJ backs CVS-Aetna buyout in latest filing,"
The Justice Department (DOJ) is standing by its defense of CVS Health’s US$69 billion acquisition of Hartford insurer Aetna.
In a 38-page document filed Wednesday, February 13, in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, government lawyers argued that their proposed settlement of the deal, which called for Aetna to sell off its standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug business, is sufficient to ensure that the merger does not destabilize the healthcare marketplace or hurt consumer choice.
The federal government’s most recent statement on the merger was intended to answer public comments submitted in the case over the last three months. Organizations like the American Medical Association and the National Community Pharmacists Association, together with business and healthcare industry groups, raised a variety of issues to the court, including concerns about anti-competitive consolidation and vertical integration in the health care sector.
The DOJ responded by noting that its consent decree keeps CVS and Aetna from consolidating interests in the one business where the companies competed directly and bolsters the competitiveness of Florida-based WellCare Health Plans, which absorbed Aetna’s Medicare Part D unit.
In response to charges that CVS could raise prices for drugs and services post-merger and abuse their market share by steering customers to Aetna insurance plans, government lawyers argued that neither route would prove profitable for the parent comp...

67,"February 17, 2019",EU: French antitrust plans could harm EU credibility says Monti,"
According to a report from Politico, former EU competition chief Mario Monti has delivered a stark warning that Paris is playing with fire by seeking to tear up Europe’s antitrust rules.
France and Germany are upset because the EU this month blocked Alstom and Siemens  from merging to form a European rail champion. Brussels argued the merger would form a behemoth that would harm European consumers, while Paris and Berlin claimed that the tie-up was necessary to combat rival manufacturers in China.
Monti disliked France’s desire to rewrite  antitrust rules as “un-French,” saying that Paris is usually a strong advocate of enforcement from Brussels. He warned that an assault on EU law by the government of President Emmanuel Macron could undermine the credibility of competition regulators in Brussels as they seek to take action against digital giants.
He told Politico in an interview that top French officials underestimate the likelihood of their actions backfiring.  “I found the comment of Bruno Le Maire, that Vestager acted in the interest of China, frankly unacceptable”,  Mario Monti.

68,"February 17, 2019","US: Facebook, FTC discuss multibillion dollar fine: report","
A report says Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are negotiating a “multibillion dollar” fine for the social network’s privacy lapses.
The Washington Post reported Thursday, February 14, that the fine would be the largest ever imposed on a tech company. Citing unnamed sources, it also stated the two sides have not yet agreed on an exact amount.
The FTC has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica and other privacy disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard users’ privacy.

69,"February 17, 2019",Japan: Nissan sought Japan’s help in avoiding merger,"
Nissan Motor had asked the Japanese government for help in fending off a proposal to merge with Renault SA, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, February 15.
The request by the automaker was made months before the arrest of former Nissan and Renault Chairman Carlos Ghosn in Japan in November, the paper stated.
The unusual request for government help “indicated the level of pressure that Nissan executives sensed coming from the French side” to merge the two automakers, the paper stated.
The French government is the biggest shareholder of Renault.
In response to the request, the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry drafted an agreement that would allow it to oversee talks between Nissan and Renault, a role Nissan considered invasive, the paper stated.

70,"February 14, 2019",EU: EC approves revamped copyright rules,"
European Union negotiators agreed Wednesday on codified language in a new set of sweeping copyright-reform rules, including a provision that would mandate YouTube and other internet platforms block copyrighted material when it’s uploaded. YouTube in particular has been particularly vigorous in opposing the proposed changes to the laws.
The finalized text of the rules must next be formally confirmed by the European Parliament, which holds elections this May, as well as the Council of the EU. After that, the EU’s member states will have 24 months to adopt the new rules into their national legislation.
“To finally have modern copyright rules for the whole of EU is a major achievement that was long overdue,” European Commission VP for the digital single market Andrus Ansip said in a statement released Wednesday. “The negotiations were difficult, but what counts in the end is that we have a fair and balanced result that is fit for a digital Europe: the freedoms and rights enjoyed by internet users today will be enhanced, our creators will be better remunerated for their work, and the internet economy will have clearer rules for operating and thriving.”
Proposed by the European Commission in April last year, the platform-to-business (P2B) law is targeted at Google Play, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store, Amazon Marketplace, eBay and Fnac Marketplace, reported Reuters.

71,"February 14, 2019",Japan: Nissan and Renault reaffirm alliance,"
Top executives from Nissan and Renault on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of an alliance that has been pressured by the ousting of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, but avoided discussing the potentially contentious issue of Nissan’s next chairman.
The newly appointed chairman of France’s Renault SA, Jean-Dominique Senard, arrived in Japan on Thursday for two days of meetings with Nissan.
“Our goal within the alliance has not changed, which means we want to make it irreversible”, he said, echoing comments made a year ago by Mr Ghosn. However, the Renault boss said that it was “too early” to give specifics about any structural changes to the alliance.
Before his arrest, Mr Ghosn had been pushing for a merger between the two. This was resisted by Nissan because of fears it would give Renault too much control, the Financial Times reported last year.

According to a report from Reuters, Japan’s government plans to set up a new regulator to scrutinize big tech companies like Facebook and Google amid growing concerns about monopoly practices and the handling of personal data.


The new regulator will examine competitive practices, the protection of personal data, and make antitrust recommendations, according to a presentation made at a government advisory panel on Wednesday.
The new body will also draw up new guidelines to evaluate whether mergers and acquisitions will lead to a monopoly on messaging data or personal data.
The government hopes to finalize the plans for the new regulator by the summer, but it is still uncertain when it will become fully operational.

UK stockbroker Shore Capital has bought rival Stockdale Securities in a deal worth £9 million (US$11.6 million). It is the latest example of consolidation in a sector that is expected to shrink under European trading rules, reported the Financial Times.
The tie-up will create the fourth-largest corporate broking and advisory business in London. The combined entity will advise around 125 clients and provide research on about 300 stocks.
“It is appealing to have that kind of scale,” said Simon Fine, co-chief executive of Shore. The deal would give Shore specialist investment fund capability and improve its corporate advisory and broking, equity research, sales and trading services, the company added.
The EU’s Mifid II rules, now a year old, have triggered a shake-up in the way brokerages do business, forcing asset managers to set up expensive systems for reporting trades and to pay for research and trading separately.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are planning to combine their European steel activities to create the continent’s No. 2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, raising concerns that far-reaching remedies are required to secure antitrust approval.
The European Commission is expected to outline its competitive concerns about the merger this week, calling on the two firms to offer compromises to avert a potential veto.
“We won’t support a merger at any price,” Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board and secretary at IG Metall, Germany’s biggest labor union, told Reuters on Wednesday, February 13.

The Competition Council announced that after examining documents and working sessions with relevant parties, it had discovered a number of new details related to possible violations of competition law in Grab’s acquisition of fellow ride-hailing platform Uber last March.
These discoveries prompted the council to return the case dossiers to the Ministry’s Competition and Consumer Protection Department for further investigation. The investigation is expected to run until April of this year.

76,"February 12, 2019",France: Gov wants major change in EU merger rules,"

According to the Financial Times, Paris has called for the biggest shake-up of EU merger rules in 30 years, as it responded to last week’s decision by Brussels to block the partnership between German and French train manufacturers Siemens and Alstom. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has expressed anger at the decision by the European Commission to veto the merger, on Tuesday, February 12, called for the creation of “European industrial champions,” reported the FT.
While Brussels warned that the combined company of Siemens and Alstom would have been overly dominant in signaling and high-speed trains on the European market, Paris has slammed the rules as a relic of the 20th century that risks handing technological supremacy to China.
Speaking alongside German finance minister Olaf Scholz in Brussels on Tuesday, Mr Le Maire put forward a three-point plan of rule changes, saying he would discuss it further with Berlin in the coming days.
The proposals include giving EU national leaders the right to overturn the Commission’s merger decisions, and equipping Brussels with the ability to approve a merger but subsequently to force the combined company to make divestments if competitive problems emerged.

T-Mobile US CEO John Legere heads to Capitol Hill this week to defend his proposed takeover of Sprint, Bloomberg reported.
Legere is set to appear Wednesday, February 13, before a House panel about the US$26.5 billion tie-up, which would unite the No. 3 and 4 US mobile carriers, sparking fears of higher prices as competition is lost. Sprint and T-Mobile claim the merger will make a stronger rival of leading providers AT&T and Verizon Communications.
The hearing before a panel of the House Energy Committee is shaping up to be a tougher test for Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure than when they appeared before the Senate last year after the deal was announced. Since then, deal opponents—including Dish Network, Altice USA and policy groups—have been able to refine their arguments against the merger and organize against it.

South Korea’s Supreme Court partially ruled in favor of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) in its longstanding legal fight with US chipmaker Qualcomm over fines for unfair practices to cement its monopolistic position.
The Supreme Court announced Monday, February 11, that Qualcomm should pay at least 200 billion won (US$178.4 million) in penalty out of total 273.2 billion won (US$242.9 million) slapped by the KFTC as it concluded the KFTC’s action was legitimate.
The Supreme Court, however, sent the case back to the lower Seoul High Court for reconsideration on the fine. It judged that some part of the penalty related to rebates paid by Qualcomm to LG on condition to use its radio frequency (RF) chips should be canceled because it found the practice didn’t have a significant damage on market competition as argued by the KFTC.
Qualcomm has not made an announcement regarding the latest court’s ruling, with a spokesperson of the Korean office saying that there is “nothing to say at the moment.”

Shipping company CMA CGM’s bid to enter the freight forwarding market took another step forward as the ocean carrier opened up its US$1.68 billion bid for Ceva Logistics to the company’s public shareholders.
Last week, the European Commission’s takeover board ruled that the combination of the fourth largest ocean carrier by size and the Swiss firm would not have an adverse effect on the market for ocean shipping.
The offer comes as shipping lines are seeking to take a bigger part of their customers’ supply chains by moving into inland transportation and freight management, outside the traditional scope of basic port-to-port transport. Denmark-based Maersk Line, the world’s biggest container carrier by capacity, has stated it wants to become an integrated freight operator like United Parcel Service and FedEx.

80,"February 12, 2019",Hipster Antitrust,"
By José Miguel de la Calle
 
Now that questions abound regarding the exponential growth of the giants of the Digital Economy (Google, Facebook, Netflix, Instagram, and others), some voices have reappeared that hope to implant the ideas of the so-called Neo-Brandeisians, whose positions have also been characterized under the catchy term of ‘Hipster Antitrust’ (a call back to American Antitrust’s roots). The term was coined by attorney Kostya Medvedovsky, as shown by his Twitter account byline: “Not a Hipster, despite coining the term ‘Hipster Antitrust.”
The Neo-Brandeisian movement seeks to follow up on the basic position taken by Justice Brandeis, who put forward several problems for competition related to large multinational corporations, simply due to their large size. The starting point for Neo-Brandeisian thinking is the rejection of the consumer welfare standard, which has ruled over the US’ antitrust law regime unanimously over the last several decades, ever since it was proposed by Robert Bork and picked up by the US Supreme Court in 1979, which pointed out that “Congress designated the Sherman Act as a prescription for consumer welfare”. The main reason for rejecting consumer welfare as the essential guidepost for competition policy is that is focuses exclusively on the search for low prices, which at first glance translates into gains for consumers, but pushes aside extra-economic criteria that may be as or more important, aimed at different ...

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it had decided to delay the publication of its report to give it enough time to “reach a fully reasoned final decision” on the £12 billion (US$15.4 billion) merger of grocery store chains Asda and Sainsbury’s.
An inquiry group made up of CMA panel members was due to report back by 5 March 5, but this timetable has now been extended to 30 April 30. The CMA stated Competition and Markets Authority said there were special reasons why the original March 5 deadline had been pushed back to April 30, citing the “scope and complexity of the investigation.”
It added that it needed to consider issues raised by both supermarkets and third parties, as well as the need to reach a fully reasoned provisional decision.
Combining Asda with Sainsbury’s would create the UK’s largest supermarket group with a market share of over 30%. The two companies have argued that their increased scale will result in lower prices for consumers, but most observers think they will be required to sell off at least some stores in order to secure approval.

The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday, February 8, ordered the reinstatement of a jury’s US$44 million award against Swisher International—the world’s largest cigar-maker—based on its effort to stifle competition from an upstart rival.
Following the jury’s April 2016 determination that plaintiff Trendsettah USA  incurred damages in the amount of US$44,446,482 based on the defendant’s conduct, United States District Court Judge James V. Selna of the Central District of California made post-trial rulings and, later re-considering them, granted summary judgment to Swisher on the antitrust claims.
Selna also granted Swisher a new trial on a claim of attempted monopolization and found it was entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, on a claim of actual monopolization. He denied Swisher’s motion for judgment as a matter of law in connection with attempted monopolization.

Thyssenkrupp expects to receive in the course of the week a statement of objections from the European Commission regarding its planned joint venture with Tata Steel, it stated in e-mailed comments.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters that the charge sheet, which details areas of concern that need to be addressed for the deal to get approval, would likely be sent this week.
“As soon as the statement of objections has arrived we will thoroughly examine the Commission’s arguments,” a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said, adding the group continued to be confident that the transaction could be closed in early 2019.
The joint venture, announced in June last year, is the biggest shake-up in Europe’s steel industry in more than a decade. To be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the entity will have around 48,000 workers and about €17 billion (US$19.2 billion) in sales.
The deal, which took two years to get off the ground, is aimed at creating synergies and reducing overcapacity and will form the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.
The EU competition enforcer opened an in-depth investigation last year and identified issues in steel for car parts, packaging such as food and aerosol cans and electrical steel for engineering products including transformers.

What do we do,  shall we divide the European forces, or try to merge the European forces from the industrial point of view?” Bruno Le Maire told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Sunday.
His comments come after the European Union blocked a rail deal between Alstom and Siemens on Wednesday, citing competition concerns. The merger proposal between the French and the German companies planned to create a European rail champion with revenues of about 15 billion euros ($17 billion). The merger proposal referred only to the companies’ transport services and would have combined them into one new firm, solely controlled by Siemens.
The EU’s competition authority specified that the proposed merger would have created an “undisputed” market leader in several mainline signaling markets, as well as reducing the number of suppliers by removing one of the two largest manufacturers of very high-speed rolling stock.

89,"February 10, 2019",US: House Panel Passes Bill Targeting OPEC,"
A US House of Representatives committee approved a bill on Thursday that would open up the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to antitrust lawsuits, but it was uncertain if the measure would be considered by the full chamber, reported Reuters.
The House Judiciary Committee passed the bipartisan bill, known as the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, on a voice vote.
The legislation would change US antitrust law to revoke the sovereign immunity that has long protected OPEC members from US lawsuits. It allows the US attorney general to sue the oil producers group or any of its members on grounds of collusion.
“It’s long past time to put an end to illegal price-fixing by OPEC. The oil cartel and its member countries need to know that we are committed to stopping their anti-competitive behavior,” Grassley said in a statement. “We, in the United States, have been working for years to develop our domestic clean, renewable and alternative energy resources. We’re also committed to reducing our reliance on foreign oil, especially when it’s artificially and illegally priced. Our bill shows the OPEC members we will not tolerate their flagrant antitrust violations.”


Versions of the bill have appeared without success in Congress for the past 20 years. The committee also approved a version of the bill last year by voice vote, but it never reached the full House for a vote.

90,"February 10, 2019","US: DOJ joins UNC, Duke no-poach case","
According to a report from Bloomberg the Department of Justice’s antitrust division wants a say in a class action alleging that Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill conspired to suppress medical school professors’ wages.
The DOJ said in a court notice that it expects to file a statement of interest,  used to assert the government’s arguments without being a party to the lawsuit, before March 12.
The suit, filed in 2015 by a Duke University radiologist, claims that senior administrators and deans at Duke and UNC’s medical schools allegedly entered into a pact agreeing not to hire each other’s faculty members. Such agreements, called no-poach contracts, could be an antitrust violation since they can reduce employees’ wages and limit job mobility.
“The United States has a significant interest in filing a statement of interest on these issues because it enforces the federal antitrust laws and has a strong interest in their correct application,” the DOJ said in the notice, filed Feb. 6.

91,"February 6, 2019",US: House Judiciary Panel probes competition in health care,"
Scrutiny of competition in the health-care industry is on the agenda of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, two sources familiar with the Committee’s actions told Bloomberg Law.
“Competition in health care is definitely on the list of priorities for the committee,” Richard Luchette, communications director for panel’s chairman David Cicilline (Dem-Rhode Island), wrote in an email.
Among the potential areas for scrutiny: the increasing consolidation of hospitals, the CVS-Aetna merger, and the Celgene/Bristol-Myers Squibb tie-up. The panel is joining the efforts of four other House committees in taking a closer look at health care, an issue that helped Democrats win control of the House in the midterm elections.
Bloomberg reported that hospital and health system merger and acquisition activity has been increasing over the past 15 years, from 38 transactions in 2003 to 115 in 2017, according to an analysis by management consulting and software firm Kaufman Hall. It has been an area of concern for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administration Seema Verma.
The Committee also could look at the relationships between pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen who negotiate drug discounts and decide which drugs get preferred coverage in health-care plans, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and insurance plans, an area that has been of concern for the Trump administration.

Major travel websites including Trivago, Expedia, Agoda, and Booking.com have agreed to change the way they do business after a UK investigation found some of them were deceiving users about hotel room prices and search results.
The UK Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday, February 6, announced the results of its probe, which focused on issues such as pressure selling, misleading discount claims, and hidden charges.
The regulator stated that some buyers were warned that other users were looking at the same hotel, giving them a “false impression” of a room’s popularity. In other cases, the full cost of the room was not displayed.
While not all of the platforms engaged in each of the unfair practices, they have now agreed to follow a common set of guidelines.
The companies have pledged to display all charges including taxes and refrain from pressure selling. They will be clearer about discounts and only promote deals that are really available at that time.
The changes must be made by September 1, 2019.

93,"February 6, 2019",EU: Antitrust policy gets heat after mergers blocked,"

According to a report from Reuters Siemens and Alstom’s merger collapsed on Wednesday after EU regulators blocked the deal, prompting Germany and France to call for an overhaul of EU competition policy to better meet global challenges.
The European Commission also rejected a bid by German copper company Wieland-Werke AG to buy a business unit from Aurubis, Europe’s biggest copper smelter, similarly arguing the deal could have pushed up prices for consumers.
The two vetoes are likely to spur efforts by France and Germany to loosen EU competition rules so as to take a more global than solely European view of mergers and potentially to allow EU ministers to have a say.
Shortly after the Commission’s announcements, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules to facilitate large cross-border mergers.
“Protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China, the United States and others,” Kaeser said in a statement.
EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Siemens and Alstom’s argument about merging to compete with their bigger Chinese state-owned rival CRRC in the European market.
“We don’t see the Chinese coming. The Chinese are nowhere, not at all in Europe,” she told a news conference.

T-Mobile has committed to offering the same or better rate plans as those offered as of today’s date for three years following the merger, reported Reuters. If the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approves the telecom company’s US$26 billion merger with competitor Sprint, T-Mobile will put price increases on hold for three years, T-Mobile CEO John Legere wrote in note sent this week to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.
“While we are combining our networks over the next three years, T-Mobile today is submitting to the commission a commitment that I stand behind — a commitment that New T-Mobile will make available the same or better rate plans for our services as those offered today by T-Mobile or Sprint,” Legere wrote in the letter.
Some critics have opposed the deal, announced in April, saying the elimination of one of the four largest wireless providers—Sprint is the No. 4, behind Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile—will lead to higher prices and harm consumers.
The pledge comes a week before two committees in the House of Representatives—Energy and Commerce and Judiciary—hold a joint hearing to discuss the transaction. The hearing is set for February 13, and both Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.

Former Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Commissioner Mignon Clyburn is working to help T-Mobile and Sprint get their US$26 billion merger approved by regulators.
Clyburn, a Democrat, confirmed she’s working as a paid consultant to the carriers to advise them on their impending merger. The news of her involvement was first reported by Politico on Monday, February 4.
The companies, whose merger was announced in April last year, need approval from the FCC and the US Department of Justice.
“Affordable broadband access is a critical priority particularly for those Americans who are underserved or currently have no viable options at all,” Clyburn said in an interview with CNET. “I am advising T-Mobile and Sprint as they seek to accelerate the creation of an inclusive nationwide 5G network on how best to build a bridge across the digital divide that currently exists in our country.”

96,"February 5, 2019",India: Walmart may exit Flipkart merger after new FDI e-commerce regulations?,"
New foreign direct investment (FDI) rules regarding online marketplaces may cause issues for the Walmart-Flipkart merger. According to investment bank Morgan Stanley, Walmart may back out of its merger with Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, reported India Today.
Implemented from February 1, the new FDI rules bar online marketplaces with foreign investments from selling products from sellers in which the online marketplaces hold a stake. The new FDI rules also ban exclusive marketing arrangements.
Morgan Stanley, in a report titled “Assessing Flipkart Risk to Walmart EPS” dated February 4, claimed that “an exit is likely, not completely out of the question, with the Indian e-commerce market becoming more complicated.” The group stated an exit like this would not be unprecedented as Amazon had done the same in China in 2017.
The new FDI regulations are expected to heavily impact Flipkart as the e-commerce giant may have to remove up to 25% of its products from its site. The biggest effect will be on the smartphone and electronic inventory of the website, a high earning segment for the website, due to the government targeting exclusive deals.

Managers of £4-trillion (US$5.23-trillion) in assets must clearly spell out to customers from May how they measure performance of money invested in their funds, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on Monday, February 4.
The FCA published a set of new rules for asset managers, stating its review of the market found “weak price competition” leading to lower returns for savers, reported The Financial Times.
“We’re working to make competition work better in the asset management market and protect those least able to actively engage with their investments,” said Christopher Woolard, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition.
“Today’s remedies build on those we’ve already introduced and will make it easier for investors to choose the best fund for them and help them achieve their investment objectives,” he added.
It was the second batch of remedies or rule changes following publication of its market study into asset management in November 2015 to improve “value for money” for investors in funds that have been accused of being opaque regarding fees and charges.

Bulgaria’s Commission for Protection of Competition (CPC) announced on Monday, February 4, that it is launching an in-depth probe into arms maker Emko’s planned acquisition of local peer Dunarit, in line with a recent ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC).In January, the SAC cancelled a decision by the competition regulator dating back to 2016 to let the deal move ahead without analysing it, CPC documents showed.
Back in 2016, when Emko notified the competition regulator of the planned acquisition, CPC decided that it would not look into the deal because the combined turnover of the two companies was below the regulatory limit.
The antitrust body’s decision was challenged in court by local company Viafot Investment Bulgaria, which operates in the same market segment as the parties to the deal.

The probe is one of many that the social networking company faces over the handling of customer data throughout Europe. An Irish data-protection commissioner said in an interview last week that her agency currently had seven separate investigations into Facebook.
The German probe is targeting the way Facebook collects information on how users surf the internet to drive its advertising revenue. The Bundeskartellamt, the regulator’s German name, has been probing the terms since 2016 and last year several times postponed the final decisions.

Baxter said Friday that it has been cleared from a US Department of Justice antitrust probe, launched in 2017, investigating companies that market intravenous saline solutions.
The probe came as hospitals endured a shortage of intravenous saline solutions, which are used to hydrate hospital patients. The shortage dates back to late 2013, after drugmakers told hospitals they might experience delays in deliveries of saline.
The case argued that drugmakers price fixed the price of their saline solution. The shortage and rapidly rising prices of the most ubiquitous of hospital supplies came to the forefront in the fall of 2015 when senators from both parties held hearings and called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate why shortages of saline persisted even as prices were rising.

In a separate previous case, the Commission charged Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse, and a fourth bank in December with being part of a bond cartel, also citing traders using chat rooms.

A potential tie-up between German banks Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank should get the nod of regulators in Germany.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a senior German regulator, reported the government is prepared to support a merger of the two to create one banking giant. The move is an acknowledgment about the health of the two banks as standalone entities, noted the report. The senior regulator told the paper that during the past few weeks he had looked over the plan and unofficially backed the idea of merging the two banks. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and the Social Democratic Party have been pushing for the merger. “This is a decision about industrial policy and it has to be made by politicians,” the regulator told the Wall Street Journal, adding that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives are also backing the idea of a merger. Officials from both parties declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal.
The Wall Street Journal reported that a person close to Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that owns a lot of shares in both banks, said the executives wouldn’t block a deal if it got the blessing of the German government. In 2018 Cerberus told investors the German market was large enough for two big banks and that it wasn’t calling for a merger of the two, noted the Wall Street Journal.
While the executives at Deutsche Bank have been resisting efforts to merge, the paper said it may not have too much control of its future any longer...

Officials from member-country antitrust regulators met on Thursday to vote on the deal, a key step toward a final Commission veto as soon as February 6. The EU’s top antitrust official, Johannes Laitenberger, declined to address political pressure surrounding the tie-up, telling reporters in Brussels, “We do our job and our job is to provide the decision makers with facts and with evidence.”
According to Bloomberg, blocking of the deal on concerns it would harm competition in Europe would be a blow to Le Maire, who has repeatedly criticized the EU’s reluctance to back the creation of a leading Franco-German train-equipment company. He’s now seeking to make antitrust laws a central topic in EU parliament elections in May.

Regulatory Sandbox and Competition of Financial Technologies in Taiwan By Andy C. M. Chen (Chung Yuan Christian University)1
Financial technology, or “FinTech” for short, has become the buzzword for today’s digital economy. The rapid advancements of information technology and the Internet assist financial institutions to provide their products and services more efficiently and in a way more tailored to their customers’ needs. Insurance companies, for example, have used telematics technology and big data analytics to better understand the risk preferences of their potential clients. This in turn has allowed insurance companies to design insurance policies more aligned with incentives that engage risk-taking activities by the insured and to contain the moral-hazard problem. In addition, FinTech enables and facilitates entry by non-financial firms into markets where regulated financial institutions have been conventionally viewed as essential intermediaries for transaction flows. FinTech gradually subverts this business model. Today, instead of lining up before an automatic teller machine or a bank counter, an increasing number of people surf online to make payment transfers with their mobile wallets. It is fair to say that FinTech is the primary driving force behind financial innovation.
To sustain the momentum of FinTech innovation, several jurisdictions, including the UK, Denmark, Canada, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Brunei, and Australia, have implemen...

Antitrust issues were a hot topic at the 15th annual State of the New conference held in Washington, DC on Tuesday, January 29.
House Antitrust chairman David Cicilline (Dem-Rhode Island) opened the program with strong words about Google’s perceived anti-competitive behavior, both as a gatekeeper and for its buying splurge in which it has gobbled up smaller firms. This “concentration of power” creates “pernicious impacts on a free and diverse press,” Cicilline said, especially “in the absence of a competitive marketplace.” He cited reports on Google’s ability to manipulate traffic on its ad networks as well as with its readers and users. All of this affects “legacy news companies and digital publishers alike,” Cicilline said. “The free and open internet … is incompatible with this trend toward centralization online.”
“It’s vital that the House Antitrust Subcommittee takes up these matters in a top-to-bottom investigation [to determine] whether use of market power harms the competitive process online,” he said. “We cannot have a democracy without a free and diverse press”….one that gives publishers “a level playing field to negotiate with dominant platforms.”

Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, is pressing ahead with an internal recommendation to veto the tie-up after last-ditch concessions from the German and French train manufacturers failed to address her concerns, according to several people with direct knowledge of the decision.
The decision deals a blow to a push by France and Germany to create “European champions” able to compete with state-backed foreign rivals, particularly from China. It will probably reignite a debate over the EU’s antitrust regime.

US antitrust chief Makan Delrahim says the Justice Department (DOJ) will be watching Facebook’s messaging integration, reported Bloomberg.
Speaking at the State of the Net conference, Delrahim said, “We’ll watch it with interest” even though it wouldn’t trigger any merger review.The DOJ will still have interest in whether combining the message services gives Facebook anticompetitive market power, he said.
When asked whether past mergers might have been a mistake, he said “I’m not privy to the facts and the economics of some of those past mergers. It’s really easy to say that Facebook and Instagram should have never been allowed to merge, and they should be competing today.”
On Friday, January 25, CPI reported that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg planned to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger at the technical level.

110,"January 30, 2019",US: Qualcomm vs. FTC arguments wrap up,"
Lawyers for Qualcomm and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), after weeks of arguments, have both rested their cases in a trial that could very well inform technological innovation, and America’s role in that innovation, reported CNET.
The key issue in the case is the IP licensing rates Qualcomm charges for access to its massive catalog of standard-essential patents.The FTC has accused Qualcomm of operating a monopoly in the mobile chip market, which hurt rivals and caused handset makers to raise their prices.
For the FTC to win the case, it has the burden of showing that Qualcomm had a monopoly, that it had market power, and that it used that power in negotiations with handset makers to command high royalties. The FTC also has to show that Qualcomm’s conduct hurt competitors and that the anticompetitive actions continue or will start again in the future.
FTC attorney Jennifer Milici kicked things off Tuesday afternoon, January 29, by detailing how Qualcomm used its power in the 3G and 4G chip market to force handset makers like Apple to sign licensing agreements with excessively high royalties. If Qualcomm isn’t stopped, she said, it’ll do the same thing in the 5G market.
Qualcomm attorney Robert Van Nest of law firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters, argued during his closing that the FTC didn’t meet its burden in the case and that Qualcomm won business “through superior innovation and better products.”
“High royalties alone is not the ...

Missouri’s new senator, conservative Republican Josh Hawley, said Tuesday he would be amenable to working with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on a mutual probe of the power and policies of big social media companies like Google and Facebook.
Hawley, R-Mo., said Tuesday he and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had not discussed joining together. But each has separately raised concerns about the power and influence and the personal privacy policies of social media companies lijke Microsoft, Facebook and Google. Hawley has said he would use his position on the Senate Judiciary Committee for anti-trust and other probes.
Ocasio-Cortez, whose defeat of incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary in the Bronx, New York, last year has gotten her uncommon attention for a House freshman, this week criticized Google, Facebook and Microsoft for sponsoring a conference that include a panel questioning global climate change.

112,"January 29, 2019",Australia: TPG abandons mobile network plan over Huawei ban,"

Australian company TPG Telecom announced on Tuesday, January 29, it had abandoned the rollout of what would have been the country’s fourth mobile network because of a ban on Chinese giant Huawei, reported the Financial Times.
In light of the ban announced in August, “that upgrade path has now been blocked,” TPG’s statement said. TPG said in its statement it did not make commercial sense to continue investing in a network that could not be upgraded easily to a 5G standard, which will offer faster consumer services and which will support an increasing number of industrial applications.
Australia blocked Huawei and Chinese mobile device maker ZTE from its 5G network due to security concerns. The government stated involvement of a company “likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government” presented too much risk.
“It is extremely disappointing that the clear strategy the company had to become a mobile network operator at the forefront of 5G has been undone by factors outside of TPG’s control,” said David Teoh, executive chairman of TPG.

According to a report from Bloomberg, T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify about their planned US$26.5 billion merger before a Democratic-controlled House panel.
The hearing, scheduled for February 13, gives Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, an opportunity to examine a deal that would reduce the US wireless market to three carriers. Cicilline has vowed to look into the rising concentration and market power wielded by companies in industries like technology and health care.
“A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would combine two of the four largest wireless carriers and the carriers with the largest numbers of low-income customers,” Cicilline said in a statement with Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania. “As the committees with oversight of the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice, we must hold this hearing to examine the effects on important issues like jobs, costs to consumers, innovation and competition.”
Cicilline’s plans are part of a broader effort by Democrats, who took control of the House earlier this month, to increase congressional oversight of the Trump administration.

Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), Union National Bank (UNB), and Al Hilal Bank agreed to a merger on Tuesday, January 29, to create the third-largest bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The bank will become the fifth largest in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with 420 billion UAE dirham (US$114.4 billion) in assets with increased productivity and economies of scale expected to boost profitability, the statement said.
The merger “makes a lot of strategic sense,” said Richard Segal, a senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London. “The first-half closing timetable seems ambitious, unless some of the preliminary work has already been undertaken.”
The merger, first announced in September, was unanimously recommended to shareholders by the boards of ADCB and UNB, the banks announced in a joint statement.

115,"January 28, 2019","EU: Alstom, Siemens merger concessions may not save rail deal","
Efforts by Alstom and Siemens to create a European rail champion could yet hit the buffers despite their latest concessions to try to address antitrust concerns.
The merger aims to create the world’s second largest rail company—with combined revenues of about €15 billion (US$17.1 billion)—but the deal has met opposition since it was announced in September 2017.
In a statement on Monday, January 28, France’s Alstom confirmed that last-minute concessions had been offered, but sounded a note of caution, adding: “There is, however, still no certainty that the content of this package will be sufficient to alleviate the concerns of the (European) Commission.”
People familiar with the matter said last week that the European Union competition watchdog would block the deal, with a decision likely on February 6, before the February 18 deadline.
German politician Manfred Weber, leader of the European People’s Party in the European Parliament, said the latest proposals were a good way forward.
But a senior EU official cautioned that if the new concessions did not completely remedy problems raised by a market inquiry, the EU competition office will have no room for maneuvers.
Germany’s Siemens and Alstom have argued that their deal would help them be better equipped to compete with China’s state-owned CRRC, but the EU has stressed its concerns lay with defending consumer interests rather than creating regional industrial powerhouses.

Two US House panels will hold a joint hearing on Feb. 13 on T-Mobile US and Sprint proposed $26 billion merger and its potential impact on consumers, The Hill reported.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee will hold a joint hearing to “examine the merger’s potential impacts on consumers, workers and the wireless industry,” the committees said in a statement on Monday. Both T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere and Sprint Chairman Marcelo Claure have agreed to testify.

“We look forward to examining this merger from the perspective of what is in the best interest of consumers and hardworking people,” they added in the statement.
The statement was also signed by Reps. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairmen of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, respectively.

Ocasio-Cortez’s comments came in the aftermath of layoffs at a number of number of news organizations, including BuzzFeed and HuffPost.
“The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies & concentration of ownership,” she tweeted on Saturday, adding: “The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally & economically unsustainable. We can’t simply accept the cliché that ‘journalism is dying.’ Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it – and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too.”

Google dijo en una declaración trimestral al Congreso que gastó US $ 4.9 millones en actividades de cabildeo durante el cuarto trimestre, ligeramente por encima de los US $ 4.4 millones en el mismo período del año anterior. El total de 2018 también superó los US $ 18.04 millones gastados en actividades de cabildeo en 2017, de acuerdo con el seguimiento de las presentaciones por parte del Centro no partidista para políticas receptivas.
Facebook reveló que también gastó la mayor parte de su vida en el cabildeo del gobierno de EE. UU. En 2018, con un valor de US $ 12.62 millones. Eso fue superior a los US $ 11.51 millones de hace un año, según los datos del Centro para la Política Responsiva.

StarKist announced late Friday, January 25, that it has agreed to a settlement worth US$20.5 million with Walmart to resolve antitrust claims. Pittsburgh-based Starkist noted that Walmart is the largest retailer for canned tuna in the United States, making a deal with the Arkansas-based company critical.
“StarKist is pleased to resolve this matter with our valued customer, Walmart. The resolution is a business-oriented and reasonable one, which sets a benchmark for resolving remaining matters with our other valued customers,” said Scott Meece, StarKist’s general counsel and senior vice president, in the official announcement.
Starkist, owned by South Korean parent Dongwon, is one of three major tuna suppliers who have been investigated for price-fixing in recent years. The US Department of Justice has been looking into allegations that StarKist, Bumble Bee Foods, and Tri-Union Seafoods, which owns Chicken of the Sea, conspired to keep prices artificially high.

121,"January 27, 2019",US: FB’s plan to merge messaging services may raise antitrust concerns,"
 
 
Facebook’s reported plans to integrate its three messaging platforms could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny.
The New York Times reported on Friday, January 25, that Facebook plans to combine the technical infrastructure behind WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, though the apps will continue to function as separate services. The paper cited four people familiar with the company’s plans.
CNBC spoke with several antitrust lawyers who all said that Facebook’s move is unlikely to bring new antitrust action against the company.
Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the Times that Facebook’s plans would be “a terrible outcome for internet users,” and Representative Ro Khanna (Democrat-California) took to Twitter to voice his concern.
“This is why there should have been far more scrutiny during Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp which now clearly seem like horizontal mergers that should have triggered antitrust scrutiny,” Khanna wrote.
Facebook is facing pressure over its privacy practices and platform manipulation by foreign actors. At a hearing of international lawmakers in the UK in November, a Canadian representative suggested antitrust might be the solution to Facebook’s problems.
“What we’re regulating … are the symptoms,” said Charlie Angus, Canada’s vice chairman of the House of Commons’ standing committee on access to information, privac...

The Philippine competition watchdog on Friday, January 25, announced it has sanctioned ride-hailing service Grab for obstructing an audit aimed at preventing anti-competitive practices, and warned it could void the company’s acquisition of Uber’s regional business if the violations continue.
Philippine Competition Commission Chairman Arsenio Balisacan said the regulator fined Grab 6.5 million philippine pesos (US$123,000) for “submitting deficient, inconsistent and incorrect data” related to fares.
Grab’s actions impaired the Commission and an independent auditor’s ability to monitor compliance with voluntary commitments the company made to address concerns about anti-competitive practices.
Grab in March took over US-based rival Uber’s Southeast Asian operations, which the Commission approved in August. To address competition issues, Grab agreed to periodic post-merger monitoring and promised not to permit “extraordinary deviation” from minimum fares, among other commitments.

In a letter sent to two top members of the US Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, five US Senate Democrats called for a hearing on the potential effects of the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, reported CNET.
The letter brought up concerns that the merger could lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and less flexibility when you want to switch carriers. There’s also concern that the merger could impact low-income consumers since T-Mobile and Sprint are also competitors in the prepaid front.
Opponents of the merger say the reduction in competitors would consolidate the market too much. But supporters, including the companies, say scale is needed to build new 5G infrastructure and to compete in the market.
While the Federal Communication Commission’s review of the merger is on hold during the partial government shutdown, opposition to the deal is growing. A group called the 4Competition Coalition was formed last month to challenge the merger. Several rural carriers, including C Spire, Blue Wireless, and Pine Belt Cellular have joined the coalition. The group now has 23 members.

Attorneys sparred in federal court Friday, January 25, over whether a judge should find Qualcomm’s patent license offer to Apple was fair, reported Courthouse News. The patent litigation between Apple and Qualcomm heads toward trial this spring.
Apple sued Qualcomm in the Southern District of California in 2017 over claims Qualcomm’s monopoly on chipset technology used in smartphones caused Apple and its contract manufacturers to overpay to use the patented technology.
At Friday’s late afternoon court hearing, Apple attorney Ruffin Cordell, with Fish & Richardson of Washington DC, argued US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel should not make a declaratory judgment finding Qualcomm’s patent license is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, or FRAND, reported Courthouse News.
“The reason they are doing [this] is to use it as a negotiating tool for ongoing talks with Apple should those ever resume,” Cordell said in urging Curiel not to find Qualcomm’s patent license is FRAND-compliant.
The trial in San Diego is scheduled for April 15.

Mr. Zuckerberg has also ordered all of the apps to incorporate end-to-end encryption, the people said, a significant step that protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in the conversation. After the changes take effect, a Facebook user could send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, for example. Currently, that isn’t possible because the apps are separate.



Facebook is still in the early stages of the work and plans to complete it by the end of this year or in early 2020.

Chile’s SQM, the world’s second largest producer of lithium, has taken measures to protect sensitive information from China’s Tianqi, which recently acquired a 23.77% share of the company.
A Chilean antitrust court approved the transaction, but placed conditions on the sale that limit Tianqi’s access to SQM business secrets. Additionally, Tianqi was not to be allowed to name any of its executives or employees to SQM’s board. The company was also told it would have to notify regulators of any future, lithium-related deal with either the Chilean producer or rival Albemarle.
SQM on Wednesday, January 23, announced its board had approved additional measures to safeguard company secrets.
The lithium miner told financial regulator CMF that all requests for sensitive information by a board member “appointed by a shareholder who is also a competitor” would first be routed through SQM’s CEO, and then shared with Chilean antitrust regulators.
The CEO would be authorized to deny access to business secrets, but only on the order of the regulator.

The agency stated said it has secured formal commitments from 16 celebrities, who also include models Alexa Chung and Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley, to change how they label social media posts to their millions of followers.
Brands pay thousands of dollars for a single social media post. But European Union consumer protection law requires social media users to disclose whether they have received gifts or cash to endorse a brand, to avoid giving the impression the post represents their personal view, the CMA explained.

130,"January 23, 2019",EU: Bridgestone to acquire TomTom’s telematics business,"
TomTom will remain independent and grow its core digital maps business, its CEO said on Tuesday, January 22,  after the company agreed to sell its fleet management business to the European subsidiary of Japan’s Bridgestone for €910 million (US$1 billion).
Amsterdam-based TomTom faces a turning point after Google broke into the market to supply maps to carmakers last year, striking deals with Renault and Volvo and upsetting a duopoly between TomTom and its traditional larger rival HERE.
“On the one hand (Google’s entry) is scary, but on the other hand it really focuses the mind,” said Harold Goddijn, TomTom’s founder and CEO, in an interview with Reuters.
The Telematics sale price was slightly higher than analysts had estimated when TomTom announced plans to sell it in September, but TomTom shares slid 6.5% to €7.53 after the deal was announced, as questions over the company’s future returned to the fore.
TomTom, which is debt-free, will return €750 million of the Telematics proceeds to shareholders via a capital repayment and keep €160 million to fund further development of its mapping and navigation technology, which is used in Apple maps, among others.
At the price announced on Tuesday, Telematics accounts for almost half of TomTom’s €1.89 billion market capitalization.

Merger Review in the 2020s: Do Digitalization and Globalization Change the Analysis? – By Toshiko Igarashi (Japan Fair Trade Commission)1
On November 7 and 8, 2018, ICN Merger Working Group held the fifteenth ICN Merger Workshop, in Tokyo, hosted by the Japan Fair Trade Commission. Over 200 participants, including agency officials and NGAs (Non-Governmental Advisors) from about 40 jurisdictions participated, and discussed the role and the challenges of merger review in the digitalized and globalized economy under the theme “Merger Review in the 2020s: Do Digitalization and Globalization Change the Analysis?”
2018 ICN Merger Workshop
The two-day workshop consisted of four plenary sessions and sixteen breakout sessions.2 Plenary sessions addressed broader themes of how competition agencies are or should respond to changes in the digital and global economy, while breakout sessions addressed narrower topics within that theme.
The opening plenary session, Merger Review in the Digital Economy, presented an overview of the characteristics of mergers in the digital economy and the experiences of competition agencies. Panelists from the UK, Portugal, and Singapore discussed their experiences, following the introduction by the Canadian moderator. The UK panelist presented legal, analytical, and evidential challenges of reviewing merger in the digital economy. While the UK’s “share of supply” jurisdictional test provided its competition agency with the ability of revie...

132,"January 22, 2019",EU: Mastercard fined US$650M for breaking antitrust laws,"
The European Commission has fined US payment system Mastercard €570 million (US$648 million) for limiting the possibility for merchants to benefit from better conditions offered by banks established elsewhere across the EU.
“By preventing merchants from shopping around for better conditions offered by banks in other Member States, Mastercard’s rules artificially raised the costs of card payments, harming consumers and retailers in the EU,”Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement on Tuesday, January 22.
Brussels found that until December 2015, the payment system’s rules made acquiring banks apply the interchange fees of the country where the retailer was located, instead of allowing them the benefit of lower interchange fees offered in another member of the 28-state bloc.
“This led to higher prices for retailers and consumers, to limited cross-border competition and to an artificial segmentation”of the market, according to the Commission’s investigation.
The fine is the latest step in line with the Commission’s policy to reduce card fees for European merchants.

133,"January 22, 2019",EU: Vestager plans Big Tech policy report,"
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s top antitrust cop, is coming to the end of her term as antitrust enforcer, but not before she plans to release a report laying out a long-term plan to police the world’s largest tech companies.
Vestager has tussled with many of the big name tech companies, including Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. Her term ends in October 2019, so she’s working a report that will lead competition policies in the digital era, according to a report by the AP.
Feedback has been collected from companies, experts and business groups that show the need for more regulation, and her report — which is scheduled to be released in March — will reflect that need.
“The most important thing is that the majority of input is pro-enforcement,” she said. The industry she oversees can’t be allowed to shape itself, she said. “We are way beyond that.”
During her tenure as Commissioner for Competition, Vestager started three antitrust cases versus Google, one of which slapped the tech company with a €4.3 billion (US$5 billion) fine for forcing other companies to use its software on Android phones. She got the company hit with another €2.4 billion (US$2.8 billion) fine over the manipulation of shopping results from the search engine.
When she went head-to-head with Apple, she ordered the company to pay €13 billion (US$15 billion) in back taxes from Ireland. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the fine “total political crap.”

Australia’s competition watchdog has delayed its decision on whether to approve the AU$15 billion (US$8.3 billion) merger of TPG Telecom and Britain’s Vodafone after raising concerns in December, reported Reuters.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) set April 11 as the new provisional date for its decision on the mega-telecom tie-up, two weeks later than it initially intended.
The regulator stated the delay was due to TPG and Vodafone not providing the required information on time. Vodafone Australia was yet to lodge its response to ACCC’s concerns, but it remained committed to the deal, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.

According to Reuters, Linde, the industrial gases giant created by the merger of US group Praxair and German rival Linde, announced it would buy back up to US$6 billion of own shares, returning proceeds from assets it had to sell to win antitrust approval.
Under the repurchase program, Linde plans to acquire up to 15% of its outstanding shares between May 1, 2019, and February 1, 2021.
Linde may start the program earlier if its existing US$1 billion share repurchase programme is concluded ahead of schedule.
The two companies had to sell more than €8 billion (US$9.1 billion) in assets to win over global antitrust regulators to their merger.

136,"January 21, 2019",US: Regulators eye “record” Facebook fine,"
Regulators in the US have reportedly met to discuss levying fines against social media giant Facebook, a punishment that could be sizable in scope and which comes in the wake of privacy violations.
Numerous sources citing The Washington Post said Friday, January 18, that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is mulling the fine, which could be set at record levels. That fine would come in tandem with investigations that have stretched into the past year, since a March 2018 announcement that the FTC was looking into the company’s privacy practices. The Post in turn cited three unnamed people, “familiar with the discussions,” in reporting on the most recent developments.
Facebook has drawn scrutiny amid reports that a quiz application was used to gather details on as many as 87 million users, and the data was in turn shared with Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm based in the UK that has since been shuttered. The consulting firm had retained data on tens of millions of users, but claimed it had not in fact held onto that data. Other data privacy issues have been reported beyond that linkup.
The fine would reportedly be “record-setting” in scope and would eclipse the US$22.5 million paid by Google in 2012.
As has been reported, Facebook had entered into a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, under which the company had pledged to be transparent in the ways it collected and handled (and retained) data.
The government shutdown currently underway has meant that regulators h...

137,"January 21, 2019",EU: Lawmakers target index fund managers on “common ownership”,"
According to a report from the Financial Times, European lawmakers have taken aim at the influence of the largest index fund managers.
Passive funds have enjoyed dramatic growth, with assets hitting US$9 trillion in 2018, according to the trade body, Investment Company Institute, the FT added. Big passive managers own shares in most large companies and this has led to concern over antitrust issues.
Common ownership, a theory developed by several US and international academics, claims that passive managers’ stakes in multiple companies in one sector incentivizes them to constrain competition.
Last week the European Parliament cited OECD research and warned that higher levels of common ownership result in “hidden social cost and reduced product competition.”
Sven Giegold, a member of the Green party of the European Parliament, said the “dramatic change in the asset management industry” posed dangers to the market economy. “The effects of [large passive funds] have to be taken into account and regulated,” he told the Financial Times. He called for action from the European Commission. Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner, last year began looking into whether common ownership impinged on competition. That inquiry has yet to result in policy action.

South Africa’s Shoprite announced on Monday, January 21, it would appeal against a 20 million rand (US$1.4 million) fine handed to its ticket-selling subsidiary by the country’s Competition Tribunal, which found agreements signed by the firm had affected competition, reported Reuters.
The initial case, covering 1999-2012, was referred to the tribunal in 2010 after five rivals of ticket seller Computicket, owned by Shoprite since 2005, complained the business abused its dominance by signing exclusive agreements with clients.
“There is sufficient … evidence to suggest that the exclusive agreements had resulted in anti-competitive effects,” the tribunal’s judgement stated.
“Computicket will appeal the Competition Tribunal’s finding,” Shoprite, South Africa’s biggest retailer, announced in response.

El representante demócrata David Cicilline, de Rhode Island, quien asume el cargo de presidente del panel antimonopolio del Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes, desea examinar qué papel, si lo hubiera, el presidente Donald Trump ha jugado en algunas de las mayores fusiones durante su administración, dijo la persona: quien declinó identificarse.
Cicilline está asumiendo el rol de liderazgo mientras los economistas y defensores de las políticas están presionando para que se refuerce la aplicación de la ley antimonopolio para combatir la creciente consolidación empresarial en toda la economía.
Las otras prioridades de Cicilline para el panel incluyen examinar el costo de los medicamentos recetados, cómo las fusiones pueden reducir el poder de negociación de los trabajadores y el predominio de plataformas tecnológicas como Google y Facebook, dijo la persona.

141,"January 20, 2019","India: Watchdog orders DP, Maersk to withdraw some notices at Mumbai port","
India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered Denmark’s Maersk and Dubai’s DP World to withdraw certain customer advisories which it claims could hamper growth of the country’s largest container port in Mumbai, a document seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year ordered a probe into suspected antitrust violations by DP World and Maersk units at the terminals they operate at state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
Handling 66 million tonnes of cargo in the last fiscal year to March, JNPT is critical to India’s international trade. The port handles more than half of India’s traffic in shipping containers each year.
The probe was ordered as the CCI found merit in a complaint filed by Singapore’s PSA International, which alleged the rival duo had created barriers to hinder the growth of PSA’s terminal by colluding on certain charges they levy at the port.
Though the terminal operators handle each other’s containers to help boost the port’s efficiency, PSA had alleged that DP World and Maersk last year issued advisories aimed at discouraging port users from sending PSA’s containers to their terminals.
In an order issued by the CCI on January 15, the watchdog ordered Maersk and DP World units to withdraw those advisories, stating it “smacks of anti-competitive” conduct.
The advisories, if not withdrawn, would cause “irretrievable damage or losses”—not only to PSA—and would not augur well for the port’s developm...

The European Union must approve the tie-up between Germany’s Siemens and French group Alstom, said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who added he would meet a main European regulator to express his support for the deal.
Le Maire told France’s Journal du Dimanche newspaper that he would meet European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on January 21 to reiterate France’s backing for the deal.
“Rejecting the merger between Alstom and Siemens would be both an economic and a political mistake,” Le Maire said in the interview that was published on Sunday.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that Siemens’ and Alstom’s plan to create a European rail champion to take on a Chinese rival had failed to win over EU antitrust regulators, despite German and French backing.
The EU veto, to be announced early next month, could push Siemens to float its own in-house rail technology division, called Siemens Mobility, while keeping a stake.

143,"January 20, 2019",Spain: Gov plans 3% digital tax on large tech companies,"
On Friday the Spanish government approved on Friday a draft law that would tax large companies 3% of their digital revenue, bringing an estimated 1.2 billion euros ($1.37 billion) to state coffers each year, cabinet spokeswoman Isabel Celaa said.
Spain, along with Italy, Britain and several other European Union countries, has been readying national digital tax plans while the bloc is still at loggerheads on an EU-wide levy.

It is designed to prevent big companies, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Uber, from averting tax by routing their profits to the bloc’s low-tax states.
The expected fiscal revenue is included in Spain’s draft budget for this year, which the minority Socialist government presented on Monday, although the bills still face parliament discussions that could take several months.
The European Commission last March proposed a 3 percent levy on the digital turnover of large online tech firms to address low taxation.

The French government has asked Japan to accept a possible merger between Renault SA and Nissan Motor following the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, who had managed the alliance of the carmakers, sources close to the matter said Sunday.
The request, apparently aimed at bringing the two automakers under the wing of a new holding company, was made at talks between French and Japanese officials in Tokyo, and reflects French President Emmanuel Macron’s wishes, the sources said.
A delegation including Martin Vial, a Renault director designated by the French government, visited Japanese officials to discuss the plans.
The French government is the biggest stakeholder in Renault. In 2015, the French government agreed with Nissan and Renault that it would not interfere in the Japanese automaker’s management.

The European Commission on Friday cleared BASF’s acquisition of Solvay’s nylon assets after the two parties promised a remedy package addressing anti-trust concerns.
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019. The German chemical major announced its intention to acquire the assets in 2017 for €1.6bn.
However, the EU antitrust authorities had asked the company for divestments to stop it taking a dominant position in the market.
“During the approval process in Europe BASF made commitments to address the competition concerns of the EU Commission,” it said.
“They require divesting parts of the original transaction scope to a third-party buyer, namely manufacturing assets and innovation capabilities of Solvay’s polyamide business in Europe. The divestment process started in Q4 2018.”

According to a report by the Financial Times, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has urged the EU to ramp up its defences against the economic threat posed by Chinese state-owned enterprises while defending the competition rules that would allow her to block a rail merger that Paris sees as essential to countering Beijing’s ambitions.
According to documents seen by the Financial Times, Margrethe Vestager warned fellow members of the European Commission on Tuesday, January 15, that the bloc’s antitrust rules should not be ignored to allow the planned merger of France’s Alstom with Germany’s Siemens railway division, despite warnings from Paris and Berlin that the tie-up is needed to build a rival to Chinese trainmaker CRRC.
However, Ms Vestager is unconvinced that the Chinese will sell trains in Europe in the foreseeable future and is bound by antitrust rules to block the deal unless the companies offer to sell off significant high-speed rail assets.

Several retailer merchant plaintiffs (MPs) are headed to trial against American Express (Amex) claiming Amex’s use of an anti-steering rule in their contracts violates US antitrust law and after having three of the four the relevant markets outlined in their suits rejected by the district Judge. On Monday, January 14, US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of the Eastern District of New York granted Amex’s motion for partial summary judgment.
The MPs allege that the anti-steering rule prevents them from setting different prices for different credit cards, stating a preference for a particular type of payment, or using different payment terms for different cards.
The merchants claim the restraints “nullify the operation of the price mechanism, impede competition among credit card networks and suppress output.” As a result, the MPs allege, “merchant fees and the net two-sided transaction price for Amex and other credit card networks are higher than the competitive level and higher than they otherwise would be in the absence of Amex’s anticompetitive restraints [and] the number of credit card transactions is lower than it otherwise would be in the absence of the Amex restraints.”
The MPs had “sought to proceed to trial with respect to four formulations of the relevant market: 1) a one-sided, all-general purpose credit (“GPCC”) card market; 2) a one-sided, Amex-only market; 3) a two-sided, all-GPCC market; and 4) a two-sided, Amex-only market.”

Cicilline is stepping into the leadership role as economists and policy advocates are pushing for stepped-up antitrust enforcement to combat rising corporate consolidation across the economy.
Cicilline’s other priorities for the panel include examining the cost of prescription drugs, how mergers can reduce workers’ bargaining power, and the dominance of technology platforms like Google and Facebook, the person said.

According to Bloomberg, Siemens and Alstom are considering adding sweeteners to a package of assets for sale in a last-ditch effort to gain antitrust approval from the European Commission and salvage their rail deal, according to people familiar with the matter.
The German and French train equipment suppliers’ new offerings include possible contract extensions and patents and are being discussed with antitrust officials and potential bidders, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions aren’t public. The former rivals are working to save the tie up that would have combined sales of about €15 billion (US$17 billion) from getting vetoed by the Commission on concerns it’ll crimp competition, they said.
It remains unclear whether the steps will be enough to avoid antitrust opposition, the people said, though the recent meetings with European officials left the companies slightly more optimistic a compromise can be reached, one of them said.

Europe’s top court opened the way to a US$2 billion damages claim by US delivery company UPS on Wednesday, January 16, by annulling a 2013 decision to stop it from buying Dutch firm TNT Express.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) stated the ruling followed a procedural error by the European Commission in its veto, which paved the way for FedEx to acquire TNT Express for €4.4 billion (US$5 billion) in 2016, a deal it approved.
UPS, which has announced it is seeking €1.74 billion (US$1.98 billion) from the European Commission, stated it was pleased the ECJ agreed that the company had been given a fair hearing.
“The judgment in UPS’s favor makes a number of points preserving a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval,” it stated.
The Commission had rejected UPS’s planned €5.2 billion (US$5.9 billion) acquisition of TNT, claiming it had not offered enough concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers.
The ECJ stated the Commission had infringed UPS’s rights of defense by using a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in its exchange of views and arguments with UPS.
Wednesday’s ruling follows that of the General Court of the European Union, the EU’s second highest court, in 2017. The Commission had appealed against that ruling.

152,"January 16, 2019",US: Patent office to enter Qualcomm fight,"

The US Federal Trade Commission has agreed with Apple’s view of Qualcomm licensing practices, and a trial over the government’s antitrust case is in its second week in San Jose, California, reported Bloomberg.
The US Patent and Trademark Office has decided to wade into a global licensing battle between Apple and Qualcomm, with billions of dollars at stake.
The Patent Trial and Appeal Board agreed to consider the validity of two Qualcomm patents, according to notices posted on its electronic docket Tuesday, January 15. Apple and ally Intel  had claimed the patents didn’t cover new inventions and the board conducted a preliminary analysis to determine if Apple had a “reasonable likelihood” of winning its argument. The Board will hear arguments from both sides and issue a final decision in about a year.
Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a worldwide dispute over licensing fees for use of Qualcomm’s technology. Apple has argued its former supplier unfairly leverages its position as the biggest supplier of chips for smartphones to force payment. Qualcomm has countered that Apple is using its intellectual property without paying for it, and the legal cases are aimed at forcing it to reduce licensing charges.

The Most Powerful Person in Tech Is … David Cicilline?
By Joe Nocera
When David Cicilline was approached at the beginning of the last Congress about becoming the ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee 1 of the House Judiciary Committee, his first inclination was to say no. Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, knew almost nothing about antitrust law. “Even as a practicing lawyer, this was not my field of expertise,” he says.
But he eventually agreed to take the post, and spent the next two years getting up to speed on the complex issues surrounding megamergers, oligopolies, concentration of power and, not least, the societal problems posed by Facebook and Google, which he calls “the platforms.”
Today, with the Democrats in control of the House, Cicilline has become the chairman of the subcommittee. And he has big plans. Suffice it to say that if someone were to ask me who is going to be the most important person in tech in 2019, I’d rank Cicilline well ahead of Mark Zuckerberg. My interview with the congressman, which I’ve edited and condensed, took place Friday.

154,"January 15, 2019",US: AG nominee Barr grilled on antitrust at Senate hearing,"

US President Donald Trump’s nominee for Attorney General, William Barr, said on Tuesday, January 15, he favors strong enforcement of US antitrust laws and would examine statistics showing that scrutiny of mergers is at historic lows.
“I am for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to preserve competition,” Barr told a US Senate panel during his confirmation hearing. “As I said, this is going to be an area I want to get into.”
Barr was responding to questions from Republican US Senator Josh Hawley about what Hawley called all-time low levels of scrutiny of mergers.
“I am interested in exploring those statistics,” said Barr. “At the end of the day, it’s competition we’re worried about in different markets.”
Hawley asked if Barr believed that high levels of concentration in many parts of the economy, particularly the technology sector, could hamper competition and deserve scrutiny.
Barr said he was concerned about network effects that occur when a product’s value to one consumer increases as other consumers use it.
“The thing I’m concerned about are the network effects that are now at work where they’re so powerful that particular sectors could essentially be subsumed into these networks,” Barr replied. “They’re just very powerful network effects because of the size.”
In addition, Barr told US senators that regulators need to take a deeper look at the “huge b...

155,"January 15, 2019",EU: Moscovici says EC will be objective on Alstom-Siemens deal,"


The European Commission will be objective—but not naive—and will take into account future economic developments when it decides over a rail deal between industrial groups Alstom and Siemens, an EU senior official said.
“We want to take into account the evolutions of the economy of tomorrow. We are not naive,” EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters on Tuesday, January 15, after the Commission’s weekly meeting, at which the Franco-German deal was discussed.
Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager briefed her fellow commissioners over the merger, in an unusual discussion over competition matters prompted by strong pressure from Paris and Berlin to authorize the deal.
Moscovici, addressing reporters about the meeting, said that as a French national he was “attentive” to Paris’s arguments, but stressed the decisions that will be made will be objective and “with a strategy.”
Supporters of the deal say EU antitrust rules should be updated so that they can foster European industrial champions against international competition. Moscovici said the EU policy was not “obsolete.”

156,"January 15, 2019",Germany: Court throws out Qualcomm’s latest patent case against Apple,"
 
According to Reuters, a patent lawsuit filed by Qualcomm against Apple was thrown out by a German court on Tuesday, January 15, in a reversal for the US chipmaker after it won a recent court ban on the sale of some iPhones in the country.
The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the Qualcomm suit as groundless in an initial verbal decision, stating the patent in question was not violated by the installation of its chips in Apple’s smartphones.
“We are happy with the decision and thank the court for their time and diligence,” Apple said in a statement.
“We regret Qualcomm’s use of the court to divert attention from their illegal behavior that is the subject of multiple lawsuits and proceedings around the world.”
Qualcomm, waging a worldwide patent battle with Apple, announced it would appeal after winning a separate case before a court in Munich in December that enabled it to enforce a ban on the sale of older iPhones in Germany.
“Apple has a history of infringing our patents,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s executive vice president and general counsel.

Federal Judge Richard Leon isn’t buying the partial government shutdown as a reason for the Department of Justice (DOJ) not to submit comments in the CVS Health and Aetna merger case.
Leon, on Friday, January 11, ordered the DOJ attorneys to “roll up their sleeves” and respond by February 15. The DOJ is required to respond to public comments on the CVS and Aetna consent agreement.
The DOJ also filed a motion last week to stay the appeals proceedings in the case of a Texas judge who ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.
“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ’emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,'” the DOJ told the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The US House has filed a motion to intervene in the appeals case and their responses are due January 17, stated the DOJ, which added that it intends to oppose the intervention.

158,"January 15, 2019",Switzerland: COMCO agrees with Apple about a TWINT-friendly solution,"
 
The automatic launch of Apple Pay at POS (point of sale) terminals can interfere with payments made by the TWINT application. Following the intervention of the COMCO Secretariat, Apple is committed to offering a pro-competitive technical solution.
Apple offered with Apple Pay a mobile payment solution for its devices, in particular the iPhone and Apple Watch. Apple devices and their apps are set to launch Apple Pay automatically when held close to a POS terminal to allow a contactless payment.
Payments with the TWINT application are effectuated by scanning a QR-code that appears on the screen of the POS terminal. Until now, Apple Pay was likely to launch automatically and thus disrupt a current payment transaction made with the TWINT App.
Apple has committed to immediately provide a technical solution enabling TWINT to suppress Apple Pay during the payment transaction effectuated with TWINT. Due to these commitments, the Secretariat decided to close the preliminary investigation against Apple.

Keurig Green Mountain is driving up prices and abusing its monopoly power over single-serve brewing devices and cups, according to an antitrust lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Food and beverage distributor McLane claims that because of Keurig’s anticompetitive behavior, it was overcharged on more than US$1.5 billion worth of K-Cups it purchased from Keurig and its licensees; J.M. Smucker and Starbucks Coffee.
In late 2017, a federal court rejected a request by Keurig to dismiss multiple lawsuits charging that it had unfairly monopolize the market for single-serve “K-Cups” used in its popular coffee brewing machines.

160,"January 14, 2019",Vietnam: Grab appeals Vietnam court’s ruling in Vinasun lawsuit,"
Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab on Friday, January 11, filed an appeal against a Vietnamese court ruling that ordered it in December 2018 to pay local taxi operator Vinasun 4.8 million dong (roughly US$200k) for causing it an operational loss.
The ride-hailing company claimed the Ho Chi Minh City Court had no jurisdiction over the case.
“If the appellate court does not dismiss the case, it is requested to amend the first instance judgment to determine that Grab does not carry out a transportation business, does not violate Decision 24, Decree 86 and dismiss entirely Vinasun’s case,” Grab said in a statement.
Decree 86 provides for the conditions of doing business in the domain of transportation, while Decision 24 is a pilot programme by the local government to operate e-hailing services. Both Grab and Vinasun are among companies licensed under the programme.
Vinasun had filed a lawsuit against Grab in 2017, accusing the latter of causing it a US$1.8 million loss by indulging in unfair business practices. A failed attempt at an out-of-court settlement later, the Ho Chi Minh City Court asked Grab to pay US$200,000 in compensation to Vinasun, determining that the ride-hailing unicorn was partly behind Vinasun’s loss.
The Vietnamese court also ruled that Grab violated local regulations since it operates as a taxi company, and not just as a technology firm. However, the ride-hailing firm continues to contend it is a technology company.
“VinaSun could not prove ...

161,"January 14, 2019",US: Newmont to buy Goldcorp in US$10B deal to create world’s largest gold producer,"
Newmont Mining announced on Monday, January 14, that it would buy smaller rival Goldcorp in a deal valued at US$10 billion, creating the world’s biggest gold producer by output.
The deal is the second high-profile merger in the mining industry since Barrick Gold agreed to buy Randgold Resources in September last year to cut costs.
The gold mining industry has come under fire from investors in recent months for poor management of capital. This, combined with falling gold reserves and higher extraction costs, has prompted miners to look for cost efficiencies.
“The strategic rationale for combining Goldcorp with Newmont is powerfully compelling on many levels,” Goldcorp CEO David Garofalo said in a statement.
The combined company is expected to produce 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold over the next 10 years. In 2017, Newmont produced 5.3 million ounces of gold, while Goldcorp mined 2.6 million ounces.

162,"January 14, 2019",UK: Sainsbury struggles to keep Asda deal on track,"
According to a report from the Financial Times, Sainsbury’s is facing a tougher battle than it had expected to get regulatory approval for its proposed takeover of Asda without onerous conditions, analysts and advisers have said, with an extension to a competition investigation now regarded as likely.
A deal to combine the UK’s second- and third-biggest supermarkets was announced last April, and speculation about the regulatory probe into the deal mounted after the two parties used a judicial review before Christmas to secure more time to respond to inquiries from the Competition and Markets Authority.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has previously told the Financial Times that the two companies would consider the deal unviable if more than a certain amount of profit were lost because of store disposals. Last week, he told reporters that Sainsbury’s “remains as confident in its case now as it was at the start.”

The share price of Brazilian airplane manufacturer Embraer soared Friday, January 11 as markets reacted favorably to the country’s President Jair Bolsonaro approving a merger with Boeing.
Bolsonaro announced he wouldn’t be using his veto powers to block the merger between two of the world’s three biggest aviation companies.
Embraer’s shares had taken a nosedive last week after Bolsonaro had expressed concerns over the deal.
But now the US$5.2 billion deal, which will see Boeing take control of Embraer’s commercial airplane manufacturing business – 80% of its operation – will go ahead.
Embraer will only retain control of its military division.
On Thursday, Bolsonaro had said he was satisfied that “the final proposal preserves (Brazil’s) sovereignty and national interests.”
Embraer was founded as a state group in 1969 before being privatized in 1994, although the Brazilian government retained a “golden share” giving it the right to veto strategic decisions for the company.

William Barr, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general, promised to recuse himself from the Department of Justice’s lawsuit to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger, according to Reuters.
Senator Amy Klobuchar (Democrat-Minnesota) announced on Friday, January 11, that Barr, who served on Time Warner’s board until recently, made the assurance to her in a private meeting this week.
“As Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee and as someone deeply concerned about maintaining a marketplace that benefits consumers, it is critically important that the Justice Department is able to complete an unbiased review of the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger,” Klobuchar, a critic of the US$85 billion deal, said in a statement. “Given Mr. Barr’s ties to Time Warner, this commitment from Mr. Barr to recuse himself from the Department’s review is necessary.”
Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate.
Among his holdings are US$1.2 million worth of shares in telecom and media company AT&T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&T last year, from 2009 until 2018.

Germany’s antitrust authority has expressed concerns to the European Union’s competition watchdog about the planned merger of the rail operations of Siemens and France’s Alstom, a newspaper reported on Sunday, January 13.
The EU watchdog is set to decide by February 18 whether to approve the merger, with French newspaper Les Echos reporting that the European Commission was likely to veto the merger, which would create a Franco-German rail champion.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported the German competition body had written a confidential letter to its EU counterpart stressing concerns about the planned deal and saying it completely shares the Commission’s reservations.
The German body stated it did not believe that the recent pledges of both companies removed those competitive concerns, the paper cited the letter as saying.

166,"January 13, 2019",Germany: Amazon Dash Button breaks consumer law,"
A court in Germany handed down a harsh ruling about Amazon’s Dash buttons on Thursday, January 10, according to a report from Reuters.
The court stated the Dash buttons, which are small, Wi-Fi-connected devices that reorder items like laundry detergent and coffee, breaks consumer protection legislation because it doesn’t give consumers enough information about the product or its price. According to German law, a transaction must provide info on price and characteristics or delivery details.
Daniel Widmann, a technology law expert at Pinsent Masons, said in 2016 that this could cause trouble for the company. “There are further special obligations regarding consumers in electronic commerce,” he said. “A valid consumer contract is only concluded when the consumer explicitly confirms that he or she undertakes to make a payment. There should be unambiguous wording, such as ‘order and pay.’”
A regional consumer protection watchdog organization brought the case against Amazon, arguing that Dash buttons don’t let customers know what they’re paying. Wolfgang Schuldzinski, head of the consumer body, said his organization isn’t against new technology, and that the issue is that the buttons don’t give customers enough information.
“We are always open to innovation. But if innovation means that the consumer is put at a disadvantage and price comparisons are made difficult, then we fight that,” he said.
Amazon claimed the button was not against German law, and t...

Facebook may face action from Germany’s antitrust watchdog. According to Reuters, the German antitrust watchdog is planning to order Facebook to stop gathering “some” user data.
The Federal Cartel Office, which is Germany’s national competition regulator, has been investigating Facebook for the last 4 years. The office is accusing Facebook of using its market dominance to collect data from its users without their knowledge or consent.
Now, the Federal Cartel Office says it will present its findings to Facebook and recommend a course of action. Facebook, however, is disputing the findings of the watchdog, Reuters reported.
According to Reuters, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company disputes the watchdog’s findings and will continue to defend this position.
The investigation is being closely watched amid mounting concerns over data leaks on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the use of social media by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.

The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation into the tax treatment of Nike Inc in the Netherlands, saying this may have given the US sportswear maker an illegal advantage, reported the Financial Times.
The Nike investigation, announced on Thursday, January 10, follows other probes by the EU executive into tax schemes in Belgium, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Ireland, and the Netherlands it says allow companies to set up structures to reduce their taxes unfairly.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said on Thursday: “Member states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors.”
Under EU State aid rules, the European Commission has the power to require the Netherlands to recoup any illegal state support that Nike, the world’s largest sports footwear and athletic company, has received since 2009.
The move is the latest in a series of probes into unlawful tax arrangements, which have caught out companies including Apple, Starbucks, Amazon, Fiat, and Engie.

CBS’ board will meet on January 31, and the possibility of a merger between the former corporate siblings will be a hot topic on the agenda, according to Bloomberg, which reports that a decision “could come within weeks.”
A potential combination between CBS and Viacom, whose assets include Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and the Paramount film studio—was in the spotlight for most of 2018, as the desire to bulk up on content and the companies’ shared history and ownership drove merger discussions. The two split in 2006, and both are majority controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements.
National Amusements pushed for a merger last spring, but the companies’ executive teams couldn’t find common ground. The discussions devolved into boardroom battles and a lawsuit, and the merger was eventually dropped with National Amusements agreeing not to bring it up again for at least two years.

HSBC is the third bank to settle, after Deutsche Bank and Bank of America agreed in August 2017 to pay a respective US$48.5 million and US$17 million and cooperate with the plaintiffs.
Investors led by two Alaska government entities and the Iron Workers Pension Plan of Western Pennsylvania accused banks of colluding to manipulate prices of US dollar-denominated supranational, sub-sovereign, and agency bonds.

Industrial groups Siemens and Alstom are discussing additional divestments with the European Commission to win approval for their plan to create a joint Franco-German rail champion, sources told Reuters.
The move is meant to overcome concerns from antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who in December voiced her doubts over the impact that their deal would have on high-speed trains.
Three sources close to the talks said on Thursday, January 10, fresh concessions were being made by the two firms to convince the EU Commission. The companies have made additional concessions to extend the geographical scope of their earlier offers and are now detailing their plan with Brussels.
Siemens and Alstom had already offered to sell either one of their high-speed train-making businesses and the bulk of Alstom’s signaling business in Europe in addition to some of Siemens signaling assets.
But these offers were seen as not sufficient by Britain’s CMA competition watchdog and its counterparts in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain.
The regulators said in December they were worried about the supply of very high-speed rolling stock for trains such as the Eurostar which links the UK, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
The Commission’s current deadline to decide on the operation is February 18.
A spokesman for Vestager declined to comment.
On Wednesday, in a speech in Germany, Vestager said she was in favor of fostering European industrial champions. But she stressed: “We can’t...

Seafood provider Chicken of the Sea International (COSI) has come to an agreement with 29 grocery retailers and distributors resolving their antitrust claims. Under the terms of the agreement, COSI will pay a cash settlement and work with the companies to promote Chicken of the Sea products.
The agreement comes in the wake of COSI’s separate settlement with Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart this past May.
The mega-retailer filed suit in 2016 against the so-called “big three” tuna providers—COSI, Starkist, and Bumble Bee—alleging a conspiracy to fix prices of shelf-stable seafood sold in the United States. Other major US grocers that have sued the companies, however, including Wegmans Food Markets, The Kroger Co., Albertsons Cos., Hy-Vee, Publix Super Markets, and Meijer, have not as yet reached settlements.

175,"January 9, 2019",US: Qualcomm calls Apple CEO’s comments “misleading”,"

According to a report by Reuters, Qualcomm responded to comments Apple’s Tim Cook made in an interview, in which he said there had been no recent settlement talks between the iPhone maker and chip supplier in their global legal battle, calling Cook’s remarks “misleading.”
In a television interview on CNBC earlier on Tuesday, January 8, Cook responded to a question from host Jim Cramer about whether Apple would settle with Qualcomm after Qualcomm had announced legal victories against Apple in patent cases in China and Germany.
“Look, the truth is, we haven’t been in any settlement discussions with them since the third calendar quarter of last year. That is the truth. So I’m not sure where that thinking is coming from,” Cook said.
Cook’s comments contrasted with those Qualcomm’s CEO Steven Mollenkopf made in November on CNBC.
“We do talk as companies, and I think what you’re seeing, really, are activities consistent, really, with the fourth quarter of the game, and not the first quarter,” Mollenkopf told CNBC then. “We always talk about – and I’ve been very consistent – that this second half of [2018] and into [2019], is when we’re really on the doorstep of finding a resolution.”
Apple has accused Qualcomm of engaging in illegal patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant market position in so-called modem chips, which help mobile phones connect to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has argued that its practices followed decade...

On Wednesday, January 9, the Competition Commission of South Africa urged schools to adhere to the school uniform guidelines aimed at curbing anti-competitive behavior at schools.
This is aimed at making sure that schools are compliant with the Competition Act but, most importantly, school uniforms become reasonable and affordable, the Commission said in a statement.
The investigation into anticompetitive behavior at schools was concluded early last year. The probe established that a number of schools still had exclusive contracts with one supplier.

177,"January 7, 2019",US: Opposition to T-Mobile/Sprint merger grows,"
The 4Competition Coalition, an alliance against the proposed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, has gained the support of two rural wireless carriers and the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA).
The group, which is now comprised of 18 members, contends the merger would lead to higher prices, fewer choices and a reduced quality of service, particularly among people living in rural areas.
“No matter how you slice it, this merger is a bad deal for rural Americans,” Claude Aiken, president and CEO of WISPA, said in a statement. “T-Mobile claims that Sprint’s vast holding of the 2.5 GHz spectrum will help them increase coverage, but in the past T-Mobile’s buildout focus has largely been on populated urban areas. There are no assurances that rural Americans will ever see benefits from this merger.”

HERE Technologies, the automotive mapping company controlled by three German carmakers, is giving ride-pooling a new twist with an app that makes it easier for friends to share a trip to work, games or concerts, reported The Financial Times.
“The current trend in the mobility-as-a-service market has turned out to be very consolidated, concentrated — even monopolistic in many areas of the world,” said Liad Itzhak, head of Here Mobility, whose parent company Here Technologies is majority owned by Audi, BMW and Daimler.
SoMo lets users plan where they need to be, then choose from a host of private and public transport services to get them there, akin to Google Maps. But unlike the dominant ride-hailing groups, SoMo is a social media network, too, connecting friends who are attending the same “gatherings”.

179,"January 6, 2019",France: Le Maire: Blocking Alstom-Siemens merger would be a “political mistake”,"
The European Commission would make “an economic error” and “a political mistake” by blocking a proposed Alstom-Siemens merger, French Economy minister Bruno Le Maire said Sunday, January 6.
“If the European Commission was to make an unfavorable decision regarding this merger, it would be for the wrong reasons. It would not only be an economic error, but also a political mistake because it would weaken the whole European industry faced with China,” Le Maire said in a Europe 1 radio interview.
POLITICO reported in November that the EU executive body had reached a preliminary conclusion that Siemens’ acquisition of Alstom would be “incompatible” with the internal market.
Blocking the merger “would also send to a conquering China a signal of European division and unarming,” Le Maire added.
Paris and Berlin have previously called on the European Commission to allow the creation of a European champion in the railway industry to be able to compete with China.
European commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager is concerned that a tie-up between the German and the French companies may reduce competition in the markets trains and signals.
The new merged company would be around three times the size of its nearest rival.
The EU executive body has until February 18 to decide on whether or not to clear the merger, or what conditions it wishes to impose on the merger.

180,"January 6, 2019",Australia: ACCC warns “arrogant” business sector of huge fines,"
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims has slammed the corporate sector as arrogant and warned companies that mislead consumers to expect fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars this year.
Mr Sims also predicted the ACCC will increasingly clash with companies over merger proposals, and accused dealmakers of lying about wider benefits of potential takeovers.
The ACCC chairman said the Hayne royal commission into misconduct in the financial services sector and other scandals had exposed the business community for losing focus on their customers.
“I think there’s an element of arrogance about corporate Australia, that they are in a privileged position and they can do as they like in almost an unfettered way,” Mr Sims told The Australian Financial Review.
“They just need to come down to earth a bit and realise why they exist and what they’re there for. They need to regain control and focus on long-term shareholder value, which means a focus on customers.”
Mr Sims pointed to cases involving Telstra, which was hit with AU$10 million (US$7.1 million) in penalties by the Federal Court last April for misleading consumers about its premium direct billing services, and the Ford Motor Company, which was ordered to pay the same amount after being found to have engaged in unconscionable conduct in relation to a problem with its transmissions.

181,"January 6, 2019",US: T-Mobile/Sprint merger review suspended,"
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has paused its review of the US$26 billion proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint for the second time in four months. The federal government funding lapse has caused issues in merger reviews.
The 180-day review period for mergers and other transactions that require FCC approval, otherwise known as a shot clock, was suspended earlier this week when the agency shut down most operations due to the ongoing impasse over federal government funding. The partial government shutdown has effectively put the timeline for a final decision on hold until Congress and the president come to an agreement on a federal government spending bill.
The FCC started reviewing the proposed merger of the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers on June 18, 2018, but paused the review process on September 11 when the companies submitted new documents. Consideration of the deal got underway again on December 4, at day 55 of the review timeline.

182,"January 6, 2019",US: FTC antitrust case against Qualcomm officially starts,"
 
On Friday, January 4, in California, the United States Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) antitrust case against chipset-maker Qualcomm officially started, reported Reuters.
The FTC accuses Qualcomm of abusing a monopoly on mobile chip technology, the company’s bread-and-butter. The outcome of the case could have major ramifications not only for Qualcomm’s business but the smartphone industry at large, reported Reuters The non-jury trial is expected to last for 10 days. Presiding Judge Lucy Koh will issue the verdict.
Qualcomm owns a number of key smartphone-related patents, and has often been accused of failing to follow FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) pricing.
Prior to the FTC action, Qualcomm had already been hit with a US$853 million fine in South Korea for similar practices. In fact, that case led directly to Apple filing a US$1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing it of withholding rebates in retaliation for cooperating with antitrust investigators.
“Qualcomm says you will pay our rates if you want our chips,” Jennifer Milici, an attorney for the FTC, said during opening arguments. “The only way to arrive at a market rate [for Qualcomm’s patents] is to negotiate without that threat.”

Following the ruling by Chile’s supreme court that a bank can legally close accounts of a crypto exchange, the country’s Court of Defense of Free Competition (TDLC) reaffirmed that banks must reopen crypto exchanges’ accounts. The Chilean antitrust court continues to hear the case alleging that banks exploit their dominant position to keep crypto exchanges off the market.
Martín Jofré, the CEO of crypto exchange Criptomkt, commented after the ruling, “For us, it is a success since we need bank accounts to operate in the market. In any case, we always rely on Chilean institutions, especially on the TDLC for its role as defender of free competition.”
Cryptocurrency exchanges filed a lawsuit with the TDLC against 10 major banks in Chile last year, accusing them of abusing their dominant position after they unilaterally decided to close their accounts. The TDLC then ordered banks to reopen accounts of the exchanges for the duration of the trial.

Mobile operator Telenor Norge is reportedly challenging a $91 million fine for abusing its dominant position in the Norway mobile market by hamstringing the development of a new national mobile network.
On December 20, Telenor filed a comprehensive complaint against the Competition Authority’s decision because we believe the pricing model in the agreement is legal, says Communications Manager Anders Krokan in Telenor to Finansavisen.
In June, the Norwegian Competition Authority concluded that Telenor placed obstacles in the way of the development of a third mobile network in Norway. The fee of NOK 788 million is the highest fee the audit has ever given. Telenor has always disagreed with the decision.
Krokan says that he hopes the Competition Appeals Board will thoroughly review the complaint and the company’s statements.

The European Commission announced on Thursday, January 3, it had cleared the sale of the Costa Coffee chain to US drinks maker Coca-Cola from British restaurant and hotel owner Whitbread.
“The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns because the companies do not sell the same products and the links between their activities are limited,” an EU executive said in a statement.
The acquisition is widely seen as an attempt by the fizzy drink giant to challenge the dominance of Starbucks and to ramp up competition in the ready-to-drink coffee market.
Coca-Cola president and chief executive James Quincey said he wants to turn Costa into a worldwide brand through its established distribution, marketing and vending platform.

Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse, and another bank have been charged by European Union antitrust regulators for being in a bond trading cartel.
It was the latest blow to the reputation and public image of the banking sector in Europe, which has faced billions of euros in fines for rigging interest rate benchmarks.
The European Commission did not name the banks it had charged. However, it stated its investigation focused on the conduct of certain traders at four banks and contact between them, largely through online chatrooms.
Following its statement, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse announced they were cooperating with the probe.
If found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, the banks could face fines up to 10% of their global turnover, although Deutsche Bank stated it had proactively cooperated with the investigation and did not expect a financial penalty.

Judge Richard Leon, who is currently scrutinizing CVS Health’s $69 billion buyout of Hartford health insurer Aetna, appeared to soften his stance on the pending merger shortly before Christmas, opting not to block most integration proceedings between the two companies while his investigation gets underway.
Reuters reported Saturday, December 22, that Judge Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, accepted an offer by CVS Health that would give Aetna a considerable amount of autonomy during the review process, including the power to make product, pricing, and personnel decisions. The concession was apparently enough to keep Leon from bringing all aspects of the merger to a complete halt.
“Based on CVS’s constructive and appropriate representations, I am satisfied that, so long as these measures remain in place, the assets involved in the challenged acquisition will remain sufficiently separate,” the judge wrote, according to the Reuters report.

LG is the latest smartphone maker to join the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) and other companies in a lawsuit against Qualcomm. While Samsung’s withdrawal didn’t do the lawsuit any favors, LG’s new stance strengthens the KFTC’s case again, particularly with LG being a Korean company.
According to Business Korea, industry sources claim that LG chose to participate in the legal efforts against Qualcomm due to shaky negotiations in between LG and Qualcomm in the US.
Qualcomm’s ongoing legal fight with Apple recently resulted in Apple’s iPhones being banned in China and possibly Germany. The chip-maker alleges that Apple incorrectly used two key Qualcomm patents without paying royalties. The affected devices include all iPhones from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone X, all of which were banned from being sold in China.
The KFTC slapped Qualcomm with a 1.03 trillion won fine (US$917.4 million) for abusing its patents back in 2016.

189,"January 2, 2019",US: AMC antitrust suit can move forward,"

An antitrust lawsuit against the movie theater chain AMC Entertainment  will be allowed to move forward, the US District Court of the District of Kansas ruled December 27.
AMC uses its dominant market position to force movie distributors to give it exclusive licenses to play movies, thereby stifling competition, rival Cinetopia claims.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Kansas, focuses on Cinetopia’s location in the Overland Park development Prairiefire. The lawsuit claims that after Cinetopia rebuffed AMC’s offer to buy the Prairiefire location in 2013, AMC obtained exclusive showings of blockbuster films including “Godzilla,” “Million Dollar Arm,” and “The Good Dinosaur.”
Cinetopia claims AMC’s practice, known in the industry as “movie clearance,” torpedoed Cinetopia’s business prospects in Overland Park.
The Cinetopia lawsuit points to other instances in which it’s alleged that AMC exerted pressure on competitors through movie clearance. An example cited in the lawsuit is a 2010 instance in which AMC allegedly used movie clearance against Studio Movie Grill in the Northland area of Kansas City, prompting Studio Movie Grill to close and leave AMC’s Barrywood 24 complex as the only theater in the area.

German online travel agent VIR is a joint complainant in the case. The European Technology and Travel Services Association (ETTSA’s) other members are Odigeo, Opodo, ebookers, eDreams, Sabre, Travelport and hotels.com, among others.
“LH (is) leveraging its dominant position on air transport services markets in Austria and Germany to control and manipulate the present and future distribution channels for LH and ultimately other carriers’ tickets,” the association said in its complaint. It said this penalized EU consumers in the short term as well as in the long run.

An Indian court has declined to quash or stall an antitrust investigation into Dubai-based port operator DP World’s alleged anti-competitive behavior at the country’s largest container port in Mumbai, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month said it suspected antitrust violations by DP World and Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk at the terminals they operate at state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
The CCI’s probe followed a complaint by Singapore’s PSA International Pte Ltd, which alleged that Maersk and DP World businesses created barriers to hinder the growth of PSA’s terminal by colluding on certain charges they levy at JNPT.
DP World’s unit Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal approached a High Court in Mumbai last week seeking to quash the CCI probe, which it said was “arbitrary” and “lead to gross discrimination and grave economic harm”.

BMW has launched a ride-hailing service in the Chinese city of Chengdu, the company reported. The luxury car brand is the first foreign company to get a license to operate a ride-hailing service in the country.
 
“We are excited to offer our new premium ride-hailing service in Chengdu, one of the largest ride-hailing hubs in the world embracing mobility solutions for a sustainable urban future,” said Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of BMW’s board of management. “Half our fleet of 200 BMW 5 Series are sustainable plug-in-hybrid vehicles, and our highly skilled and trained drivers will ensure an exciting premium mobility experience.”
BMW’s foray into the ride-hailing business is part of its ReachNow car-sharing brand, which debuted an electric vehicle rental endeavor last year. The new service involves trained drivers chauffeuring customers in a fleet of 200 BMW 5 Series cars.
According to reports, a rider who wants to use the service will pay a little more than they would for China’s largest ride-hailing app, Didi Chuxing, which bought out Uber’s Chinese business in 2016.
Didi’s comparable luxury feature, which is available in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, includes cars such as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6, as well as the BMW 5 Series.
For a 23-kilometer ReachNow ride in Chengdu on a Monday afternoon, a rider will pay about US$68. A similar trip in Shenzhen through Didi Luxury is about US$30, which is US$3 versus US$1.3 a kil...

196,"December 18, 2018","EU:  Vestager worries about Alstom, Siemens deal","

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday, December 18, voiced concerns over a plan by Siemens and Alstom to create a Franco-German rail champion and its effect on high-speed trains in Europe.
German industrial group Siemens and French rival Alstom last week offered to sell either one of their high-speed train technologies and the bulk of Alstom’s signaling business in Europe in addition to some Siemens signaling assets to address EU antitrust concerns, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
“It is right to say that we have concerns on very high-speed trains because it is very important for Europe to develop also when it comes to high-speed trains,” Vestager told a news conference.
“For us, it is very important to get the market response,” she said.
The European Commission has given rivals and customers until the end of this week to provide feedback on the offer.

197,"December 17, 2018",Argentina: US fund buys 51% of PRISMA for US$725M,"
The sale of 51% of shares in Prisma, the company that handles Visa card payments in Argentina, has been completed as US-based Advent Investment Fund has closed a deal for US$725 million, to be distributed among the banks that own the firm.
In addition to giving up control of Prisma, the banks now have three years to divest themselves of the 49% of remaining shares. They will be betting that, with Advent as a partner, the company will be valued well over the US$1.42 billion valuation Prisma was given for this transaction.
The banks were forced to divest Prisma following an investigation by the National Commission for the Defense of the Competition (CNDC), which determined that the company had a dominant position in the payments market. Crucially, the CNDC found that Prisma dominates what is called the “acquiring” and “data processing” system through extremely low tariffs, which it compensated with high charges along the rest of the business chain. This strategy worked as a very effective barrier to entry for those who wanted to enter the procurement and processing market. Prisma is thought to account for about 70% of payment transactions involving electronic money in Argentina.

198,"December 17, 2018",EU: Clothing company fined €40M for “geo-blocking”,"
On Monday, December 17, the European Commission fined the clothing company Guess €39.8 million (US$45.2 million) for restricting retailers from online advertising and selling cross-border to consumers in other Member States (“geo-blocking”), in breach of EU competition rules.
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said, “Guess’ distribution agreements tried to prevent EU consumers from shopping in other Member States by blocking retailers from advertising and selling cross-border. This allowed the company to maintain artificially high retail prices, in particular in Central and Eastern European countries. As a result, we have today sanctioned Guess for this behaviour. Our case complements the geoblocking rules that entered into force on 3 December – both address the issue of sales restrictions that are at odds with the Single Market.”
The investigation into Guess began in June 2017 following a year-long inquiry into the cross-border online sales practices of 1,900 companies.
The European Commission said Guess’ distribution deals with retailers restricted them from using the Guess brand names and trademarks for online search advertising and also prevented them from setting the retail price independently.
Specifically, the investigation found that Guess’ distribution agreements restricted authorized retailers from:

199,"December 17, 2018",US: Foxconn attorney: no settlement with Qualcomm,"
Lead attorney for Apple assembly firm Foxconn released a statement saying that neither Foxconn nor Apple would seek a settlement in court with Qualcomm over the companies’ ongoing legal tug-of-war.
The conflict is but one aspect of the global legal battle between regulators, Apple, and Qualcomm—which supplies modem chips that help phones connect to wireless data networks.
Last week, Qualcomm secured a preliminary victory in a patent lawsuit in China that would have banned sales of some Apple iPhones there. Apple later stated it believed it was already in compliance, but would change its software “to address any possible concern” about its compliance.
The group of contract manufacturers—which includes Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp, and Compal Electronics—became embroiled in the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm last year.
In the supply chain for electronics, contract manufacturers buy Qualcomm chips and pay royalties when they build phones, and are in turn reimbursed by companies like Apple. Qualcomm sued the group last year, alleging they had stopped paying royalties related to Apple products, and Apple joined the defense.
In response to Qualcomm’s lawsuit, the group of manufacturers filed their own lawsuit against Qualcomm. The group is seeking US$9 billion in damages for Qualcomm’s practice of charging money for chips but then also asking for a cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone as a patent royalty p...

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile  won approval from US national-security officials for its planned takeover of Sprint, according to people familiar with the matter, bringing the two rivals a step closer to closing their roughly US$26 billion combination.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS, told the companies Monday, December 17, that it had cleared the union of the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers by subscribers after several months of negotiations with company representatives, the people said.
The deal still needs approval from antitrust authorities at the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department. T-Mobile executives have said they expect that process to end in the first half of next year.

201,"December 17, 2018",EU: EC fines Bulgarian gas company €77M,"
The European Commission announced on December 17 that it has fined Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) €77.1 million (US$87.6 million) for blocking competitors’ access to key gas infrastructure in Bulgaria, in breach of EU antitrust rules.
The European Commission, which raided the company in 2011 in a move that led to the opening of an investigation in 2013, claimed BEH had abused its dominance to hinder competitors.
Specifically, between 2010 and 2015, BEH blocked access to Bulgaria’s gas transmission network, the country’s only gas storage facility, and the only import pipeline bringing gas into Bulgaria—which was fully booked by BEH.
Bulgarian Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova criticized the Commission for demanding that Bulgaria should privatize BEH’s gas network operator Bulgartransgaz in order to reach an agreement and avoid a fine.
“This is strategic infrastructure for the country, directly linked with the national security. We cannot allow compromises with our national security,” Petkova told reporters.

202,"December 17, 2018",India: DP World challenges CCI’s jurisdiction,"
Dubai government-run global port operator, DP World, has filed a written petition in the High Court in Mumbai, challenging an interim order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to probe alleged anti-competitive practices on a complaint filed by PSA International, its rival at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
The CCI last month announced it suspected alleged antitrust violations by DP World and Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk at the terminals they operate at state-owned JNPT.
DP World is challenging the November 9 interim order, arguing that the antitrust regulator has “no jurisdiction” over the issue on which Singapore government-owned PSA International had filed the complaint, at least two people familiar with the writ petition filed by DP World said.
In the complaint, PSA alleged that DP World and the container port operating unit of A.P. Moller-Maersk, which have been running facilities at JNPT for many years, were creating entry barriers to its newly-opened terminal at India’s busiest container gateway, thereby limiting its operational effectiveness since the February 18 start.

203,"December 17, 2018",US: Johnson & Johnson file for dismissal in Kroger case,"
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) filed a motion to dismiss in the antitrust claim brought against the company by Walgreens and Kroger in regard to sales of J&J’s reference infliximab product, Remicade—a pharmaceutical which treats various irritable bowel conditions. In early December, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denied the motion.
In June 2018, Walgreen and Kroger filed an antitrust suit against J&J and its Janssen division seeking permanent injunctive relief and damages “arising out of [J&J and Janssen’s] unlawful exclusion of biosimilar competition to the brand name drug Remicade,” according to the suit.
Walgreen alleged that J&J’s hold on the market was due to exclusionary practices enacted through “contracts and bundled discounts that have suppressed competition.” Furthermore, the suit states that J&J entered into agreements with insurers through which they agreed not to cover either of the biosimilar products on their respective plans, or to only do so in rare cases.
According to the order of dismissal, J&J moved to dismiss Walgreens’ and Kroger’s claim on two grounds: J&J alleged that the retailers’ claims did not sufficiently allege antitrust violations, and that because the retailers do not have consent from the distributors to pursue these claims, they lacked antitrust standing.
On the first ground, the court found that, similar to a case brought by Pfizer, the complaint “plainly and r...

204,"December 17, 2018",UK: “Big Six” energy merger called off after CMA clearance,"
Npower and SSE, two of the UK’s big six energy firms, will no longer go ahead with their planned merger.
The merger was given the final green light by the Competition and Markets Authority in October, but the companies have failed to reach an agreement to continue.
The board of SSE said that the decision to call off the merger was influenced by a range of factors, including the changing energy market and clarity over the new energy price cap, which comes into effect in January.
“We closely monitored the impact of all developments and continually reviewed whether this remained the right deal to do for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Ultimately, we have now concluded that it is not,” said Alistair Phillips-Davies, CEO of SSE.
“We believed at the time it was the right thing in terms of what we saw. There was a significant prize to go for,” he added. “But market conditions changed over the past 13 months.”
Mr Phillips-Davies said the deal had been hampered by a combination of factors including the level of a price cap on some bills being introduced from January, the performances of the two businesses and a “very, very competitive market.”

The chairman of South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, Kim Sang-jo, made the comments in a meeting with heads of nine small suppliers for retailers in Daejeon, located about 160 kilometers south of Seoul.
Kim said big retailers would pay punitive damages of up to three times the losses incurred by smaller partners in case of illegal business practices, such as rejection and returns without legitimate reasons.
South Korea has been trying to level the playing field for small and medium-sized companies in a country where family-controlled conglomerates have dominated the economy for decades and some have recently come under fire for abusing their market dominance and exerting undue pressure on subcontractors and smaller firms.

Reuters reported that Siemens and Alstom have offered to sell either one of their high-speed train technologies to address EU antitrust concerns about their plan to create a Franco-German rail company, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, December 17.
Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom submitted an offer last week to divest about 4% of the combined company, namely the bulk of Alstom’s signaling business Pendolino in Europe in addition to some Siemens signaling assets platform, Velaro Novo, according to Reuters’ sources.
Pendolino trains have been sold to 12 operators in 12 countries. Siemens’ Velaro Novo high-speed trains, on the other hand, will only enter service in 2023.
Additionally, the offer included plans for a five-year license to sell the trains in Europe.
The European Commission has given rivals and customers this week to provide feedback. A negative response could prompt the regulator to demand more concessions from Siemens and Alstom before it makes a ruling by February 18.

Dear Readers,
To close out this consequential year in antitrust, the December 2018 CPI Antitrust Chronicle® features articles related to multi-sided platforms and consumer harm. As the legal and economic literature have parsed out over the years, multisided markets have been around and long time, but today they have taken on a rather ubiquitous nature.
A number of the articles in this month’s Chronicle feature discussions on some of the pertinent issues of the European Commission’s recent Google Android decision…discussing, among other issues, relevant markets, competitive constraints, underlying damage theory, the potential effects of associated remedies, and potential consumer harm.
Looking beyond this specific case, one author asks: “Has the digital economy turned into a jungle?” This month’s articles address some of the broader themes and issues that continue to be hotly debated in relation to antitrust enforcement of two-sided and multi-sided markets. When faced with these new (and some not so new) hurdles, what are some of the main challenges to ensure the relevance and timeliness of competition enforcement?
As 2018 comes to a close the team at CPI wishes our readers, authors, and subscribers happy holidays and a great start to the New Year.
As always, thank you to our great panel of authors.
Sincerely,
CPI Team*

We investigate their impact on Android’s two-sided structure. These remedies question both Google’s business model and Android’s technical architecture as anti-fragmentation provisions and apps’ pre-installation may be consubstantial to such a two-sided structure.

209,"December 17, 2018",Structuralist Innovation: A Shaky Legal Presumption in Need of an Overhaul,"
By Dirk Auer – 
The relationship between competition and innovation has puzzled economists for the last century. This had led to a growing body of work which ultimately concludes that no market structure is strictly superior at fostering innovation. Despite these findings, the European Commission has recently adopted a number of decisions – including the two Google cases – wherein it concludes that more firms in any given market will produce greater choice and more innovation for consumers. I call this the “Structuralist Innovation Presumption.” This paper shows that the Commission’s presumption is at odds with sound economics and that a more nuanced approach is required.

The preliminary ruling by Judge Lucy Koh in the US District Court for the Northern District of California stated that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making so-called modem chips, which help smartphones connect to wireless data networks, to rival chip firms. On Friday, December 14, Judge Koh ruled against Qualcomm again.
Qualcomm argued in court papers that the new market conditions would likely show that it does not have the monopoly on modem chips that the FTC alleges.
But last week, Judge Koh rejected the request in a pre-trial decision, saying that the case was about Qualcomm’s business conduct and not its market power.
Koh wrote in her decision: “Qualcomm does not argue that any post-discovery evidence shows a change in Qualcomm’s own business conduct. All of the proposed evidence relates to alleged shifts in Qualcomm’s market power.”

The Disney and Fox merger had been moving along rather smoothly until it hit a regulatory snag in Brazil earlier this month. Now, regulators in Mexico are questioning how the merger will affect the country’s cable industry.
The primary cause of concern for the regulatory body in Mexico will be Disney’s increased portfolio of sports content. According to Mexican newspaper El Universal, Disney would own nearly 30% of the programming in the market while companies like Warner Brothers and Universal owning substantially less content at 15.12% and 11.45%, respectively. El Universal reports that television prices could increase upwards of 20% as a result of the merger.
In the US the merger received conditional approval from the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission dependent of Disney’s ability to sell the regional sports networks acquired in the merger.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) has given its approval of Gray’s merger with Raycom Media. Divestment of broadcast television stations in nine markets is needed as a condition of resolving “a challenge” to the proposed US$3.6 billion merger between Gray and Raycom.
The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed merger. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the suit by remedying the competitive harms alleged in the complaint, through the divestitures and related conditions.
“Without the required divestitures, Gray’s merger with Raycom threatens serious competitive harm to cable subscribers and small businesses,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “I am pleased, however, that we have been able to reach a speedy and complete resolution of the Division’s concerns, thanks in part to the parties’ commitment to engage in good faith settlement talks from the outset of our investigation.”

According to a report from Reuters, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced  it has settled antitrust charges with Nexstar Media Group, which was accused of sharing sensitive information with rivals in the broadcast television industry.
The information involved how stations were performing, which provides insight to rivals about whether they would raise, lower, or maintain spot advertising prices, the agency explained in a statement.
The settlement, which must be approved by a court, bars direct and indirect sharing of such information and requires Nexstar to cooperate in the ongoing investigation, according to the statement.
“Robust competition among broadcast stations allows American businesses to obtain competitive advertising rates. The unlawful sharing of information reduced that competition and harmed businesses and the consumers they serve,” Assistant US Attorney General Makan Delrahim said.

214,"December 16, 2018","According to a report from Reuters, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced  it has settled antitrust","
The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week provisionally cleared Menzies Aviation’s takeover of part of Airline Services’ business after an in-depth investigation allayed competition concerns.
The two firms supply airlines in the UK with a variety of support services including the de-icing of aircraft and ground handling.
An initial Phase 1 probe raised concerns that the merger could restrict choice for airlines at a number of key airports in England and Scotland for both de-icing and ground handling, potentially leading to higher prices or a worse service. These concerns led to the merger being referred to a Group of independent CMA Panel members for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.
The CMA issued its provisional findings based on a thorough evaluation of the wider evidence base in the Phase 2 inquiry. It has found that the market for ground handling services is particularly dynamic, with a strong recent history of companies entering the market to compete for contracts. With regard to de-icing services, the CMA found that competition between Menzies and Airline Services is very limited such that the merger would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition.
The CMA is inviting comments on its findings until January 9, 2019. It will then consider any submissions it receives before reaching a final decision, the deadline for which is January 28, 2019.

Scientific Games announced last week that it had agreed to pay US$151.5 million in order to settle a federal antitrust lawsuit with four companies over efforts it made to keep other automatic card shufflers out of the market.
As part of the settlement Scientific Games is to pay Shuffle Tech, Aces Up Gaming, and Poydras-Talrick US$151.5 million, around 45% of the US$335 million it had been ordered to pay by an Illinois jury in August this year.
“While we firmly believe that the jury decision was wrong, we are pleased with the outcome of the settlement and that this matter will be resolved for good,” Scientific Games chief legal officer and executive vice president James Sottile said.
The case dates back to 2012, when Scientific Games filed a lawsuit against the three companies, alleging the trio had infringed on the solutions provider’s patents in the development of an automatic card shuffling machine.

Brazil’s antitrust authority CADE has recommended that a court convict 16 companies and 52 individuals over allegations they were involved in forming a cartel to fix bids for public train contracts across the central and southern parts of the country.
CADE said in a statement on Wednesday, December 12, the companies, which include units of Mitsu, Bombardier, and Alstom, could pay up to 20% of their annual gross revenue if convicted, while individuals could pay fines of 50,000 to 2 billion reais (US$13,000 to $514 million).
When it launched the probe in 2014, CADE said the cartel allegedly began in 1998 and its members had divided up tenders between themselves and “pretended there was competition, but had agreed previously on the prices of their bids.”
CADE said the scheme included bids for metro and commuter trains in the cities of Sao Paulo, Brasilia, Porto Alegre, and Belo Horizonte.
CADE’s conclusions add to a list of corruption accusations that Brazilian authorities have levelled against companies across a range of industries in recent years, leading to the downfall of many powerful executives and politicians.
“The evidence collected throughout the investigation allows us to conclude that the companies and their employees interfered with the results of at least 27 projects,” CADE stated.
CADE said among the other companies involved were local units of Balfour Beatty, Construccion y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) and Hyundai-Rotem, part of Hyundai Moto...

Deutsche Telekom welcomed the decision but said it was not convinced by all aspects of the judgment and would consider appealing to the European Court of Justice.
Europe’s largest telecoms provider and its Slovak Telekom unit were sanctioned by the European Commission in 2014 for squeezing out competitors by charging unfair wholesale prices in Slovakia.
The EU competition enforcer said the anti-competitive practice to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services lasted more than five years.
The two companies were given a joint fine of €38.84 million while Deutsche Telekom was also hit with an additional €31 million penalty.
The companies subsequently challenged the EU decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court.
The Court said a parent company’s liability can exceed that of the subsidiary if there are factors which reflect the former’s conduct for which it is held liable.
However, in this case, what was at fault was the basis used by the Commission for assessing the additional fine.
“Deutsche Telekom’s turnover is not capable of reflecting its individual conduct in the infringement at issue and … it therefore could not serve as a basis for the calculation of an additional fi...

218,"December 13, 2018","US: 4Competition coalition forms to oppose Sprint, T-Mobile merger","
Opponents of the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US have formed a coalition called 4Competition in an attempt to strengthen their efforts to convince regulators to block the merger. The coalition includes a wide range of actors, from operators such as C Spire and Dish Network to unions CWA and AFL-CIO and non-profits like Public Knowledge, the Open Markets Institute, and Fight for the Future.
Other members include Common Cause, New America’s Open Technology Institute, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, Rural Wireless Association, The Greenlining Institute, and the Writers Guild of America West. In November, the 14 groups sent a joint letter to Congress members outlining their opposition to the merger, which would reduce the US from four to three mobile network operators. While Congress does not have a say in vetting the merger, the coalition wants the legislature to hold hearings in order to raise public awareness about the implications of the deal.
The opponents claim that the merger would lead to higher prices for consumers, job losses and reduced competition, including for MVNOs seeking network access. They also dispute the claims from T-Mobile that the deal would support a faster 5G launch or improve coverage for rural mobile users.
The merger is subject to clearance by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice, and the companies aim to complete the deal in the first half of 2019. The FCC closed the period for public comment...

219,"December 13, 2018",Vietnam: Grab’s Uber takeover violated competition law,"
The Vietnamese Trade and Industry Ministry announced its investigation has found evidence that Grab’s acquisition of competitor Uber violated Vietnam’s Competition Law.
The investigation, carried out by the Ministry’s Competition and Consumer Protection Department, found that the two ride-hailing firms had failed to report their merger to competition authorities as needed.
They merger they carried out was also not allowed by Vietnamese law, the Ministry stated Wednesday, December 12.
The 2004 Competition Law requires any merger or acquisition that results in a company gaining a 30% market share to be reported to competition authorities.
If a company gains a 50% market share from the deal, it can only be implemented with express permission from the authorities.
The department’s preliminary investigation has found Grab’s market share in Vietnam exceeded 50% since Uber quit the market last April.

220,"December 13, 2018",Australia: ACCC delays TPG-Vodafone merger decision,"
In a statement on Thursday morning, December 13, Australian Competition and Consumer Competition (ACCC) chairman Rod Sims cast serious doubts over the future of the AU$15 billion (US$10.8 billion) deal to merge Vodafone Australia and TPG Telecom after warning of a “substantial lessening of competition.” Mr Sims delayed his decision for three months.
Mr Sims said it was the ACCC’s view that TPG, on its own, was on track to enter the increasingly competitive AU$20 billion (US$14.5 billion) mobile market “and as such it’s likely to be an aggressive competitor.”
“We therefore have preliminary concerns that removing TPG as a new independent competitor with its own network, in what is a concentrated market for mobile services, would be likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition,” he said. “If TPG remains separate from Vodafone, it appears likely to need to continue to adopt an aggressive pricing strategy, offering cheap mobile plans with large data allowances.”

According to a report from Bloomberg, the lead House Democrat on antitrust issues, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, said that he plans to craft legislation aimed at reining in tech giants.
The measure will aim to ensure that online firms with “significant market power” aren’t allowed to discriminate against competitors, Cicilline said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing examining Google’s practices. He said he plans to work with the Federal Trade Commission to develop the proposal.
“I strongly support an open, decentralized internet that is free of powerful gate keepers with the ability to discriminate against rivals, threaten innovation, or harm consumers,” said Cicilline, who serves as ranking member of the panel’s antitrust subcommittee. He’s poised to become subcommittee chairman in the next Congress.
Cicilline said he was “deeply concerned” by reports that Google has abused its dominant position in the online search market.
The European Commission last year fined Google US$2.7 billion for allegedly giving its comparison site prominent placement in search results over rival comparison sites.

The city of Oakland filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday, December 11, challenging the relocation of the Raiders to Las Vegas, calling the move illegal and demanding compensation for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
The long-awaited suit against the Raiders, the National Football League (NFL), and every other team in the league seeks damages for the “unlawful decision to boycott Oakland,” but does not ask for the Raiders to remain in the city. Oakland claims the NFL and its teams collude as an “illegal cartel” to demand that cities bankroll new stadiums with public funds or be shut out of the marketplace with team relocations.
On top of antitrust violations, the complaint alleges that the Raiders and NFL are violating their own policies and bylaws.
“Threats of relocation are a central part of the NFL’s practice of demanding public financing for new stadiums, which significantly increase team revenues and ticket prices,” Oakland City Attorney Barbara Parker said in the statement.

French and German engineering giants Alstom and Siemens announced Wednesday, December 12, they had offered EU regulators concessions they believed would meet concerns over the planned merger of their railway businesses, reported Reuters.
Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom agreed last year to merge their rail operations, creating a company with €15 billion (US$17 billion) in revenue and a workforce of 62,000, but regulators raised concerns over the deal.
“The proposed remedies include mainly signaling activities as well as rolling stock products and represent around four percent of the sales of the combined entity,” Siemens and Alstom stated in a brief joint statement on Wednesday.
“The parties consider that the proposed remedy package is appropriate and adequate. There is, however, no certainty that the content of this package will be sufficient to alleviate the concerns of the Commission. A decision by the Commission is expected by February 18, 2019,” they added.

The planned survey is designed to learn how four large firms that provide online search and shopping services, Google, Apple, Facebook  and Amazon.com, conduct business and how best to set regulations for dealing with issues that may arise due to their massive economic clout.
The move, revealed at a meeting of ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers, comes amid growing concerns that such technology companies can force unfair deals on smaller business partners due to their overwhelming market shares.

The planned tie-up between Britain’s second and third-biggest supermarkets has been referred for an in-depth investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), expected to be completed by the start of March.
But Sainsbury’s said on Wednesday that the two companies felt the current timetable “does not give the parties or the CMA sufficient time to provide and consider all the evidence given the unprecedented scale and complexity of the case”.
he watchdog responded by saying that giving the extra time the two retailers are asking for would put the its ability to complete its investigation by the required deadline “at very serious risk”.

An EU Competition law Analysis of Online Display Advertising in the Programmatic Age
By Damien Geradin & Dimitrios Katsifis (Euclid Law)
Online display advertising, whereby publishers display visual-based advertisements (e.g. texts, images or videos) on their website against remuneration, represents a large source of revenues for publishers, large and small, offering valuable content to Internet users. But for online display advertising, many such publishers would not subsist, and the Internet would be impoverished. Display advertising is also critical to advertisers, in particular when they seek to raise “brand awareness” among consumers.
Because of its vital importance to advertisers and publishers, healthy competition in the advertising ecosystem is desirable. Yet, despite the spectacular growth of online display advertising, the picture is not entirely rosy. In the “programmatic” era, where ad inventory is sold through computerized decision-making processes managed by “ad tech” intermediaries, the online display advertising sector is characterized by a high degree of opacity, and publishers and advertisers have expressed concerns about the so-called “ad tech tax”, i.e. the large and opaque fees applied by various intermediaries. Moreover, while the ad tech sector comprises a wide variety of intermediaries, its main segments are dominated by Google, with concerns being expressed that it may engage in both explo...

Vodafone’s purchase of Liberty Global’s assets in Germany and east Europe may damage competition in Germany and the Czech Republic, EU antitrust regulators announced on Tuesday, December 11, as they opened a full-scale probe into the US$21.8 billion deal.
The deal between the world’s second-largest mobile operator and US cable pioneer John Malone’s Liberty would enable Vodafone to compete more effectively with Deutsche Telekom in the German rival’s home market.
It also expands Vodafone’s reach in broadband, cable, and mobile services elsewhere in Europe as it includes Liberty Global assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania.
The European Commission stated some rivals might be shut out of the Czech market, where Vodafone offers mainly mobile telephony services and Liberty Global offers fixed services.
In Germany, the deal might reduce competition in the retail fixed telecoms markets and retail TV markets, curb investments in next-generation networks, and give the merged firm more power as a TV broadcaster, the EU competition enforcer stated.
It saw no issues in Romania and Hungary and stated it will decide whether to clear the deal by May 2. The deadline can be extended if Vodafone offers concessions.
Reuters reported on November 30 that the watchdog was set to launch a full-scale probe into the deal.
Vodafone said it still expected EU approval by mid-2019.

230,"December 11, 2018",US: FTC faces appeal in Shire ViroPharma case,"

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Tuesday, December 11, urged a federal appeals court to overturn the dismissal of its lawsuit accusing a unit of drugmaker Shire of violating antitrust laws, claiming the lower court’s ruling threatens its enforcement abilities.
The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia will hear arguments over whether a judge in March correctly held the FTC could only seek an injunction against Shire ViroPharma if it could allege the company was about to break the law again.
In this case, the FTC alleged the defendants violated antitrust laws by abusing government processes to delay generic competition to its branded prescription drug, Vancocin HCl capsules.
The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has a practice where it refrains from approving generic applications of a drug if there are any pending citizen petition filings. ViroPharma purportedly used this to its advantage and submitted 43 filings with the FDA to delay the process for generic versions of its drug.
“I have long advocated that the commission target abuses of government processes that significantly harm competition and consumers. The commission’s action is another example of this ongoing commitment,” said FTC then-acting chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen.

231,"December 11, 2018",US: Defunct startup Sidecar sues Uber: “hell-bent on stifling competition”,"
 
 
Defunct startup Sidecar Technologies, which pioneered on-demand ride-hailing, is suing Uber, alleging it engaged in predatory pricing and anticompetitive practices that ultimately put Sidecar out of business.
The lawsuit, filed in US district court in San Francisco on Tuesday, December 11, claims “Uber became hell-bent on stifling competition from competing ride-hailing apps,” and used subsidies and made fake ride requests to competitors in a bid to dominate the market. Sidecar went out of business in December 2015 and sold its assets to General Motors in 2016.
The lawsuit comes after Uber made a confidential filing for an initial public offering last Thursday and is the latest in a long line of legal disputes targeting Uber, which has battled drivers and rival companies.
The complaint was brought by SC Innovations, the successor to Sidecar after it was shuttered. Sunil Paul, the co-founder of Sidecar, said that with Uber, “it was never a fair fight.”
“That’s why Sidecar failed,” Paul said in a blog post. “And it’s also why both drivers and passengers are left with higher prices and fewer choices today. Now it is clear that Uber’s predatory and anti-competitive strategy worked.”
Sidecar alleged in the lawsuit that “Uber’s senior officers and executives directed clandestine campaigns” to place fraudulent ride requests on the Sidecar app. Drivers were inundated with ride requests sent by Uber that were canceled before they arrived at th...

On Monday, December 17, at 10:00 am, Judge John Koeltl will hear oral argument in the case of Cenedella v. Metropolitan Museum of Art et al on the museum defendants’ motion to dismiss New York City artist Robert Cenedella’s lawsuit, in which he alleges an antitrust conspiracy against outsider artists such as himself. Instead of deciding the motion on the legal briefs submitted by the attorneys, Judge Koeltl will convene the parties and their attorneys to hear arguments and ask questions in court.
In February, the painter known as the “Art Bastard” hit the art establishment with a US$100 million proposed class action, accusing The Met and four other New York City museums of conspiring to artificially raise prices for some galleries’ work and restricting access to the market.
Robert Cenedella, known as the “Art Bastard” said private collectors, galleries, and auction houses play a large role in determining which works end up in museum collections, creating a system that drives up prices for a small group of select artists while shutting out others who “do not carry the imprimatur or financial cache of the contemporary artists within the closed system.”
“The system today—put in place by galleries, auction houses, and art critiques—has nothing to do with talent, development of skill, or maturation of the art world,” said Cenedella, a teacher at the Art Students League of New York.

The judge ruled the lawsuits sufficiently alleged J&J entered into contracts with insurers that required them to deny or restrict coverage for competing, cheaper drugs and threatened to deny them rebates if they reimbursed patients’ claims for them.
Remicade generated US sales of US$4.8 billion for J&J in 2016, but it faces increased competition from cheaper “biosimilar” copycats, including Pfizer’s version, which is sold in the US under the name Inflectra.

The app, available for iOS and Android platforms, has features that include biometric identification, location finder, transfer tracking, and exchange rates and fee estimates.
MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes said the move is important for the continued growth of the company’s digital and mobile strategies.
“More than 70 percent of our online transactions are made on a mobile device,” he said. “It’s critical that the consumers who use their smartphones to transact with us have a product that provides an exceptional customer experience. We believe the new MoneyGram app is the best app in the industry.”

Years into a government probe over alleged generic drug price fixing, investigators have expanded the scope to include 300 drugs and 16 companies, an official told The Washington Post.
Connecticut Assistant Attorney General Joseph Nielsen told the Post it’s “most likely the largest cartel in the history of the United States.” And he knows the allegations well: Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen has been investigating generic pricing collusion since 2014 in a probe that started with just two drugs. So far, the investigation has already yielded guilty pleas from two former executives of Heritage Pharmaceuticals who are now cooperating with investigators.
The lawsuit and related cases picked up steam last month when a federal judge ruled that more than 1 million emails, cell phone texts, and other documents cited as evidence could be shared among all plaintiffs.
“This is most likely the largest cartel in the history of the United States,” Nielsen said. He cited the volume of drugs in the schemes, that they took place on American soil and the “total number of companies involved, and individuals.”

Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is continuing to grow its US antitrust capabilities, this time bringing onboard Andrew Ewalt, a longtime Department of Justice (DOJ) official who was the counselor to another recent Freshfields hire, Eric Mahr, the former director of litigation in the DOJ’s Antitrust Division.

Ewalt said that he wasn’t looking to move to private practice, but the prospect of a change emerged from staying in touch with Mahr, who joined Freshfields in February after departing the DOJ in November 2017.
“He would share some of his experiences,” Ewalt said. “It piqued my interest.”

238,"December 10, 2018",US: Uber eyes 2019 IPO,"
Uber is moving ahead with its initial public offering (IPO), filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US last week.
The Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Uber is joining Lyft, its ride-hailing rival, in filing the paperwork with the SEC, setting the stage for the two to go public in rapid succession. The report noted the IPOs could happen in the first quarter of 2019 at the earliest. They are expected to be among the largest tech IPOs planned for the New Year, noted the report. The two have already received multibillion-dollar valuations. The IPOs are aimed at raising money to fund the next stage of growth, noted the Financial Times. The IPOs also give early investors and employees a means to cash out their shares.
Uber isn’t the only one gearing up for an IPO. The Financial Times noted that Slack, the workplace messaging app, has hired an investment bank to underwrite its IPO in 2019. The FT cited sources familiar with the matter. Airbnb, Palantir, and Stripe are also seen as potential IPOs in 2019. People close to the matter told the paper that in the case of Uber, it is tapping Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the IPO and could try to get a valuation of higher than US$100 billion. It would be one-third more than the US$76 billion valuation Uber had in the fall when it sold a stake to Toyota.
While Uber has been saying for months that it expects an IPO in the second half of next year, the company is spee...

239,"December 6, 2018",US: Judges grill DOJ over to AT&T-Time Warner merger,"
According to a report by The Hill, federal appeals court judges grilled the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday, December 6, over its challenge to a lower court’s decision to bless the AT&T-Time Warner merger.
It’s unclear from the tough questioning where the judges will land in their consideration of the appeal, but the government, which challenged the US$85 billion merger last year and faces a high burden in the appeals process, faced an intense interrogation from the panel.
“This is a merger that will shape the industry for decades to come,” Michael Murray, the DOJ’s lawyer, said during his oral argument before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
The questioning centered on the economic model that the government relied on in court earlier this year and the trial judge’s interpretation of it in his decision to approve the merger unconditionally.
While the judges also spent a good deal of time on AT&T’s offer to arbitrate any impasse in licensing negotiations, the appeal just come down to the trial judge’s leeway in examining the evidence and coming to conclusions about shortcomings in economic theories.
AT&T attorney Peter Keisler stressed how his side showcased the problems in the government’s economic modeling and how there wasn’t any rebuttal evidence offered by the other side that supported the real-life application of these models showing raised prices on consumers.
“What the trial showed about the model was its ex...

Baker Botts announced that Maureen Ohlhausen has joined the firm, and will become a partner and a Co-Chair of the global Antitrust Practice effective January 1, 2019.
From January 2017 to May 2018, Ms. Ohlhausen was Acting Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the highest-ranking position in the agency, charged with antitrust enforcement and consumer protection. She served as FTC Commissioner from 2012 until her appointment as acting Chairman.

During her distinguished tenure at the top echelon of the FTC, Ms. Ohlhausen was a leading voice in shaping the current standards that apply to antitrust, privacy, and consumer protection laws, both in the US and globally through her interactions with regulators, elected officials, judges, and scholars, both at home and abroad. She has received numerous awards, including the FTC’s Robert Pitofsky Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Mason University Distinguished Alumni Award.
In early 2018, Ms. Ohlhausen was nominated by President Trump to serve on the United States Court of Federal Claims. She recently withdrew her nomination in favor of her decision to serve the needs of clients in private practice.

241,"December 6, 2018",UK:  Gov releases Facebook emails about data privacy that could impact EU scrutiny,"
Facebook emails showing the company threatened to cut off user data access to potential rivals could lead to harsher regulatory scrutiny by the European Union, reported Bloomberg.
Their publication preceded a vote by EU lawmakers expected December 6 on draft rules for how online platforms should treat partners, and Germany’s conclusion of an antitrust probe, due in the new year, which may call on Facebook to its change privacy terms. EU privacy regulators, newly armed with the power to fine for data breaches, may be hungry for a scalp as well.
“Facebook is now on notice that we cannot continue to undermine the trust citizens place, not only in our online platforms, but our democracy itself,” said Claude Moraes, a British member of the European Parliament who quizzed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a June hearing. “A big stick is available to the EU in the form of competition and taxation powers.”
A trove of internal correspondence, published online December 5 by UK legislators, provides a look into the ways Facebook executives, including Zuckerberg, treated information posted by users like a commodity that could be harnessed in service of business goals. Apps were invited to use Facebook’s network to grow, as long as that increased usage of Facebook. Certain competitors, in a list reviewed by Zuckerberg himself, were not allowed to use Facebook’s tools and data without his personal sign-off.

The Federal Court has approved a settlement reached between agricultural cooperative Murray Goulburn and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which will see the cooperative’s former managing director hit with a US$200,000 fine.
The Federal Court’s approval of the settlement also saw Murray Goulburn declare that it had breached Australian Consumer Law, however no financial penalties were sought from the former dairy processor.
The ACCC launched proceedings against Murray Goulburn last year, alleging it had engaged in unconscionable conduct and made false or misleading representations in breach of Australian consumer law.
In April 2016, after months of promising to raise the farmgate milk price, Murray Goulburn suddenly and retrospectively slashed milk prices, stunning its suppliers and leaving many hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.

In a poll of New Yorkers on whether they support or oppose Amazon’s plans to build a new headquarters in the Long Island City area of Queens, the majority said they support Amazon, according to a report by Reuters.
They do have some trepidations, however, as polled residents were split over the finer points of the multibillion-dollar incentive package that was offered to lure the online retail giant to the area.
Of the residents who replied to the Quinnipiac University poll, 57% said they approved of Amazon’s plans, while 26% said they opposed it.
When it came to the issue of the US$2.8 billion in tax breaks and incentives offered to Amazon to come to Queens, 46% said they are in support and 44% said they oppose the idea.
Amazon was offered US$1.525 billion in performance-based direct incentives, as well as a refundable tax credit by New York State’s Excelsior Program, which could total as much as US$1.2 billion.
State, city, and local residents have opposed the deal over maneuverings that allowed Amazon to minimize the need for local approvals, something that is normally necessary in local projects.
Other leaders say they are against the project because of the large tax breaks, and also due to how the company will affect the neighborhood’s infrastructure.
There were a reported 238 cities that competed to get Amazon’s new headquarters, and the decision to split between two locations was surprising to many. The other HQ will be in Crystal City in Arlington County ne...

Takeda Pharmaceutical has won shareholder approval to finance its £46 billion (US$58.6 billion) purchase of Shire, paving the way for Japan’s largest corporate takeover and the creation of a global drugmaker with combined revenues of US$32 billion.
The vote on Wednesday, December 5, caps months of aggressive campaigning by Christophe Weber, Takeda’s CEO, to fend off attempts by founding family members to derail a deal that the 237-year-old group sees as pivotal to securing its place among the world’s top 10 pharmaceutical companies.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the acquisition propels 237-year-old Takeda into the big leagues, making the combined entity the world’s eighth-largest drugmaker by sales, and reflects how Japan’s corporate titans are looking abroad to fuel growth. Together, the companies would be estimated to earn half their revenue from the US, up from the roughly one-third that Takeda makes now. Takeda also estimates annual savings would reach at least US$1.4 billion three years after the merger.

Britain’s competition watchdog announced on Wednesday, December 5, that PayPal’s US$2.2 billion takeover of Swedish financial technology startup iZettle would be referred for an in-depth review.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated PayPal had refused to offer proposals to address its concerns on how the deal—PayPal’s biggest ever—could hurt competition and could lead to higher prices for customers, or worse quality of service.
The regulator had also flagged concerns surrounding competition in the emerging market for “omni-channel” payment services as a result of the merger.
PayPal’s acquisition of iZettle, which would allow the US payments processor to expand into the retail payment terminals business in international markets, closed in September.

Brazilian antitrust watchdog CADEade will begin an investigation on Wednesday, December 5, that may result in mandatory sales of refineries by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras), newspaper Valor Economico reported.
According to the paper, CADE is analyzing the influence of Petrobras on fuel prices. The company controls almost 100% of refining in the country. CADEade and Petrobras did not immediately comment on the matter.
Petrobras proposed earlier this year to sell a 60% stake in four refineries. But a truckers strike that pressured the company’s pricing policies spooked buyers, and a decision by Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski forced the company to halt the sale process.

The apex court on Wednesday, December 5, rejected the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) plea to investigate charges of cartelization by Vodafone India, Idea Cellular, and Bharti Airtel. The CCI had approached the Supreme Court to challenge an earlier judgment passed by the Bombay High Court, The Economic Times reports.
The Bombay High Court in September ruled that the CCI doesn’t have the jurisdiction to order an investigation when there is a sector-specific regulator: the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

Qualcomm, the world’s biggest smartphone-chip maker, walked away from its agreement to buy NXP in July, after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. The planned deal was first agreed between the two companies in October 2016.
After high-stakes talks on Saturday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina, the White House announced in a statement that China was “open to approving the previously unapproved” deal for Qualcomm to acquire NXP “should it again be presented.”

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Visa and Mastercard have offered to cap the fees charged on card payments made by tourists in the European Union to stave off fines and end an EU antitrust investigation.
The European Commission announced both companies made offers to lower fees known as interregional interchange fees. The Commission, which has asked for feedback on those proposals, stated the fees are applied to payments made in the EU and three other European countries with cards issued outside of the region.
Card networks like Visa and Mastercard set interchange fees. But it is the banks that profit from them because merchants pay the banks when customers pay with their cards. That means that getting lower fees from European purchases could have deep implications for US banks. In recent years, they have focused their credit-card businesses on more affluent customers, many of whom travel and spend outside the US.
The Commission is worried that the fees could raise prices for companies in Europe, potentially driving up prices for consumer goods and services.
Credit-card companies have been locked in disagreements over fees charged to merchants with officials in the US and Europe for years, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In the US, Visa and Mastercard were part of a group of firms that agreed to a US$6.2 billion settlement with merchants related to card fees.

CADE announced on Monday, December 3, that a deal by Walt Disney to buy Twenty-First Century Fox‘s entertainment assets raised concerns about undermining competition in the cable television market.
A CADE report prepared to inform a subsequent ruling by the regulator said the deal would result in “a significant increase in concentration in the market of sports channels on cable TV and a high probability that Disney could control the market.”
This could “potentially reduce the quality and diversity of the sports content available, besides raising costs that could be passed on to consumers,” the report stated.

According to an interview by CNBC, PayPal has dismissed concerns that its US$2.2 billion takeover of European technology start-up iZettle could lead to higher prices for payment services and reduce competition.
The US-based fintech giant secured the largest acquisition in its history when it closed the deal for Swedish payments firm iZettle in September. However, Britain’s antitrust watchdog has since stated PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival.”
Speaking to CNBC’s Elizabeth Schulze at the Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland, on Tuesday, December 4, PayPal’s Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready said, “We absolutely believe that we will demonstrate that we are bringing more choice (and that) we are pro-competition.”
“We are really looking to expand the market in ways that are great for small business and great for consumers alike,” Ready said.

A federal judge raised the prospect of not approving CVS Health’s deal to buy insurer Aetna, which closed earlier this week, during a routine portion of the legal process.
Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia objected to what he said was the government’s and companies’ treatment of him as a “rubber stamp” for the deal, noting that CVS had closed its deal to buy Aetna for US$69 billion on Wednesday, November 28.
The judge, in a brief hearing Monday, said he’s considering requiring that the merged firm hold the CVS and Aetna assets separate until he has more time to consider the settlement. If he does so, it could cause considerable disruptions for the newly merged firm, as CVS began integrating Aetna’s assets immediately after the deal closed last week.
Aetna said in a statement, “It’s commonplace for acquisitions to close before this final step in the process is complete, and our focus remains on delivering on the combined company’s potential.” CVS did not return a request for comment.

According to the Financial Times, international exchange Eurex plans to appeal against the loss of a 15-year old lawsuit it brought against CME Group alleging the Chicago exchange had violated US antitrust laws to stop a rival venture from getting off the ground.
The group, the derivatives bourse of Deutsche Börse, filed a notice confirming its intention in an Illinois district court late on Friday, November 30. It is trying to overturn a judge’s ruling a month ago, which found against Eurex’s charge that the CME and its subsidiary, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), had broken rules in order to defend its home turf. Eurex declined to comment further.
The move will prolong a case which dates back to 2003, but which the CME had felt was over. At the time under scrutiny, CBOT was independent, but has now been owned by the CME for more than a decade. CME declined to comment on Eurex’s filing.

Lithium is a key component in the batteries that power everything from cellphones to electric vehicles.

Over the objections of AT&T and Time Warner’s merger, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has decided to permit 27 antitrust scholars to speak at a hearing later this week, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
This Thursday, December 6, the US government will continue its efforts to block the US$85 billion deal between AT&T and Time Warner. The merging parties have expressed confidence going into oral arguments before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and will likely be favored in their attempt to uphold a trial court’s determination that the tie-up isn’t enough of a competitive threat to be in violation of the Clayton Act.
Although AT&T closed the acquisition, it agreed to keep Time Warner’s cable networks in a business unit separate from AT&T’s communication assets for now, in case the government chose to appeal. The decision to allow new voices is somewhat extraordinary and perhaps a new reason for hope for the Justice Department (DOJ).
The scholars include, among others, Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, former DOJ antitrust chief A. Douglas Melamed, and Herbert Hovenkamp, who has authored a leading treatise on antitrust law.

Apple and Qualcomm have reached an impasse in the dispute regarding iPhone patent royalties, so a court date has been set by a federal judge in San Diego, for April 5, 2019. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that both sides have been unable to reach a settlement in the latest case between the tech companies.
Qualcomm has accused Apple of stealing its wireless technology and proprietary code and sharing it with rival chipmaker Intel who went on to be Apple’s exclusive chip maker for its latest range.
Qualcomm wanted to proceed to court earlier in February, however, the US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel set the April date, citing the complexity of the situation, and the need to “accommodate the court’s schedule.”
This suit is the latest in a slew of back and forth claims between Apple and Qualcomm. Most recently, Apple insisted that they were not in talks “at any level” with the chipset maker.

257,"December 2, 2018",‘The Curse of Bigness’ Review: Revisiting the Gilded Age,"
R. Epstein reviews “The Curse of Bigness” 

By Tim Wu
 
Before his 1916 appointment to the Supreme Court, Louis Brandeis was the nation’s most prominent critic of large concentrations of wealth and power. Brandeis coined the phrase “the curse of business” to express his outright hostility to monopoly power, which he equated with the bigness of the new industrial trusts in railroads, oil, steel and tobacco. Brandeis wrote that “competition is in no sense consistent with large-scale production and distribution”; that such monopolies are secured by “cut-throat competition, espionage, doing business as fake independents, the making of exclusive contracts”; and that America must place “ample power in a government board to aid the small man as against his mighty opponent.”
Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University’s law school, is Brandeis’s most avid contemporary disciple. In “The Curse of Bigness,” he borrows Brandeis’s impassioned rhetoric to express his fear that a new Gilded Age is upon us, with Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon appearing as the successors to the dominant trusts of more than 100 years ago. By blindly forgetting the lessons of history, we now face, in Mr. Wu’s words, “extreme economic concentration,” which “yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding an appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership.”
Mr. Wu writes with elegance, conviction, knowledge—and certitude. But he goes over the top in his ...

According to a report from Nikkei, Japan’s antitrust regulator will craft rules for cross-sector partnerships in high-tech fields like automated driving and connected devices, seeking to prevent monopolies on big data and intellectual property.
In planning conferences starting in December, the Japan Fair Trade Commission’s (JFTC) Competition Policy Research Center aims to clarify at what point inter-industry data sharing crosses the line into illegality. It aims to reach a conclusion as soon as the summer, with the JFTC expected to use the rules as the basis for new guidelines on antitrust law.
Having a clear set of rules is expected to prevent reorganizations by Japanese businesses from being hobbled, at a time when US information technology giants like Google and Amazon are enlarging themselves even further through cross-sector partnerships.

As part of its cooperation with a European Commission antitrust investigation, the company announced that it is likely to reach an agreement to pay a fine ranging from €37 million to €40.6 million (US$42.4 million to US$46.6 million), so it’s recording an estimated charge of €37 million (US$42.4 million), according to the release.
“The Company has already made certain changes to its business practices and agreements in response to these proceedings, and the Company believes that such changes have not had, and will not have, a material impact on its ongoing business operations within the European Union,” the press release stated.

Travel technology company Amadeus settled a lawsuit led by seven US flyers purportedly on behalf of the American ticket-buying public by agreeing to pay US$3 million in fees to plaintiff’s attorneys in return for no longer having to defend itself against the charges, stated a filing in New York federal court.
The suit alleged that Amadeus colluded with its peer companies Sabre and Travelport to wrangle advantageous content distribution contracts with airlines. The suit accused the three companies of strong-arming airlines into accepting excessive fees, which were passed along to US consumers via allegedly higher airfares.
The flyers filed their case in July 2015 with the hope of getting the lawsuit certified as a class action, representing all US ticket buyers in recent years. The seven flyers will get US$500 each out of the US$3 million settlement by Amadeus, while the plaintiffs’ attorneys get the rest.
In November 2018, the EU opened a similar antitrust case against Amadeus.

261,"December 2, 2018",EU: Vodafone’s US$22B Liberty Global deal to get full antitrust scrutiny,"

Vodafone’s proposed US$21.8 billion acquisition of Liberty Global’s assets in Germany and Eastern Europe is headed for a full EU antitrust probe, Reuters reported.
According to Reuters, the European Commission’s move could put pressure on the world’s second-largest mobile operator to offer concessions, unless it can convince the EU competition enforcer that the deal poses no competition issues.
The deal between Vodafone and US cable pioneer John Malone’s Liberty would enable Vodafone to better compete with Deutsche Telekom in the German rival’s home market.
The enlarged company would be Europe’s biggest provider of broadband, cable, and mobile services with 54 million customers and reach 110 million homes and businesses. The acquisition includes Liberty Global assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania.

December 2018
CPI EU News Column edited by Thibault Schrepel, Sam Sadden & Jan Roth (CPI) presents:
Apple/Shazam: Data Is Power, But Not A Problem Here By Nicolo Zingales (Sussex Law School)1
Introduction
Is there a significant impediment to effective competition where a major provider of music streaming services acquires a leading application for automatic music recognition, particularly insofar as the latter enables the identification and targeting of users of competing streaming apps? In Apple/Shazam,2 the European Commission answered this question in the negative, considering several ways in which the data collected through that application could lead to a competitive advantage. The Decision constitutes an important addition to the series of EU merger cases involving the use of customers’ personal data,3 as distinct from broader “big data” concerns.4
Facts
On March 14, 2018, the Commission received the notification of a concentration that would result in Apple’s acquisition of Shazam, a developer and distributor of music recognition apps for smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. The notification followed a referral pursuant to a request made on December 21, 2017 by the Austrian competition authority, to whom the acquisition was notified on December 12, 2017; competition authorities of seven more EEA Member States subsequently joined the request. On April 23, 2018, the Commission opened a Phase II investigation due to two distinct non-horizontal and non-coordinated effects:5 (a) the potential foreclosure of competing providers of automatic content recognition (“ACR”) software solutions as a result of conduct such as pre-installing Shazam on iOS, integrating Shazam with iOS, or degrading the interoperability of ACR solutions provided by Shazam’s competitors on iOS; and (b) the potential foreclosure of competing providers of digital music streaming apps as a result of Apple gaining access to commercially sensitive information on its rivals through the Concentration.
However, having conducted an in-depth investigation on the databases maintained by Apple Music, Apple Music’s competitors, and Shazam’s competitors and having examined several possible concerns arising from the concentration, the Commission concluded in its Decision on September 6, 2018 that the Transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in any of the following: (i) the licensing of music charts data at worldwide level, in the EEA or in any of the Referring States; (ii) online advertising services in any of the Referring States; (iii) digital music streaming apps in the EEA or in any of the Referring States; and (iv) ACR software solutions at worldwide level or in the EEA.
 
The Decision
The Decision takes a close look at the digital music industry, including digital music streaming services and ACR software solutions, and the role played by user data in generating insights, product development, and targeted advertising. It identifies five distinct relevant markets: (1) software solution platforms; (2) digital music distribution services; (3) ACR software solutions, including music recognition apps; (4) licensing of music data; and (5) online advertising.6 The Commission left open the possibility of further market segmentation, as there would be no impediment of effective competition under any of the plausible definitions. Nevertheless, what appears clear from the competitive assessment of these markets is that Apple has a considerable share (20-30 percent) both in software solution platforms and digital streaming apps; while Shazam has a prominent share (in excess of 30 percent) in the market for music recognition apps for smart mobile devices, and a more marginal position in the market for ACR software solutions (5-10 percent). Finally, although the investigation was inconclusive with regard to the market shares of the parties in the markets for licensing of music charts data and online advertising, the Commission confirmed in its investigation the existence of multiple alternative providers.7 That finding, along with the complementarity of the parties’ datasets, led to the conclusion that the merger would not give rise to horizontal effects.8
With regard to non-horizontal effects, the Commission considered potential foreclosure of competing providers of digital music streaming apps due to the acquisition of commercially sensitive information, compounded by two possible groups of practices that Apple could undertake post-Transaction, that is denial or degradation of access of Apple Music’s rivals to: (i) Shazam’s referral mechanism as a customer acquisition channel; (ii) Shazam’s referral mechanism as a functionality that boosts user engagement and enriches user experience; (iii) Shazam as an advertising tool; (iv) Shazam as a provider of in-app music recognition functionalities; (v) Shazam’s User Data as an input to improve existing functionalities, or offering additional functionalities, on music streaming services.
Thus, the first and main theory of harm reviewed by the Decision concerns the possibility that Apple would take advantage post-transaction of the information acquired by Shazam, including via its current API integration with Spotify, to derive commercially sensitive information. In particular, Apple could combine the Customer App Information (which includes information about the presence of non-pre-installed digital music streaming apps on the mobile device where Shazam is installed) with additional identifying information (such as email address, Facebook ID, mobile’s advertising ID, etc.) enabling it to draw up a list of customers of Apple Music’s and potentially target them with personalized offers. Here the Commission notes, “without prejudice to the assessment by competent data protection authorities” that such data aggregation seems to be permitted under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as Shazam’s terms of service “appear to inform” on the processing of the Customer Information processed by Shazam.9
Furthermore, Shazam is already able to access data about which apps are installed on a user’s Android device, because the Android Developer Guidelines allow all apps to do so. On the other hand, Spotify’s developer terms and conditions are quite stringent, imposing developers to: (i) only request from Spotify users the data they need to operate their app; (ii) not to email Spotify users without explicit consent; (iii) completely and accurately disclose the privacy practices and policies they apply on their app or website; and (iv) not use Spotify’s user data “in any manner to compete with Spotify.”10
Nevertheless, despite the existence of legal and contractual constraints on the use of Customer App Information, the Commission assessed whether the targeted advertising made possible by the combination of databases was likely to have negative impacts on effective competition, and concluded that it did not on three grounds.11 First, the ability to access the Customer App Information on Android is not limited to Shazam and would not be limited to Apple post-Transaction (unlike for iOS). Second, the market investigation clearly indicated that the digital music streaming service market in the EEA (and in the Referring States, including Iceland where Apple Music is active) has been growing considerably, and that there are already several providers with the capability of targeting “music enthusiasts.” Third, the Commission noted that Apple has stated its plans to change Shazam’s data collection practices in order to bring them in line with Apple’s industry-leading positions on privacy and, thus, to update the Shazam app for OSs other than Apple’s OSs so that it will “not send to Apple the Customer App Information unless the music streaming service of that user agrees to allow this information to be sent to Apple.”12
The second theory of harm contemplated by the Decision is one of denial and degradation of access by competitors to Shazam’s referral mechanism as a customer acquisition tool. The Commission here determined that, even if the merged entity were to have the technical ability and the incentives to engage in such practices, it is unlikely that they would have the ability to foreclose competing providers of digital music streaming apps and adversely affect competition.13 This is because Shazam’s market shares have not translated into a significant degree of market power. And in fact, given the low number of referrals for registration currently coming from Shazam, the effects of denial or degradation of access of competing providers of digital music streaming apps to Shazam’s referral mechanism are unlikely to be sufficient to reduce their ability or incentives to compete.
A third and related theory considered by the Decision concerns the denial and degradation of competitors’ access to Shazam’s referral mechanism as a functionality boosting engagement and enriching experience. Here again, the Commission notes that the merged entity would lack the incentives to foreclose competition simply because of Shazam’s limited market power,14 and the limited relevance of referral mechanisms in competition between digital music streaming apps. The Commission notes that already pre-Transaction, the referral tile to Apple Music has a more prominent position on iOS devices (due to an existing partnership between the merging parties), which has failed to produce significant results in user engagement. And in any case, nothing would prevent users, post-transaction, from “shazaming” songs and listening to them on rival digital music streaming apps.15
A fourth and important theory of harm in the Decision explores the possible “big data” advantage arising from the acquisition of Shazam: Shazam’s data could be exploited to improve existing functionalities, or offer additional functionalities, on digital music streaming apps. Here, the Commission concludes that Shazam User Data does not appear to be unique and, thus, be able to confer a significant “data advantage” to Apple post-Transaction.16 The Commission’s assessment is based on an in-depth investigation of data available on users of digital music services using four relevant big data metrics: that is the variety of data composing the dataset; the speed at which the data are collected (velocity); the size of the data set (volume); and the economic relevance (value). In particular, it finds that Shazam’s data are not more comprehensive than other datasets available in the market, they are generated at a lower speed and with lower per user engagement, and have never been considered as a strategic asset by the merging parties.
A fifth theory of harm was that Shazam could be used to serve more effective ads, for instance through push notifications that promote Apple Music on Android devices. However, this theory was quickly dismissed on grounds that Shazam’s strength in the advertising market is relatively low; and that users always remain free to choose not to receive any of the notifications in question.17
Yet perhaps the most elaborate theory of harm examined by the Commission has to do with the possible foreclosure of competing providers of ACR software solutions, including music recognition apps, by the adoption of two different types of strategies: first, by providing different levels of integration of ACR functionalities between Apple Music apps and competing digital music streaming apps; second, by leveraging of Apple’s strong market position in other products or services, most notably in the hardware space.
The Commission rejects the first scenario, noting the existence of several alternative ACR providers, and endorsing the view gathered during the investigation that the concentration may have the positive effect of encouraging digital music distributors to partner with providers of ACR technology.18
As to the second scenario, the Commission acknowledges the theoretically possible impact on competition of the following three practices: (a) pre-installation of the Shazam app on Apple’s PCs, smart mobile devices, and other platforms; (b) deeper integration of Shazam’s app on Apple’s products and services; and (c) reduction of interoperability between Apple’s products and services (and, specifically, Apple devices’ microphone) and third parties ACR apps and software solution.19 However, it finds the concerns not to be merger-specific, as there is already a partnership and integration is in place between Apple Siri and Shazam’s ACR technology.20
Furthermore, preventing hardware integration by competing ACR software solutions providers would be against Apple’s interest to have a multitude of apps in its ecosystem, ultimately affecting its competitiveness vis à vis other platforms.21 In any case, the Commission rules out any likely competitive impact of such integration in light of the fact that the parties do not have a sufficiently strong position in the market, respectively, for ACR software solutions platforms and ACR software solutions.22
 
Author Opinion
This Decision offers food for thought to the ongoing discussion on the reform of competition law in a data-driven environment.23 One takeaway is the difficulty of assessing market power in the presence of non-monetary pricing. The Commission also expresses discomfort in using market shares as a proxy for market power in fast-growing sectors characterized by frequent market entry and short innovation cycles,24 while also noting that Shazam is not a startup company and there is no history of disruptive entry or innovation.25 Absent from this discussion, however, is a hands-on examination of the ACR technology and business models, which could have arguably shed light on the relative quality of the products offered by competitors and the scope for entry.
First, the Decision only provides an introduction to the technology in question, distinguishing between fingerprinting and watermarking: in the former, quality depends on algorithms extracting recognizable data for audio signals and a large reference database, which is built upon the source fingerprints given by music labels and music streaming or download service providers and music aggregators. In the latter, quality depends on algorithms aimed at inserting data into the audio signal, and a smaller reference database that is likely to require closer cooperation with music publishers and record companies. While we are told that providers of ACR software solutions rely on both technologies, it appears difficult to assess the effects of the concentration without a clear picture of the relative importance of those algorithms and reference databases. This is disconcerting as ACR software solutions are destined to become crucial gatekeepers for the flow of information in the EU, particularly in light of recent legislative and policy proposals to require the adoption of on the installation of content recognition technologies to prevent the circulation of illegal content.
Second, a measurement of market power as the ability to reduce quality in this market can hardly overlook the significance of in-service advertising. This arguably implies the need for an assessment of the elasticity of demand in reaction to an increase in advertising, and of the frequency and intensity of advertising across providers of ACR software solutions. It is somewhat disappointing that, although the Commission perceives the existence of a problem with its estimation of market power, it fails to conduct the holistic inquiry that would enable it to reach more solid conclusions. This is all the more problematic considering that Shazam’s limited market power was a core reason for dismissal of the second, third, and sixth of the above-mentioned theories of harm.
Another aspect worth noting in this Decision is the interaction of competition and other policy goals. Specifically, one of the concerns that led the Commission to open a second phase investigation was inextricably linked to data protection law: would it be possible for Apple to use information collected through Shazam in order to identify customers of Apple Music’s rivals, and ultimately target them with advertising or marketing campaigns? While data protection law does not a priori prevent such targeting, the assessment in that context depends on the specific conditions of processing of personal data, including its transparency and the safeguards available to data subjects.
The Commission did not conduct such detailed assessment, however,26 which could potentially mean that by approving a concentration that raises data protection concerns it failed to fulfill its duty to protect EU Charter rights. For this reason, a welcome development in connection with this Decision is the effort by the European Data Protection Board to initiate inter-institutional dialogue, through an unprecedented statement issued during the investigation calling for the consideration of the data protection and privacy interests of individuals where one or more companies have accumulated “significant informational power.”27
In line with recent initiatives by the European Data Protection Supervisor,28 the Statement goes beyond data protection: it demands the assessment of “longer-term implications for the protection of economic, data protection and consumer rights whenever a significant merger is proposed, particularly in technology sectors of the economy.”29
Whether the European Commission and other competition authorities are indeed ready to take that challenge remains to be seen. In this regard, it is worth exploring the suggestion made in the Statement that such assessment be “separate to and independent from, or integrated into, the competitive analysis.” Should a digital rights impact assessment be one of the measures proposed in the reform package for competition law in the digital age? If so, what form should it take? Given the competition authorities’ lack of competence in making data protection determinations, this would arguably require the institutionalization of a dedicated cooperation mechanism between digital regulators.30

263,"November 29, 2018",US: 14 orgs tell Congress why T-Mobile and Sprint merger should be blocked,"

T-Mobile and Sprint’s proposed merger has seen pushback from various groups. One in particular, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), is concerned the deal could mean up to 30,000 lost jobs. Now, 14 organizations including Consumer Reports, CWA, and the American Antitrust Institute have shared with the House of Representatives why they believe the deal shouldn’t be allowed and also called for hearings on the merger proposal.
On Wednesday, November 28, leaders from the 14 organizations sent a letter to Congressmen Jerrold Nadler and Frank Pallone, who are the ranking members on the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Energy & Commerce, respectively. The letter shares arguments for why the T-Mobile and Sprint merger should be blocked and also asks for hearings on the potential impacts of such a deal.
The organizations include:


American Antitrust Institute


Center for Media Justice


Common Cause


Communications Workers of America Consumer Reports


Fight for the Future


Free Press Action


The Greenlining Institute


National Consumer Law Center, on behalf of its low income clients


New America’s Open Technology Institute


Open Markets Institute


Public Knowledge


Rural Wireless Association Writers


Guild of America West


The concerns range from job losses, it being an anti-competitive and anti-consumer deal, to even incentivizing Verizon, AT&T, and the new T-Mobile to “collude.”

264,"November 29, 2018",Germany: Antitrust regulator opens probe into Amazon,"

The Federal Cartel Office, Germany’s antitrust authority, has rolled out an inquiry into Amazon and whether or not it is using its dominance in the market to harm third-party retailers that sell products through its website as a marketplace member.
According to a report in Reuters citing the regulator, the Federal Cartel Office announced Thursday, November 29, that it has received “many” complaints requesting regulation of the business practices that Amazon has been engaging in recently. “Amazon acts as a kind of ‘gatekeeper’ to customers. The double role as biggest trader and biggest marketplace means there is a potential to impede other traders on the platform,” said cartel office President Andreas Mundt, according to Reuters. Mundt said the inquiry will look at the business rules Amazon imposes on traders that use the site, including the lack of transparency over terminating the contract, delaying payments, and the shipping conditions the marketplace merchants contend with. Reuters noted Germany is the second largest market for Amazon outside of the US In Germany, Amazon has long battled with unions over pay and the regulation of conditions for logistics workers, noted the report. Reuters noted that the Federal Cartel Office is also investigating social media giant Facebook after discovering that it gathered data on people without their consent by using its market dominance.
Earlier this week, after two years on the market, reports surfaced that Amazon will ...

265,"November 29, 2018",US: Hospital merger passes final regulatory hurdles,"
A proposed merger between Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Lahey Health, and three other health systems received the final state and regulatory hurdles Thursday, November 29, clearing the way for a deal first announced two years ago. Once finalized, the merger will create the state’s second largest healthcare system after Partners HealthCare in size.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said her office would not sue to block the merger to form Beth Israel Lahey Health System, but she would place certain restriction on the deal. The restrictions include what Healey called an “unprecedented” seven-year cap on prices charged by the combine system.
Also on Thursday, the US Federal Trade Commission announced it had decided not to file a lawsuit blocking the merger. In a statement, the agency described the decision to not sue as a “close call.”

266,"November 29, 2018",Japan: Prosecutors will hold Ghosn as long as needed,"
Japanese prosecutors said Thursday, November 29, they will detain former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn for as long as is needed to finish their investigation into suspicions of financial irregularities, as the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance reaffirmed its partnership.
Shin Kukimoto, deputy chief prosecutor for the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office, defended its handling of Ghosn, who was arrested on November 19 along with another Nissan executive, Greg Kelly.
“We are not detaining (Ghosn) for an unnecessarily long time,” Kukimoto told reporters. “We only take necessary steps as needed.”
Kukimoto refused to confirm reports that both Ghosn and Kelly have denied the allegations against them. Ghosn is suspected of violating financial laws by underreporting millions of dollars in income and Kelly is suspected of collaborating in that. Nissan has also announced an internal probe triggered by a whistleblower found Ghosn allegedly misused company assets.

267,"November 29, 2018",Iceland: Icelandair and WOW merger cancelled,"

Icelandair announced on Thursday, November 29, it had scrapped its all-share deal to buy WOW Air that had aimed to create a stronger international competitor, sending its shares down 10%.
Privately-held Wow Air, which has been reducing the size of its fleet and announced its cash flow was under pressure due to stricter terms from creditors and lessors, stated it was looking at other opportunities but did not give details.
Scrapping the merger follows the collapse in October of Icelandic-owned and Copehagen-based Primera Air, highlighting intense industry competition that has also driven Air Berlin and Britain’s Monarch Airlines out of business.
The failure of the merger could also knock Iceland’s economy, which has become increasingly reliant on tourism. The central bank has expressed concerns about WOW Air’s financing have been weighing on the krona in recent weeks.
“The planned acquisition of Icelandair Group of WOW Air will not go through,” Bogi Nils Bogason, interim president and CEO of Icelandair Group, said in a statement. “This conclusion is certainly disappointing.”

269,"November 28, 2018",UK: Viagogo and regulator settle in court,"
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched legal action against Viagogo in August over concerns it was breaking consumer protection law.
The court stated Viagogo must tell buyers which seat they will get and if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door.
In a Twitter post, Viagogo described it as a “groundbreaking settlement.”
In a statement, CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the court order was a “victory for anyone who decides to buy a ticket through Viagogo.”
The court order means Viagogo will have to:


Tell ticket buyers if there is a risk they will be turned away at the door


Inform customers which seat they will get


Inform buyers who is selling the ticket


Make it easy for people to get their money back when things go wrong


Prevent the sale of tickets a seller does not own and may not be able to supply


Not give misleading information about the availability and popularity of tickets


Viagogo agreed to address all the CMA’s concerns, the regulator announced.
The company has to comply with the court order by mid-January, the same deadline set for other resale sites that have already agreed to change their practices, the regulator added.

270,"November 28, 2018",UK: CMA finds Experian/ClearScore merger could hamper competition,"
 

The UK’s antitrust watchdog has provisionally found that Experian’s takeover of ClearScore is likely to weaken competition in the credit reporting sector and have a negative effect on the services offered to customers.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) referred the proposed £275 million (US$352.9 million) takeover of ClearScore by Experian for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation in July, following initial fears the deal could results in UK consumers ultimately paying more for credit cards and loans.
As the two largest credit checking firms in the UK, the CMA believes that the effect of taking one of the firms out of the market would be to substantially reduce the pressure to continue to develop innovative offers and to make other improvements in services.
The CMA is now asking for views on these provisional findings by December 19, 2018. Potential remedies could include a ruling to sell off parts of the merged company’s business or an ultimate sanction to quash the deal. The statutory deadline for the CMA’s final report is March 11, 2019.

271,"November 28, 2018",EU: Facebook could face coordinated regulation by nine countries,"
Facebook could face coordinated regulation by nine countries after CEO Mark Zuckerberg refused to be questioned by an international committee on fake news.
According to a report in the Financial Times, members of parliaments from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Singapore, France, Belgium, and the UK said Facebook has lost the trust of the public, and peppered Facebook’s vice president of policy solutions Richard Allan with questions during a hearing in London after Zuckerberg refused to appear at the hearing.  Following the hearing, the members of parliaments signed a joint statement that read, “it is incumbent on us to create a system of global internet governance … and govern the major international tech platforms which have created the systems that serve online content to billions of users around the world,” reported the Financial Times.
Facebook has been facing increased scrutiny in recent weeks as scandals continue to emerge. Charles Angus, vice president of Canada’s House of Commons standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics, told Allan during the hearing that Facebook has lost the trust of the international community to police itself and that regulation is going to have to be looked at. “I would put it to you that the best regulation would be antitrust … Perhaps the simplest form of regulation would be to break Facebook up or treat it as a utility,” Angus said during the hearing. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported ...

The Swiss Competition Commission (Comco) announced an investigation into whether various Swiss financial firms agreed to boycott Apple Pay and Samsung Pay in order to protect rival mobile payments app, TWINT.
TWINT is a joint venture between: SIX; Worldline; and the six largest Swiss banks. Comco suspects that five financial firms—Aduno, Credit Suisse, PostFinance, Swisscard, and UBS—refused to allow their credit cards to be used with the rival mobile payments apps. Comco has conducted inspections at the offices of those companies, as well as at TWINT, although it is not under investigation.
Credit Suisse has cast doubt on the allegations, indicating that it already allows its customers access to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay via its subsidiary, Swisscard. UBS indicated that it had tried to reach an agreement with Apple Pay in 2016 without success. TWINT indicated that it has made its own antitrust complaint against Apple, which it alleges prevents the trouble-free use of TWINT on IOS devices.

274,"November 27, 2018",US: Trump wins dismissal of competition case,"
President Donald Trump defeated an antitrust lawsuit by a Washington wine bar that alleged that the opening of his Trump International Hotel in 2016 decimated its business by luring foreigners, fundraisers, and lobbyists away from the bar, reported Bloomberg.
Cork Wine Bar alleged that it lost customers because they felt compelled to drink, eat, and hold events at the president’s hotel, which is located about 1 1/2 miles away. Trump had argued that he can’t be sued while serving as president and is protected by the US Constitution from claims under the District of Columbia’s unfair-competition law.
US District Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington threw out the case on Monday, November 26, saying the bar didn’t show how Trump interfered with or hindered its business. The judge said that while Cork may claim that Trump and the hotel were trying to take advantage of competitive benefits of the president’s “heightened notoriety,” that is not “legally redressable wrong.”

275,"November 27, 2018","US: Amazon, Facebook recruit from the DOJ","
AT&T, Facebook, and Amazon are padding their antitrust expertise by poaching from the government, reported Bloomberg. All three tech giants have recently hired top Justice Department (DOJ) Antitrust Division lawyers.
The hirings could hinder the Department’s antitrust enforcement powers at a time when large tech companies’ market dominance is coming under greater scrutiny. But adding the government’s experts to their payrolls could help the companies self-check their exposure to antitrust risk, Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, told Bloomberg Law.
The Antitrust Division, in the last three months, lost three high-ranking officials to big tech firms. Bryson Bachman, senior counsel to Delrahim, left for Amazon. AT&T scooped up Brinkley Tappan, another counsel to Delrahim. Kate Patchen, chief of the aAntitrust dDivision’s San Francisco office, is now at Facebook.
The three officials “would help minimize anticompetitive conduct” at their new employers, Delrahim told Bloomberg Law. The companies can lean on the new employees to help boost their knowledge on compliance and antitrust risks, he said.
The departures aren’t “concerning,” Delrahim said. The division continues to employ “high caliber applicants and additions.”
DOJ staff, including heads of the Antitrust Division, typically leave government posts for in-house counsel roles or go on to powerhouse antitrust firms. For example, Christine Varney, th...

November 2018

Themes and Takeaways from the FTC Hearings on the Intersection of Big Data, Privacy, and Competition By Elena Kamenir (Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe)1
On November 6-8, 2018, the U.S. FTC held hearings on privacy, big data, and competition as a part of its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century series.2 The hearings covered a wide array of issues, including whether privacy concerns affect competition analysis, how to evaluate conduct and mergers involving big data, which remedies are appropriate to address antitrust harm involving certain datasets, and the policy recommendations and implications surrounding these issues. This article first summarizes common issues discussed on the panels. Although there was much consensus among panelists, differences emerged regarding the intersection of competition, privacy, and big data. This article concludes by outlining three issues on which antitrust and consumer protection practitioners will continue to focus on and debate.
 
Common Issues Discussed During the Hearings  

 What Makes Data Valuable? 

One of the threshold questions when analyzing the impact of big data is whether the data is valuable. Panelists generally agreed that the value of data is highly dependent on how the data will be used and analyzed. Florian Zettelmeyer identified three categories exemplifying how data analytics can be useful. Data analytics can: (1) enable business initiatives; (2) enable idea generation; an...

The company didn’t disclose the quantum of the settlement amount. “The settlements extend to all claims brought by the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs. The terms of the settlements are confidential,” Sun Pharma said in a statement to stock exchanges.
A group of direct purchasers sued Cephalon, Mylan, Teva and Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2006 for so-called “pay-for-delay” settlements in which brand-name drug makers pay their generic counterparts to keep drugs off the market.

280,"November 26, 2018",US: Justices skeptical of Apple in case about iPhone apps’ sales,"
The Supreme Court seemed ready Monday, November 26, to allow a lawsuit to go forward that claims Apple has unfairly monopolized the market for the sale of iPhone apps, reported Bloomberg Law.
The court heard arguments in Apple’s effort to shut down an antitrust lawsuit. Chief Justice John Roberts was alone among the nine justices who seemed prepared to agree with Apple.
The suit by iPhone users could force Apple to cut the 30% commission it charges software developers whose apps are sold exclusively through Apple’s App Store. A judge could triple the compensation to consumers under antitrust law if Apple ultimately loses the suit.
But the issue before the high court at this early stage of the suit is whether the case can proceed at all. Justice Stephen Breyer, who used to teach antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said the consumers’ case seemed straightforward and in line with a century of antitrust law.
Apple argues it’s merely a pipeline between app developers and consumers. The developers set the prices and agree to pay Apple a 30% commission on whatever they sell, the lawyer representing Apple said in the courtroom. According to Bloomberg quoting Daniel Wall, a lawyer for Apple, if anyone should be able to sue the Cupertino, California-based company, it’s a developer. “There have been plenty of disputes, not one has gone to litigation,” he said.
But Justice Elena Kagan said it appears that consumers have a direct relationship wit...

CVS Health and Aetna have received the final state approval they need to complete their roughly US$69 billion merger and now expect the deal to close “on or about” November 28, the companies announced Monday, November 26, in regulatory filings.
The companies had been expecting to finalize the merger by Thanksgiving. However, a handful of the 28 states CVS and Aetna needed approval from opposed the combination, claiming it would reduce competition and could leave consumers worse off.
CVS and Aetna announced the deal last December. The Department of Justice granted preliminary approval in October on the condition that CVS and Aetna removed overlap between their Medicare Part D plans. Aetna stated it would sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans for an undisclosed amount to ease the concerns.

PayPal, which closed the deal in September, could ultimately face pressure to unwind part of the transaction that centers on the companies’ businesses in the UK unless it addresses the concerns from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in that market.
“We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform,” a PayPal spokesman wrote in an emailed statement.

283,"November 26, 2018",South Korea: KFTC believes in revision to fair trade law,"
South Korea’s corporate watchdog chief said Monday, November 26, that the revision to the fair trade law is very important for the impartial implementation of the country’s antitrust rules.
“The revision is very important in that it would determine the implementation of the country’s competition law,” Kim Sang-jo, the chief of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), said in a forum.
The KFTC chief, however, said it would be very tough for the revision to be ratified by the parliament as there are still huge differences of opinions.
In August, the KFTC proposed the revision of the fair trade law, which will increase the number of conglomerate subsidiaries subject to inter-affiliate trading regulations by threefold.
The revision to the law also bans inter-affiliate trading within a business group whose founding family members hold over 20% stakes in both listed and unlisted companies, and over 50% in their affiliates.

284,"November 25, 2018",US: Top court hears Apple dispute,"
Apple will head to the US Supreme Court this week to block a group of customers from suing the tech giant for monopoly abuse, The Telegraph has reported.
The company is battling a group of iPhone owners who claim Apple forces them to overpay for apps by forbidding rivals to the multibillion-dollar App Store.After the customers won the right to launch a class action lawsuit against the company in 2017, Apple is now appealing to the Supreme Court to have the decision overturned, The Telegraph reported late on November 24.
If Apple fails, the business model of the App Store, one of the company’s fastest-growing and most profitable divisions, could be threatened, it added.
Apple makes billions each year by taking a 30% cut of apps sold through the App Store, which are created by developers. App revenues grew by around a third in 2017 to $38.5 billion even as sales of Apple’s iPhones and iPads stalled.
The customers argue that its sizeable commission is evidence of the company exploiting its monopoly position over iPhone users. They argue that “iPhone consumers nationwide have paid (Apple) hundreds of millions of dollars more for iPhone apps than they would have paid in a competitive market.”

The report stated that BMW becomes “the first global automaker to obtain such a license in the fast-growing market.” The report also stated said that “BMW Mobility Service, a fully owned subsidiary of the BMW Group, obtained its ride-hailing license in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in China’s southwest.”

286,"November 22, 2018",UK: Facebook fights fine for Cambridge Analytica scandal,"
Facebook plans to appeal a fine issued by the UK’s data watchdog in response to the social media site’s Cambridge Analytica scandal.
An estimated 1 million UK residents were affected by the scandal, which impacted 87 million Facebook users worldwide. Though there was no evidence that any of the UK users’ data was shared by third parties, the company was still hit last month with a US$644,600 fine in the UK after the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) ruled that the social media network operator was engaged in “serious breaches of data protection.”
“Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,” said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham at the time. “A company of its size and expertise should have known better, and it should have done better.”
However, Facebook will be filing an appeal against the ICO based on its claim that there is no evidence of UK users’ data being used.
“The ICO’s investigation stemmed from concerns that UK citizens’ data may have been impacted by Cambridge Analytica, yet they now have confirmed that they have found no evidence to suggest that information of Facebook users in the UK was ever shared … with Cambridge Analytica, or used by its affiliates in the Brexit referendum,” said Anna Benckert, Facebook’s EMEA VP and associate general counsel, according to reports. “Therefore, the core of the ICO’s argument no longer relates...

287,"November 22, 2018",US: DOJ said to be reviewing Anti-OPEC legislation,"
According to a report by Bloomberg, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is formally reviewing antitrust legislation aimed at reining in OPEC’s power over oil markets, according to a department official.
While the study is ongoing, there is an understanding that the oil cartel’s efforts to affect crude prices through production quotas has raised costs for American consumers, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That’s traditionally the type of conduct the DOJ would frown upon, the person said.
Bipartisan, anti-OPEC bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate, though neither chamber has voted on the measures yet.
The House Judiciary Committee in June approved the “No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act,” or NOPEC bill, which would give the US Attorney General the authority to file a suit against OPEC for trying to control oil production or to affect crude prices. It would amend the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the law used more than a century ago to break up the oil empire of John Rockefeller. A similar Senate bill hasn’t seen any action yet.

288,"November 22, 2018",US: Judge grants Qualcomm’s motion to streamline Apple suit,"

According to a report from Court House News, a federal judge dismissed claims by Apple involving a handful of Qualcomm’s patents in the ongoing dispute between the two technology giants over chipsets used in smartphones.
US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel dismissed 56 claims brought by Apple relating to nine of Qualcomm’s patents-in-suit at issue. The antitrust litigation accuses Qualcomm of monopolizing the chipset technology and overcharging the iPhone maker and its contract manufacturers for it.
Last month, Qualcomm’s attorney Evan Chesler told the judge Apple and its contract manufacturers, including Compal Electronics, owed billions in unpaid royalties for using the chipset technology.
Chesler said the dispute between the tech companies was not over individual patents owned by Qualcomm, but the licensing agreements entered into by the parties for use of Qualcomm’s portfolio of thousands of patents.
The FTC case dates back to January 2017 and accuses Qualcomm of forcing companies like Apple to buy its wireless chips in exchange for better patent royalty rates.

According to a report from Reuters, Visa and Mastercard have proposed lowering the fees merchants face when they accept payments from non-EU credit cards in a bid to settle a long-running EU antitrust investigation.
Even after the reduction, such fees—which are paid by merchants when they accept card payments and are a lucrative source of revenue for banks—will still likely be higher than those for EU cards, they say.
Visa, the world’s largest payments network operator, found itself in the European Commission’s crosshairs in August 2017, charged with subjecting the cards of foreign tourists to excessive fees when they used their cards in the EU.
The Commission’s charge against Mastercard dated from July 2015.

South Korea’s S-Oil Corp, Hyundai Oilbank, and Jier Shin Korea took part in a bid-rigging scheme that led to more than US$100 million in overcharges to the US military, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
The three companies were not named in filings in US federal court in Ohio that described a conspiracy that involved a total of six companies that overcharged US military bases in South Korea for fuel.
The South Korea bid-rigging investigation is part of a more aggressive effort by the US Justice Department (DOJ) to crack down on companies that defraud the US government on military contracts.
The court papers filed by the DOJ after it settled with three other companies last month named SK Energy; GS Caltex—50% owned by Chevron; and Hanjin Transportation. They agreed to pay a total of US$236 million in criminal fines and civil damages.
The DOJ estimated that the bid rigging occurred from about 2005 to 2016. The government procurement data site GovTribe stated that between 2008 and 2013, the major sellers of fuel to US military bases in South Korea were S-Oil, GS Caltex, SK Energy, Hanjin, Hyundai Oilbank, and Jier Shin Korea.
S-Oil Corp stated through a spokesperson that it was “unaware of any investigation.” S-Oil is partially owned by Aramco Overseas, according to both Aramco’s and S-Oil’s websites.
A spokesperson for Hyundai Oilbank acknowledged that it was under investigation, but declined further comment. A Jier Shin Korea spokesperson also ...

292,"November 21, 2018",US: Facebook recruits ex-DOJ antitrust pro,"
Facebook hired Kate Patchen, who headed the Justice Deptartment’s (DOJ) antitrust office in San Francisco, this month as associate general counsel for litigation matters.
Kate Patchen, who previously led the DOJ’s antitrust office in San Francisco, joined the social media group as an associate general counsel on litigation matters this month, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Patchen has worked at the Department of Justice for 14 years, during which time she has prosecuted a number of price-fixing cartel cases in the computer memory chip industry.
Ms Patchen’s appointment comes as technology companies grapple with a steady drumbeat of criticism from progressives, who argue companies such as Facebook are too big and should be broken up. Congressman David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who will chair the judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform, commercial, and antitrust law in January, has expressed some criticism over the size of Facebook.
He tweeted that Facebook shouldn’t be trusted any longer to regulate itself and said Congress “should get to work enacting new laws to hold concentrated economic power to account.”

294,"November 21, 2018",EU: Vestager wants “level playing field” after Brexit,"
On Tuesday, November 20, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that the EU’s 27 remaining Member States would remain very vigilant that Britain play by the same rules as Europe on business after Brexit.
Vestager, who has spearheaded Europe’s effort to keep tech giants in line with EU law, said that her teams have been working “very closely” with Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on the matter.
“From what we see, the UK economy will be integrated with other European businesses and this is why the level playing field is so important,” she told AFP in an interview.
“The UK may not be a member (of the EU) of course but you just don’t drift away thousands of kilometres (miles) and become another nation, you’re still Europe one way or another,” she said.
The Commissioner said this was especially pertinent on the Irish border backstop, the most sensitive topic in the negotiations that involves preventing a visible border between EU-member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland after the divorce.
In the draft agreement, both sides have agreed that under the backstop arrangement the UK must observe “level playing field” commitments on competition and state aid, as well as on environmental standards and tax.

295,"November 20, 2018",Japan: Ghosn arrest puts Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi merger at risk,"

The arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan, has put the spotlight on the fate of the alliance between the three giant car makers that he headed, reported the Financial Times.



Ghosn was the architect of a link up between Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi, the world’s second largest car manufacturing group. Nissan and Mitsubishi have already announced their intention to remove him as chairman of their firms, while the French government has announced he cannot remain chairman and CEO of Renault.
Ghosn is accused of underreporting compensation beginning in 2011, a year after Japan’s Financial Services Agency required listed companies to disclose executive salaries topping 100 million yen (US$880,000). Though Ghosn’s disclosed salary totaled 4.98 billion yen (US$44.2 million) over the next five years, he received around US$88 million, sources say.
Shareholders at subsequent annual meetings continued to raise issue, even over his disclosed pay, saying that Nissan could have averted some of its layoffs if Ghosn’s salary were trimmed. But Ghosn’s disclosed salaries remained high by Japanese standards, often referencing global industry standards.
Under these circumstances, “Misstatement of income constitutes betrayal of shareholders,” said Toshiaki Yamaguchi, an attorney with compliance issue expertise.

296,"November 20, 2018",UK: Sainsbury’s-Asda deal could hurt farmers?,"

The National Farmers Union (NFU) has warned that its members will feel the impact of any squeeze on suppliers that will result from the merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda, reported Reuters.
The organisation, which represents more than 55,000 farmers in England and Wales, made the remarks in a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is investigating the proposed merger of Britain’s second and third largest grocers. The NFU stated that while it believed “healthy competition is good, severe market disruption is a concern of our members’ ability to survive.”
The CMA is currently probing the deal and seeking views from interested parties.
In oral evidence to the CMA, the NFU’s head of food and farming Philip Hambling said farmers were concerned whether the combined group could deliver its proposed 10% saving for shoppers without passing the pressure on to farmers.
“At a time when farms are already facing intense price pressure, the prospect of a further squeeze on price leaves farmers concerned about the potential impacts on their businesses,” he said.
“Continually squeezing margins can take away the ability of the food and farming industry to invest and improve quality, range and sustainability,” added Hambling.
Sainsbury’s and Asda’s key argument is that the deal would lower prices and improve the customer offer of both brands, while allowing suppliers to grow their businesses.
Both grocers have stated they be...

China has given unconditional approval to Walt Disney’s US$71.3 billion planned takeover of large parts of 21st Century Fox, Disney announced on Monday, November 19.
The news drove the stocks of both companies higher as some on Wall Street had feared of complications in the approvals process.
The deal still requires regulatory approval from a number of nations around the world, but the unconditional green light from China represents a huge win for Disney.
Disney initially agreed in December to buy the majority of Fox for US$52.4 billion in stock. The deal at the time included Fox’s movie studios, networks National Geographic and FX, Star TV, and stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group and Hulu, as well as regional sports networks.
Disney secured conditional approval from the US Justice Department for the deal in June after agreeing to sell Fox’s 22 regional sports networks.

300,"November 19, 2018",Android Remedies: Tearing Down the Wall?,"
November 2018

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
Android Remedies: Tearing Down the Wall? By Simonetta Vezzoso (Trento University)1
Introduction
The control of abusive practices has long been touted as the most arduous area of competition law, fittingly compared to climbing Mount Everest.2 Once the anticompetitive practices have been proven, though, devising appropriate remedies might at times vividly recall the challenges posed by another mythical mountain, namely the K2. While not the highest mountain in the world, climbing the K2 is generally considered harder.
The two recent Google Decisions might well exemplify many of these difficulties. Following long and complex investigations, the European Commission (“Commission”) imposed on Google a whopping total fine of €6.7 billion. While Google has already applied for annulment of both infringement decisions, the antitrust eyeballs are now fixated on the respective remedial phases of the proceedings. Neither in the Google Shopping Case, nor in the Android Case, the Commission dictated a specific remedy but instead left it up to Google to propose measures that can effectively bring the infringements of Article 102 TFEU to an end.
The Google Shopping decision was issued in July 2017.3 The Android Decision has been announced on 18 July 2018, and while the public is still waiting for the pleasure of reading it, Google has already started implementing significant changes to the Android ecosystem as a consequence of its proposed remedies to the alleged anticompetitive practices.
The legal framework for remedies to abuses of dominance under EU law is set by Council Regulation 1/20034 and the relevant case law. The Commission can impose behavioral or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed. Moreover, the purpose of a remedy in an infringement decision is “to bring the infringement effectively to an end.” When it comes to effectiveness, it is of course a matter of degree. A remedy worth its name should at the very least put an end to the types of conduct considered abusive. Put differently, the dominant undertaking should be prevented from continuing to engage in the future in the conduct that has been found to be abusive (the “sin no more” remedy). While this is obviously crucial, a more comprehensive and effective remedy should also consider stopping the effects of the abusive behavior and therefore, truly eliminating the consequences of the competition law infringement. This would require restoring the competitive process that would have prevailed but for the abusive practice(s). This does not mean trying to go back in time, especially in rapidly changing markets. Efforts should be made, however, to ensure that the market is as competitive as it would have been, if not for the legal violation. Depending on the circumstances of the case, this could mean re-creating the conditions for smaller competitors to compete and innovate. In the most extreme scenarios, structural remedies could be necessary, like divesting parts of the business of the dominant undertaking to substitute for the competitive threat successfully eliminated by the abusive practices of that dominant undertaking. The undeniable challenge here is how to construct a suitable counterfactual. While difficult, this should not be a suitable excuse for tying one’s hands and not engaging the enforcer’s best efforts aimed to the accomplishment of the all-important task of restoring the competitive process in the interest of consumers. This is also to avoid a dangerous externality in the form of the otherwise credible message that infringing competition law pays, especially in winner-takes-all markets.5
 
The little we know about the Android remedies
Competition Commissioner Vestager made clear that Google was required to bring the conduct effectively to an end within 90 days of the decision.
At a minimum Google has to stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices considered abusive, namely the tying practices, the exclusivity payments and the obstruction to the development of Android forks.6 “In other words,” explains the Commissioner “our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can pre-install on Android devices, or which Android operating system they can adopt.” Moreover, the Decision imposes Google an obligation “to refrain from any measure that has the same or an equivalent object or effect as the practices found abusive”.7  Finally, the Commission specifies that the “decision does not prevent Google from putting in place a reasonable, fair and objective system to ensure the correct functioning of Android devices using Google proprietary apps and services, without however affecting device manufacturers’ freedom to produce devices based on Android forks.”
If the Google Shopping Decision can serve here as a template8, Google in the Android case had until the end of September (60 days) to come up with a remedy proposal. After that, it is realistic to suppose that a number of substantial exchanges between the Commission and Google took place.9 On 28 October 2018 Google started implementing its chosen remedy.
Following Google’s public announcement illustrating the core of the proposed remedies on 16 October 201810, many external commentators have strongly criticized them (but the complainants in the Android Case have remained remarkably quiet).11
Google’s public announcement focuses on a series of changes to the contracts with device manufacturers. First, Google unbundles the Google Search and the Chrome browser apps from the group of other Google mobile applications (G-Suite). This means that, for instance, if the device manufacturer decides to install Google Play (Android’s app store) on her devices, she does not need to install Google Search and Chrome. She is required, however, to install the other apps comprised in the G-suite.
What has also attracted much attention, and early criticism, is another aspect of Google’s proposed remedy package, namely Google’s intention to introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets wanting to use Google mobile applications. As Google puts it, “(s)ince the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we will introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped into the EEA.” How much handset manufacturers will have to pay is still unclear. According to documents purportedly seen by some journalists, Google will charge handset makers wishing to use its mobile application package as much as $40 in Europe, depending on the country and the device’s pixel density. Fees would apply to devices activated on or after February 1, 2019.12
On the other hand, the Google Search app and Chrome will be licensed separately and do not foresee a licensing fee. At the same time, Google offers new commercial agreements to device manufacturers for the non-exclusive pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome. In its offering to device manufacturers Google will now compete with app developers in the browser and search markets. This means that a device manufacturer can choose, based on a number of commercial considerations, to pre-install browsers and search apps alternative to Google Search and Chrome, like for instance Bing, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Firefox Focus, Samsung Internet, Microsoft Edge, Puffin and Opera.
Another modification in the contracts with handset manufacturers relates to the forking restriction. Manufacturers selling handsets that carry the G-suite may also build and distribute forked smartphones. This means, for instance, that Samsung, Motorola, Sony, HTC, LG could start offering Android forks. In this respect, the Commission wrote that it had “found evidence that Google’s conduct prevented a number of large manufacturers from developing and selling devices based on Amazon’s Android fork called ‘Fire OS.13’”
Besides the modifications to the contracts with handset manufacturers succinctly described by Google in its blog post, further bits and pieces of a broader reshuffling of the Android ecosystem are starting to emerge from the ever attentive business press. Thus, for instance, Google will be offering in the European Play Store ‘Google Voice Action Services’. While this app shares the same voice-based capabilities of Google Assistant, it does not provide any web search capability. Users who buy devices from handset manufacturers that do not pre-install Search will still be able to use it.14 It is also interesting that Google is introducing for the first time into its contracts with handset manufacturers the requirement that manufacturers install security patches in a timely matter. It is not clear, however, if the contracts foresee penalties if manufacturers fail to meet Google’s security requirements.15
Of castles and fortresses
For all the current digital hype, the Android case brought by the European Commission is still largely Old School. In particular, the conduct considered anticompetitive by the EU competition enforcer was not embedded in complex code, or black boxes, but was in rather plain sight, namely in the written contracts between Google and device manufacturers.
One of the possible narratives of the theory of harm in the Android case is that Google built a moat around its castle, the search engine, and that some of the tactics and constructions employed were abusive under Article 102 TFEU. Some of those tactics, apparently, comprised extending the fortification to reinforce the castle’s defences.16 Restoring competition in the markets affected by the abusive types of conduct would seem to require reducing some of those defences, like lowering the walls of the fortress,17 including lowering barriers to entry. While promoting competition and innovation within the ecosystem, this could benefit some actual or potential competitors of Google. The fact that these competitors may or may not choose to take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by the remedies is not in the competition enforcer’s control, especially in fast moving digital markets. In some instances, however, the fact that new competition does not emerge and grow is a clear indication that the remedy package could have been better engineered. Ideally, consumers should benefit directly from remedies carefully devised to increase competition and choice, and not only from the overall “distraction” that antitrust enforcement causes to the dominant undertaking.18
The Google Cases, as well as the still to these days passionately debated Microsoft Cases19,make it abundantly clear that, going forward, the remedial phase of a competition law proceeding deserves increased attention.
For once, remedies need to be proportionate, meaning among other things that they must be suitable in addressing the harm at issue.20 In markets where technology changes rapidly, however, addressing the “harm at issue” is rarely straightforward. Thus, for instance, an adequate remedy21 in these markets is necessarily forward-looking, and directly addressing the harm as it materialized in a drastically different technological environment is unlikely to be effective. In this respect, an intrinsic tension may emerge between remedies that are proportionate, or suitable, in the sense that they address the conduct that is found to be illegal, and remedies that are truly effective in restoring competition. This is especially the case in today’s entrenched digital markets, where attacks that do not merely weaken the fortress defenses but that may be successful in breaching the walls of the fortress are notoriously rare.22 This is another significant, albeit often disregarded, way in which competition law is challenged in the era of digitization.
A further remedy-related aspect that needs careful attention is that the two engines driving the current economic and societal changes, namely software and data, are highly malleable and transformative. It follows that competition authorities might encounter serious difficulties in devising mechanisms allowing for their full potential to be preserved in the interest of consumers, while providing effective remedies against anticompetitive practices. Moreover, there might be an ever increasing information asymmetry between high tech-savvy undertakings and competition enforcers, entailing a serious risk of successful strategizing and gaming by the former, especially in the remedial phase. Understandably, competition authorities are reacting to this and other new challenges by increasing their in-house technological competence. This not only might improve the detection of anticompetitive behavior, but also strengthen later phases of competition enforcement, including the restoration of competitive processes where their functioning has been hampered by anticompetitive effects.

Jeff Bezos has declared that Amazon is “not too big to fail,” in an all-hands meeting of the company’s staff held last Thursday, November 15, at the firm’s base in Seattle.
“I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt,” the billionaire said, replying to an employee who asked him about the company’s future, in relation to the bankruptcies of big US retailers such as Sears.
“If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.”
Bezos said that the goal was to delay the inevitable for as long as possible — and that the way to do that was to focus on customers.
“If we start to focus on ourselves, instead of focusing on our customers, that will be the beginning of the end … We have to try and delay that day for as long as possible,” he said.
Several Amazon employees who spoke with CNBC on the condition of anonymity said government regulation and potential antitrust violations were “big concerns” when looking to the future of the company.
“It’s a fact that we’re a large company,” Bezos said in the recording heard by CNBC. “It’s reasonable for large institutions of any kind, whether it be companies or governments, to be scrutinized.”

Siemens and Alstom announced on Friday, November 16, they will not seek a hearing in front of European Union regulators to address antitrust concerns about their planned rail merger.
The companies have the right to a formal hearing, but announced in a joint statement that they had submitted written answers in response to queries from the European Commission about the merger.
They stated they were now focusing on “ongoing constructive discussions” to address concerns raised by the Commission.
Germany’s Siemens and France’s Alstom, the maker of the TGV high speed train, agreed last year to merge their rail operations, creating a company with €15 billion (US$17.1 billion) in revenue and a workforce of 62,000.
Siemens and Alstom announced the planned rail merger in September last year, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, but criticized by opposition politicians amid fears of French loss of control of the TGV high-speed train.

304,"November 18, 2018",UK: CMA closes pharmacy cartel,"
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has decided to close its investigation into the alleged anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices in relation to generic pharmaceutical products.
The watchdog announced  its decision is based on administrative priority grounds. The authority further stated that it has not reached a view on whether there is sufficient evidence of an infringement of competition law for it to issue a statement of objections to the parties under investigation.
“This decision does not amount to a statement or finding as to whether the party to the investigation has infringed competition law, nor should any inference be made to that effect,” the authority announced in the closure statement.
The CMA launched the investigation on October 10, 2017, and expanded the scope in July this year, amid the backdrop of rising generics prices that affected community pharmacies hard.

305,"November 18, 2018",Australia: Antony Catalano tries to stop Fairfax Nine merger,"
Former Domain CEO Antony Catalano has thrown in an eleventh hour attempt to stop the merger of Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media, but is not interested in making a full takeover bid for the publisher.
Mr Catalano wrote to Fairfax chairman Nick Falloon on Sunday night, November 18, with a proposal to buy 19.9% of the publisher and prevent its merger with Nine. He has asked for a meeting of shareholders, due to take place on Monday, to be delayed so shareholders can consider his offer, which is conditional on the merger being defeated and him being given a seat on the Fairfax board.
“The timing is not a deliberate attempt to disrupt the deal at the last minute,” Mr Catalano told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age late on Sunday. He said that when the share price was higher, the deal was “good” but at the current 61.6¢ it was “a terrible deal.”

Recent Developments at DG Competition: 2017/2018
By Andrea Amelio, Gabor Koltay, Penelope Papandropoulos & Hans Zenger (European Union), Thomas Buettner, Cyril Hariton (Toulouse Business School), Geza Sapi (European Commission) & Tommaso M. Valletti (Imperial College Business School)
The Directorate General for Competition at the European Commission enforces competition law in the areas of antitrust, merger control, and state aids. This year’s article provides first a general presentation of the role of the Chief Competition Economist’s team and surveys some of the main achievements of the Directorate General for Competition over 2017/2018. The article then reviews: the Google Search (Shopping) case, the role of price discrimination in state aid cases; and the use of counterfactuals in merger cases where alternative transactions might have occurred absent the merger.

307,"November 15, 2018","US: FCC asks for comment on Sprint, T-Mobile deal","


In September, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) paused the clock on the 180-day review period for T-Mobile and Sprint’s merger plans and asked for more documentation. The FCC is now asking the public to weigh in on the matter.
As noted by the FCC, the latest filing includes new data and a “substantial body of new material.”
On November 6, 2018, the Applicants filed a new econometric study with the Commission. The new study describes itself as a “merger simulation offer[ing] an economically coherent framework, grounded in detailed industry data, for understanding the competitive significance of the proposed merger.” The analysis represents a substantial body of new material on economic issues central to the review of the proposed transaction. It relies on a newly submitted data set and new methodologies to reach conclusions about the specific effects of the transaction not previously in the record.
The 180-day clock has been paused at 55 days into the review since September 11, but will resume once the comment period is closed.
Some progress in favor of the merger deal came two weeks ago as T-Mobile’s parent company voted for the deal as the majority shareholder of the telecom.

308,"November 15, 2018",US: Atrium Health and DOJ settle antitrust suit,"
Atrium Health has agreed to end what the federal government claimed are anticompetitive steering restrictions in contracts between commercial health insurers and its providers in the Charlotte, North Carolina service area, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced.
If the settlement is approved by a federal judge, it will end two years of civil antitrust litigation that challenged Atrium’s alleged use of steering restrictions that prevented health insurers from promoting cost-effective healthcare services to consumers, the DOJ stated.
“Competition encourages healthcare providers to reduce costs, lower prices, and increase quality,” said Makan Delrahim, Assistant US Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. “Atrium’s steering restrictions interfered with the competitive process, resulting in fewer choices and higher costs for consumers.”

British packaging group DS Smith gained EU antitrust approval on Wednesday, November 14, for its €1.9 billion(US$2.2 billion) purchase of Spanish rival Europac after agreeing to sell production plants in Portugal and France, reported Reuters.
DS Smith announced its biggest-ever acquisition in June to cement its market position in France and make it the number two player in Spain. It is the latest deal in an industry which has seen growing demand from online retailers.
The European Commission stated DS Smith’s offer to sell a Europac production plant in Portugal and two of its own facilities in France addressed its concerns that the deal would reduce competition in corrugated sheets and cases in Portugal and western France.

European Algorithmic Antitrust and Resale Price Maintenance: Asus, Denon & Marantz, Philips, and Pioneer Decisions By Dr. Aurélien Portuese (St Mary’s University London)1

On February 2, 2017, the European Commission announced the launch on its own initiative of three sets of investigations into suspected anticompetitive behavior in online commerce.2 The three sectors inquired have been (i) consumer electronics manufacturers; (ii) video games publishers; and (iii) hotels and tour operators’ price discrimination. As of the November 2018, the consumer electronics manufacturers sector is the first sector to be fined with an amount totaling €111 million for the companies Asus, Denon & Marantz, Philips, and Pioneer, following a press release on July 24, 2018.3 Since the Yamaha decision of 2003,4 it is the first time the European Commission has fined companies on the basis of resale price maintenance as prohibited by Article 101 TFEU.
Four Decisions for Algorithmic Resale Price Maintenance
All decisions, except Denon & Marantz, have been closed as of November 7, 2018.5 All decisions concerned vertical restraint instances wherein defendant companies relied upon “fixed or minimum resale price maintenance (RPM)”6 in order to restrict “the ability of their online retailers to set their own retail prices for widely used consumer electronics products such ...

311,"November 14, 2018",US: Amazon moves into DC and NYC,"

Amazon picked America’s financial and political capitals for massive new offices on Tuesday, November 13, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, DC.
The world’s largest online retailer plans to spend US$5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than US$2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more.
The online retailer’s decision to expand into New York and Arlington, is part of a larger initiative to extend its reach further into grocery, drones, entertainment and defense contracting services reported Bloomberg Government.
“Both for the economic reasons and networking reasons, it’s a very strong influence-peddling strategy,” said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the watchdog group Public Citizen. “That’s why they’re here. I don’t think they would be here for any other reason.”
“By locating one of their headquarters in this vicinity, they become a major player [and] a major contributor to the economy here. That becomes a valuable tool for peddling influence,” he said. “Instead of having to fly out from Seattle, they’re here, and they’re networking with everybody.”
Last year, Amazon convinced regulators that its purchase of Whole Foods would be a positive development in the grocery marketplace.

312,"November 14, 2018",UK: SSE admits “some uncertainty” over Npower merger,"
Energy firm SSE has admitted there is “some uncertainty” that its merger with rival Npower will go ahead. The announcement comes after the companies delayed the tie-up due to the incoming energy bill price cap of £1,137 (US$1,471) a year for “typical usage.”
It means suppliers will have to cut the price of their default tariffs to the level of the cap or below it.
The SSE-Npower merger, which has been cleared by the British competition regulator, would create the UK’s second-biggest energy company. However, Perth-based SSE has revealed it has been hit by widened losses for its household gas and electricity supplier.
SSE announced an update on the discussions would be disclosed by mid-December. But it added: “There is now some uncertainty as to whether this transaction can be completed, as originally contemplated.
“Nevertheless, the board believes that the best future for SSE energy services, including its customers and employees, will continue to lie outside the SSE group.”

Walmart announced on Tuesday, November 13, that Binny Bansal, the CEO of Flipkart, the Indian eCommerce company Walmart recently acquired, has resigned effective immediately.
In a press release, Walmart announced that while Bansal has been an important part of Flipkart since co-founding the company, recent events caused the risk of a distraction; as a result, he has made the decision to step down. According to Walmart, the decision comes after an independent investigation done on behalf of Flipkart and Walmart into claims of “serious personal misconduct.” Walmart stated Bansal strongly denies the claims.
“Nevertheless, we had a responsibility to ensure the investigation was deliberate and thorough. While the investigation did not find evidence to corroborate the complainant’s assertions against Binny, it did reveal other lapses in judgement, particularly a lack of transparency, related to how Binny responded to the situation,” Walmart wrote in the statement. “Because of this, we have accepted his decision to resign.”
Walmart went on to note that Bansal had been contemplating a move for some time and that he has been working with the company to devise a succession plan. Those efforts have now been accelerated.
Going forward, Kalyan Krishnamurthy will continue to be CEO of Flipkart, which will now include Myntra and Jabong, continuing to operate as separate platforms within the Flipkart business. Ananth Narayanan will continue providing leadership as CEO o...

314,"November 13, 2018",US: Pentagon official: “No fundamental concern” over defense consolidation,"
On Tuesday, November 13, DOD Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions Ellen Lord told Reuters that the government is still reviewing a merger of Harris Corp and L3 Technologies, but that she had no fundamental concerns about further consolidation in the US defense sector.
Ms. Lord said that the Defense Department is carrying out a detailed process together with antitrust authorities to determine if the proposed merger would “be problematical in terms of the competitive landscape.”
“We’re working through the process. We look at deals based on the individual merits,” Lord said on the sidelines of a NATO industry conference. She added that the CEOs of both companies had contacted her about their plans “very professionally” before announcing the deal.
For years, the Pentagon discouraged consolidation among top-tier contractors while welcoming deals from smaller players. In 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter warned that further consolidation in the weapons industry could lead to higher costs, decreased innovation, and less competition just days after Lockheed Martin’s US$9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft was approved by regulators.

On Tuesday, November 13, Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division chief Makan Delrahim spoke on CNBC and, among other comments, responded to questions regarding President Trump’s tweets attacking Comcast and Amazon accusing the companies of antitrust violations. The most recent tweet came on Monday, November 12, supporting the American Cable Association’s letter to the DOJ requesting an investigation into Comcast’s alleged antitrust violations.
“… these types of concerns raised about Amazon are bipartisan. And Senators raise them, the president has raised it. It’s—again, I think it’s great that we have such a debate about free markets and the antitrust laws there to protect the free markets. As far as what we do in our enforcement, you know, we need the evidence, we need the economics, we go to court. And politics, you know, that goes on between various aspects of the government don’t affect our decisions to make these cases,” Delrahim said.
Additionally, when asked about the DOJ returning to court to try to stop the Time Warner AT&T merger, Delrahim responded, “The Court of Appeals in D.C. will be hearing the oral arguments December 6th. The parties, we had agreed with them to hold the Turner assets separate until the end of February and so they’re supposed to be running that business a little bit separately so that in the event the court of appeals overturns the district court’s decision as we argued—and I think ...

317,"November 12, 2018",US: DOJ pressured to probe Comcast over antitrust violations,"

The American Cable Association (ACA), a lobbying group for midsize cable operators, sent a letter to the Department of Justice demanding an investigation into Comcast over alleged antitrust violations committed by company. The letter was addressed to Makan Delrahim, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, and a hawk on antitrust issues.
The ACA claims Comcast has already violated antitrust laws repeatedly by allegedly exerting price pressure along with withholding “must-have” programming from local stations, squeezing rival cable distributors by threatening to raise prices, and refusing to carry certain channels.
In a tweet, President Donald Trump said Comcast “routinely violated antitrust law,” in remarks he ascribed to the American Cable Association.
Trump has frequently taken aim at the alleged anticompetitive practices of media companies whose stories paint him in an unflattering light, including CNN owner AT&T as well as Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos is owner of the Washington Post.

318,"November 12, 2018",EU: Commission targets big tech’s FinTech moves,"
Moves on the part of Amazon and Google to enter the financial services market are prompting European financial regulators to mull whether or not the tech companies need to be supervised.
According to a report in the Financial Times citing Olli Rehn, governor of Finland’s central bank and a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, the issue of tech companies entering the financial services industry has resulted in a “very lively discussion by financial supervisors and central banks in Europe.” The comments were made at the Financial Times’ Middle East Banking Forum being held in Dubai. It was well received by senior bankers, reported the paper, noting many have complained that it’s not an even playing field when competing against technology companies. The report noted it could also mark a new fight between tech companies and European regulators, which have been going after them over data breaches and to get more taxes out of the tech giants.
Rehn was asked if the ECB was mulling regulation for the tech companies that have entered financial services and said in response: “we see big tech is moving in there,” adding that it was “currently a matter for discussion among financial supervisors,” reported the Financial Times.
The comments come as the big tech companies in the US including Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple have been entering the financial services market by supporting digital payments and launching other services. Tencent and Alib...

StarKist will appear Wednesday, November 14, at the federal court in San Francisco for an arraignment and plea hearing for its role in a conspiracy to fix prices of packaged seafood sold in the US, according to court records.
The US Justice Department had announced last month that StarKist has agreed to a guilty plea for its role and this was also confirmed by StarKist in its own statement. No date was given at the time as to when the defendant would appear in court.
A one-count felony charge accused StarKist and its co-conspirators of agreeing to fix the prices of canned tuna between November 2011 to December 2013. StarKist, which faces a criminal fine of up to US$100 million, has agreed to cooperate in the investigation conducted by a federal grand jury sitting in San Francisco.

When Democrats take control of the US House of Representatives, they plan to investigate the Trump administration’s decision to try to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, and whether officials sought to punish Amazon.com by prodding the US Post Office to hike shipping prices for the world’s largest e-commerce company, a senior Democrat said on Sunday.
Speaking to online publication Axios, Representative Adam Schiff, who is expected to be the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats will review if President Donald Trump was trying to punish the major firms with “instruments of state power to punish the press.”
Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, while Time Warner’s holdings include CNN. Trump has lambasted both outlets frequently for their critical coverage of his administration.
“It is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,” Schiff told Axios in an interview that will aired Sunday, November 11, on HBO.
Mr. Schiff said Mr. Trump “was secretly meeting with the postmaster in an effort to browbeat the postmaster into raising postal rates on Amazon… This appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post.”

However, Fleet News claimed that they will not begin merging their mobility services until the deal has also been approved by antitrust authorities in North America.

Last month, Takeda offered to divest Shire’s pipeline compound SHP647, along with some associated rights after the European Commission voiced concerns about the overlap with its own drug for inflammatory bowel disease called Entyvio.
Takeda is looking to the acquisition to boost its late-stage pipeline. Rare disease specialist Shire has seven drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials compared to Takeda’s three. The deal would also make it a global top 10 drugmaker.

German antitrust regulators gave their seal of approval to the merger of the Karstadt and Kaufhof department store chains, Bloomberg reported.
The deal transforms two competing department store chains into a single behemoth amid falling sales at big department stores in many western countries. Rising competitive pressure from online retailers was an important consideration, the German agency stated November 9.
The new Karstadt-Kaufhof entity will own a total of 243 department stores in Europe and employ around 32,000 workers. Aside from the locations of the Kaufhof and Karstadt chains in Germany, the merger unites Karstadt’s sportsware stores, the European presence of the outlet chain Saks Off 5th, department stores in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as a range of online retailers.
Kaufhof’s Canadian owner, Hudson’s Bay Company, and Signa Group, the Austrian parent company of Karstadt, have both described the deal as a “fusion of equals”. However, Signa is set to acquire just over half of the shares (50.01%) of the new joint venture and will also become responsible for the operative end of business.

Vertical Restraints in Two-Sided Markets after Ohio v. Amex: Lessons from the FTC Competition Hearings
By Timothy Snyder & Farrell Malone (Latham & Watkins)1
The recent Supreme Court decision Ohio v. Amex (“Amex”) elicited strong reactions from panelists throughout the Federal Trade Commission’s Hearing #3 on multi-sided platforms.2 Several panelists questioned the Court’s reasoning, with one speaker’s describing it as “economically illiterate.”3 Others supported the decision and encouraged the agencies to use their global stage to advocate the views in Amex to countries with less advanced antitrust regimes.4 Among the criticisms, two themes emerged. This article discusses both themes and briefly surveys lower court opinions citing to the Amex case to see if these concerns are beginning to appear. Although there are not enough cases to establish a trend, lower courts will likely avoid undue formalism when applying Amex and continue to take a fact-specific approach when analyzing two-sided markets.

In Amex, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to prove that anti-steering provisions in contracts between American Express and merchants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.5  The Court required plaintiffs (1) to define the market in direct-evidence cases involving vertical restraints6 and (2) to show a net-anticompetitive effect across two sides of a two-sided transaction platform.7
The case turned on market definition...

326,"November 8, 2018",EU: Vestager examines Facebook over taxes,"

According to a report from Politico, EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is weighing up whether there are grounds to open a probe into Facebook’s European tax arrangements as the Commission deepens its multinational investigation into sweetheart tax deals.
Vestager stressed that her work on taxes is unfinished, and two people close to the work of the competition investigators said that they had now turned their attention to Facebook’s arrangements. A third person agreed that the Commission was looking into these, but predicted that Vestager’s team would not find enough to open a formal investigation into the social networking giant.
At a press conference at the Web Summit in Lisbon on Wednesday, November 7,  Vestager was asked whether her department was specifically looking into an Irish arrangement that allows investors to lower their tax burden by offsetting costs from intellectual property assets they have acquired.
“We continue to ask questions. We’re asking Member States for evidence of tax rulings about specific cases,” she said. “So far, we have no specific criticism of any legislation from the Irish Republic.”
Vestager and the Commission ruled in 2016 that Ireland would have to collect €13 billion (US$ billion)in unpaid taxes from Apple.

327,"November 8, 2018","EU: Regulators probe data brokers, credit rating agencies","
A campaign group has asked EU regulators to investigate several data brokers, credit rating agencies, and adtech companies to see if they are breaching the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Privacy International filed several complaints to the British, Irish, and French data regulators on Thursday, November 8, against data broker Acxiom, software giant Oracle, credit rating agencies Experian and Equifax, and adtech companies Criteo, Quantcast, and Tapad. The group alleges that the companies, which buy and sell the data of millions of online consumers, cannot legally collect such information.
“Part of their business models are about fundamentally exploiting data and therefore clash with many of the provisions [of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation],” said Ailidh Callander, legal officer at Privacy International, according to the Financial Times. “We put most of our attention on the bigger companies with which people have a direct relationship, like Facebook and Google, but then there are these other companies that most people have never heard of, and wouldn’t expect to have a huge amount of data about us.”
The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office stated said it was “aware of concerns raised about the compliance of data protection laws by big tech companies, data brokers and credit referencing agencies.”

328,"November 8, 2018",US: Investors sue 16 banks over currency market rigging,"
According to a report from Reuters, a group of large institutional investors including BlackRock and Allianz’s Pacific Investment Management has sued 16 major banks, accusing them of rigging prices in the roughly US$5.1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.
The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, November 7, in the US District Court in Manhattan by plaintiffs that decided to “opt out” of similar nationwide litigation that has resulted in US$2.31 billion of settlements with 15 of the banks.
Those settlements followed worldwide regulatory probes that have led to more than US$10 billion of fines for several banks, and the convictions or indictments of some traders.

329,"November 8, 2018",Germany: Regulator asks EC for say on Vodafone/Unitymedia deal,"
Germany’s competition regulator has made a formal request to the European Commission to take over the investigation into Vodafone’s proposed acquisition of cable operator Unitymedia, reported Telecom Paper. The Bundeskartellamt stated the deal could lead to significant changes on the German cable TV and telecoms markets.
Vodafone filed the merger with the European Commission in mid-October. The deal also covers its planned takeover of Liberty Global’s cable activities in Hungary, Romania, and the Czech Republic. The German regulator only wants a say on the German part of the transaction.
The Commission confirmed that it received the referral request from the German agency on November 7. It will have 35 working days to decide whether to hand the case to the Bundeskartellamt.
The request is likely to delay a decision on the deal from the Commission’s original deadline of December 11. Vodafone and Liberty Global have announced that they aim to close the deal by mid-2019.

A Georgian chicken producer, has agreed to pay US$2.2. million to extract itself from a federal, class-action lawsuit alleging massive price fixing by the major players in the broiler industry, a conspiracy the plaintiffs say was aided by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
The settlement agreement is the latest development in one of a growing number of lawsuits targeting some of Georgia’s largest chicken producers. Lawyers behind the suits say their clients and consumers were harmed by a conspiracy to keep chicken prices artificially high for years despite declining costs by manipulating the “Georgia Dock,” a pricing index for whole chickens maintained for decades by the Agriculture Department.
The lawsuits target household names like Tyson, Perdue, and Pilgrim’s Pride, companies with large footprints in North Georgia’s chicken-producing region. The companies are the leading broiler suppliers, controlling 90% of the US$30 billion wholesale market that stretches around the globe.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced on Thursday, November 8, it will not oppose the proposed merger between Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media.
The ACCC examined a number of markets affected by this proposed merger. Australian news, including online news, current affairs reporting, and investigative journalism, was the key issue, and in particular whether the merger would substantially lessen competition in the creation and provision of Australian news content.
The merger investigation was extensive and involved contact with hundreds of stakeholders, consideration of the more than 1,000 submissions, and examination of internal documents the ACCC compelled from both Nine and Fairfax.
“While the merger between these two big name media players raised a number of extremely complex issues, and will likely reduce competition, we concluded that the proposed merger was not likely to substantially lessen competition in any market in breach of the Competition and Consumer Act,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.

332,"November 8, 2018",Japan: Japan to consider easing M&A rules as regional banks struggle,"
Japan’s government has kicked off a debate on changing antitrust rules to make it easier for regional banks to merge, as they struggle to generate profits due a declining population and a limited number of corporate borrowers.
In a meeting of a government advisory panel discussing Japan’s growth strategy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed his ministers to come up with ways to smoothen regional bank consolidation that could include a revision of legislation or exemptions to existing regulations.
The panel is scheduled to finalize a plan in coming months.
The plight of regional banks has become a headache for the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which is drawing criticism for hurting financial institutions’ profits by keeping interest rates virtually at zero for years.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday, November 5, raising rates alone won’t solve structural problems regional banks face, such as a dwindling population and a lack of funding demand, and that mergers and consolidation could be options for them to survive.
“Many banks are losing money on their deposit and lending business,” said Ryoji Yoshizawa, financial sector analyst at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Japan.
“Consolidation is not simply necessary. It is unavoidable for regional banks to become more efficient.”
One problem advisers will consider is what they say is a lengthy process to approve bank mergers, according to documents published by the advisory panel....

Italy’s antitrust authority announced on Wednesday, November 7, it was opening a probe against Ryanair and Wizz Air over their new hand luggage policies.
The regulator last week requested the two low cost airlines to suspend a new policy according to which only very small bags would be let on board for free, charging passengers for luggage.
The investigations were opened because Ryanair did not apply the required suspension and because Wizz Air passengers signaled it had not followed the request.
The probe could end with sanctions for the carriers, for a maximum of €5 million (US$5.7 million) each.

Sessions’s chief of staff Matthew Whitaker will serve as acting attorney general, Trump announced.
Whitaker also will assume oversight of the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign in that meddling.
Whitaker, who has publicly criticized the Mueller investigation, by law can serve as acting AG for a maximum of 210 days.
Whitaker will have the power to fire Mueller “for cause” as outlined under rules governing the special counsel’s office, if such cause is found.

335,"November 7, 2018",US: Qualcomm must license technology to rivals court rules,"


According to a report from Reuters, a US federal judge ruled on Tuesday, November 6, that chip seller Qualcomm must license some of its technology to competitors such as Intel.
The preliminary ruling came in an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in early 2017. The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial next year.
The preliminary ruling by Judge Lucy Koh in the US District Court for the Northern District of California said that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making so-called modem chips, which help smartphones connect to wireless data networks, to rival chip firms.
Qualcomm and the FTC had jointly asked Koh last month to delay ruling on the issue for up to 30 days while they pursued settlement talks.
In August, Qualcomm settled with Taiwanese regulators for US$93 million and an agreement to invest US$700 million in the country over the next five years.

Sinclair has entered into a consent decree with the Justice Department (DOJ) to “resolve” DOJ’s investigation into its sharing of information among “certain stations in some local markets.” But it will not have to pay any fine or suffer any penalty, the DOJ announced.
The DOJ has not filed the consent decree, but Sinclair stated it expected it to by Thursday, November 8.
Sinclair cited the decree in its third-quarter earnings statement. Companies are required to inform investors of regulatory or legal actions that could affect the company’s performance.
Sinclair pointed out that the settlement was not an admission of guilt and did not involve “any monetary damages or penalties.”
DOJ concerns about Sinclair’s inventory control in markets where it sought two stations resulted in Sinclair restructuring its deal to acquire Tribune Media, a takeover that ultimately failed.

Apple isn’t in talks “at any level” to settle its Qualcomm  legal dispute, according to a Reuters source. The source says Apple is “gearing up for trial” with “no settlement in sight.”
Last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court alleging the chip company taking a cut of phone selling prices for a patent license fee was illegal. Qualcomm denied the claim and countered that Apple owes US$7 billion in unpaid royalties.
A source familiar with the situation said this week that there are no settlement talks between Apple and Qualcomm.
“There is absolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight,” the person said. “We are gearing up for trial.”
The FTC case dates back to January 2017 and accuses Qualcomm of forcing companies like Apple to buy its wireless chips in exchange for better patent royalty rates. Apple was in an exclusive modem supply arrangement with Qualcomm for several years, but started mixing in Intel chips with 2016’s iPhone 7, and is now Intel-only with the iPhone XS.

Amazon and its rival in India, the Walmart-owned Flipkart, did not break regulations through their selection of merchants and brands, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced in a ruling late on Tuesday, November 6. The decision is a defeat for a lobby group representing thousands of online sellers in India.

A case brought by the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA), which represents more than 3,500 online sellers, complained that Flipkart was using its dominant position to favor select sellers—an argument the CCI rejected.
AIOVA’s case alleged Flipkart was not adhering to a section of India’s antitrust laws that says companies should not abuse a dominant market position through “unfair or discriminatory” pricing.
“Looking at the present market construct and structure of online marketplace platforms market in India, it does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of evolution of market [sic],” the Commission stated in its ruling.

Spotlight on the Federal Trade Commission’s Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection
By Tianran “Tinny” Song (Labaton Sucharow)1
Introduction
The Federal Trade Commission’s Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century at George Mason University’s Scalia Law School featured a discussion on the antitrust framework for evaluating acquisitions of potential or nascent competitors in digital marketplaces. Speakers addressed issues such as determination of the appropriate framework for evaluating these acquisitions, whether current antitrust law is sufficient for developing challenges, and what pragmatic approaches antitrust enforcement agencies could consider in evaluating whether there was anticompetitive harm.
The Current Framework of Analysis
The first panel focused on the current framework for evaluating mergers between incumbents and nascent competitors, and how that framework fits within the current law and merger guidelines. Opening remarks delivered by Susan Athey and Paul T. Denis introduced this issue. Speaking from her experience as the Economics of Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, Athey grounded the issue in basic platform economics: incumbents may be incentivized to block new startups while new startups seek to disrupt the incumbents; however, resource-abundant incumbents may have clear advantages in raising barriers to entry and making it harder for low-cost entry into the market.

Disney’s US$71.3-billion offer to buy Twenty-First Century Fox’s entertainment assets won approval from the European Commission on Tuesday, November 6, subject to Disney selling interests in factual TV channels in Europe, reported CNBC.
Disney committed to divest its interests in channels including History and Lifetime in the European Economic Area (EEA) to avoid harming competition following its purchase from Fox, reported the EU regulator.
“The decision is conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by Disney,” the Commission announced.
The channels it must end its interest in are A+E Television Networks, History, H2, Crime & Investigation, Blaze, and Lifetime channels—currently owned by A+E Television Networks, a joint venture between Disney and Hearst.
Disney secured conditional approval from the US Justice Department for the deal in June after agreeing to sell Fox’s 22 regional sports networks.

341,"November 6, 2018",US: Looking into what “Looking Into” tech antitrust activity might mean,"
In antitrust we trust – or at least a “look into” antitrust?
News came Monday, November. 5, that, according to President Trump, the current administration is—in his words—“looking into” possible antitrust violations that may have been committed by tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon, and Alphabet (which owns Google).
CNBC reported that in an interview with Axios that aired on HBO, the president said “we are looking at [antitrust] very seriously. Look, that does not mean we are doing it, but we are certainly looking, and I think most people surmise that, I would imagine.” He said that such scrutiny had occurred during previous years, but added that a “previous administration” had curtailed that examination, without naming which administration had done so.
“You know they were actually talking about this same subject – monopoly.”
The president has previously stated that such “looking into” has been and is on the table. Back in August, the administration announced through Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow that it was “taking a look” at regulating Google and its eponymous search engine.
This time around, the president told Axios that the administration is looking at “all three” companies, a statement that embraces Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
Trump’s comments come against a backdrop where in past months, the Justice Department has met with state attorneys general to look at antitrust behavior. And as has been reported by The Washington Post,...

A panel of three federal appeals court judges named by former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will hear the Justice Department’s appeal of a ruling allowing AT&T Inc to acquire Time Warner, court records show.
Judges Judith W. Rogers, Robert L. Wilkins and David B. Sentelle will hear arguments on December 6th.
The government argues that AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition will lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law, while AT&T says the government offered no basis for second guessing key conclusions of a lower-court ruling allowing the transaction to proceed.
Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, and Rogers, who was named to the bench by Clinton, were among seven appeals court judges in June 2001 that issued an opinion tossing out an order that Microsoft Corp should be broken up but found that the company possessed monopoly power and agreed that the company had behaved anticompetively.
The company ultimately agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department and an agreement to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Tuesday, November 6, rejected allegations of price fixing against app-based taxi service providers Ola and Uber, stating that drivers acceding to “algorithmically determined prices” by the platforms does not amount to collusion between them.
In a 13-page order, the CCI also dismissed complaints that Ola and Uber are imposing a resale price maintenance system on the drivers as well as alleged price discrimination.
For the model followed by cab aggregators, estimation of fares are done by algorithms on the basis of large data sets. Apart from personalized information, various other factors —such as time of the day and traffic situation,—are taken into account with respect to fares.
“Resultantly, the algorithmically determined pricing for each rider and each trip tends to be different owing to the interplay of large data sets. Such pricing does not appear to be similar to the ‘hub and spoke” arrangement as understood in the traditional competition parlance,” the regulator stated.

Platforms in the Spotlight at the FTC Hearings
By Joshua D. Wright and John M. Yun (George Mason University)1
The Spotlight on Platforms
Over a series of three days, from October 15 to 17, 2018, the Global Antitrust Institute (GAI) hosted the third session of the FTC Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century at the Antonin Scalia Law School, George Mason University. After introductory remarks by Scalia Law School Dean Henry Butler and Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra, the panels broadly focused upon three topics: (1) multisided platforms, (2) nascent/potential competition, and (3) labor policy. The overarching focus of the hearings was clearly multisided platforms, which accounted for seven of the twelve panels.
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Ohio v. American Express, platforms are rightly the subject of significant attention and discussion ranging from the economic tools and methods to evaluate platforms to the correct legal framework for capturing and shaping that analysis. The economic research on platforms began in earnest fifteen years ago with pioneering work from Evans (2003) and Rochet and Tirole (2003).2 Much of the important economic learning over the past fifteen years—economic concepts such as cross-group effects, the interrelationship of demand, and the difference between transaction and non-transaction platforms—are becoming part of the antitrust lexicon. Much of the discussion at the hearings mi...

345,"November 5, 2018",US: SCOTUS net neutrality rules fight,"

On Monday, November 5, the Supreme Court announced that it will not hear a closely watched case over the future of the Internet, rejecting a petition by telecom industry groups to consider net neutrality, reported Reuters.
Three of the justices—Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch, —would have voted to take up the case, according to the court’s announcement, and wipe off the books a lower court’s decision backing the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) net neutrality rules, which were originally passed in 2015. But there were not enough justices for a majority, after Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh recused themselves.
The high court’s decision not to throw out the 2016 US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling leaves a legal precedent in place that could help net neutrality supporters in any future legal battle if that policy is ever re-introduced.
The rules championed by former President Barack Obama, intended to safeguard equal access to content on the internet, were opposed by President Trump. The Trump administration and the telecom industry had wanted to erase the 2016 ruling even though the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission in December voted to repeal the net neutrality rules. The policy reversal went into effect in June.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat who backed the net neutrality order in 2015, said on Twitter that the Commission had “actually petitioned ...

President Trump is considering antitrust actions against Silicon Valley giants as a means of regulation, he told Axios on HBO in an interview aired Sunday, November 4.
“I do have a lot of people talking about monopoly when they mention those three in particular,” Trump said about Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The president continued, “we are looking at [antitrust] very seriously … Look, that doesn’t mean we’re doing it, but we’re certainly looking and I think most people surmise that, I would imagine.”
Trump said others have also considered action against tech companies but a “previous administration” stopped that. “They were talking about this years ago. You know they were actually talking about this same subject — monopoly.”
The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon, saying that package deliveries by the US Postal Service for Amazon were costing the service money.
Trump has also been critical of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.
Mike Allen, co-founder and executive editor of Axios, told CNBC on Monday he thinks Trump was being serious about this inquiry into big tech.
“The president has been talking about this for a long time,” Allen said in a “Squawk Box” interview. He also mentioned Trump’s “obsession” with Amazon.

347,"November 5, 2018",US: MGM Casino and Caesars to merge?,"
Las Vegas casino giants MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corp. are reportedly discussing a merger to create a behemoth company that would control about half of the Las Vegas and Atlantic City gaming and hospitality markets, the New York Post reported citing unnamed sources familiar with the ongoing talks.
According to NY Post sources, MGM has tapped investment bank Morgan Stanley and law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to study a potential merger with Caesars. However, there is still no offer on the table, sources have pointed out.  After it became known that Caesars has rejected a reverse takeover offer from the smaller Golden Nugget hotel and casino chain.

People familiar with the matter have also revealed that activist hedge funds, which collectively own about a quarter of Caesars, have been pushing for a MGM tie-up for some time now. A merger of the two operators would create a behemoth gambling giant with a market capitalization of more than $21 billion. According to the NY Post’s sources, Canyon Partners, which owns shares in both Caesars and MGM, is among the hedge funds supporting a deal between the two companies.

Las autoridades antimonopolio de Japón investigarán si gigantes tecnológicos como Google y Amazon están utilizando sus posiciones líderes en el mercado para explotar a sus contratistas u obstruir la competencia, dijo el 1 de noviembre el titular a cargo del comercio justo del país.
En una entrevista con el periódico Mainichi Shimbun, el jefe de la Comisión de Comercio Justo de Japón (JFTC) Kazuyuki Sugimoto dijo que la investigación se llevaría a cabo el próximo año. “Investigaremos si los ‘plataformas’ están obstruyendo la innovación tecnológica de las empresas japonesas”, dijo Sugimoto al diario.
El término “plataformas” se refiere a los gigantes tecnológicos que dominan su sector, e incluye a Amazon, Apple, Google y Facebook.
Sugimoto dijo que la investigación “analizará si la acumulación de datos de los clientes está impidiendo que los recién llegados ingresen al mercado, o si sus posiciones dominantes en el mercado están obligando a sus socios comerciales a recortar precios”.
La investigación implicaría reuniones con las empresas y sus socios, y podría implicar que el organismo de vigilancia antimonopolio convoque a funcionarios de la compañía para entregar documentos incluídos en la orden “si es necesario”, dijo.

350,"November 4, 2018",US: WarnerMedia accuses DOJ of “collaborating” with Dish in HBO dispute,"

According to a report from CNBC, AT&T’s WarnerMedia has accused the US Department of Justice (DOJ) of “collaborating” with Dish Network in a high profile dispute over carrying HBO and Cinemax.
WarnerMedia’s HBO, known for its award winning TV series “Game of Thrones” and “The Sopranos,” went dark on Dish’s satellite television service on Thursday, November 1, after a disagreement over a new distribution deal.
“Dish’s proposals and actions made it clear they never intended to seriously negotiate an agreement,” said Simon Sutton, HBO president and chief revenue officer.
AT&T responded with their statement: “The Department of Justice collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our merger,” a WarnerMedia spokesman said. “That collaboration continues to this day with Dish’s tactical decision to drop HBO not the other way around. DOJ failed to prove its claims about HBO at trial and then abandoned them on appeal.
“The merger created for AT&T immense power over consumers,” said Andy LeCuyer, DISH senior vice president of programming, in a prepared statement. “It seems AT&T is implementing a new strategy to shut off its recently acquired content from other distributors.”

351,"November 4, 2018",UK: Financial chief to step down,"
According to a report from Reuters, Stephen Haddrill is to step down as chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) just as a root-and-branch review of what British politicians have called a “timid” watchdog nears completion.
Haddrill has been head of the regulator that oversees accountants, actuaries and how companies apply good governance codes for nearly nine years. The FRC stated the exact date of his departure in late 2019 would partly depend on the outcome of the Kingman review.
John Kingman has been asked by the business ministry to look at whether the FRC needs more powers to stop a repeat of corporate failures like construction company Carillion and retailer BHS – or if more radical change in supervising accountants is needed.
Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is due to publish initial findings by year end on its fast-track probe into competition in the audit sector after lawmakers called on the CMA to consider breaking up the Big Four accounting firms.
The Kingman review and the CMA probe are seen as packages to help to improve audit standards and keep Britain an attractive place to invest as it departs from the European Union next March.

352,"November 4, 2018",US: Beer giants up against Canadian brewers in 7th Circuit,"

According to a report from Courthouse News, the 7th Circuit weighed the reach of US antitrust laws in a case accusing Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors of making secret deals with Canadian authorities to promote sales of their beer at the expense of small breweries.
Last year, Mountain Crest sued Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors, America’s first and second largest breweries, claiming they abused their monopoly power to restrain trade – particularly, beer exports to Ontario, Canada.
Mountain Crest, the 21st largest brewer in the US, brews beer for Ravinder Minhas, a Canadian entrepreneur, for export to Alberta. Since 2009, it’s been trying to expand its market to Ontario, but claims the defendants have stiff-armed it through “secret agreements.”


This secret agreement allegedly stipulated that if any small brewer, like Mountain Crest, wanted to sell 12 or 24-packs of beer in Ontario, they would have to pay listing, handling, and service charges to sell through The Beer Store. Anheuser Busch and Molson Coors brands were exempt from the fees.
A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit as barred by the act-of-state doctrine, because all the challenged conduct is governed by a contract with the Ontario government.
But Mountain Crest’s attorney Charles Benoit told a 7th Circuit panel Friday, November 2,  that this interpretation of the law immunizes illegal conduct abroad by American companies.
“Can a beer company offer $10 million [to a foreign government] to block all o...

According to a new coalition of advocacy groups, T-Mobile’s proposed US$26 billion acquisition of Sprint will result in higher prices for consumers, poorer service, and fewer incentives for the companies to invest
“As structured, the T-Mobile-Sprint combination is illegal on its face under the antitrust laws, does not serve the public interest, and should be rejected,” Public Knowledge, Open Markets Institute, Common Cause, Consumers Union, and Writers Guild of America write in comments submitted this week to the FCC.
“A combined T-Mobile and Sprint means higher prices and worse service in wireless phone service. This is true for the public at large, and especially true for rural and suburban communities. This is a bad deal plain and simple. There is no excuse for the government to approve it.” said Open Markets Institute Executive Director Barry Lynn.
Phillip Berenbroick, Senior Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge, said, “The record compiled by the FCC clearly demonstrates that the proposed transaction is a classic horizontal merger that would substantially reduce competition in the wireless voice and broadband market and harm consumers.”
T-Mobile and Sprint say that if the merger goes through, they plan to invest nearly US$40 billion to roll out a nationwide 5G network. T-Mobile and Sprint argue that the new network will offer 5G speeds four to six times faster than each company could achieve independently, which will spur competition by forcing Verizon and...

AT&T, the No.2 US wireless carrier by subscribers, closed its US$85-billion acquisition of media company Time Warner in June, and created WarnerMedia to house assets including Turner TV networks and the premium channel HBO.
“It seems AT&T is implementing a new strategy to shut off its recently acquired content from other distributors,” said Andy LeCuyer, Dish’s senior vice president of programming.
A WarnerMedia spokesman said past behavior showed that removing services from customers was becoming a common negotiating tactic for Dish.

Japan’s antitrust authorities will probe whether tech giants such as Google and Amazon are using their market-leader positions to exploit contractors or obstruct competition, the country’s fair trade chief said Thursday, November 1.
In an interview with the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, the head of Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) said the investigation would take place next year. “We will probe whether ‘platformers’ are obstructing the technological innovation of Japanese companies,” Kazuyuki Sugimoto told the daily.
The term “platformers” refers to tech giants that dominate their sector, and includes Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.
He said the probe would “study whether client data hoarding is obstructing newcomers from entering the market, or whether their dominant positions in the market are forcing their business partners to cut prices.”
The investigation would involve meetings with the businesses and their partners, and could see the antitrust watchdog summon company officials and order documents handed over “if necessary,” he said.

The Islamic divisions of ADCB and UNB would merge and then take over privately-held Al Hilal Bank, they said.

357,"November 1, 2018",Chile: Antitrust court rejects appeals against Tianqi deal,"
Chile’s antitrust court on Tuesday, October 30, rejected appeals filed against its authorization of Tianqi Lithium Corp’s $4.1 billion purchase of a stake in lithium producer SQM, Tianqi said on Tuesday.
The decision marks the latest legal victory for Tianqi, a Chinese miner seeking to acquire 24% of Chile’s SQM, the world’s No.2 lithium miner, as Beijing promotes electric vehicles that rely on the metal.
Last week Chile’s Constitutional Court rejected a lawsuit filed by SQM’s majority shareholder Julio Ponce to block Tianqi’s plans to buy the stake from Nutrien.
But legal risks had lingered over the deal. SQM, Ponce’s Pampa Group, and consumer watchdog group Conadecus previously filed appeals against the antitrust court’s decision to authorize the transaction.
Ponce had argued the acquisition could expose SQM’s secrets to top competitor Tianqi. Conadecus said the deal could raise prices of products powered in part by lithium, like cellphones and electric vehicles.
“With this final decision, Tianqi expects to close the transaction in the timeframes originally scheduled,” Tianqi said in a statement.
Tianqi had planned to complete the acquisition by the end of the year.

358,"October 31, 2018",EU: Comm approves support for LNG terminal in Lithuania,"
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, the compensation granted by Lithuania to LITGAS for supplying a mandatory quantity of liquefied natural gas to the LNG terminal in Klaipėda.
In November 2013, the Commission approved an aid scheme to support the construction and operation of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at the Klaipėda seaport in Lithuania. The LNG terminal has, since its construction, played a vital role in the diversification of gas supplies and security of supply in Lithuania.
In June 2018, Lithuania notified the Commission of certain changes to the aid scheme approved in 2013, namely.


Public service obligation of LITGAS. To ensure security of supply, the LNG terminal must be kept operational, which requires continuous deliveries of liquefied natural gas and its constant regasification. In January 2016, Lithuania decided to modify the initial scheme and to entrust LITGAS, a liquefied gas supplier with a public service obligation to ensure the supply of a mandatory quantity of liquefied natural gas to the LNG terminal in Klaipėda. In exchange, LITGAS receives a compensation from the Lithuanian State to cover the costs incurred for performing this public service obligation. The compensation is financed via a “security supplement,” which is an additional fee paid by all gas transmission system users.

Britain’s competition watchdog cleared CME Group’s £3.9 billion (US$4.96 billion) deal to buy Michael Spencer’s NEX Group, paving the way for a cross-border trading powerhouse, reported the Financial Times.
The UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) approval of the £3.9 billion (US$4.96 billion) acquisition was the last significant hurdle for CME and NEX to overcome after receiving the go-ahead from the US Department of Justice earlier this month. CME and NEX announced the news in separate statements on Wednesday, October 31.
CME announced the pair now expect the deal to close by Friday, November 2. The companies had already received approvals from the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, and regulators in the US, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.
The UK CMA’s investigation began in mid-September. The authority had until November 8 to decide whether the deal could damage competition in the market. The deal was not referred for a more rigorous second-phase investigation.

The tech giant first asked the 9th Circuit on Friday to reconsider a published decision that revived a suit claiming that the Cupertino, California-based company monopolizes the market for iPhone apps. Apple argued in its petition that the panel hadn’t properly considered whether the consumer class could allege that they were directly harmed by distribution fees.

The UK is facing pushback by lawmakers in the US and lobbyists who contend a new tax on some of the world’s biggest internet companies would create what is seen as a dangerous precedent.
According to the Financial Times,  which cited Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce — lobbyists and lawmakers, Donohue and others think the tax would target big American technology companies unfairly. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Donohue said, “the American business community supports international dialogue on ways to modernize the international taxation system to adapt to changes in the global economy. Unilateral European actions will erode trust and lessen the prospects for the international agreement; indeed, we now see governments outside of Europe considering similar actions.” Meanwhile, a Republican Senate aide told the Financial Times that senators have urged the EU to get rid of a similar plan, arguing it will create a new transatlantic trade barrier and target US companies.
Earlier this week the UK announced it was aiming to lodge a 2% tax on the UK-generated revenues of search engines, social media companies, and online marketplaces if revenue on a global basis is more than £500 million (US$638.5 million) a year and the company is profitable. The UK is among several countries that are looking at overhauling their tax codes to capture more revenue from the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google.

Regulators are to investigate the insurance industry for potential racial bias and discrimination over the data that companies use to set their prices.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that while it had found no evidence of “direct discrimination,” insurers were using information within their pricing models that may implicitly or potentially explicitly relate to race or ethnicity, so there was a “risk of discriminating against consumers.”
Announcing a study of the £78 billion (US$99.6 billion) general insurance industry, which will look at whether certain groups of consumers are paying too much, the FCA also floated the idea of a specific day or week in the year when all consumers would renew or switch their insurance.
A report published by the regulator indicated that many loyal, older home insurance customers were being overcharged for their coverage so firms could offer artificially low prices to new customers.
Alongside the FCA’s program of work on general insurance pricing, it is working closely with the Competition and Markets Authority as it investigates the Citizens Advice super-complaint on excessive prices for disengaged customers.

The Commission said it had examined in its investigation the effects of the proposed transaction on the retail market of dietetic pet food sold by veterinarians.
The EU executive, which oversees competition policy, stated it was concerned that Mars might be able, in the future, to shut out its dietetic pet food competitors from retail channels, namely the AniCura clinics and the VetFamily member clinics.
Mars offered to divest VetFamily, a purchasing organization for independent veterinary clinics, as a whole in Europe.
The Commission stated this commitment addressed its concerns as they would reduce Mars’ influence on retail channels in Denmark and Sweden.

The European Commission has closed its antitrust investigation into a codeshare agreement between Brussels Airlines and TAP Air Portugal relating to the Brussels-Lisbon route, which the Commission was carrying out on its own initiative.
On October 27, 2016, the Commission adopted a Statement of Objections against the two airlines, raising preliminary concerns that their codeshare cooperation on passenger services between Brussels and Lisbon may have restricted competition between them.
The closure decision is based on a thorough analysis of all relevant evidence, including information received from the two airlines in their replies to the Statement of Objections and during an oral hearing, which took place in May 2017.
The Commission concluded that the evidence collected was not sufficient to confirm its initial concerns and has therefore decided to close its investigation. Throughout the investigation, the Commission emphasised that its concerns related to certain specific features of this particular codeshare, rather than to codeshares in general.
Finally, it should be noted that since 2014 new airlines have begun to compete with the code-sharing airlines on the Brussels-Lisbon route, to the benefit of consumers. The Commission will continue to monitor the European air travel market.

369,"October 30, 2018","EU: Tata Steel, ThyssenKrupp planned joint venture probed","
The European Commission announced that it was investigating whether a planned joint venture between Indian steelmaker Tata Steel and Germany’s ThyssenKrupp could reduce competition in the high-end steel sector.
Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are major producers of flat carbon steel and electrical steel with significant production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands, and Britain, the New York Times reported.
The proposed joint venture would combine their European carbon steel and electrical steel businesses and the Commission stated that this raised concerns over their dominance in steel for cars, metallic coated steel for packaging, and grain-oriented electrical steel.
“The Commission is concerned that, following the transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers, as well as higher prices,” an EU executive said in a statement.
“These customers include various European companies, ranging from major corporations to numerous small and medium-size enterprises,” the executive said.

370,"October 30, 2018","UK: “Digital” tax to hit Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook","
The UK is implementing a first-of-its-kind tax on locally generated revenue by large technology firms, including Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
According to the Wall Street Journal, dozens of other countries have been looking into similar taxes on digital services sold by these companies in an attempt to capture more revenue from online businesses.
“It’s clearly not sustainable, or fair, that digital-platform businesses generate substantial value in the U.K. without paying tax here,” Philip Hammond, the UK’s Treasury chief, said on Monday, October 29. He added that while a global agreement “is the best long-term solution,” progress has been “painfully slow.” While the new tax would only be in force until a global solution is found, Hammond said, “we cannot simply talk forever.”
As a result, the UK announced it was moving forward with a plan to begin a digital tax for large tech firms by 2020.
The government of Spain has proposed a similar tax, which still requires parliamentary approval. The Spanish tax inspectors raided Google’s Madrid offices in 2016. In addition, Commission Margrethe Vestager has also suggested that tax reforms are needed
The new UK tax puts pressure on other countries to come to an agreement on a global digital tax. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been leading the international digital tax talks.
Spokespeople for Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent company Alphabet had no immediate comment on the new U...

371,"October 30, 2018",US: Coachella faces new legal fight,"
Last April, Soul’d Productions, a Portland-based music festival promoter, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Coachella and AEG/Goldenvoice.
The promoter claimed that Coachella and AEG aimed to “monopolize the market for popular music” in the West Coast. Specifically, Soul’d Out had problems with Coachella’s “radius clause.” A federal judge dismissed the antitrust suit filed by an Oregon festival promoter against AEG and Coachella, but declined to rule on several other key elements of the lawsuit, including unfair competition claims.
Now, Soul’d Productions has refiled its lawsuit with key changes. In the refiled lawsuit, the Oregon promoter claims Coachella’s restrictive clause harms the Pacific Northwest concert promoter market. AEG also negotiates the California festivals’ radius clause with other promoters. Nika Aldrich, attorney for Soul’d Production, claims this constitutes an “unlawful horizontal restraint on trade.”

372,"October 30, 2018",US: FTC requires Marathon to sell stores,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is requiring Marathon to sell five New York convenience stores to settle charges that its proposed acquisition of Express Mart would violate federal antitrust laws.
Marathon is the parent company of Speedway, headquartered in Enon, Ohio. The News-Sun reported earlier this year that Marathon acquired 78 stores held by Petr-All Petroleum Consulting Corporation under the Express Mart brand. The company plans to convert the stores to the Speedway brand. Speedway is the second largest company-owned convenience store chain in the US.
The FTC raised concerns Marathon’s acquisition would harm competition in five of the markets where the company is acquiring stores. They include Farmington, Fayetteville, Johnson City, Rochester, and Whitney Point.
“In three of the five retail diesel markets, the proposed acquisition would result in a merger to monopoly,” the FTC said in a news release. “In the fourth, the proposed acquisition would reduce the number of significant competitors from three to two. In the fifth, the proposed acquisition would reduce the number of significant competitors from four to three.”

Japan’s Shinwa Bank and Eighteenth Bank Ltd have decided to postpone their planned merger by six months, saying they wanted to bring the dates of their merger and systems integration closer together to avoid complications for customers, Reuters reported.
Eighteenth Bank and Shinwa Bank got approval in August from Japanese authorities to merge after alengthy review that had sparked a battle between the antitrust watchdog and financial regulators.
The postponement was earlier reported by the Nikkei business daily, which attributed the delay to preparation for a change in the local calendar with the abdication of the emperor next year.
The Nikkei said the banks decided to postpone the merger by six months to avoid potential system troubles with the added workload of making necessary changes to the system with the change of the imperial era in May next year.

374,"October 29, 2018",EU: Songwriters protest EC’s Sony-EMI deal approval,"
Songwriters and independent music companies have hit out at the decision of competition regulators in Europe to approve Sony’s deal to take complete ownership of EMI Music Publishing. The European Commission announced it was green lighting the deal on Friday, October 26.

Impala, the pan-European independent music companies’ trade association, had rigorously opposed the proposed transaction, the result of which would create a mega-publisher with 4.21 million compositions, a huge pool of writers, and the ability to combine recordings and publishing. It would “control more music than any other player in the sector,” the Brussels-based lobby body warned.Since 2012, EMI Music Publishing has been jointly owned and controlled by Sony Corporation of America and Mubadala Investment Company, an investment fund based in the United Arab Emirates. Sony signed a “legally binding” memorandum of understanding earlier this year to acquire a 60% share in the publisher, which triggered a regulatory probe.
Impala had called for Sony to be required to spin-off some of its assets, which regulators had agreed to on earlier mergers. “This goes against the regulator’s own precedents,” notes Helen Smith, Impala’s executive chair. “In 2012, it ruled that divestments were required for Sony to become a minority shareholder.
The deal is “bad news for the music sector and the digital single market,” Smith adds. “Sony will have a near monopoly over the charts and the whole mus...

The announcement comes a few days after the death of Gilberto Benetton, a prominent member of the Italian family that controls Atlantia and was a strong supporter of the acquisition.
It also follows the collapse in August of a motorway bridge operated by Atlantia’s unit Autostrade per l’Italia, a disaster that exposed Atlantia to harsh criticism by the Italian government and risked jeopardizing the deal.
The Italian infrastructure group announced in a statement it had indirectly acquired 50% plus one share of Abertis.

378,"October 28, 2018",EU: EC probing Ryanair’s state aid in Frankfurt,"
The EC has opened an investigation into whether Ryanair had benefited from illegal state aid at Germany’s Frankfurt-Hahn airport.
“We will investigate whether regional and local authorities in Germany, against the rules, gave an unfair advantage to Ryanair over its competitors,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Under the deal in question, between 2009 and 2017, Ryanair received training aid and funding for a crew and pilot school and for a maintenance hall at the airport, the EC stated.
Ryanair stated it was confident that the Frankfurt-Hahn agreement fully complied with EU state aid rules.
“The EU has previously investigated this matter in 2014 and ruled that there was no state aid involved in the Ryanair-Frankfurt-Hahn agreement,” the airline claimed in a statement.
The previous investigation related to arrangements before 2009.
The EU executive opened a similar investigation in July over a deal between Ryanair and the French airport of Montpellier.

The Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA) filed two complaints, stating the acquisition would harm the independent digital music scene. It later stated that the combined company would harm consumer choice.
The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors (BASCA) claimed the acquisition would form a “Superpower” and that Sony + EMI would intimidate creators’ voices and erode the autonomy of collective rights management.
However, the European Commission announced on Friday, October 26, that Sony’s acquisition doesn’t raise anti-competitive concerns. The Commission cleared the transaction without any conditions.

Pharmaceutical company Takeda is talking with the European Commission about selling an experimental inflammatory bowel disease drug to help close its US$62 billion takeover of Shire.
In a statement released Friday, October 26, Takeda stated that it has been in discussions with the EC about divesting SHP647, which is in the final stages of experimental testing for the treatment of two gastrointestinal disorders: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
This specific drug has come to attention since Takeda already markets the drug Entyvio for those conditions. In just 2018, Entyvio sales brought Takeda US$1.8 billion.
The company claims that there are no other pharmaceuticals being discussed and that it doesn’t see any delays affecting the EC’s review being finished by its November 6 deadline.
The deal has already won approval from China, the US Federal Trade Commission, Brazil and Japan, making Europe the final major market that needs to sign off.

A New York court has found three former London-based currency traders not guilty of manipulating benchmark foreign exchange rates.
Chris Ashton, Rohan Ramchandani and, Richard Usher, who worked at Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase respectively, were acquitted of all charges by a jury on October 26.
US prosecutors announced the charges in January 2017, and the three came to the United States to face them voluntarily.
Prosecutors claimed the three traders and others colluded to influence daily benchmark euro-dollar rates, known as “fixes,” in order to benefit their own trading positions. They said the scheme ran from 2007 to 2013.
The traders used a chatroom they dubbed “The Cartel” to exchange information, according to prosecutors.
Several others have been charged in the US probe, including Mark Johnson, a former head of foreign exchange cash trading at HSBC, who was sentenced to two years in prison in April after being found guilty by a jury, and former Barclays trader Jason Katz, who pleaded guilty and faces sentencing next year.

Rod Sims has been re-appointed Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for a three-year term.
Mr Sims was appointed chairman of the ACCC in August 2011 for an initial five-year term, before getting an extension in 2016. He is the first chairman to get a third term, which will run until August 2022.
“I’m looking forward to continuing our very strong enforcement work,” Mr Sims said in Canberra on Thursday.
“We’ve just got higher penalties so we’ll certainly be seeking penalties against large companies, north of $100 million, if we can achieve that.
“We continue to put a lot of focus on enforcement, we’ve got a lot of important market studies, a lot of important work to do on communications, I’m looking forward to embracing all of it.”
The ACCC is currently inquiring into power prices; the dairy industry; gas; insurance in northern Australia; home loans; and the impact of Google and social media on traditional news and advertising media.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Mr Sims had done an outstanding job in the role.
“Under Rod’s leadership the ACCC has been the consumer’s champion, enhancing competition, and therefore in the process ensuring more jobs and lower prices for consumers,” he said.

Broadcom’s practices are also being examined by the US Federal Trade Commission, the report added, citing one of the people.

Broadcom’s US$117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm Inc was blocked by the  US government over national security concerns, while Qualcomm had to walk away from a US$44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval.

According to a report by BrewBound, a federal judge  has signed a “Modified Final Judgment” that officially clears Anheuser-Busch InBev’s US$100 billion purchase of rival SABMiller more than two years after the Department of Justice (DOJ) initially green-lit the acquisition.
US District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on Monday, October 22, ruled that A-B InBev complied with requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act and he approved a number of new conditions that he said are “in the public interest.”
The four new provisions to the consent decree are “designed to improve the Proposed Final Judgment’s enforceability,” according to a DOJ order issued Monday in conjunction with the Final Judgment.
In addition to a previously agreed upon stipulation that required A-B InBev to divest itself of the MillerCoors business in the US, and conditions that limit the company’s power over independent beer wholesalers, the DOJ has included new language that will make it easier for the government to pursue legal action against the global beer giant if the company is believed to be in violation of the consent decree.

According to a report from The Guardian, Italy’s antitrust watchdog announced on Wednesday, October 24, it was fining Apple and Samsung Electronics €5 million (US$5.7 million) each following complaints they used software updates to slow down their mobile phones.
An investigation launched in January by the nation’s competition authority found that certain smartphone software updates had a negative effect on the performance of the devices.
Believed to be the first ruling of its kind against smartphone manufacturers, the investigation followed accusations that installing operating system updates for older phones slowed them down, thereby encouraging the purchase of new phones.
In a statement the antitrust watchdog said, “Apple and Samsung implemented dishonest commercial practices” and that operating system updates “caused serious malfunctions and significantly reduced performance, thus accelerating phones’ substitution.”

387,"October 24, 2018",US: Steve Hilton: Rewrite antitrust law to deal with tech monopolies,"
According to a report from Recode, author Steve Hilton says that to effectively regulate the tech sector, we first have to unlearn a lot of things we take for granted.
“[There’s a] story we used to tell, a true story, about whether Facebook knocked out Myspace and Google knocked out Microsoft, and these tech companies don’t stay powerful for too long,” Hilton said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. “It feels like that’s not really true anymore.”
On top of that, he told Recode’s Kara Swisher, not-very-old axioms about corporate regulation no longer apply. He cited the example of onetime Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, who argued that “the size of a company is only a problem” if it prevents customers from getting “decent-quality products and services at a reasonable price.”
Today, multiple tech giants operate in parallel to one another, giving away high-quality products for nothing, which prevents most competitors from challenging their dominance.
“When I was learning economics at university, we had this notion of predatory pricing, which is when you price your product below marginal cost in order to shut out the competition, and that was seen as a problem,” Hilton said. “Well, now, predatory pricing is the business model, which is we give it away free.”

Chile’s Constitutional Court on Monday, October 22, delayed to Thursday a hearing into the contested sale of local lithium miner SQM to Chinese firm Tianqi.
The court’s president said an “extraordinary session” would decide whether to hear in full a complaint by SQM’s majority shareholder that the country’s antitrust court failed to follow due process in approving a settlement between Tianqi and Chilean regulators.
The agreement cleared the way for the Chinese miner to purchase a 24% stake in SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium.
The court can either agree to hear the case in full and suspend the sale, potentially putting it at risk, hear the case in full but allow the sale to go ahead, or decline to hear the case further.

389,"October 23, 2018",US: Suit says Burger King’s “no poaching” rule held down wages,"
Burger King workers have been denied pay raises and opportunities for advancement because the fast-food giant illegally required franchise owners to agree not to hire each other’s workers during their employment or for six months afterward, a federal lawsuit charges.
The “no hire” and “no solicitation” rules have been included in standard franchise agreements since at least 2010, according to the suit filed in early October in US District Court in Miami, reported Forbes.
The suit seeks class-action status on behalf of all US Burger King workers, past and present, since 2010. It names Burger King and Burger King Worldwide, both headquartered in Miami, as defendants.
Jarvis Arrington, a former line cook at a Chicago-area Burger King restaurant, is the lead plaintiff. Arrington was earning US$10 an hour when he attempted “to increase his pay rate and better his working conditions” by trying and failing to get a job at another Burger King restaurant in Chicago, the suit states.
After being told his transfer would need to be approved, he did not hear back from the restaurant to which he had applied, and sought employment outside of Burger King, the suit stated.

390,"October 23, 2018","EU: Siemens, Alstom to face antitrust warning","
Siemens and Alstom will receive a warning this week from European Union antitrust regulators that their plan to create a Franco-German rail champion will hurt competition, reported Reuters.

The European Commission, which opened a full-scale investigation into the deal in July, will send a statement of objections—or charge sheet—setting out its concerns about specific areas, an unnamed source said, though it is possible the timetable for doing so could slip to next week.The EU competition enforcer had previously flagged worries about reduced competition in the supply of some types of trains and signaling systems and higher prices as a result of the companies’ plan to merge their rail operations. The Commission opened a probe in July, saying the deal, which could create a global leader with three times the market share of its closest rival, could reduce competition and lead to higher fares for travelers.
German industrial group Siemens and French rival Alstom announced the planned rail merger in September last year, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron but criticized by opposition politicians amidst fears of French loss of control of the TGV high-speed train.

On Monday, October 22, Industrial gases groups Praxair and Linde won US antitrust approval for their US$86 billion merger, clearing the last hurdle for the deal.
The all-share merger of equals will create an industry leader with revenues of about US$27 billion based on 2017 figures, and 80,000 employees across more than 100 countries, which will be called Linde.
The merger will make it bigger than France’s Air Liquide, which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas.
This month Linde also stated that the proposed business combination between Praxair and Linde received antitrust clearance in South Korea.

The deadline for proposed concessions in the European Commission’s preliminary assessment of the deal was October 19. The Commission’s website showed that Sony had not submitted any.

393,"October 22, 2018",Singapore: Uber to appeal regulator’s decision on Grab deal,"

On Monday, October 22, Uber announced it will appeal a decision by Singapore’s antitrust watchdog that its merger with Grab violated the city-state’s competition laws, reported Reuters.
Last month, Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) slapped a US$9.5 million combined fine on Uber and Grab, ruling that the former’s takeover of the latter’s Southeast Asia operations had substantially decreased competition in the local ride-hailing market.


Uber stated it was making the appeal independently of Grab, as a matter of principle. Separately, Grab announced it would not appeal the regulator’s decision.
The CCCS’s ruling that the transaction led to a substantial lessening of competition, and that Uber had intentionally breached the law, was “unsupported and incorrect,” Uber claimed in a statement.
Uber asked the CCCS to annul its fine and claimed the regulator had used a very narrow definition of the ride-hailing market.
Uber disputed the CCCS’s allegation that Uber knew that the transaction infringed the law, but nevertheless moved ahead. “To the contrary, our view has always been that in a properly defined market – including at the very least ride-sharing, street-hail taxis and new entrants – the transaction respects the law and does not raise significant concerns,” it stated.

Caesars has reportedly rejected an offer from the owner of the Golden Nugget, according to the New York Post.
Caesars’ board is expected to unanimously reject Golden Nugget owner Tilman Fertitta’s deal as soon as this week, believing it would saddle the casino giant with too much debt, two sources close to the situation told The Post.
“That is certainly not attractive,” a source with knowledge of Caesars’ board’s thinking said, noting that it was a US$25 billion debt load from a 2008 leveraged buyout that had plunged Caesars into bankruptcy in 2015.
Instead, Caesars  is in advanced talks to buy a few properties from Jack Entertainment, a Midwest-based gaming company that owns six casinos in Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Detroit, the Post reported.
News of the possible merger sent stocks for Caesars soaring last week.

On Monday, October 22, the head of Telefonica Deutschland called for EU regulators to block Vodafone’s planned acquisition of Liberty Global, saying it would lead to a “quasi-monopolisation” of the German cable TV market.
Britain’s Vodafone agreed in May to pay US$21.8 billion to buy Liberty Global‘s assets in Europe, with the main prize being Germany’s Unitymedia, but still needs regulators’ approval.
“This takeover would mean the end of competition in the cable market and in the fixed broadband network,” Telefonica CEO Markus Haas said in a statement on Monday.
“We must not allow a quasi-monopolisation of important parts of the infrastructure, which is of decisive importance for the economic future of Germany, to take place.”
Vodafone sought EU antitrust approval for the deal on Friday, according to a filing on the European Commission website.

396,"October 22, 2018",The end of competition?,"
Posted by The Washington Post
The end of competition?
By Robert J. Samuelson
Competition is dying. That’s the latest complaint against American business. We have too many supersized firms, excessively large and unnaturally profitable. Dubious mergers, permitted by toothless antitrust laws, boost companies’ market power and squash rivals. The lifeblood of a dynamic economy is competition; its erosion — if true — would be a momentous event.
But is it true? Let’s see.
Superficially, there’s ample corroborating evidence. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and some other tech firms are massive and have dominant market positions in their chosen fields. Google — to take one obvious example — has about 90 percent of the Internet search market.
Mergers and acquisitions among large firms are also common, with antitrust laws providing only limited restraint. Just recently, the Justice Department (which shares antitrust enforcement with the Federal Trade Commission) approved the $69 billion health-industry merger between CVS and Aetna. Earlier, Justice challenged the $85 billion merger between Time Warner and AT&T, but a federal court backed the companies.
A number of studies indicate that economic consolidation — fewer firms providing goods and services — is occurring in many industries. The best-known report came in 2016 from President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). It found that all U.S. corporate mergers and acquisitions totaled about $2....

397,"October 22, 2018",US: Former US Solicitor General will no longer lobby against “NOPEC”,"
According to a report from Bloomberg, former Solicitor General Ted Olson will no longer lobby on behalf of Saudi Arabia against the proposed “NOPEC” bill after his law firm pulled out of the deal.
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher’s representation of the Saudi embassy concluded on Thursday, October 18, according to an updated filing with the Justice Department, which maintains registrations of foreign agents in the US.


Last month, the Saudi embassy contracted with Gibson to develop a white paper opposing the “No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act” legislation (NOPEC).
The House of Representatives introduced a version of the bill in May. The Senate has also revived legislation, which would amend the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which is the law used more than a century ago to break up the oil empire of John Rockefeller.
President Trump’s antitrust chief said earlier this month that the administration is “still studying that legislation,” in reference to NOPEC. “We don’t have an administration position on that,” US Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said after a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on October 3.

Microsoft’s upcoming US$7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub has cleared another major hurdle: the EU has approved the deal after determining that there are no antitrust concerns in Microsoft buying the popular open-source software repository, reported the Financial Times.
European antitrust authorities have reportedly determined that “the merged entity would continue to face significant ongoing competition from other players.” Officials also aren’t concerned that Microsoft could “undermine the open nature of GitHub,” noting that developers have other options they could switch to if Microsoft’s stewardship of the platform isn’t to their liking.
The GitHub purchase was first announced in June this year, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella commenting at the time, “We are committed to being stewards of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-first ethos, operate independently and remain an open platform. We will always listen to developer feedback and invest in both fundamentals and new capabilities.”

399,"October 21, 2018",Chile: Chinese Lithium giants face new antitrust hurdle,"
According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, a Chilean court is expected to rule in the coming week on a lawsuit aimed at derailing a deal critics say could create a cartel for lithium—a key component in batteries used in electric vehicles and smartphones.
The legal challenge is the latest twist in a nearly yearlong effort by China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp. to acquire a large stake in Chile’s biggest lithium producer, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM).
Last week, Reuters reported that both Albemarle and SQM have accused each other of overdrawing brine from the Atacama’s underground aquifers. Both companies have operations in the Atacama’s Salar, and their operations are just three miles apart from each other. The brine water that has been accumulating for millennia under the Atacama is lithium-rich, and companies pump it out and send the brine to evaporation ponds where heat extracts the water and leaves the reactive alkali metal behind.
A court hearing is set for Monday, October 22, with a decision expected shortly after. If the court throws out the suit, it would pave the way for the sale of the SQM stake to close in the fourth quarter. If the court agrees to review the suit, the deal would be delayed for an indefinite period.
Tianqi and Nutrien say the deal won’t be anticompetitive, citing limitations imposed by Chile’s competition regulator, such as restricting Tianqi from placing its own employees on SQM’s board.

Unilever also faces problems in Chile. Detergent companies Maritano and Cleaner have filed a complaint against Unilever before the National Economic Prosecutor’s Office, accusing the multinational of applying predatory prices.

StarKist—a subsidiary of South Korea’s Dongwon Group—has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of price-fixing, the Justice Department announced on Thursday, October 18.
The company faces a potential fine of US$100 million in connection with an agreement to fix canned tuna prices that ran from at least late 2011 to late 2013, the Department stated.
“The conspiracy to fix prices on these household staples had direct effects on the pocketbooks of American consumers,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.  “All Americans have the right to the benefits of free and open competition — the best goods and services at a price free from collusion.  We will continue to hold companies and individuals who cheat consumers accountable.”
“Our citizens’ confidence in the ability to buy goods within an unbiased market is key to sustaining an efficient and fair economy,” said Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett, FBI San Francisco. “This investigation stands as a symbol of our commitment to holding corporations and senior leadership accountable and ensuring that activities such as price fixing will not be tolerated.”
Bumble Bee agreed in May 2017 to plead guilty to one count of fixing the prices of canned tuna and to pay a criminal fine of US$25 million. Two Bumble Bee executives also agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing, as did one StarKist executive.

402,"October 18, 2018",UK: MP wants Zuckerberg to answer questions about adtech operations,"
According to TechCrunch, a British Conservative politician has made a public call for the UK’s competition regulator to look into Facebook’s adtech operations. Damian Collins, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee made the suggestion in a tweet that referenced a news article reporting on a US class action lawsuit against Facebook.


The tweet read:







According to TechCrunch, advertisers in the US lawsuit allege Facebook knowingly inflated video viewing stats and thus mislead them into spending more money on its ad platform than they otherwise would have.
But Facebook disputes the allegations, claiming the lawsuit is “without merit”. It has also filed a motion to dismiss the claims of ad fraud.

A spokeswoman for the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also declined to comment when asked whether it has any concerns related to practices in the adtech sector.

 And earlier this month the CMA’s CEO, Andrea Coscelli, told the Committee it is indeed considering doing so, if only it can carve out the resources to do so — saying he was worried about “potential gaps” in the regulatory framework around competition and consumer issues.
“A month ago, this Committee asked us to look at digital advertising. That is something we are actively considering, subject to Brexit in the next few weeks, because it has a big resource implication for us,” said Coscelli on October 9. “It is certainly something where we are interested in get...

A US appeals court will hear oral arguments on December 6 in the Justice Department’s (DOJ) fight against AT&T’s US$85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, the court announced on Wednesday, October 17.
The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14 after a US district court ruled the deal was legal under antitrust law. The DOJ has asked a federal appeals court to reverse that approval.
The core of the DOJ’s concern is that AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use its ownership of Time Warner’s content to make pay TV rivals pay more, thus raising their costs and forcing them to charge consumers more.
AT&T has stated it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019, or the conclusion of the government’s appeal.

According to Bloomberg, two former traders at Deutsche Bank AG were convicted by a New York jury of conspiring to rig LIBOR—a key interest-rate benchmark—handing a victory to US prosecutors targeting behavior by individuals at financial institutions that have paid billions of dollars to settle government claims.
On Wednesday, October 17, Matthew Connolly and Gavin Black were found guilty of trying to manipulate the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), which is used to value trillions of dollars of financial products, from 2004 to 2011.

Since regulators began a global crackdown on how the LIBOR benchmark is set, banks including Deutsche Bank and Barclays Bank have agreed to pay more than US$9 billion in fines. Dozens of traders have been fined, barred from the financial industry, or criminally charged in different countries. But only four, including Connolly and Black, have been found guilty at a US trial, and the other two convictions were reversed.Deutsche Bank was one of the worst offenders in the global rate-rigging scandals. Authorities said bank employees played central roles in manipulating LIBOR and a similar European benchmark known as Euribor. Both are based on the average borrowing rate of big banks and are used to value trillions of dollars of financial products.

Xerox in May scrapped a US$6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also handed control of the US photocopier giant to new management.
The ruling by the New York State Appellate Court could give the Japanese firm leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table. Fujifilm is also suing Xerox in a separate US suit that seeks well over US$1 billion, accusing it of breach of contract in abandoning the deal.

Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider is bringing its antitrust and intellectual property practices to California with its first West Coast outpost, putting down roots in San Francisco.
Antitrust partner Daniel Bitton and IP partner Jason Murata will relocate from New York and Connecticut, respectively, to lead the new Bay Area office.
“After spending 20 years at the firm developing a reputation as an elite antitrust and IP boutique, we felt the time was right to expand our footprint to the West Coast,” said Matthew Becker, Axinn’s managing partner.
Having a physical presence in the region brings the firm closer to several of its foundational clients, including Google, McKesson and Silver Lake Partners, Becker said. It also better positions the firm to serve the region’s broader tech sector. Northern California is “an epicenter in the U.S. for technology and scientific innovation,” he said.
“The Bay Area is really a hub for both tech and life science companies, servicing those types of companies has been our sweet spot, so we felt that it was really important to plant the flag,” Becker added. “And doing so would fit very nicely with our core practices of antitrust and IP, which are in very high demand in the region.”

The FTC case dates back to January 2017 and accuses Qualcomm of forcing companies like Apple to buy its wireless chips in exchange for better patent royalty rates. Apple was in an exclusive modem supply arrangement with Qualcomm for several years, but started mixing in Intel chips with 2016’s iPhone 7, and is now Intel-only with the iPhone XS.

412,"October 16, 2018",US: ACA warns DOJ against Disney’s Fox RSN divestitures,"
The American Cable Association (ACA) has urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) to bar Disney from selling Fox’s regional sports networks to any in-market, big-four TV station or MVPD, saying it would raise pay TV prices and create new antitrust problems.
In June, the DOJ signed off on Disney’s US$71.3 billion purchase of most of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets with the requirement that Disney divest Fox’s 22 regional sports networks.
At the time, the agency stated that without the divestitures, the deal would likely result in higher prices for cable sports programming licensed to MVPDs in local markets.
In a letter submitted to the DOJ Monday, October 15, as part of the agency’s Tunney Act review, the ACA claimed allowing an ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox station the same local market as the RSN to purchase it would create a similar issue the department found with Disney owning them. Operators would run into negotiation problems when one entity could potentially blackout two sets of must-have programming, resulting in a hike in MVPD licensing fees, the trade group says.
“Losing both sets of programming simultaneously is far worse than losing each set of programming individually,” ACA wrote.

The UK’s competition watchdog has announced that, in addition to groceries, its inquiry into Sainsbury’s planned buyout of Asda will examine the sale of petrol, toys, school uniforms, and small kitchen appliances.

The extent to which fast-growing discount chains Aldi and Lidl act as “close alternatives” to the two traditional grocers will also be considered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), according to a statement outlining the major issues it is considering in relation to the £10 billion (US$13.2 billion) merger of the UK’s second- and third-largest supermarkets.
Tuesday’s, October 16, “Issues Statement” sets out the key areas the CMA expects to scrutinise, at both a local and national level—including groceries, bought both in-store and online; fuel; and other items such as toys, small electricals, and children’s clothing.
It will assess whether the merger could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered.

414,"October 15, 2018",US: Nokia stands with Qualcomm in FTC SEP case,"

According to the World Intellectual Property Review, Nokia has sided with Qualcomm in its standard-essential patent (SEP) dispute with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
District Judge Lucy Koh allowed the FTC to file a response to Nokia’s amicus brief at the US District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division, on Friday, October 12.
The competition dispute between Qualcomm and the FTC dates back to January 2017, when the Commission accused the company of using unfair licensing tactics to maintain a monopoly in the supply of semiconductor devices.

Technology associations which represent companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google shared their support for the FTC’s position in an amicus brief in September.
Now, telecommunications company Nokia has filed an amicus brief in Qualcomm’s favor. Nokia warned against “novel and surprising interpretations” of the regulations governing SEPs which may have unintended consequences for SEP owners and the wider industry.
“Complications that would likely arise from inconsistent licensing obligations advocated for in the FTC’s motion for partial summary judgment could unravel the success of SEP licensing and standards development,” Nokia stated.
Last week, the FTC asked Judge Koh for leave to file its response to Nokia’s brief, as Nokia’s claims “miss the mark” in their interpretation of the FTC’s arguments.
The FTC’s response brief, attached to the motion for partial summary...

The Walt Disney Company has offered antitrust concessions to help secure EU approval of its US$71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets. The move was announced Monday, October 15, by the European Commission, which is reviewing competition concerns over the merger, with Disney having submitted its proposals Friday October 12. Details of the concessions offered were not disclosed.
The European regulator has also extended its deadline for reviewing the merger from October 19 to November 11. The Commission is expected to consult with customers and media competitors before deciding whether to accept Disney’s proposed concessions.
Disney received approval of the acquisition from the US Justice Department in June after agreeing to sell off Fox’s 22 regional sports networks. Disney and Fox shareholders voted to approve the buyout on July 27.

416,"October 15, 2018",EU: Gov proposes regulation of online marketplaces,"
European Union lawmakers have proposed new regulations aimed at stopping an online marketplace such as Amazon from using data from merchants’ product sales to boost sales of their own branded products.
Reuters reported that in April the EU laid out draft rules to stop what they claimed was an unfair marketplace where online merchants had access to the merchant data from products that sold on their platform, putting them at an advantage when they are hawking their own branded products. According to Reuters, the rules target app stores, search engines, eCommerce sites, and hotel booking websites. Lawmakers in the European Parliament have to approve the legislation. They are facing pressure to project a consumer-friendly face ahead of elections in May, noted the report. They, as a result of that, have included around 680 amendments to the rules since April, reported Reuters.
Among the proposals getting attention is one from Danish center-left lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, the lead parliament negotiator. According to the report, she proposed setting up a so-called Chinese wall between the units. She wants her committee to vote on the draft proposal on December 6, noted Reuters. In her amendment, she pointed to EU regulators’ antitrust investigations into the online merchants’ dual role of marketplace merchant and rival. “To ensure fairness, the provider of the online intermediation service should not be allowed to disclose the data generated by the transactions of a busi...

CPI TALKS ON THE CONSUMER WELFARE STANDARD
An Interview with Diana Moss (American Antitrust Institute)
by Jon Baker (American University)
Ahead of the inaugural conference on Challenges to Antitrust in a Changing Economy, at Harvard Law School on November 9th, CPI reached out to Jon Baker (Professor, American University) and Diana Moss (President, American Antitrust Institute). They will participate in “The Consumer Welfare Standard” panel, together with Rob Atkinson (President, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation), Renata Hesse (Partner, Sullivan & Cromwell), and Einer Elhauge (Professor, Harvard Law School).
In this exclusive interview, Diana Moss has responded to three questions asked by Professor Baker on the consumer welfare standard and its current application in US antitrust law.
This conference is co-organized by CPI and CCIA. To see the full program and register free, please click here.
Some progressives say that antitrust rules pay insufficient attention to harms to suppliers, including workers; harms along competitive dimensions other than price and output, such as quality or innovation; and the ways that the exercise of market power may undermine non-economic values, as by creating anti-democratic political pressures or limiting the opportunity of small businesses to compete. To what extent are these concerns justified?

418,"October 14, 2018",US: AT&T CEO raised idea of selling CNN to head off antitrust challenge,"
According to Bloomberg, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson floated the idea of selling CNN when he met with US antitrust officials last year in an attempt to head off a government lawsuit challenging the company’s proposed takeover of Time Warner, according to a deposition.
During a November meeting with the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Stephenson raised the possibility of selling CNN, reported Bloomberg.
Stephenson recounted the exchange during a deposition before the government’s lawsuit seeking to block the deal went to trial. Stephenson has disputed he ever offered to sell CNN to resolve the government’s concerns about the proposed merger.
According to a transcript obtained by Bloomberg, he was questioned by a Justice Department lawyer about the meeting with Delrahim.
“And during that meeting, you raised the subject of CNN?” the Justice Department lawyer asked.
“I did,” Stephenson said.
“OK. And you were the first one to raise the subject of CNN?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Stephenson, who went on to say, “I asked Mr. Delrahim, I think my language, this will be pretty close: ‘If I were to walk in here tomorrow and tell you I had gotten my head around selling CNN, would that allow you to wave this deal through?’ And he said, unequivocally, ‘No.’”

CME Group announced it has secured approval from the US antitrust regulator for its US$5.5 billion takeover of Michael Spencer’s NEX Group, moving the world’s biggest derivative exchange closer to securing a new avenue of growth, reported the Financial Times.
The US Department of Justice’s clearance, along with earlier approvals from other regulators in the United States, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, means that CME Group now has six approvals, with just the UK remaining. The exchange operator stated it was optimistic that it would win it soon.
If completed CME, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, will also be the dominant player in the US$500 billion a day market for US government debt.
The deal is now awaiting a formal ruling from the UK’s antitrust authorities, which is due on November 8.

A panel of federal judges has consolidated 17 lawsuits accusing Sinclair Broadcast Group and other media companies of scheming to artificially raise prices for local television advertisements, reported the Daily Record.
Cases pending in federal court in Maryland and Illinois will be combined with 15 related cases and heard in Illinois, a panel on multidistrict litigation ordered last week.
“The actions commonly allege that the conspiracy was effectuated by sharing competitively sensitive information through … advertising sales teams in order to raise advertising prices to supracompetitive levels,” said the order, filed Tuesday.
The complaint comes as the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division is actively investigating the defendants’ conduct after its recent review of the now-defunct merger between Sinclair and Tribune.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defended its rollback of Obama era net neutrality protections on Thursday, October 11, filing a legal brief with a federal appeals court that argues the agency has the right to change its mind, reported ArsTechnica.
The Republican-led FCC said it was within its legal right to roll back the 2015 rules, citing a Supreme Court decision from a decade earlier as precedent. The agency claimed says the rules, which imposed utility style regulation on broadband networks, stifled investment by internet service providers (ISPs).
The FCC’s Chairman Ajit Pai’s FCC argued that broadband is not a “telecommunications service” as defined in federal law, and therefore it must be classified as an information service instead. As an information service, broadband cannot be subject to common carrier regulations such as net neutrality rules, Pai.

Shares in India`s United Breweries  fell as much as 3% on Friday, October 12, a day after Reuters reported the brewer and two of its global rivals had been raided in India as part of an ongoing investigation into price-fixing allegations.
Reuters reported on Thursday that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted search and seizure operations at the offices of India`s United Breweries (UB), Denmark`s Carlsberg, and the world`s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) in at least two Indian cities.
Investors and analysts said shares in UB, which is known for its Kingfisher brand, were hit by fears that the CCI raids could result in penalties and potentially dent profits down the road.
“This is a highly regulated market and these are global players. So, allegations of price-fixing are extremely worrying for us,” said the head of a fund that owns shares in UB, who asked not to be named due to company policies.

DOJ giving cover to monopolizing firms that breach antitrust rules
By Michael Carrier
Imagine that a company makes a promise that an industry relies on, gains monopoly power as a result and then says “just kidding.” The head of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, recently gave this conduct an antitrust pass. That’s not right.
The setting for this scenario involves standards, which are ubiquitous in our high-tech, connected world. Our plugs fit into wall outlets, and our phones connect to wireless networks. The reason is simple. Industries have adopted standards with which companies build compatible products.
Some standards implicate patents. Here, there is a real concern that after companies are locked in to a standard, the patent holder will “hold up” the industry by demanding unreasonable royalties or even blocking products from the market.
For that reason, standards organizations have required patent holders to license on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms (FRAND).
These companies are essentially saying: “We don’t know if the standard ultimately incorporates our patents, but if it does (and to encourage the consideration of our technology), we agree that we will license on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.”
In a series of speeches, Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Delrahim has been skeptical of “patent holdup,” and in an address on Sep. 18, he stated that FRAND abuse would not violat...

The three-day event will examine the potential for collusive, exclusionary, and predatory conduct in multi-sided, technology-based platform industries.  The sessions will also examine antitrust frameworks for evaluating acquisitions of nascent competitors or occurring in nascent markets, including in the technology and digital marketplace; and the approach to addressing antitrust issues regarding labor markets.
The Commission invites public comment on these issues, including, the questions listed below.
Multi-Sided Platforms (October 15, 16, and 17):

What are the defining characteristics of multi-sided platforms? Is there a way to distinguish between multi-sided and single-sided businesses? Are any adjustments to antitrust analysis necessary to account for any special characteristics of multi-sided businesses?
How should the courts and agencies define relevant antitrust markets and measure market power for multi-sided platform businesses?
What is the relevance of network effects (direct and indirect) in multi-sided platform markets?

Pharmacy chain CVS won US antitrust approval for its US69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday, October 10, reported the Washington Post.
The merger can go ahead as long as Aetna sells off its private Medicare drug plans, the Justice Department said. The tie-up will allow CVS, whose retail pharmacy business serves 5 million customers a day, to turn more of its brick-and-mortar locations into front-line clinics for basic medical services and patient monitoring.
“Our focus will be at the local and community level,” CVS CEO Larry Merlo said, “taking advantage of our thousands of locations and touchpoints throughout the country to intervene with consumers to help predict and prevent potential health problems before they occur.”
According to the Post, the Aetna acquisition is also expected to give CVS more leverage in its negotiations with drugmakers over drug prices, analysts say.
This merger would combine the third-largest health insurer and the largest national pharmacy chain, but has come under fire from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.

428,"October 10, 2018",India: WhatsApp caves to local data storage demands,"
WhatsApp, Facebook’s messaging app that is trying to make inroads in the digital payments market in India, has created a system to store payment data locally in India.
Reuters, citing a statement from WhatsApp, reported the company confirmed it built the system in response to India’s payment data guidelines. India has required companies to store data locally on Indian consumers. According to Reuters, WhatsApp has a user base that is higher than 200 million in India, and has been trying to break into the payment market in the country.
While WhatsApp began testing payments in the country earlier this year with around one million users, it has delayed its formal launch partly due to a need for clarity on the part of Indian regulators as to how the data is supposed to be stored.
As the report noted, this comes as other companies have sought an extension of the October 15 deadline to ensure the data is local. Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have met with the Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to get extensions.
The move to launch a payment app in India makes sense, given that Credit Suisse predicts it will be a US$1 trillion market by 2023, reported Quartz. WhatsApp has been slow in launching its payment app in the country because it first needed the nod from the government.
In June, Bloomberg reported that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) asked WhatsApp, along with partner banks, to provide additional details about the sy...

JFTC, which made the first on-site inspection of Airbnb last October, would end the inspection because Airbnb had told their clients that the contract that kept them from listing on a rival website was no longer effective, reported Reuters.

On Tuesday, October 9, Europe’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said she wants to hear critics of Siemens and Alstom’s plan to create a Franco-German rail champion which is being investigated by the European Commission, reported Reuters.
The Commission in July opened a probe, saying the deal—which could create a global leader with three times the market share of its closest rival—could reduce competition and lead to higher fares for travelers.
“People are coming to us with concerns saying that this would be a very big company in Europe. The analysis is still ongoing. We hope anyone with concerns will come forward to us. It is not too late. Please come forward if there are any concerns,” Vestager told a European Parliament hearing.
German industrial group Siemens and French rival Alstom announced the planned rail merger in September last year, an industrial boost for French President Emmanuel Macron which has prompted criticism from opposition politicians. In July shareholders in Alstom voted in favor of the proposed merger with Siemens mobility division.
Vestager said the Commission’s investigation would look into the role of other big global companies in Europe and whether these would provide a competitive constraint to the merged company.

EU antitrust regulators have scrapped a year-long investigation into four Swedish mobile telecoms providers because there was insufficient evidence of wrongdoing, the European Commission announced on Monday, October 8.
The EU competition enforcer raided several mobile telecoms companies in Sweden in April last year on suspicion they may have blocked rivals from entering the market. Telia Co AB, Telenor ASA, 3 Sweden, and Tele2 AB subsequently confirmed the raids.
The Commission announced it was not taking further action.
“On the basis of the evidence found, the Commission concluded there was no sufficient grounds to pursue this preliminary investigation,” an EU representative said in a statement. Earlier on Monday, Tele2 stated the Commission had closed the probe.
“Today, the European Commission has informed Tele2 that the investigation has been closed without any further action,” Tele2 said in a statement.
Companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules face fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover.

433,"October 9, 2018",US: Re-file date granted in Coachella suit,"
Portland’s Soul’d Out Productions has been given until 25 October to re-file its lawsuit over Coachella’s radius clause, after a judge granted AEG’s motion to dismiss.
The antitrust suit filed against AEG and Coachella by Oregon promoter Soul’d Out has been partially dismissed by US federal judge Michael Mosman, who granted AEG’s motion to dismiss the antitrust claims, but declined to rule on other elements of the suit.
According to Aldrich, Soul’d Out has also been given the option of re-filing the antitrust suit should the plaintiff revise its definition of “relevant markets”.
“Establishing the correct product market is something the courts require with a degree of particularity [when assessing an antitrust dispute],” he explains.
Soul’d Out has been given a deadline of 25 October to re-file.

Dos de los principales funcionarios del Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos (DOJ) y la Comisión Federal de Comercio (FTC), declararon ante el Subcomité Judicial del Senado sobre Defensa de la Competencia, Política de Competencia y Derechos del Consumidor el miércoles 3 de octubre en una audiencia titulada: “Supervisión de “La aplicación de las leyes antimonopolio”.
Comenzando con una nota ligera, la Senadora Klobuchar (D-Minn) dió inicio la audiencia diciendo: “Me complace el repentino interés en nuestra audiencia antimonopolio … parte de esto tiene que ver con nuestros invitados … no creo que vayan a hacer un sketch de Saturday Night Live sobre esta audiencia … ”
El Fiscal General Adjunto del DOJ, Makan Delrahim, jefe de la División Antimonopolio del DOJ, y el Presidente del FTC, Joseph Simons, hablaron sobre la aplicación de la ley antimonopolio de las agencias y sobre las recientes fusiones, juicios, investigaciones y audiencias que han sostenido.
Delrahim habló sobre cómo el DOJ, como parte de una revisión más amplia, está revisando dos decretos de consentimiento de 70 años de antigüedad que aún se utilizan para determinar cómo se calculan los pagos de diversos proveedores de servicios de música para reproducir su contenido.

435,"October 8, 2018",US: Judge dismisses Coachella antitrust suit,"

According to a report from Billboard, a federal judge has dismissed an antitrust suit filed by an Oregon festival promoter against AEG and Coachella Thursday, October 4, but declined to rule on several other key elements of the lawsuit, including unfair competition claims.
In a ruling made from the bench, District of Oregon Judge Michael Mosman partially granted AEG’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Soul’D Out Productions, but gave the Oregon promoter leave to refill the lawsuit if they amended their definition of relevant markets, one of the key factors in evaluating an antitrust case.

“Establishing the correct product market is something the courts require with a degree of particularity,” said Nika Aldrich, who filed the suit against Coachella in April. He further told Billboard that his client had tried to book three acts also performing at the 125,000-person festival—Tank and the Bangas, SZA, and Daniel Caesar—for their Portland event, but were turned down because of Coachella’s 2018 radius clause.Judge Mosman declined to rule on those counts, and he later issued an order denying a request by Coachella organizers to strike a letter from evidence detailing the festival’s nationwide, five-month radius clause for the festival that takes place over two weekends in Indio, California and attracts 250,000 fans.

According to Reuters, US software giant Microsoft is set to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its US$7.5 billion purchase of privately held coding website GitHub.
GitHub, the world’s largest code host, has more than 28 million developers using its platform. It will become a part of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit once the acquisition is completed.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has tried to assuage users’ worries that GitHub might favor Microsoft products over competitors after the deal, saying GitHub would continue to be an open platform that works with all public clouds.
“Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation,” Nadella said in a release when announcing the deal in May.

According to the Financial Times, eight investment consultants, including the “big three” of Aon Hewitt, Mercer, and Willis Towers Watson, are taking part in the talks, dubbed Project Spotlight. One intention is to develop standards for the disclosure of performance and costs charged to pension schemes.
The meetings come as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looks into the role of investment consultants, which advise trustees on choosing fund managers and asset classes.
The CMA has warned that pension fund trustees did not have sufficient information to be able to judge if they are getting a good deal.

The talks are being hosted by IC Select, the governance specialist. IC Select stated smaller investment consultants including Cardano, KPMG, Momentum, Redington, and River and Mercantile had agreed to take part.

On Monday, October 8, Australia’s competition regular declared that Port of Newcastle Operations (PNO) must reduce its charges for ships entering the port to carry coal for global miner Glencore, Reuters reported.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) stated that PNO should cut its current rate by about 20%. According to Reuters, the port said it would contest the decision.
“PNO proposed large increases to the current price, but the ACCC found that a reduction in the price for using the shipping channel was appropriate,” ACCC Commissioner Cristina Cifuentes said in a statement.

The port stated it was disappointed by the decision. “We will use all legal avenues available to contest the decision. We will be lodging a request for review with the Australian Competition Tribunal,” it stated.

Linde said that the proposed business combination between Praxair and Linde received antitrust clearance in South Korea.
Linde is a public limited company formed on April 18, 2017, that will become the parent company of Praxair  and Linde upon the completion of the business combination.


Last week Linde announced that the company’s US$83 billion merger with Praxair has received Chinas’s regulatory approval. This leaves  the companies waiting for approval from European, US, and South Korean authorities.
The companies are both in the process of selling various assets to win the three remaining regulators’ approval.

Simons also said he does not know “anything” about the leaked draft of a proposed executive order directing federal agencies to conduct an antitrust investigation of the big technology companies.
Simons was asked if there should be a federal antitrust investigation of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.
“It’s not appropriate to comment on specific companies but you heard what I said, right, that this is an area of concern for us,” Simons said after his speech at the recent Georgetown University Law Center’s 2018 Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium.

The European Commission has concluded that Slovakia’s €125 million investment aid to Jaguar Land Rover is in line with EU State aid rules.
Margrethe Vestager, Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said: “Our investigation confirmed that Slovakia’s €125 million public support to Jaguar Land Rover for its project to build a new car plant in the region of Nitra is in line with our State aid rules. Our investigation revealed that the aid was necessary for Jaguar Land Rover to invest in Europe rather than in Mexico. We also found that the measure will contribute to job creation and to the economic development of a disadvantaged region without unduly distorting competition.”
Jaguar Land Rover is investing €1.4 billion to build a car manufacturing facility in the region of Nitra (Slovakia), an area eligible for regional aid under EU State aid rules (Art. 107(3)(a) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union). The plant is due to have a production capacity of 150,000 cars per year. The project is expected to create about 3,000 direct jobs.
Slovakia notified the Commission of its plans to grant €125 million of public support for the project. This represents the maximum aid that can be granted for such a project under the Commission’s Guidelines on Regional State Aid for 2014-2020, which enable Member States to support economic development and employment in the EU’s less developed regions and to foster regional cohesion in ...

442,"October 4, 2018",US: Antitrust Chief vows to scrutinize Comcast,"
Antitrust regulators plan to scrutinize Comcast’s management of streaming video service Hulu, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said Wednesday, October 3.
“Certainly Hulu could be a competitor to the cable business,” Delrahim, the DOJ’s antitrust chief, told a Senate subcommittee at an oversight hearing. “And it’s one that we will examine carefully to see if they might take any conduct that would harm its ability to compete.”
Delrahim’s comments came in response to questions from Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), who asked whether Comcast’s new ability to help run Hulu could pose a risk to consumers.
When Comcast merged with NBCUniversal in 2011, the company agreed to refrain from managing Hulu for seven years. That term expired recently, leaving Comcast free to take an active role in overseeing Hulu. Last month, Comcast appointed three directors to the board of Hulu. The company—formed in 2007 as a joint venture between Fox and Disney, is currently owned by Comcast, Disney—Fox, and AT&T.
This summer, shortly before Comcast’s merger conditions expired, Delrahim said the DOJ planned to monitor the company.

The UK’s competition watchdog has handed Lloyds legal directions after the lender failed to meet its obligations around managing accounts with payment protection insurance (PPI), the policy at the center of a huge mis-selling scandal.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called on the lender to “put effective systems and procedures in place” after it made multiple breaches of a 2011 market order by the regulator.
The CMA claimed this is not the first time Lloyds has broken the rules, which have been in place since 2011, as the bank reported six breaches two years ago.
“We are disappointed that Lloyds has again failed to provide these important reminders or provide accurate data to its customers,” said CMA director Adam Land.
The CMA stated that “given the continued failure” of Lloyds to comply, it will now issue the bank legal directions to make sure it follows certain measures.

On Wednesday, October 3, the European Commission’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that her country’s government did not support naming her for another mandate at the European Union’s executive body, reported Reuters.

According to Reuters, Vestager has a high profile in Brussels after attacking tax dodging allegations and monopoly powers among US multinationals including Google and Apple as the EU competition commissioner.
“My native member state doesn’t seem too enthusiastic about giving me another mandate,” Vestager said at a news conference in Paris. “And that would be an understatement.”
Vestager is a former leader of the Danish Social Liberal Party, which opposes the country’s ruling conservatives.
“The tradition in my country is that it is the biggest party in government that names the commissioner,” Vestager told reporters. “Since my party is not in the government, at least you would have to break the tradition.”

A year ago, the Denver Film Society announced it would join an antitrust lawsuit against Landmark Theatres; the indie film giant responded with a request for the case to be dismissed. Monday, October 1, the Film Society announced that part of Landmark’s request has been denied and the case will continue on in the courts.
The claim accuses Landmark Theatres of violating federal antitrust laws by preventing smaller arthouse theaters from screening certain films by negotiating exclusive contracts with distributors.
In a September 28 opinion, Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote that he dropped some parts of the case based on Landmark’s request, but is allowing others to continue in court.
“We’re pleased with the court’s decision in favor of our lawsuit moving forward,” said the Denver Film Society’s executive director, Andrew Rodgers, in a statement. “While we know there will be additional steps in the legal process, we’re confident that Landmark’s anticompetitive practices are unlawful, including Landmark’s insistence on exclusive rights to screen specialty films that eliminate local competition for those films despite consumer demand.”

The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued California over its new new neutrality law, a little over an hour after Gov. Jerry Brown  signed the bill, reported the Financial Times.

The lawsuit claims the California bill is “unlawful and anti-consumer” because it goes against the federal government’s “deregulatory approach to the Internet.” Jeff Sessions, the US attorney-general, declared the California law “extreme” and “illegal”, arguing that the states could not regulate interstate trade.
“The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today, but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our constitutional order,” he said. “We will do so with vigor.”
Jerry Brown signed the state’s net neutrality bill into law on Sunday, September 30, to restore Obama-era protections that prevented internet service providers from charging extra for fast-lane services or discriminating against certain sites.

So how do they treat the data that they get from the little guy? Does that give them an advantage that cannot be matched?”

The head of the Germany’s antitrust watchdog, Andreas Mundt, said he is “very optimistic” that his office will take action against Facebook later this year, reported Reuters.
The social media giant has faced extreme scrutiny from European and German lawmakers in the past year due to a host of issues, including the Cambridge Analytic scandal and allegations of unfair competition with rivals.
“We are currently evaluating Facebook’s opinion on our preliminary assessment, and I’m very optimistic that we are going to take further steps, even this year, whatever this would mean,” Mundt told attendees at a conference on competition law in Berlin on Monday, October 1.
The worst-case scenario for Facebook in this event is Germany ruling it a monopoly and ordering it to break up–though such action would face years of legal challenges.

The Competition and Market Authority (CMA) is looking for companies which are using big data to rip off vulnerable consumers after Greg Clark, business secretary, said he would trigger a far-reaching review into business practices related to big data, reported the Financial Times.
Mr Clark has asked Andrew Tyrie, head of the CMA, to advise him on an overhaul of Britain’s business regulation, for which he said he was ready to legislate. The business secretary said there were warning signs in the way companies had used personal data to exploit customers, such as energy groups imposing higher charges on loyal customers, who failed to shop around.
Lord Tyrie said the CMA had done “a lot of thinking” about how to reform Britain’s regulatory regime.
“The most effective competition bodies will be those that respond to the rapid growth in these new markets,” he said, adding that millions of consumers would enjoy greater choice thanks to technology, while others would still be vulnerable to “exploitation.”

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) antitrust chief said Friday, September 28, he’s unsettled by allegations that the biggest US technology companies are suppressing conservative voices on their platforms.
Whether the bias claimed by Republicans—which companies from Facebook to Google and Twitter have denied—is harmful “depends on what kind of bias we are talking about,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said at a Friday morning event organized by news outlet Axios. “I’m concerned about the concerns that have been raised.”
Delrahim confirmed that the agency has heard anecdotes about technology firms taking steps to block new entrants into the industry, though “I don’t know if any of the enforcement bodies necessarily have that credible evidence.”
There isn’t a question of whether some companies have significant market power, Delrahim noted, but whether “they are taking action that harms a new entrant’s ability.”

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Thursday, September 27, released information in a detailed explanation of why it last week announced it would refer the proposed merger of grocery store chains Asda and Sainsbury’s for an in-depth investigation.
The CMA found that the planned £12 billion (US$15.7 billion) merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda risks substantially lessening competition in 463 areas where the businesses overlap.
The regulator raised the prospect of a substantial sell-off of stores in order to satisfy the regulator that the deal can go through, as it had previously stated that where stores’ overlap it could mean shoppers facing higher prices or a worse quality of service.
The CMA stated it would not allow the deal to go ahead if its concerns are not fully addressed.

456,"September 27, 2018",US: Nine State Attorneys General support AT&T in TW suit,"
Nine state attorneys general–seven Republican and two Democratic–filed an amicus brief late Wednesday, September 26, in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit declaring their support for the AT&T/Time Warner merger and their opposition to the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) arguments.
“What is truly unusual, especially in a merger of such national scope, is that not a single state decided to join the federal government’s antitrust action here or file a supporting amicus brief,” Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel (Republican) wrote in the 25-page brief.
Republican state attorneys general from Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Utah—as well as two Democratic AGs from Kentucky and New Mexico—joined the Wisconsin-authored brief.
In June, a federal district judge ruled that the federal government’s opposition to the AT&T merger had no basis in fact or law. The DOJ appealed to the DC Circuit.

457,"September 27, 2018",US: Aetna divests Medicare business seeking CVS merger approval,"
Aetna announced plans on Thursday, September 27, to sell its Medicare prescription-drug business to WellCare Health Plans, a key step towards gaining regulator approval for its US$67.5 billion merger with CVS.
Although financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, in a securities filing, Aetna stated that the “purchase price is not material” to the company. The divestiture of the Medicare Part D to WellCare may help resolve objections to the CVS-Aetna deal from US antitrust regulators.
The company stated in the filing that, “Aetna believes the divestiture is a significant step toward completing the DOJ’s (Department of Justice) review.”
WellCare, a smaller health insurer that’s based in Tampa, Florida, has been using deals to fuel its expansion. The company completed a US$2.5 billion deal for the health insurer Meridian in early September, adding about 1.1 million insurance customers to its base of 4.4 million members.

458,"September 26, 2018",US/EU: Vestager talks about big tech and Amazon,"
On Wednesday, September 26, EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager sat down at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York and discussed in an interview a number of topics currently of interest in the EU and in the US, primarily focusing on big tech.
When asked about the recently announced probe into Amazon’s data practices related to third party sellers, she responded, Amazon is a two-sided marketplace with dual functions… They provide a lot of services to small businesses, which allow them to be active in e-commerce. And that’s great. [But] they also grow themselves—[into] books, movies, groceries… Of course, they get all the data from the little guys, and we want to understand how that data is being used.”
Later in the interview, Ms. Vestager was asked about the popular belief that the EC is specifically targeting US tech companies since Europe does not have any comparable companies. She responded, “It’s not about your flag, or whether you are a public or a private company. It’s about your competitive spirit. You are supposed to compete.” She continued on to say that the EU’s laws were not drafted to impede innovation and growth while discussing the two massive Google fines.

459,"September 26, 2018",US: Some State AGs Could Launch Joint Inquiries Into Tech Companies,"
Some state attorneys general are worried about the dominance of the big tech leaders and could launch joint inquiries into the likes of Google and Facebook.
The Wall Street Journal, citing US AGs that attended a meeting hosted by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, reported Republican AG Doug Peterson of Nebraska said officials are looking at launching a multistate inquiry into the leading tech companies with an eye toward protecting consumer privacy and looking into antitrust concerns. “There’s certainly enough interest expressed by the attorneys general who were there today, and I think [we] will continue to move forward,” Peterson told the Wall Street Journal in an interview. Given the intense scrutiny the tech giants are already under, a move by the AGs to launch an inquiry would be yet another regulatory battle the big tech companies would have to contend with.
According to the Wall Street Journal, during the meeting of the AGs a lot of the discussions were on the data that technology companies collect from users and the transparency of the terms of use. The paper noted that some AGs want to investigate the power of the companies while others are worried about the potential for political bias on the platforms. That didn’t garner as much attention as the other issues during the meeting, noted the report.  The Justice Department told the WSJ it plans to review the information from the meeting and that it “expects this dialogue will continue in the near future.”...

460,"September 26, 2018",US: FTC Chairman: we’re looking at big tech’s startup buys,"
At a conference hosted by Georgetown Law in Washington, DC, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Joseph Simons said that the Commission is “thinking about what to do and how to bring cases” regarding big tech companies buying up small startups.
YouTube and Instagram were both young startups when Google and Facebook bought them. More recently, Microsoft proposed to buy GitHub for US$7.5 billion and Amazon bought online pharmacy PillPack for US$1 billion.
“These types of transactions are particularly difficult for antitrust enforcers to deal with because the acquiring firm is, by definition, not a full-fledged competitor,” Simons said. “And also the likely level of competition with the acquiring firm is frequently, maybe more than frequently, not apparent. But harm to competition can nonetheless be significant.”
The FTC has had a series of hearing this month to examine “whether broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies, or international developments might require adjustments to competition and consumer protection enforcement law, enforcement priorities, and policy,” according to the FTC’s website.

The Effects of Rapid Technological Change on Regulatory Policies in the Communications Sector
By Robert Crandall 
Predicting what future changes in technology may occur is often an impossible endeavor. Designing effective regulatory policies around changing technologies is even more difficult, as it requires understanding how those changes may alter market conditions that often render such policies obsolete or even counterproductive. This report draws on a sizable history of past regulatory and antitrust interventions whose results demonstrate that:
• In a fast-changing industry, it is often very difficult to predict developments that dramatically change the market.
• In industries characterized by rapid technological change, regulation often leads to counterproductive constraints on firms. Moreover, history shows that such counterproductive regulations are often hard to lift and stay in place for a long time.
• The wireless industry is in the midst of a major technological change, a move to 5G, and competitors have already successfully entered with new business models (cable companies, DISH, and others, including Google and other tech companies). As a result, predicting future market conditions is particularly difficult.
• Therefore, at this time the regulators should be particularly cautious intervening.

A proposed merger between Aetna and CVS has come under fire from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).
In a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, AAPS President-elect Marilyn Singleton, MD, JD, said that the merger would be bad for patients.
“Mergers can decrease competition and such mergers are not in the interest of our patients,” Singleton wrote.
The merger would combine the third-largest health insurer and the largest national pharmacy chain, which has the dominant pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), CVS Caremark, the AAPS wrote in a statement.
“This merger is particularly troubling in light of the highly concentrated national market for PBM services and current lack of transparency in drug pricing and PBM contracts,” Singleton wrote.

466,"September 25, 2018",US: States met with DOJ on antitrust action against social media giants,"
The representatives of 13 states plus the District of Columbia met with top Justice Department officials to discuss what could result in a comprehensive, federal government antitrust effort against the country’s top social media companies, reported Reuters and BuzzFeed.
According to Reuters, the meeting focused on how tech companies handle user data and whether privacy issues can be addressed using antitrust law, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
“The conversation really zeroed in on privacy,” he said. “We talked about having some more conversation… The principle conversation revolved around privacy and antitrust.”
The attorneys general of Alabama, California, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Utah attended, as well as representatives from the offices of Arkansas, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Washington.
The DOJ originally announced the meeting in the immediate aftermath of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that quizzed Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about their policies. While that hearing never addressed whether the social media platforms discriminated against conservative viewpoints, it came after Apple, Google, and Facebook had banned right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who during a break berated Florida Senator Marco Rubio (Republican), claiming that tech companies’ decision to ban him from their platforms was evidence those companies are “purging conservatives.”

467,"September 25, 2018",UK: Mercer attacks CMA over “flawed” data,"
Investment consultancy Mercer has criticized the UK’s competition watchdog for using flawed data in its analysis of the institutional advisory and fiduciary sectors, reported the Financial Times.
Mercer wrote to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week flagging concerns about the data behind a recent report that highlighted concerns about the competitiveness of investment consultants and fiduciary managers.
“We have several concerns about the CMA’s data analysis. These include the use of incorrect data, errors in the CMA’s analytical code and reliance on unrepresentative samples,” Fiona Dunsire, UK chief executive of Mercer wrote.
Mercer stated it found flaws in the data used to examine how trustees of pension funds are engaged. The CMA found that less engaged schemes pay significantly higher prices than more engaged schemes when they move into fiduciary management with their investment consultants. Mercer, however, claimed there was a “significant error” in the analytical code the CMA used in its work on engagement.
The competition authority embarked on its probe last September after receiving a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) referral that highlighted “serious concerns” over how investment consultants operate. It marked the first time the FCA had used the referral powers since they were introduced three years ago.

468,"September 25, 2018",New Zealand: Court of Appeal rejects proposed media merger,"
The Court of Appeal has knocked back the proposed media merger between NZME and Stuff. Stuff’s parent company, Fairfax Media, is also the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

The two companies were challenging a judge’s refusal to give the merger the green light after the Commerce Commission first rejected the deal. In May last year, the Commission declined to authorize the tie-up, arguing it would concentrate too much media influence in one business.
The subsequent High Court appeal by New Zealand Herald owner NZME and Stuff was unsuccessful when Justice Robert Dobson found that the regulator was entitled to place significant weight on the perceived loss of media plurality in the deal.
The companies then took the challenge to the Court of Appeal, focusing on the regulator rejecting the merger “against a backdrop of very large quantified net benefits,”, which the High Court found to be between NZ$133 million (US$83.4 million) and NZ$209 million (US$138.9 million).
The Court of Appeal, however, was not swayed and dismissed the challenge on Monday, September 24.

469,"September 24, 2018","Singapore: CCCS finds Grab/Uber abused dominance, imposes remedies","
Grab and Uber were slapped with fines and restrictions after the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) concluded the merger between the two resulted in higher prices.
Reuters, citing the CCCS, reported the combined US$9.5 million in fines was small compared to the companies’ valuations; it, along with other measures, marks the largest actions against the two companies since they announced their deal in March. In the deal, Uber sold its Southeast Asian unit to Grab and got 27.5% of the company as a result. Reuters noted that the CCCS said Grab drivers have to be able to work for anyone and not exclusively for Grab and that any exclusivity deals with taxi fleets have to be canceled. Meanwhile, Uber has to sell its car rental business to a rival if it makes a reasonable offer and can’t sell the vehicles to Grab unless it gets approval by regulators. Reuters reported that the Uber unit known as Lion City has 14,000 vehicles as of December.
In announcing the actions in which Uber was fined S$6.6 million (US$4.8 million) and Grab was fined S$6.4 million (US$4.7 million), Reuters reported the CCCS stated fares have increased between 10% and 15% since the deal was announced and that Grab now has 80% market share. Uber told Reuters it is considering appealing, saying the ruling was due to an “inappropriately narrow definition of the market.” Grab told Reuters it would follow the ruling of the CCCS. Meanwhile, Indonesian competitor Go-Jerk welcomed the moves...

470,"September 24, 2018",UK: PayPal-iZettle deal probed,"
As reported by the Financial Times, the United Kingdom’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), stated, in what is known as an initial enforcement order, that it will examine whether the merger between US-based PayPal and Sweden’s iZettle has a detrimental impact on competition in the UK
As has been widely reported, the US$2.2 billion deal between the two companies was consummated Thursday, September 21, and had been announced in May.
The FT noted that initial enforcement orders are “issued regularly” by the CMA. The orders themselves are not direct lead-ins to a formal investigation, but it is likely that there will be an embrace of at least the first stage of the merger review. There is no timetable for the initial review of the merger.
The initial review came after the CMA stated it hired Harvard professor Jason Furman to conduct what is being billed as a “digital competition inquiry,” charged with examining competition in the tech industry.
Though the investigation may not be formal at the time of this writing, the order that was issued Thursday stipulated that PayPal and iZettle must “freeze” any additional corporate activity that leads to more integration between the two firms or “otherwise impair” PayPal and iZettle from being able to act independently from one another.
PayPal announced that it is “working cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review. PayPal and iZettle brands and operations will be held separat...

The deal comes three weeks after the EU finally gave a green light to the deal after Apple first made its intention to buy it public.

Sony will know by October 26 whether EU antitrust regulators will wave through its US$2.3 billion  offer for control of EMI to become the world’s largest music publisher, according to a filing on the European Commission website on Monday, September 24.
The proposed acquisition is the boldest strategy move by Sony’s new CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, which would give it rights to 2.1 million songs from artists such as Drake, Sam Smith, Pharrell Williams, and Sia.
EU antitrust enforcers can clear the deal with or without concessions, or open a four-month investigation if they have serious concerns.
“This transaction would disrupt competition and harm consumers in an already overly concentrated music market. Given recent precedents set by the European Commission, we believe Sony’s takeover will face stiff opposition,” said Helen Smith, independent music association Impala’s executive chair.
Sony, which announced the deal in May said it would pay about US$2.3 billion to gain control of EMI to become the world’s largest music publisher in an industry that has found new life on the back of streaming services.

After three rounds of secret bidding on Friday and Saturday, September 21 and 22, Comcast offered the higher price of £17.28 (US$22.62) per share for Sky, the equivalent of nearly £30 billion (US$39.2 billion) in total for the company. Rival 21st Century Fox offered £15.67 (US$20.52) per share.
Sky shareholders must now decide whether to sell their shares to Comcast. Comcast stated it hopes to complete the sale by the end of October.
The Comcast offer values Sky at almost £4 billion (US$5.2 billion) more than the Disney-Fox bid and was recommended to shareholders by Sky’s independent committee, which was set up to evaluate the takeover bids.
Fox currently owns 39% of Sky. It now must decide whether to sell its stake or remain a minority shareholder.
“Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team,” Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said in a statement. “This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.”
British regulators organized the auction in part to ensure that Sky’s value didn’t erode during the long bidding process.

According to a report by Billboard, musician Ozzy Osbourne has had his antitrust lawsuit against AEG dismissed with prejudice after company officials announced plans to end its policy requiring acts that wanted to play the O2 Arena in London to also play Staples Center in Los Angeles.
On Friday, September 21, Osbourne’s attorney Daniel Wall filed a stipulation to dismiss the case, ending the lawsuit filed in March against AEG. The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Osbourne can’t refile the lawsuit.
AEG had used a clause in its contracts with performers that required performers who used the O2 arena to also perform at the Staples Center, allegedly to counter Azoff MSG’s reported block-booking requirement that performers play at The Forum in Los Angeles to get access to Madison Square Garden in New York.
AEG announced it would drop its policy, contingent to Azoff’s own alleged policy not returning. Nine days after AEG’s announcement, Osbourne dismissed his lawsuit.
AEG stated in response to the dismissal that, “The Osbourne suit was instigated by Azoff and paid for by MSG and Live Nation. It was hatched on the back of an artist who we believe had no idea what he was biting off. The suit was a transparent public relations ploy that failed to pressure AEG into backing down from a booking policy that was an effective competitive response to the MSG-Forum tie.”

The European Commission announced on Friday, September 21, that it is inviting comments on Romanian state-owned gas pipeline operator Transgaz’s commitments to increase its export capacities in a bid to end an antitrust investigation.
The commitments would aim to enable natural gas exports from Romania to other EU Member States, in particular Hungary and Bulgaria.
Following a formal investigation opened in June 2017, the Commission has concerns Transgaz may have breached EU competition rules by restricting exports of natural gas from Romania.
Transgaz has now proposed to increase the export capacities from 0.1 billion cubic meters to four billion cubic meters per year at the interconnection points with Hungary and Bulgaria and ensure its tariff proposal to the Romanian national energy regulator will not discriminate between export and domestic tariff.
The commitments would remain in force until the end of 2025 and a trustee would be in charge of monitoring the company’s compliance.

According to Reuters’ sources, Anheuser-Busch InBev is set to receive a fine from the European Commission for preventing cheaper beer imports into Belgium.
In 2017, the EC claimed that AB InBev was abusing its market dominance and blocking the brands Jupiler and Leffe from entering Belgium more cheaply from France or the Netherlands.
With its dominant position in the Belgian beer market, the Commission alleged that AB InBev has pursued a deliberate strategy to prevent supermarkets and wholesalers from buying Jupiler and Leffe at lower prices in the Netherlands and France, and from importing them into Belgium.
The EC can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover, but the sources said a formal decision will take some time before it is announced.

Pharmaceutical company Abbvie had its shares drop about 3% last week after California’s insurance commissioner Dave Jones sued the company, alleging Abbvie has been providing kickbacks in the form of nursing support and insurance assistance to prompt doctors to write prescriptions for its arthritis drug Humira.
Mr. Jones, who filed a complaint in Alameda County Superior Court, alleges the company’s “Ambassador” program was intended to “keep patients on a dangerous drug at any cost.”
AbbVie claimed in a statement that it “operates in compliance with the many state and federal laws that govern interactions with healthcare providers and patients.”
Credit Suisse analysts said that the lawsuit could have extensive repercussions in the drug industry since the kickback practices “are similar to what other biopharma companies have also used to help patients start and stay on medications that their doctor prescribes.”

Twenty-First Century Fox and Comcast are heading for an auction to settle a takeover of British broadcaster Sky, reported the Wall Street Journal.
The bidding process will officially begin on Friday evening, September 21, and will come to end on the following day, the UK’s Takeover Panel said Thursday, September 20, with a maximum of three rounds to decide the fate of the deal. Each bid must be made in cash.
The UK Takeover Panel, which polices deal making in the country, laid out rules for the auction. It is a process the regulator hasn’t run many times previously and never before with such a large company as the prize. London-listed Sky has a market value of some US$35 billion.
Such government-mandated auctions of big, publicly traded companies are rare reported the Journal. The Sky auction pits Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, which already owns 39% of Sky, against Comcast.
Mr. Murdoch has long sought to consolidate his holding in London-based Sky. Disney and Comcast see Sky as a way to expand internationally. The broadcaster also sells wireless, TV, and internet services throughout Europe, and it is a media company that produces its own news, entertainment and sports programming.

479,"September 20, 2018",The Tragedy of the Successful Firm,"
Twenty years after the emergence of platform literature antitrust courts and authorities still face formidable challenges in deciphering platform business models. The latest two Google cases (Google Search, Google Android) highlight the schism between what firms consider an innovative business plan and what the law is ready to accept. Noting the schism, this article focuses on a number of points that European competition law needs to address to better reconcile business practice with antitrust legal analysis with the view to enable successful firms to operate without fear of punitive enforcement.

480,"September 19, 2018",EU: Vestager opens probe into Amazon,"
Amazon’s business model is under the spotlight in Europe after the EU’s antitrust watchdog launched a preliminary investigation into how the platform uses data about merchants, reported the Wall Street Journal.
The informal probe concerns the e-commerce group’s dual role as a competitor while simultaneously acting as host to third-party merchants, who sell goods on Amazon’s websites, Margrethe Vestager, EU Competition Commissioner, said on Wednesday, September 19.
“The question here is about the data,” Ms. Vestager said, adding that the investigation was in its “very early days” and that her office has “no conclusions” about whether to open a formal probe.
The Amazon marketplace investigation follows up on concerns raised by retailers in the course of an e-commerce sector inquiry in 2017 about so-called “dual-role” platforms, reported the Journal. A typical example for such a dual-role platform is Amazon, which, on the same website, offers marketplace services to third-party sellers and sells products as an online retailer in direct competition with those third-party sellers.
Amazon might thereby gain access to competitively sensitive information about competitors’ products that it could use to boost its own retail activities at the expense of third-party sellers on its marketplace. The purpose of the preliminary investigation is to verify whether these concerns have any merit and need to be followed up.

481,"September 19, 2018",EU: Commission says McDonald’s Luxembourg tax deal not illegal,"
Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s avoided having to repay millions of euros in back taxes after EU antitrust regulators announced that its tax deal with Luxembourg was not illegal, citing issues in the Grand Duchy’s bilateral tax treaty with the United States.
The decision announced on Wednesday, September 19, is the first formal investigation in EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s five-year crackdown on tax rulings where she concluded that an arrangement was not illegal under the EU’s state-aid rules.
Vestager said the in-depth investigation had found the reason for double non-taxation was “a mismatch between Luxembourg and US tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg.”
“The good thing about this outcome is of course that it’s a case that proves that we don’t see state-aid where there is no state-aid,” Ms. Vestager said.
Rather than state aid, the Commission found tax loopholes that had allowed a McDonald’s franchising unit to avoid paying taxes on either side of the Atlantic. Ms. Vestager said Luxembourg’s treatment of McDonald’s defies tax fairness, but doesn’t amount to a special deal because it is in line with a US-Luxembourg double-taxation treaty. Luxembourg is now changing its domestic tax laws to close loopholes.

Britain’s competition regulator referred Sainsbury’s 7.3 billion-pound ($9.60 billion) takeover of Asda for an in-depth review on Wednesday because their stores overlapped in hundreds of local areas.
The Competition and Markets Authority said shoppers could face higher prices or a worse quality of service in places where both chains had shops.
“The companies are two of the largest grocery retailers In the UK and their stores overlap in hundreds of local areas, where shoppers could face higher prices or a worse quality of service,” the CMA said.
The competition regulator will also consider the impact on fuel, general merchandise such as clothing and the joint entity’s increased buying power over suppliers.
The proposed merger, which was announced in April, would see Sainsbury’s take control of Walmart subsidiary Asda in a deal that would create Britain’s biggest grocer by market share, leapfrogging Tesco.

484,"September 18, 2018","US: Visa, Mastercard reach US$6.2bn settlement over card-swipe fees","

On Tuesday, September 18, Visa, Mastercard, and a number of US banks agreed to pay US$6.2 billion to settle a long-running antitrust suit brought by merchants over the fees they pay when they accept card payments, reported Reuters.
Visa and Mastercard previously reached a US$7.25 billion settlement with the merchants in the case, but that deal was thrown out by a federal appeals court in 2016 and the US Supreme Court last year refused to revive it.
“After years of thoughtful negotiation, we are pleased to be able to reach this agreement and move forward in our partnership with merchants to provide consumers convenient, reliable, secure ways to pay,” Kelly Mahon Tullier, Visa’s general counsel, said in a statement.
As part of the payment, Visa and Mastercard will use shares owned by banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The lawsuit is one of many flashpoints in the battle between retailers and financial firms over the US$90 billion that US merchants spend every year on swipe fees, reported Bloomberg..
Some Outstanding Issues Remain
If finalized, the US$6.2 billion settlement would largely put to rest a case that traces its genesis to 2005 and had been brought by 12 million retailers.
It should be noted, though, that the all-cash agreement — the largest antitrust settlement on the books — had, in fact, been US$5.7 billion, because about 8,000 merchants had opted out of the agreement. Among those merchants that opted out were marquee names su...

The European Commission has opened a formal investigation to determine whether BMW, Daimler and VW colluded to avoid competing with each other on clean emission technologies. The EU is assessing whether the companies met to limit the development of catalytic systems that reduce nitrogen oxide diesel emissions and particulate matter (“Otto” systems) from gas-powered cars.
“These technologies aim at making passenger cars less damaging to the environment. If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers,” said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
In particular the Commission is assessing whether the companies colluded to limit the development and roll-out of selective catalytic reduction systems, which reduce nitrogen oxides from diesel car emissions
The Commission raided the German carmakers‘ premises in October 2017 as part of its initial inquiries.

The Commission said there was no legal deadline to bring its antitrust investigation to a close and didn’t discuss potential fines or penalties.

486,"September 18, 2018",US: Seattle’s Ride-Hail Union Law saga continues,"
According to a report by Bloomberg, Seattle couldn’t convince the full panel of the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its bid to throw out an antitrust challenge to a city ordinance that lets ride-hail drivers join unions.
The case will now proceed before Judge Robert Lasnik in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington.
The US Chamber of Commerce and an Uber Technologies subsidiary argued that allowing drivers to bargain collectively over their pay would be tantamount to colluding on prices.
Originally in May they won a ruling from a three-judge panel that revived their antitrust challenge to the city ordinance. But the three-judge panel did affirm dismissal of their claim that federal labor law should pre-empt Seattle’s local regulation.

Seattle sought review from the full appeals court in the hope it would dismiss the antitrust claim as well, but no Ninth Circuit judges voted in favor of review, according to a court order issued September 14.

Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies is in talks to buy Dubai-based rival Careem Networks FZ for about $2 billion to $2.5 billion, Bloomberg reported on Monday.
We believe the consumer internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped,” Careem said in an emailed statement. “In the last couple of years, the rest of the world has begun to embrace this opportunity and we have been approached by multiple strategic and financial investors. Our ambition remains to build a lasting tech institution from the region.”
Uber and Careem held preliminary talks in July to combine their Middle Eastern ride-hailing services, hoping to resolve a costly rivalry in the region, Bloomberg had previously reported.
The company has been building services such as food delivery and freight hauling, and, in April, acquired electric bike service JUMP Bikes to offer US passengers an alternative to cars.

The US Justice Department’s (DOJ) Antitrust Division on Monday, September 17, gave its approval to the US$52 billion deal merging Express Scripts with Cigna.
“We are pleased that the Department of Justice has cleared our transaction and that we are another step closer to completing our merger and delivering greater affordability, choice and predictability to our customers and clients as a combined company,” Cigna CEO and President David Cordani said in a media release.


Shareholders voted to approve the merger last month, despite early opposition from activist investor Carl Icahn, who wrote an open letter urging shareholders to reject the deal.He later changed his opinion on the merger. The Justice Department antitrust division said it looked at Cigna’s current PBM services provider, OptumRx, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group. ”
The DOJ Antitrust Division stated it looked at Cigna’s current pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) services provider, OptumRx, which is owned by UnitedHealth Group. “The (DOJ antitrust) Division understands that Cigna intends to use (Express Scripts) for PBM services and that Cigna’s current PBM services provider, UnitedHealthcare’s subsidiary Optum, will be free to compete for PBM customers that purchase medical insurance from Cigna upon closing of the transaction,” The Justice Department announced in a statement Monday.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple and Qualcomm are heading to the International Trade Commission to fight over a potential ban on imported iPhones.
Qualcomm says Apple shouldn’t be allowed to sell several iPhone models, including the iPhones 7 and 8, in the US because they infringe three Qualcomm patents, Bloomberg reported.
The two companies will square off Sept. 17 at a hearing that’s expected to last several days. The ITC is expected to issue its final ruling by May 22, 2019, according to the agency’s website.
The ITC can block imports of the iPhone models if it finds Apple is infringing the patents. The commission must consider how an exclusion order would affect the public interest, such as whether it would improperly reduce market competition and slow down innovation in new technologies.
Qualcomm sells modem chips with the patented technologies. Apple buys chips from Qualcomm and Intel. Qualcomm argues the phones using the Intel chips are infringing. Qualcomm is asking the ITC to block imports of infringing iPhones that don’t use Qualcomm chips.

EU antitrust regulators have set an October 19 deadline for their ruling on Walt Disney’s  US$71.3 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox entertainment assets, the European Commission announced on Monday, September 17.
The Commission can approve Disney’s takeover bid as is, require concessions, or, if it has serious concerns regarding the deal, open a four-month investigation into the agreement.
The US Justice Department gave the green light to the deal in June on the condition that Disney sell off Fox’s 22 regional sports networks.
The deal would see Disney, led by chairman and CEO Bob Iger, acquire Fox’s TV and movie studios, its FX Networks and National Geographic operations, TV giant Star India, as well as Fox’s stake in Hulu and its 39% stake in European pay TV giant Sky.

According to.a report from Reuters, the Communication Workers of America labor union (CWA), which opposes T-Mobile’s proposed purchase of rival Sprint, has written to all 50 state attorneys general to highlight potential job losses from the proposed deal as well as antitrust concerns.
Attorneys general California have begun probes into the $26 billion deal, which would see the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers in the United States merging.
Utah and New Mexico have said they see the proposed transaction, announced in April, as positive because it will give the carriers a boost in building next generation 5G wireless technology and help them to extend into rural parts of the two states.
In the letter from CWA President Christopher Shelton, a copy of which was sent to Reuters by the union, the CWA “expressed concern” about the deal and asked the attorneys general to investigate. The state attorneys general work with regulators and the federal government on deals they fear will cause harm locally.
The letter included a breakdown of the top 50 metropolitan areas that the union said were likely to see job losses because of the deal, mostly because of shuttered retail outlets. The CWA has estimated that the deal would lead to 28,000 lost jobs.

Competition in the markets needs to be enhanced to show to people that the game is played on equal terms, EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday while addressing the Greek parliament, according to Greek national news agency AMNA.
The European official was on a one-day visit to Athens to brief the Greek MPs about the Commission’s work on enhancing competition in many sectors.
Regarding state subsidies and their control,  she said that the Commission’s aim is to avoid distortions in trade between countries and to guarantee that competition operates in a way that both small and large players behave in a fair way.
“When citizens and businesses pay taxes, they need to feel that the big player will have to adhere to the competition rules and that he pays like anybody else,” she explained.
“We do our best to ensure that just as small and large companies are operating on the right terms, so do companies such as Google and Amazon. In the EU, the rules must be respected by all, and this is the EU’s rule of justice,” the European commissioner stressed.

According to a report by Reuters, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), signaled on Thursday, September 13, he was willing to consider tougher merger enforcement, a move that could affect high profile big tech companies but also energy producers, drug makers, and a big swath of the US economy.
FTC Joe Simons opened the first of a series of hearings Thursday in Washington to examine whether mergers have made the American economy less competitive and whether the way antitrust officials police corporate takeovers and anti-competitive conduct by big companies is outdated.
Simons said at the start of the hearing that concerns about higher concentration and reduced competition “merit serious consideration,” Bloomberg reported.
“We do this with the goal of understanding if our current enforcement policies are on the right track or on the wrong track, and if they are on the wrong track, what shall we do to improve them?” he said, noting that he was keeping “a very open mind.”
Big tech companies such as Alphabet’s Google, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and others have faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for everything from widespread collection of users’ information to being used by Russia to meddle in the 2016 US election to being unfair in how they use their dominance to compete with smaller rivals.
Joseph Simons was nominated by President Donald Trump to head the FTC in October 2017 and began work in May 2018.

498,"September 12, 2018",US: New suit filed against Uber for misclassifying drivers,"
Uber Technologies is facing a lawsuit that claims the ride-hailing company is misclassifying drivers in California as independent contractors in order to save money.
According to a report in Bloomberg citing the lawsuit, the complaint alleges that Uber is able to avoid paying US$9.07 an hour in expenses and benefits to drivers that they would get if they were treated as employees. The misclassification amounts to about US$500 million, according to the lawsuit filed by a car delivery service, reported Bloomberg. The lawsuit contends Uber uses illegal labor savings to price the rides under what they actually cost so it can steal customers from rivals that treat drivers as employees.
In January Uber reached a settlement with more than 2,000 New York drivers, agreeing to pay US$3 million. Reuters, citing a court filing in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, reported that Uber agreed to pay the US$3 million to settle what was a proposed class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of 2,421 drivers who contended the company took too many fees out of their fares. The lawsuit alleged a breach of contract for adding sales tax and a fee to the total fare amount, which then boosted the amount of service fees owed to the company. The drivers also claimed that Uber misled drivers with guaranteed compensation of US$5,000 in the first month of employment. The settlement includes drivers who worked for the ride-hailing company starting from December 29, 2009 and aren’t currently in arbitration ...

499,"September 12, 2018",US: DOJ wants suit against Bumble Bee CEO stalled,"
According to a filing written by prosecutor Leslie Wulff of the Department of Justice (DOJ) has asked a California judge to delay a grocery wholesaler’s lawsuit against former Bumble Bee Foods CEO Chris Lischewski over concerns that it could complicate the criminal case against him.
Lischewski was indicted on criminal price-fixing charges in May 2018 and subsequently stepped down from his position in the company to focus on his defense. He is also the defendant in a civil lawsuit from Associated Wholesale Grocers (AWG) that claims the company was harmed by the tuna canner’s price-fixing.
Wulff wrote in a filing that allowing the AWG lawsuit to proceed, which could involve depositions of witnesses including Lischewski, could potentially interfere with the prosecution and run the risk of violating the former CEO’s fifth amendment right prohibiting self-incrimination.
“The government’s proposed stay balances the government’s interest in protecting the integrity of the criminal proceedings, Mr. Lischewski’s fifth amendment rights, and the victims’ interest in conducting discovery and seeking restitution for the price-fixing scheme,” Wulff wrote.

500,"September 12, 2018",Australia: ACCC greenlights US$9b APA takeover,"
According to the Wall Street Journal, Australia’s antitrust regulator won’t stand in the way of a more than US$9 billion takeover of one of the country’s main gas-pipeline operators, putting the deal by Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure Holdings (CKI) in the hands of foreign investment authorities.
On Wednesday, September 12, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced it wouldn’t oppose the acquisition of APA Group after accepting plans from a CKI-led consortium to offload assets that would otherwise have meant a threat to competition when APA was merged with existing operations in the country.
Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, said concerns had been raised in the industry about APA’s dominance in gas transmission, but a takeover wouldn’t alter that in a material way.

501,"September 11, 2018",Japan: Renesas buying chipmaker IDT for US$6.7b,"

Japan’s Renesas Electronics announced it had agreed to buy Integrated Device Technology for US$6.7 billion, its second major acquisition as it deepens its push into semiconductors for self-driving cars.
Renesas is second only to NXP Semiconductors NV in auto-related chips and commands 30% of the global market for microcontrollers used in cars. But it is weak in so-called analog chips which process signals from things such as sound, light, or temperature into digital data.
Renesas Chief Executive Bunsei Kure said adding IDT would strengthen his company’s presence as a supplier of system-on-a-chip products for vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous-driving technology.

“Competition in the semiconductor industry has become like mixed martial arts,” Mr. Kure said.
Mr. Kure said the US company has been looking to sell more to the auto industry and that made it a good fit for Renesas, which sells to many top automakers. Toyota is a minority shareholder in Renesas.
“We won’t chop IDT into pieces and swallow it,” Mr. Kure said. “IDT can accelerate its growth by using us as a catalyst.”

Alibaba, the Chinese eCommerce giant, inked a deal Tuesday, September 11, with the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Mail.ru Group to create AliExpress Russia.
According to a report in Bloomberg, Alibaba is creating a US$2 billion joint venture to boost its eCommerce business in Russia, with local investors controlling the joint venture. Bloomberg reported that Alibaba will add its domestic operations of Tmall and AliExpress into the joint venture, with Mail.ru owner Alisher Usmanov’s MegaFon selling its 10% stake in Mail.ru to Alibaba for 24% of the new venture.

 “A big part of what we’ve been able to develop so far in Russia has been our cross-border business,” Alibaba President Mike Evans told reporters, according to Bloomberg. “But the future, which will require the presence of our partners at this table, will involve building a much bigger local business.”

Bloomberg reported that Alibaba will access Mail.ru’s audience via two social networks in the country. Pandao, a mobile platform for selling Chinese goods in Russia, will also be rolled into the Alibaba venture. The report noted that the Russian Direct Investment Fund will add funding in return for a 13% stake, while Mail.ru gets the remaining 15%. It’s not clear how much the Russian Direct Investment Fund is adding to the joint venture, noted the report.

503,"September 11, 2018",How to Reform the Law on Abusive Practices: The study that will serve as a basis for reform in Germany (and Europe?),"
September 2018

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) & Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group) presents:
How to Reform the Law on Abusive Practices: The study that will serve as a basis for reform in Germany (and Europe?) By Rupprecht Podszun (Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf)1
Germany is starting to prepare the next major reform of its competition law. While the 9th amendment of the national Act against Restraints of Competition in 2017 introduced a couple of new norms for the digital age that were partly of clarifying character, it now looks as if there would be more substantial shifts. The first step in the process (expected to take up to two years) was to commission a study by renowned professors on the need to reform the norms on abusive practices. Rupprecht Podszun, professor for competition law at the University of Düsseldorf, gives a first impression of what new tools may come up in Germany – and on the EU level.
Politicians in Germany have always been more critical of the rise of the MAGAF-companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook) than elsewhere. As early as 2014, then Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel called for a tough European initiative against the power of Google. Yet, it took the Commission another three years to come up with Google Shopping (a decision that probably fell short of what Gabriel had wished for). The German national competition authority, the Bundeskartellamt,...

504,"September 10, 2018",US: FTC Democrat urges issuing competition rules,"

Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, wants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to write rules defining when noncompete agreements for employees are permissible. He raised the issue last Thursday, September 6, in comments filed ahead of the FTC policy hearings. Chopra believes the FTC should evaluate using the “neglected” power of rulemaking to better enforce antitrust law.

“I see major benefits to the FTC engaging in rulemaking under “unfair methods of competition,” even if the conduct could be condemned under predecessor antitrust laws.” Chopra said on  September 6 during the 21st Century hearings. “Rulemaking can create value for the marketplace and benefit the public on all of these fronts.”

“Rulemaking would serve to advance clarity and certainty about what types of conduct constitute – or do not constitute – an ‘unfair method of competition.’ Commission studies of specific industries and business practices would guide which practices the FTC should use rulemaking to address. Indeed, as an enforcer and regulator across industries, the Commission is uniquely positioned to identify practices that it determines are anticompetitive.”

According to a report by a Courthouse news, University of Virginia economist Kenneth Elzinga, testifying on behalf of the NCAA, disputed that giving student athletes incidental benefits, like plane tickets home to attend a funeral, amounts to paying athletes to play for their schools, this testimony in contradiction of his previous research, and in support of the suit brought by three classes.
Referring to American Athletic Conference Commissioner Mike Aresco, class counsel Jeff Friedman told Helzinga, â€śMr. Arescoâ€™s view is if players were paid, it would adversely affect consumer demand… Do you believe that a hypothetical commissioner acting economically rationally â€“ who believed consumer demand would go down if players were paid â€“ that that hypothetical commissioner would advocate for his or her conference to pay players?â€ť
Elzinga replied potential lost profits from a perceived reduction in amateurism wouldnâ€™t necessarily deter a school or conference from increasing athlete pay.
â€śA rational commissioner could,â€ť he said, â€śbecause the rational commissioner may decide engaging in a strategy that generates immediate benefitsâ€ť in the form of enlisting a star player would offset the long-term costs of decreased revenues, as long as the other conferences shouldered some of those costs.

507,"September 10, 2018",UK: Probe could force Sainsbury to halt Asda merger,"
Sainsbury’s boss has warned that regulators could force Britain’s second-largest supermarket to pull out of its proposed merger with rival Asda.
Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) kicked off a formal investigation into the merger amid concerns over the potential for higher prices and worse quality of service. Both Sainsbury’s and Asda have asked the CMA to fast-track the investigation into the more in-depth phase 2 stage, something which could be announced as early as this week.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said there are some “extreme scenarios” where the remedies demanded by regulators might render any deal pointless.
“There is an Ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation] threshold at which point either party has the right to walk away,” he told the Financial Times. “It’s not a number of stores, it’s a level of profitability.”
Sainsbury’s has previously stated the combined group will benefit from buying produce at the lowest price each company pays. However, it has not disclosed how much this gross cost saving will be worth.

508,"September 10, 2018",US: State AGs mull tech regulation,"
US state attorneys general are working together to figure out the best way to regulate internet powerhouses such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the state officials are working on a legal strategy to deal with alleged antitrust violations and data-privacy abuses, as well as what some claim is a suppression of conservative speech.
“I think the companies are too big, and they need to be broken up,” Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, who is the current president of the National Association of Attorneys General, said last week in a radio interview.
Adding to the concerns for these companies is the news that US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has agreed to meet with several state attorneys general later this month to discuss whether these firms are hurting competition and “stifling the free exchange of ideas” on their platforms.
And last week, Washington lawmakers held yet another hearing over tech issues including alleged Russian hacking, privacy and user data, and criminal activity. The Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has also been holding workshops to explore competition issues, while the Federal Trade Commission will begin a series of hearings this week to talk about the same concerns.
But Landry believes the competition issues will probably have to be solved through antitrust litigation. “In my opinion, you’re not going to fix this legislatively,” said Landry. “You’re going to hav...

The named executives are:
Candace Beinecke: A senior partner at the law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, focusing on corporate governance and M&A. In the 1990s, Beinecke counted Viacom among her high-profile clients. CBS was part of Viacom until a separation in 2006.



Barbara Byrne: Vice president of investment banking at Barclays and who spent nearly three decades at Lehman Brothers. Byrne has advised several companies on megadeals over her career, including Altria Group’s spinoff of Philip Morris International in 2008, the report continued. Byrne also co-produced and invested in “Equity”—a 2016 film about gender inequality on Wall Street.
Susan Schuman: CEO of SYPartners. Schuman is a consultant who has worked with executives at several major companies, including IBM, Facebook, Starbucks, and the CW, which is co-owned by CBS.


Brian Goldner: Chairman and CEO of Hasbro. Goldner leads a company that’s trying to replace lost revenue caused by the recent liquidation of Toys ”R” Us. Hasbro has done business with CBS in the past, including making products based on “Star Trek.”

Las autoridades antimonopolio de Europa están cada vez más preocupadas sobre cómo las compañías de tecnología utilizan los datos que recaban, informó Bloomberg. Facebook fue multado el año pasado por no revelar a las autoridades de competencia que podría combinar sus propios datos con el de la aplicación de mensajería WhatsApp.

A very antitrust situation
By Rana Foroohar 
Last week, my colleague Ed asked readers to “think bigly” about a grand strategy around foreign policy.
This week, I’ll borrow another unique piece of locution from Our Leader and ask Swampians to consider how the president is politicising a “very antitrust situation” involving platform technology firms like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Trump has complained that Google’s search results are shutting out conservative voices. Likewise, attorney-general Jeff Sessions has said he plans to meet state AGs to discuss how platform firms are “hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas”. All this, came just before the Senate intelligence committee heard from Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey last week about the role platform firms may have played in 2016 election manipulation.
But far from helping Washington look at the very real issues of monopoly power in technology, the president’s involvement is — what a surprise — pulling everyone’s attention in just the wrong direction. Silicon Valley leans left politically (although I’d argue its true ideology is libertarianism) but there are no evil geniuses sitting in towers in the Googleplex trying to stifle conservative voices. Every platform tech firm has its algorithmic biases, and those need to be much better understood, as the FT wrote last week. But by making the issue of monopoli...

Amazon’s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea
By David Streitfeld
The dead books are on the top floor of Southern Methodist University’s law library.
“Antitrust Dilemma.” “The Antitrust Impulse.” “Antitrust in an Expanding Economy.” Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.
At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. “This is my command post,” said Lina Khan.
It’s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.
The retailer overwhelmingly dominates online commerce, employs more than half a million people and powers much of the internet itself through its cloud computing division. On Tuesday, it briefly became the second company to be worth a trillion dollars.
If competitors tremble at Amazon’s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon’s customers,...

513,"September 9, 2018",US: NCAA Students testify at court,"
A former UC Berkeley basketball player on Friday, September 7, accused the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of “exploiting” her by so severely limiting the scholarship money she received playing sports she often went hungry, in a federal bench trial in Oakland challenging the association’s caps on compensation to student athletes.
According to Courthouse news, Justine Hartman said she sometimes skipped classes because she was too hungry and tired to concentrate following daily six-hour basketball practices. Her athletic scholarship set by the NCAA didn’t cover her expenses at the University of California, Berkeley, she said, forcing her to pay rent with money earmarked for food.
“We don’t have the means to excel at the highest level academically,” Hartman said. “We go without a lot. There are many with similar experiences, where they’re hungry and too tired” to focus on academics.
Three classes of 53,000 current and former Division I football and men’s and women’s basketball players are trying to convince US District Judge Claudia Wilken to eliminate the NCAA’s restrictions on student athlete compensation.
But the NCAA says there is no guarantee the conferences would enact them. More likely, it says, wealthier schools would begin offering potential team members “millions of dollars” to play for them in the absence of pay limits, essentially turning those players into professional athletes.

514,"September 9, 2018","EU: January 28 deadline set for Siemens, Alstom  decision","

The European Commission has set a deadline of Jan. 28 to decide whether to approve the planned rail merger of Siemens and Alstom.
The deadline was suspended early in August, but the Commission, which rules on mergers in the 28-country European Union, stated in an online filing issued on Friday that this suspension had ended on Sept. 4 and a new deadline had been set.
The deal, agreed last September, has broad political support in France and Germany where politicians argue the merger, of Siemens’ mobility unit with their French rival, bringing together their rolling stock manufacturing, signalling and railways services businesses,  is needed to counter Chinese competition, namely CRRC, the world’s biggest train maker.

 “This Franco-German merger of equals sends a strong signal in many ways,” said Joe Kaeser, president and chief executive of Siemens at the time the deal was announced. “We put the European idea to work and, together with our friends at Alstom, we are creating a new European champion in the rail industry for the long term.”

The Competition Tribunal’s judgment dismissed an appeal by the golf club manufacturer against the CMA’s decision to fine it for breaching competition law and imposed a revised fine of £1.25 million (US$1.6 million).
In August 2017, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that golf club manufacturer Ping had breached competition law by preventing 2 UK retailers from selling its golf clubs on their websites.
The Tribunal announced Friday, September 7, it was of the “clear view” that “[t]he potential impact of the ban on consumers and retailers is real and material. It significantly restricts consumers from accessing Ping golf club retailers outside their local area and from comparing prices and it significantly reduces the ability of, and incentives for, retailers to compete for business using the internet.”
The CMA had accepted that Ping was pursuing a genuine commercial aim of promoting in-store custom fitting, but found that it could have achieved this through less restrictive means.

The US Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has expressed a “growing concern” that social media companies may be “intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas” on their platforms, the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed on Wednesday, September 5.
A statement issued through spokesman Devin O’Malley said the DOJ monitored a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg on the use of social media by foreign adversaries to spread misinformation.
“The attorney general has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms,” read the statement. An official confirmed that the statement means a meeting has been scheduled for some time in September.
The majority of Americans believe social media platforms censor political views they don’t agree with, according to Pew Research Center. Some 43% of people think tech companies favor liberal over conservative viewpoints and 72% think it’s likely that social media companies intentionally censor political viewpoints they find objectionable. These views are more strongly held by Republicans, with 64% saying tech companies favor liberal views and 85% saying social media sites censor political viewpoints.

Europe’s antitrust enforcers are increasingly concerned about how technology companies use data, reported Bloomberg. Facebook was fined last year for failing to disclose to merger watchdogs that it could combine its own data with that of messaging app WhatsApp.

Siemens and Alstom stated they are confident their rail merger will proceed and be completed on time in 2019 despite objections raised by Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) reported Reuters. Australia expressed concern on September 5 that the merger could lead to higher prices by lowering competition for heavy rail signaling projects in the country.
Siemens and Alstom’s plan to create a Franco-German rail champion has also raised concerns in Europe, where the European Union’s antitrust regulator has opened a full-scale investigation, reported Reuters.
The two companies are looking to the deal to stave off the competitive threat from bigger Chinese rival CRRC (China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation) and Canada’s Bombardier Transportation.
Siemens and Alstom announced on Thursday, September 6, that such a statement by the Australian authorities was common with proposed mergers of such a scale and it did not prejudice the final outcome of their deliberations.
“We will continue to work closely and constructively with the ACCC to explain the rationale and the benefits of the proposed combination, as well as the complex dynamics of the relevant markets and the reasons why the proposed combination will not substantially lessen competition,” a joint statement from the two companies read.

519,"September 6, 2018",EU: Vestager wants to leave her digital legacy to her successor,"
The European Commission’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in March of this year appointed three digital experts to advise her on the challenges digitization could one day pose to competition policy, which she hopes her successor will continue. In July, she called on citizens to submit their views to the Commission by the end of September.
The initiatives should culminate in a January 17, 2019, competition conference and a final expert report, which is expected on March 31. Competition experts in Brussels expect its findings will shape Vestager’s advice to the next commissioner.
A European Commission spokesperson said that the main inheritance from Vestager’s years will be broader than digital, and should include her record of policing countries’ tax ruling practices through state aid rules and working to simplify state aid procedures. The spokesperson also said that an important part of her legacy should be conceptual, prioritizing “fairness” when interpreting the law.
The Commission president plays a key role in both the appointment of the new competition commissioner and the writing of the agency’s overarching policy goals. And in his previous role as chief of staff to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the powerful Commission Secretary-General Martin Selmayr is said to have held the pen when the institution’s priorities were drafted. Vestager often refers to these priorities.

520,"September 6, 2018",UK: Ofgem proposes price cap on energy tariffs,"
On Thursday, September 6, Britain’s energy regulator Ofgem proposed a price cap on default energy bills to save households about a billion pounds a year and aims to implement it in time for winter following a government promise to tackle “rip-off” prices.
Consumer groups cautiously welcomed the cap, even though it fell slightly short of the £100 (US$129.36) cut to bills Prime Minister Theresa May had targeted ahead of last year’s election, reported The Financial Times.
The government tasked the regulator in July with calculating a marketwide ceiling for what energy providers could charge following accusations the market was broken, with customers being penalized for sticking with energy providers. The cap represents the biggest state intervention in the UK energy market since privatization in the 1980s.
Just this June, regulatory economist Martin Cave had been selected as the new chair of the UK’s energy regulator.

521,"September 5, 2018",US: Judge nixes NCAA’s Amex argument,"
According to a report by Bloomberg, a federal court in California has decided that the NCAA can’t argue that college sports are a “multi-sided platform” (serving spectators and athletes) in fighting allegations that it fixed prices for athletes by capping student aid.
The case, which started trial on September 4t, seeks to change the NCAA’s rules and force grant in aid awards to cover more than just the costs of attending a university, reflecting the revenue schools gain from basketball and football programs. At the time the parties settled the athletes’ damages claims for US$208.6 million with court approval in December 2017.
This week, Judge Claudia Wilken, of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, rejected the NCAA’s argument that a recent Supreme Court opinion should override two of her earlier decisions in the case: 1) that the college sports market included only players; and 2) barring testimony from the NCAA’s economic expert.
The NCAA was one of the first litigants to cite the Supreme Court’s June opinion allowing American Express to stop merchants from asking consumers to use credit cards with cheaper swipe fees. The NCAA’s motion, made in late August, was an initial test to see how broadly the AmEx decision can be applied.
The Ohio v. American Express decision stated that all sides of a “multi-sided platform”—for AmEx, cardholders, and merchants—should be considered in assessing antitrust harm. The NCAA used that dec...

522,"September 5, 2018",US: DOJ close to approving two healthcare mega-mergers,"

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is getting close to approving two healthcare mega-mergers, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
The mergers, one between the pharmacy CVS Health and the insurer Aetna, and the other between the insurer Cignaand the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, were announced at the end of 2017 and in March, respectively.

The DOJ has identified some competition concerns surrounding the nearly $70 billion CVS-Aetna deal, and the companies will be required to sell off assets related to Medicare drug coverage to resolve those concerns, people familiar with the deliberations said.

The DOJ’s approval of the $54 billion Cigna-Express Scripts deal could come without the government requiring the companies to sell off any assets, the Journal reported.

The CVS-Aetna deal would marry CVS’s drugstores and large pharmacy-benefit-management business with the third-biggest US health insurer. The companies have said they would use retail outlets to offer new, more convenient and efficient access to care. They have received some opposition in the past months. 
The Cigna-Express Scripts merger, announced in March, will join an insurer with a strong focus on employers to a pharmacy-benefit manager that remains a giant player despite recent business challenges. The deal faced a challenge by activist investor Carl Icahn, but it easily won out in shareholder votes.

According to the Times of Israel, Tnuva was hit with an NIS 25 million (US$6.9 million) fine after it admitted to illegal price fixing, the largest-ever financial penalty on a firm in Israel for violating antitrust laws.
The announcement of the fine comes nearly a year after reports indicated a settlement had been reached between the Antitrust Authority and Tnuva over the company’s anti-competitive practices.
Under an agreement last month with the Antitrust Authority that was approved by an antitrust tribunal, details of which were cleared for publication on Monday, September 3, two former senior executives at the company were also fined NIS 75,000 (US$20,000) a piece.
The fine was imposed on Tnuva over agreements it reached with the Shufersal and Mega supermarket chains to raise prices on a number of its products, as well as an understanding with the stores in 2011 to set a uniform price on low-fat cream cheese made by the country’s three largest dairy producers in order to prevent the other two, Strauss and Tara, from undercutting Tnuva, the Antitrust Authority declared in a statement.

Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s Antitrust Record
By Sarah Licht, John A. Rackson, Arnold & Porter
On July 9, 2018, President Trump announced the nomination of DC Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill Anthony Kennedy’s seat on the US Supreme Court, in light of Justice Kennedy’s retirement effective July 31, 2018. This Advisory reviews Judge Kavanaugh’s approach to antitrust law as reflected in his opinions.
Since Judge Kavanaugh joined the DC Circuit in 2006, he has weighed in on two significant mergers and a number of other antitrust issues. Judge Kavanaugh has been skeptical of government efforts to block mergers, dissenting from the majority in United States v. Anthem, Inc. and F.T.C. v. Whole Foods Market on efficiencies and market definition grounds.
MERGER CASES
Most recently, Judge Kavanaugh dissented from the majority in United States v. Anthem, Inc., in which the court affirmed the district court’s injunction preventing the proposed $54 billion merger of two health insurance companies, Anthem and Cigna. The majority rejected Anthem’s argument that efficiencies created by the merger would outweigh any anti-competitive effect. The majority opinion also questioned the proper weight given to efficiencies in merger analysis.
In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh agreed with Anthem. He argued that even though evidence showed that Anthem would raise fees on its employer customers anywhere from ...

Germany, seeking to rein in internet giants like Google and Facebook, plans to bolster the powers of its competition watchdog to prevent such companies from becoming monopolies even before they achieve scale, reported Reuters.
On Tuesday, September 4, an initiative was announced that includes blocking big players from taking over smaller rivals. It follows up on a pledge by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition to curb big US internet companies.
“In doing so we must find the right balance between the growth chances of German and European platforms and preventing the abuse of market power.”
A 173-page commissioned by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier calls for the German antitrust regulator to be given powers to act before a company reaches a critical “tipping point” on the way to becoming a monopoly—something that can happen quickly on the internet due to the way it functions as a network.
This could, for example, include cracking down on attempts to prevent “multihoming,” where a platform company requires its business partners to work exclusively with it, but not with any of its competitors.

527,"September 3, 2018",US: Tech Industry Hearings to start Wednesday,"

Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are likely to face questions about political content, antitrust concerns and consumer privacy at hearings that begin Wednesday, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Wednesday’s hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to include Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a representative of Google, as yet unconfirmed. Later in the day, the House Commerce Committee will examine Mr. Dorsey, whose platform has been a focus of many Republicans’ ire.
The hearings will likely highlight the industry’s political troubles, and point to practices that might be addressed in legislation or executive action in the months and years ahead, the Journal reported.
Another hearing in early October, by a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, will focus on antitrust concerns, a big portion of which is likely to delve into the overwhelming market dominance of a handful of internet companies.
Atop this week’s Senate committee hearing agenda will be the efforts of the tech platforms to stamp out foreign election interference. The committee has been investigating Russia’s multipronged campaign to influence the 2016 election for the past year and a half.

Both Republicans and Democrats want Facebook, Google, and Twitter to explain how they are protecting the 2018 midterms from abuse amid repeated warnings from top U.S. intelligence officials that the election process remains under attack by Moscow.

The senator is right to demand a renewed antitrust investigation of the tech behemoth
By Rana Forooh 
Every twenty years or so, a major antitrust case reshapes the business landscape, curbing the inevitable excesses of the dominant corporate players and allowing the next generation of innovators to be born.
So, it’s worth noting three things in this edition of Swamp Notes.
First, Tuesday is Google’s 20th birthday. Second, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin might want to send a slice of cake to Bill Gates, since it was arguably the US v Microsoft antitrust case 17 years ago, in which Microsoft was ultimately disallowed from bundling Windows and Explorer, that allowed their search giant to become the behemoth that it is today. Had Microsoft been allowed to dominate the burgeoning internet ecosystem back then the way Google dominates search today, then we might not have reached my third point — which is that Republican Senator Orrin Hatch is right to call for the re-opening of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Google from 2013.
As anyone who read the original leaked documents from 2012 knows, the case — which was dismissed by the FTC — was a close call to begin with. Key FTC staffers wanted to sue the search giant, and no wonder — many of its top brass, like chief economist Hal Varian and former executive Marissa Mayer, come off as being quite happy to prioritise Google over competitors in ways that...

Coca-Cola announced Friday, August 31, that it will acquire the British coffee chain Costa, the second-largest coffeehouse in the world, for about US$5.1 billion, as soda companies reconfigure their businesses while consumers shift awayfrom sugary, carbonated drinks.
The Atlanta-based beverage giant described the proposed deal as a necessary entryway to the expanding global coffee market.
This is the second transaction involving a consumer products company and a coffee retailer after Nestlé struck a US$7.15 billion global deal in May to sell Starbucks’ coffee products outside its cafes—in shops and supermarkets.
Coca-Cola announced it was open to additional expansion into new markets and would consider new product formats following the acquisition of Costa. “The acquisition will expand the existing Coca-Cola coffee lineup by adding another leading brand and platform. Costa also gives Coca-Cola new capabilities and expertise in coffee, and our system can create opportunities to grow the Costa brand worldwide,” Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey said while announcing the deal.

Spanish ethanol producer Abengoa and its Belgian peer Alcogroup will challenge the European Commission’s assertion that the companies colluded to fix ethanol price benchmarks, reported Reuters.
The European Commission sent a statement of objections to the two companies in late July, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, August 29, referring to EU documents which set out concerns about anti-competitive practices.
“The companies firmly contest the Commission’ allegations, both in fact and in law,” Alcogroup declared in a statement, adding that it would “fully exercise their rights of defence in the ongoing investigation.”
The move by the Commission followed a near three-year long investigation  on concerns that the two companies along with Swedish company Lantmannen may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks, which are published by energy and commodities information provider S&P Global Platts.

531,"August 30, 2018",UK: Npower-SSE merger approved,"
The UK’s competition watchdog has provisionally given the green light to the merger of Npower and the retail arm of SSE, removing the final hurdle to the biggest shakeup of the energy sector in years.
An investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on default tariffs which most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added.
The CMA stated it had decided to clear the deal after finding that SSE and Npower do not compete closely on standard variable tariff (SVT) prices.
Anne Lambert, chair of the inquiry group, said, “It is vital that householders have a range of energy suppliers to choose from so they can find the best deal for them. With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.
“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard variable prices.
“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”

US cable TV provider Altice USA called for regulators to intervene in the proposed merger between T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, in a filing published on Tuesday, August 28.
The US$26 billion deal between the two US wireless carriers, which would shrink the wireless market to three big players from four, faces a review from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
Dish come out against the T-Mobile-Sprint merger. Dish says that data from other countries that experienced four-to-three reductions in the number of carriers to say that the T-Mobile-Sprint merger could lead to an increase in prices, not a decrease like T-Mo has claimed.
Cable provider Altice said in a filing with the FCC that it’s concerned about the T-Mobile-Sprint merger. Altice has an MVNO agreement with Sprint and is planning to utilize it to enter the wireless market in 2019, but the company is concerned that if the T-Mobile-Sprint merger goes through, it could have an effect on its ability to expand.
AT&T also filed a comment with the FCC regarding the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, too, and while it says that it’s not taking a position on the deal, its statements dopaint the merger in a negative light.

If you’d like to dive in to these filings for yourself, you can find them on the FCC’s website.

Germanyâ€™s antitrust regulator expects to take first steps this year in its probe against Facebook after finding that the social media giant abused its market dominance to gather data on people without their knowledge or consent, reported Reuters.
The Federal Cartel Office is focusing on protecting competition in the digital economy through a strategy “against big internet companies,” its President Andreas Mundt said at a press conference in Bonn on Monday, August 27. The approach consists of two layers: keeping markets open for new players, and making sure consumers can pick products and services in a fair and transparent environment.
The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party appsâ€”including its own WhatsApp and Instagram servicesâ€”and its online tracking of people who arenâ€™t even members.
â€śWe are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,â€ť Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take the â€śfirst stepsâ€ť this year. He declined to elaborate.
The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones.
Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily.

Un nuevo artículo del economista John Van Reenen, presentado durante el simposio anual de la Reserva Federal en Jackson Hole, Wyoming, argumenta que las nuevas tecnologías y la globalización han ampliado las ventajas de las compañías más grandes y productivas, impulsándolas a dominar el mercado.
“Si más mercados se vuelven del estilo ‘los ganadores se llevan todo’ como con la competencia de plataformas digitales, esto generará el dominio de ‘firmas superestrella'”, escribe Van Reenen. “El éxito de tales empresas puede deberse a la intensificación de la competencia ‘en pro del mercado’ en lugar de a las fusiones anticompetitivas o la colusión en el mercado”.
El documento dio inicio el retiro anual para los banqueros centrales ubicado en el Parque Nacional Grand Teton y organizado por el Banco de la Reserva Federal de Kansas City. La conferencia de este año se centra en la estructura cambiante de los mercados reales, no en los mercados financieros, y las implicaciones para la política monetaria.
Los hallazgos parecen ser consistentes con la teoría de que la globalización y el rápido avance tecnológico pueden facilitar el surgimiento de “firmas superestrella” como Apple, Amazon.com y Google, escribió Van Reenen. A medida que las empresas se vuelven más productivas y dominantes en sus mercados, puede darse una clasificación de mano de obra por la cual los trabajadores calificados acuden cada vez...

535,"August 26, 2018",US: Study finds increasing dominance of “superstar firms”,"
A new paper by economist John Van Reenen, presented Friday at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, argues that new technologies and globalization have amplified the advantages enjoyed by the largest and most productive companies, propelling them to their dominance.
“If more markets are becoming ‘winner-take-all’ as with digital platform competition, this will generate the dominance of ‘superstar firms,’” Van Reenen writes. “The success of such firms may be as much due to intensified competition ‘for the market’ rather than anti-competitive mergers or collusion ‘in the market.’”
The paper kicks off the annual retreat for central bankers hosted in Grand Teton National Park by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. This year’s conference is focused on the changing structure of real markets — not financial markets — and the implications for monetary policy.
The findings appear consistent with a theory that globalization and rapid technological advancement may facilitate the rise of “superstar firms” such as Apple, Amazon.com and Google, Mr. Van Reenen wrote. As such companies grow more productive and dominant of their markets, a sorting of labor may take place whereby skilled workers increasingly flock to firms employing other skilled workers, and vice versa.
But while he didn’t conclude that anticompetitive behavior is the reason for deepening inequality among companies, Mr. Van Reenen said the largest f...

California’s attorney general is investigating Sprint’s planned $59 billion merger with T-Mobile and is looking for documents about the companies’ registered numbers and other data, according to a letter filed with the Federal Communications Commission, reported Bloomberg.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra asked the Federal Communications Commission for telephone number availability data “pursuant to its subpoena powers” in an Aug. 23 letter that the FCC posted on its website.
Becerra wants the agency to turn over Numbering Resource Utilization and Forecast (“NRUF”) data and local number portability (“LNP”) data, according to the letter.
The NRUF is a report by the North American Numbering Plan Administration that tracks and forecasts telephone number usage based on information submitted by telephone companies. Local number portability refers to reassigning telephone numbers when customers seek to move to another carrier.
The FCC and the Department of Justice are also reviewing the merger.

Android – Is There a Viable Monopolization Case?
By Stephen Houck

This paper considers the viability of a Sherman Act § 2 enforcement action in respect of Google’s Android operating system. It discusses the applicability of the D.C. Circuit’s 2001 Microsoft opinion in which Microsoft was found to have engaged in anticompetitive conduct to maintain its Windows operating system monopoly. The paper explains why, despite some superficial similarities, the facts that gave rise to liability in Microsoft are different in crucial respects from those pertaining to Android. The paper concludes 1) that Google lacks monopoly power in a properly defined market in which Android competes; and 2) that Google has not engaged in the type of anticompetitive conduct condemned in Microsoft. The facts underlying Microsoft and the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning strongly suggest that an enforcement action in the United States is unlikely to succeed notwithstanding the European Commission’s July 2018 Android decision.

Advertising is obsolete – here’s why it’s time to end it
By Ramsi Woodcock
Since it first became clear that Russian agents spent thousands of dollars a month on political advertising on social media in the runup to the 2016 presidential election, Americans have been asking how the powerful advertising infrastructure run by Google and Facebook could have been thrown open to foreign agents.
But fewer have stopped to ask whether there is a good reason for this infrastructure to exist at all. Why, exactly, is it a good thing for Facebook and Google to be selling advertising to anyone, let alone Russian agents?
The obvious answer seems to be so that legitimate advertisers, meaning the likes of Coca-Cola and General Motors, can inform consumers about the products they offer.
But herein lies the paradox of all advertising in the information age, online or otherwise. If there is one thing that the internet has made it easy for consumers to access without the help of advertising, it is information – and especially information about products.
As I argue in a recent article in the Yale Law Journal, if the only justification for advertising is that it informs, then advertising is now seriously obsolete. Not only that, it could even count as anti-competitive conduct in violation of the antitrust laws – as the Federal Trade Commission once believed.
Advertising as information
Imagine a world wiped clean of advertising of all kinds – from the spon...

According to a report by the Financial Times the EU will rule on the $80bn tie-up between Linde, the German chemicals group, and its US rival Praxair on Monday, an important milestone in a deal that would create the world’s largest industrial gas supplier.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, is expected to clear the merger after the companies provisionally agreed to sell €5bn of Praxair’s European assets to Japanese rival Taiyo Nippon Sanso, to address concerns that the deal would raise prices and reduce choice for consumers.
The main remaining hurdle is the US Federal Trade Commission. In July, the companies had announced they would sell $3bn of Linde’s US assets to German rival Messer and private equity group CVC to secure FTC approval.

541,"August 15, 2018",US: Alphabet joins up with insurance startup,"
Alphabet, has invested US$375 million in Oscar Health, a health insurance startup co-founded by Trump advisor Jared Kushner’s brother, Joshua Kushner. CNBC reported that Alphabet now owns around 10% of the 6 year-old startup, which utilizes a combination of technology, provider partnerships, and member experience so that it can make health insurance pricing clearer for patients and offer doctors more flexible payment models.
As part of the investment, Google employee and former YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar will join Oscar’s board. Oscar CEO Mario Schlosser said that this latest investment will help launch Oscar’s product into more cities, as well as allow it to start selling to seniors through Medicare Advantage by 2020.
The news comes just a few months after two other subsidiaries of Alphabet — venture firm CapitalG and life sciences division Verily — participated in a US$165 million round that valued Oscar at US$3.2 billion. The round was led by Founders Fund, with other investors participating in the funding, including 8VC, Fidelity, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, and Thrive Capital, among others. The funding will be used to fuel the company’s next phase of growth.
“More than five years ago, long before today’s dizzying array of mergers and new entrants, we knew the only way to fix a broken healthcare system was to empower the consumer,” wrote co-founders Kushner and Schlosser. “We started Oscar to secure the trust of consumers, to use data science an...

542,"August 12, 2018",US: Apple takes app monopolization claims to SCOTUS,"
On Friday, Apple urged the US Supreme Court in an opening brief to toss a proposed consumer class action claiming the technology giant illegally monopolized the iPhone app market, arguing that it acts merely as an agent for developers who set their own prices.
A class of consumer purchasers of iPhone apps alleged that Apple has monopolized the market for iPhone apps. The complaint alleges that Apple charged a 30% markup on all apps sold through the app store, and that the app store is the only place where iPhone apps can be sold. In the district court, Apple moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the consumers lacked antitrust standing.


Apple argued that app developers, not Apple, were the ones selling the apps and that Apple merely collected money and “passed on” the allegedly supracompetitive price charged by the developers. According to Apple, the plaintiffs’ grievance is with the price set by the app developers, not with any action taken by Apple.

Delrahim: “Don’t Stop Believing” in the music decrees
By Gus Hurwitz
Almost fifty years ago the Rolling Stones sang that iconic line: “you can’t always get what you want.” Mick Jagger probably wasn’t thinking of administrative law when writing the album “Let it Bleed.” However, fifteen years later the U.S. Supreme Court seemed to set out to prove Jagger wrong. In its Chevron decision, the Supreme Court directed federal courts to defer to agencies’ interpretations of statutes, giving agencies broad discretion to use those statutes to get whatever policies they may want. Today, agencies are able to get whatever statutory interpretation they want with the barest minimum of justification. Indeed, the doctrines of judicial deference even allow agencies to reverse course or flip-flop between policies for almost any reason, including “the election of a new President of a different political party.”
But you don’t get a reputation for “moves like Jagger” by being wrong. While agencies have very broad discretion to interpret adopt and change policies to get what they want, that discretion does have its limits. This is perhaps most strongly the case when a market has significantly relied on the current policy. Justice Scalia wisely stated that “it would be arbitrary or capricious to ignore” serious industry reliance interests. According to the Supreme Court’s FCC v. Fox decision, this means that an agency needs to engage in greater process...

Platform Antitrust
By Erik Hovenkamp
Platforms like Uber, Google Search, and Hulu pervade the modern economic landscape. A platform caters to distinct but deeply-interdependent “sides” of customers that derive value or revenues from one another, such as the merchants and cardholders on a credit card network, or the advertisers and consumers on a social media platform. Platform economics creates some important challenges for antitrust policy. A hallmark of two-sided markets—those in which platforms operate—is the need to “get both sides on board.” It is important to consider whether a restrictive practice might be reasonably necessary to accomplish this. But it is just as important not to overstate the novelties of platform commerce and their propensity to justify restraints on trade.
The Supreme Court did just that in its recent AmEx decision. In a 5-4 split, the majority held that a plaintiff cannot make an initial (and rebuttable) showing of harm without demonstrating a net injury across both sides of the market. This kind of onerous balancing act is conventionally reserved for the last stage of the rule of reason’s burden-shifting framework—after the defendant has demonstrated a countervailing efficiency worth balancing. The majority was also confused on the economic issues, characterizing AmEx’s “no-steering” restraint as a courtesy to consumers, when in fact it deprives them of a valuable option while simult...

The team at Facebook is not having a great week, as it seems all of its recent data scandal chickens have come home to roost. Last Wednesday, July 25, its market cap took a US$120 billion beating in the aftermath of earnings that fell short of revenue and earnings targets. Analysts say this is the first indication that the animus over the Cambridge Analytica issue could have a longer-term impact on three dimensions of its platform: advertisers, users, and the cost to run the platform.
Two days later, Facebook and its executive team found themselves named in a class-action lawsuit—actually, several of them—alleging that the social network made false and misleading statements related to the decline of monthly active users prior to the second-quarter earnings report.
Over the weekend, Last Week Tonight served up its own version of an “honest Facebook” ad—in a parody of the apology ad they offered up a few weeks ago—that was pretty brutal and immediately went viral.
And then on Tuesday, July 31, three-and-a-half months after Mark Zuckerberg spent about 10 hours testifying in front of senators and congress people to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica incident (and explaining the internet to our elected representatives), the other shoe dropped when it came to the long-speculated subject of the federal government regulating big tech.

BitTorrent products continue to serve more than 100 million users worldwide, with a top-rated Google Play app and various other products, including BitTorrent Play on iOS, the uTorrent browser, desktop clients for Mac and PC, and much more.
TRON is in the process of launching its proprietary blockchain technology and network which will replace its use of the Ethereum blockchain for its own TRX cryptocurrency and other applications. Acceptance of the project has grown since it’s initial coin offering (ICO) and has grown over time to a US$4.7 billion market capitalization
TRON’s technology, which can process transactions 400 times faster than the currently used technology by Ethereum, will serve to strategically grow and accelerate BitTorrent, while keeping intact its premier streaming and download products for all its current users.
TRON is creating a new presence in the United States with an emerging office in San Francisco which will house BitTorrent.
“BitTorrent’s long-held core belief of a decentralized internet are inline with TRON’s values, and the collaboration between BitTorrent and TRON is sure to contribute to an internet that is better and brighter,” according to its Medium post.

Taking on big tech: where does Australia stand?
By Caron Beaton-Wells
Big tech is under fire in Europe. In its latest sting, the European Commission has slapped Google with an eye-watering €4.3 billion (US$5 billion) fine for anti-competitive tying of its Android operating system to its in-house search engine and web browser.
The decision follows the Commission’s €2.4 billion (US$2.8 billion) fine against the company for giving illegal advantage to its comparison shopping service, just over a year ago.
And the search company is not alone in feeling the heat from Brussels. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have all been on the receiving end of what some see as a “techlash” reflecting anti-US bias and protectionism.
So far, US competition authorities have taken a far more restrained approach. The Federal Trade Commission looked into various Google practices in 2012 and found it had no case to raise around search bias. Antitrust officials are instead encouraging vigilance but caution when it comes to intervening in data-driven markets characterised by high rates of innovation.
Closer to home, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is conducting an inquiry into the impact of digital platforms on media and advertising markets. It is attracting intense interest, not just here but abroad. There are also reports of the ACCC separately investigating Google’s data-harvesting practices.

Five Things European Antitrust Gets Wrong

Within the last month, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Makan Delrahim was reported to have said to a journalist:
I don’t measure the [DOJ] Antitrust Division’s success by the fines or convictions we get or how many cases in litigation we bring. I define U.S. antitrust law’s success as the fact that we have these innovators. We have the Googles and the Facebooks and the Microsofts and the Ubers and the Airbnbs coming out of the United States. How many of those innovative companies are coming out of Europe or Korea or China?
Much wisdom is reflected in this quote, and foreign antitrust authorities would do well to reflect on these issues. For Europe, there are five basic things that it continues to get wrong with its approach to antitrust enforcement.

Android has created more choice, not less

If you buy an Android phone, you’re choosing one of the world’s two most popular mobile platforms—one that has expanded the choice of phones available around the world.
Today, the European Commission issued a competition decision against Android, and its business model. The decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones, something that 89% of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed. It also misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; to millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones.
Today, because of Android, there are more than 24,000 devices, at every price point, from more than 1,300 different brands, including Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Swedish phone makers.

The EC’s Android Decision ‒ a Debate Hosted by Politico
The European Commission’s decision on the Android investigation it began in 2016 is expected this week, now that the pyrotechnics from the NATO summit, President Trump’s visit to the UK, and the FIFA World Cup Final have subsided. There is general agreement on the global relevance of this decision and the appeals process that is expected.
The following opinion pieces, from an online debate hosted by Politico, argue for and against Google’s practices that led to the investigation.
On one hand Thomas Vinje of Clifford Chance, who is representing Fairsearch, a complainant in the case, argues that the EC’s decision will “put an end to Google’s unfair practices… preventing third parties from competing in mobile operating systems, key services and apps, and reinforcing its dominant positions in these areas,” and, more importantly, “it gets to the heart of Google’s anticompetitive behavior: its growing monopoly over our personal data.”
On the other, Massimiliano Trovato and Alberto Mingardi (research fellow and Director of the Istituto Bruno Leoni in Milan, of which Google is a financial donor) posit that “[t]his crusade of Vestager’s against Google is misguided at best—and more likely to harm European consumers than to help them.”

Comments opposing the Sinclair-Tribune deal were piling up in the FCC’s docket last week, the deadline for replies to comments on Sinclair’s fifth version of the deal. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received a flood of comments on the proposed US$3.9 billion Sinclair-Tribune merger.
Many appeared to be form comments generated by a call to arms (headlined “Stop Trump TV!”) by activist group Democratic Underground. More than half of the 25 comments on the first page of the electronic docket had the same first paragraph beginning with, “I urge the FCC to deny the merger petition…”
The Communications Workers of America, National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians-CWA, the NewsGuild-CWA and the Parents Television Council have all filed petitions with the FCC asking it to deny the merger between Sinclair and Tribune, which would create the largest broadcast group in the country with over 200 stations.
The unions filed jointly, saying that the deal would reduce competition, harm localism, diminish viewpoint diversity and eliminate jobs.

Is a green light flashing for dealmaking in tech land, allowing large firms to easily snatch up smaller ones? There’s a verbal assent in place, according to the The Financial Times, that US Justice Department’s Antitrust Chief Makan Delrahim sees value from such transactions.
Delrahim said in an interview with FT that “great efficiencies” could be wrung from such mergers and acquisitions of that size and scale. The end result has been that consumers have been the ultimate beneficiaries of such activity. As examples, he cited Google’s US$1.7 billon deal to buy YouTube 12 years ago, and that same tech giant’s buyout of Waze for a little under US$1 billion, five years ago.
As quoted by FT, Delrahim stated, “You wonder would YouTube be as useful and as [much of] a competing force to music or in video had it not been enhanced and improved through the tech resources that Google had? … I think there’s [sic] great efficiencies that could occur from a lot of these. You can’t, you know, in retrospect try to second guess that.”
Delrahim made his comments in context against what might be a shifting regulatory landscape in the US and abroad, as lawmakers and regulatory agencies here and in Europe are looking at deals with more intensity. If antitrust laws do not meet the needs of a brave new digital world, and where business models have changed, they may need an overhaul. As an example, noted the FT, services are free for customers and are paid for by advertisers.

No One Is Innocent In The Global Game of Monopoly
By Ferdinando Giugliano 
Europe shouldn’t be smug about market dominance. It’s not just a Silicon Valley thing.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has a reputation for being one of the world’s most committed trustbusters. From Apple Inc, to Alphabet Inc, the Danish politician has taken on some of the world’s most powerful corporations.
Yet it’s fair to ask whether the EU is really such a shining beacon when it comes to reining in its own companies.
Over the past few years, several academic papers have shown how monopoly power appears to be expanding rapidly in the US. Possible explanations include globalization and technology, but the timidity of American antitrust authorities in tackling the “abuse of dominance” is to blame too.
The EU, by contrast, has been hailed for fostering greater competition thanks to its single market and stricter antitrust enforcement. Vestager’s battles with Google and Apple — which have had an easy ride in the US — have cemented the European Commission’s reputation in this area.
Yet new economic research shows that Europe isn’t immune from the rise of dominant companies. Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout, who wrote a seminal paper on the decline of competition in the US, have recently obtained estimates for the evolution of market power globally. Their study, looking at the financial statements of more than 70,000 firms in 134 countries, shows the markup that European businesses charge over their marginal cost increased from roughly zero in 1980 to 64% in 2016. The jump — particularly pronounced in Denmark, Italy and Belgium — is even higher than in the US.

The European Commission had scheduled a meeting of national competition agencies for Tuesday, July 10, to brief them on the case, including what is expected to be a record-breaking fine against Alphabet unit Google.
But the meeting has been rescheduled to July 17, the person said, without giving a reason for the change.
The EC has been investigating Google’s Android practices over the last three years, seeking to determine whether the company promoted its mobile apps in an unfair manner, consequently hurting its rivals due to the dominant position of its operating system.

561,"July 9, 2018",US: Comcast set to raise the stakes with US$39b Sky bid,"
 
Comcast is expected to submit a formal £22 billion (US$39 billion) takeover bid for Sky this week, laying the ground for a bidding war for Britain’s largest commercial broadcaster, reported The Times.
Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of the giant American cable company, has until Friday, July 13, to publish the terms of its £12.50-a share-offer (US$16.56). When he does, it will start the clock ticking for 21st Century Fox, the American entertainment conglomerate that has offered US$11.80 a share to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own. Under Britain’s takeover rules, the owner of the 20th Century Fox film studio will be given a further 28 days to top Comcast’s offer.
Culture secretary Matt Hancock’s clearing of the deal is expected to be conditional on Fox selling Sky News, most likely to Disney, and promising to make up any shortfall in funding for the service to maintain its budget for the next 15 years.
The culture secretary’s clearance is expected to follow the closing on the consultation period on the deal last Wednesday, July 4, unless there are any further calls for new remedies to be considered.
Hancock said in June that the improved commitment from Fox around Sky News met the criteria he had set out covering Sky News’ viability over the long term, its continued its existence as a major UK news provider and its continued editorial independence.

562,"July 8, 2018",Singapore: Grab finds fault with CCCS analysis,"
Grab announced says that it has considered Singapore’s Competition and Consumer Commission’s (CCCS) decision that the merger of Uber and Grab lessens competition in the ride-hailing business and disagrees with their analysis.
This came on the back of the CCCS saying on Thursday, July 3, that the merger of Grab and Uber has significantly lessened competition in the ride-hailing business in Singapore and its proposal to fine the two parties.
Grab stresses that although they are one of the most visible players in transport, they are not the only player in the market, as the CCCS has not taken into account the dynamic developments and intense competition going on over the past few months, from both new and incumbent taxi and ride-hailing players in Singapore.
“Even though not required by the law, we had informed the CCCS that we were making a voluntary notification, as well as proactively engaged with the CCCS before the transaction was signed. We conducted the acquisition legally and in full compliance with Singapore’s applicable competition laws,” says Grab.

563,"July 3, 2018",EU: Android findings likely to be determined July 18,"
In a report based on information from sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg Technology posits that the EU announcement on the results of the investigation into Google’s Android operating system and the fine expected thereof are likely to be announced on or around July 18.
The EU says Google’s contracts with device manufacturers may unfairly force a bundle of Google services — search, maps, web browser and email — to be loaded on phones using the Android operating system. Android runs on 77 percent of the world’s smartphones, according to web traffic analysis firm StatCounter. The EU’s case also targets deals with phone makers and telecoms operators that pay them for placing Google Search on devices.
The decision could come as soon as July 18, judging by the “gaping hole” in the European Commission’s calendar the week after US President Donald Trump visits Brussels, reported Bloomberg.
The size of the fine Is still uncertain, after last year’s record €2.4 billion (US$2.8 billion) fine. However, the most enduring impact could be a requirement that Google renegotiate and replace existing contracts with cellphone manufacturers, opening the way for competing apps to be preinstalled, and thus reducing its hold on mobile ads.
“Consumers are basically barred from competition in the mobile search market,” said Agustin Reyna of the EU consumer organization BEUC in Brussels. “Because companies who try to enter markets where Google is dominant would find it very difficult to compete as they would not be able to match the amount of data Google holds.”
Google is expected to challenge any EU finding against Android at the EU courts. It may ask to suspend an EU order on Android until the appeals process is complete, which could take years, according to one of the people cited by Bloomberg.

564,"June 19, 2018",EU: France and Germany publish joint paper on data and its implications for Competition Law,"
Two of Europe’s biggest antitrust enforcers have joined together to launch a project looking into algorithms and their “potential” anticompetitive effects.
The increasing use of algorithms by companies is an issue of considerable debate as regards their effects on the competitive functioning of markets and to a wider extent on society. In light of this debate, the Bundeskartellamt and the Autorité de la concurrence have decided to launch a joint project.
During the coming months, the authorities are going to deal with these issues, developing a typology of algorithms and studying their potential anti-competitive effects. They will also assess algorithms’ detection and examination.
Read the joint paper here ” Report Competition Law and Data-“
This joint work is a prime example of close cooperation between two major national competition authorities in a field of growing interest for firms, authorities and citizens alike. It also provides some food for thought in the context of the ongoing policy debate on the so-called digital platforms’ economic role.

Microsoft is making Flipgrid free of charge. Schools that already have subscriptions will receive prorated refunds, Microsoft said.
The acquisition comes 1½ years after Microsoft announced a partnership with Flipgrid. Today, Flipgrid integrates with many Microsoft products, including Teams for chatting with other people and OneNote for taking notes. But Flipgrid has paid to use Amazon Web Services cloud, which competes with Microsoft’s own Azure.

567,"June 13, 2018",South Africa: Appeal Court upholds Standard Bank’s appeal in collusion case,"
The South African Competition Appeal Court (CAC) upheld Standard Bank’s appeal and ordered that the Competition Commission make available its investigation record to Standard Bank, in the Commission’s ForEx investigation.
CPI had previously reported that Standard Bank had requested that the Commission make available its record in terms of Rule 15 of the Competition Commission Rules. The Competition Tribunal denied it access to the record of the Commission’s evidence against it, claiming that because of “the length of the record, the extent of the confidential information in it and the burden it would place on the commission in preparing it, a reasonable time for production would be at the same time as discovery is made in the [foreign exchange] case.”
Accordingly, the CAC in the Standard Bank case found that the Tribunal took Standard Bank’s status as a litigant into account when assessing what a reasonable time would be by which the Commission was obliged to make available its record to Standard Bank. The CAC in Standard Bank confirmed that although the Tribunal is not bound by the stare decisis principle in relation to its own decisions, the Tribunal is bound by the CAC’s decisions.
The Tribunal’s decision in Standard Bank was inconsistent with the CAC’s earlier decision in the Group 5 case, where the CAC expressly stated that there is no rational basis for linking the production of the Commission’s record with discovery proceedings. The Tribunal’s departure from the CAC’s earlier precedent was noted with concern by the CAC in Standard Bank.

568,"June 12, 2018",US: AT&T-Time Warner mega-merger case dismissed,"
AT&T won approval on Tuesday, June 12, to buy Time Warner, in one of the largest antitrust cases in decades, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said at a hearing that he has found, after a six-week trial, that the deal does not violate antitrust law and can proceed.
The decision, in one of the biggest antitrust cases in decades, is a milestone victory for AT&T as it looks to reposition itself in a rapidly evolving media landscape. Its deal for Time Warner, valued at roughly US$80 billion, has been pending since October 2016.
The acquisition means AT&T will be the nation’s top pay-TV distributor, through its ownership of DirecTV, as well as the owner of some of the country’s most sought-after channels: Time Warner’s Turner networks, including CNN, TBS and TNT, as well as HBO, the most popular US premium network.
The case marked the first time in 40 years that a court had seen a fully litigated challenge to a so-called vertical merger, which has provoked much commentary that combines companies at different links in the same supply chain, reported WSJ. Such cases are considered more difficult for the government to win than the typical “horizontal” merger case, where the government challenges the combination of two head-to-head rivals and the loss of competition is more apparent.
Both the government and the companies had been considering appellate options in case they lost, according to people familiar with the matter.
In an unusual turn, the judge said he hoped the Justice Department would have the “wisdom” not to seek an emergency stay of his ruling, saying such a legal maneuver would be “manifestly unjust” to AT&T and Time Warner.

569,"June 12, 2018",Spain: CNMC President speaks out on possible changes under new Spanish government,"
The acting president of Spain’s National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC), José María Marín Quemada, expressed his wishes for the new government not to divide the agency, and that it will instead return its powers over the electric market.
Marín Quemada has stated that he still does not know if the Executive under Pedro Sánchez intends to “split up” the CNMC, as the previous Economy Minister had said. Regarding the electric market, he has indicated that he does not know the views of the Government either, although he has commented that he hopes that they will return the agency’s powers, “as Brussels has ordered.”
After a first warning in February 2015, the European Commission opened an infringement procedure against Spain in 2016, having considered that the fixing of tolls should be in the hands of independent bodies, as required by Community rules.
CNMC and ERSE, the Portuguese power utility regulatory agency, agreed on a pricing policy they submitted to the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators in Brussels. Then, on May 9, 2018, the State Ministry for Energy passed a resolution that contradicted these arrangements and the CNMC’s purported powers of regulation. This has been appealed by the CNMC to Spain’s National Assembly.
Marín Quemada has stated that it is still “extraordinarily” soon to make these decisions, since the new Executive has just begun his administration, but has stated that “the CNMC is always available to talk about all these issues because they are critical.”

EU antitrust regulators are set to approve US cable company Comcast’s bid for European pay-TV company Sky without demanding concessions, reported Reuters.
Comcast is battling Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky. The media mogul’s bid to buy all of Sky has been delayed by politicians and regulators worried about the power of the enlarged media group.
Earlier this week, Britain gave the green light to Fox’s bid to acquire all of Sky on condition it sold off its TV news business. Fox now owns 39% of Sky, which has operations in Germany, Austria, Italy and Britain.
Sky’s 23 million customers makes it an invaluable asset to any media group seeking to better compete against online groups Netflix and Amazon.

This report is according to two people familiar with the matter.
The DOJ, which is evaluating T-Mobile’s US$26 billion deal to buy Sprint, has been speaking with small wireless operators that buy access to the major wireless networks at wholesale rates, and is seeking their opinions about the merger, the people said, who declined to be named because the talks are confidential.
Including AT&T and Verizon, there are four major US wireless providers. Since the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division recently refused to commit to keep four carriers after the T-Mobile deal is completed—an issue that contributed to AT&T dropping its pursuit to buy T-Mobile in 2011—the department’s examination of the wholesale market suggests the government is giving the deal a thorough review.

EU antitrust authorities are gearing up to fine Alphabet up to US$11 billion over antitrust issues related to its Android operating system, according to a report Wednesday, June 6, in the Financial Times.
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, is expected to announce the fine within several weeks but the exact size of the fine wasn’t clear, according to anonymous sources cited by the FT. The EU usually issues fines on the lower end of the US$11 billion spectrum, according to the FT.
The EU announced the antitrust case in 2016 and accused the advertising giant of imposing licensing conditions for the Android OS that favored Google’s products and apps over rivals. The EU argued that these activities, among others, amounted to making it more difficult to develop competing web browsers and other operating systems, which ultimately would reduce innovation and give consumers fewer choices. Alphabet has denied the charges.
The EU also has investigated Google’s comparison shopping business, which resulted in a €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion at the time) fine.

21st Century Fox can proceed with its planned takeover bid for Sky, provided it sells the pay-TV broadcaster’s news division, the UK government announced on Tuesday, June 5.
UK culture minister Matt Hancock said the deal can move forward if Sky News is sold to a suitable third party. Regulators had held up the takeover because of concerns that ownership of Sky News would give Rupert Murdoch and his family too much influence over UK media.
The Murdoch-controlled Fox has been attempting to address those concerns through a series of concessions, including selling Sky News to Disney once the deal is complete.
Separately, Disney has struck a deal to buy Fox’s entertainment assets, including its stake in Sky.
However, US media giant Comcast waded into the bidding in February with a £22 billion (US$29.5 billion) offer for Sky, trumping the offer from Fox, which valued the broadcaster at £18.5 billion (US$24.8 billion).

Australian prosecutors charged the former local heads of Citigroup and Deutsche Bank with criminal cartel offenses, the most dramatic move so far in a country bent on taking bankers to task for years of misbehavior, reported Bloomberg.
The case centers on the banks’ actions following a AU$2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion) share sale by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) in 2015. Under Australia’s cartel laws, executives can face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. The three banks themselves are also being charged with criminal cartel offenses.
Australia’s banking industry, which thrived during the post-financial crisis years even as bankers elsewhere became symbols of destructive greed, has been convulsed in past months by public outrage. Until now, though, the scrutiny of banks had mostly centered on years of wrongdoing against retail customers and small businesses.
“These serious charges are the result of an ACCC investigation that has been running for more than two years,” Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement detailing the charges on Tuesday, June 5. ANZ and each of the individuals are alleged to have been knowingly involved in some or all of the alleged conduct, the watchdog said.

Qualcomm is asking the European Union’s General Court to strike down or substantially reduce a €997 million (US$1.2 billion) antitrust fine over payments made to Apple to ensure only its chips were used in iPhones and iPads, reported Bloomberg.
A short summary of the company’s legal arguments for the court appeal filed in April was published in the EU’s Official Journal on Monday, June 4.
Qualcomm argued that EU investigators were wrong to find that Qualcomm’s agreements with Apple were capable of harming competition and wrongly applied their own rules on how they set a fine. The company also said regulators distorted evidence in dismissing Qualcomm’s defense that some of its actions could be justified by efficiency.

The three primary markets of concern are: the bulk distribution of atmospheric gases which require special engineering capabilities to supply industrial customers such as steelmakers; the production of specialised gases; and the supply of helium as the parties and their two large rivals have secured the commercially viable sources.

The bitterest boardroom battle in recent memory has turned on a series of slights, verbal jousting and a physical altercation involving hands on a face that could determine the futures of both CBS and Viacom.
Shari Redstone, the controlling owner of CBS, has filed a complaint against the broadcaster and its chief executive Les Moonves in Delaware Chancery court, outlining her version of events in a saga that has pit the former allies against each other.
The filing further reveals Redstone’s master plan for CBS and Viacom, which also falls under her control. After a merger of the two, she proposes selling the united company for a much larger sum than either would fetch separately. She had tinkered with the idea for at least a year, according to sources, but this is the first public indication of that strategy.
Moonves was receptive to Redstone’s plan when she discussed it with him in the second half of last year, people familiar with the meeting say. As of January, he was still “supportive of a possible merger of CBS and Viacom,” according to her complaint.
People close to Moonves dispute the characterization of those meetings, saying the idea of selling a merged CBS and Viacom did not figure into their discussions.
Faced with declining sales at Viacom and the disintegration of the larger media industry under the weight of Facebook and Google’s growing dominance over audiences and advertisers, Redstone felt it was more urgent to consolidate that business with the more successful CBS, several sources say.

The political action committee (PAC), founded by then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1977 to espouse conservative causes, has joined the Coalition to Save Local Media, whose goal is not to save the merger, which it argues would put corporate elites in charge of the news.
“Even in the most capable and responsible hands, Centralized power, in all its forms, breeds exploitation and is anti-conservative,” said Craig Shirley, chairman of Citizens for the Republic (CFTR).”“Conservatives celebrate competition but this proposed merger would eliminate that. Local media news networks are some of the most trusted hard news sources in America. Permitting this merger would dramatically undermine this trust and fake news would spread like wildfire.”
The coalition already comprises a strange bedfellows collection of liberal and conservative voices united in their opposition to the deal. Its membership includes the American Cable Association, Common Cause, the Competitive Carriers Association, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix are all members), DISH Network, the Leased Access Programmers Association, NABET-CWA, NTCA (The Rural Broadband Association), One America News Network, Parents Television Council, Public Knowledge, RIDE TV, the Sports Fans Coalition, TheBlaze, and the United Church of Christ.

Comcast confirmed that it may make an offer for the entertainment assets that 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell to Walt Disney, escalating a bidding war that’s already underway over Fox’s European satellite business reported Bloomberg.
The move could further complicate a global game of M&A chess that’s being waged by some of the biggest media companies. This is because it threatens to escalate a bidding contest that’s already underway over Fox’s European satellite business.
Last fall, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts met with Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch to discuss such a union, but Murdoch was cool to Roberts’ overture.
Fox executives ultimately rejected that Comcast bid, believing that the chances of regulatory approval were better for Disney, which wants to bolster its TV and movie holdings for its direct-to-consumer streaming services. In addition, the Disney offer would turn Fox shareholders—including Murdoch and his family—into Disney shareholders. The Murdoch family would become one of Disney’s largest individual shareholders, with about 5% of the company’s stock.

One year after four Mexican Afores (retirement fund managers) were fined by the Federal Commission for Economic Competition Commission (Cofece), two of them have not yet complied with the sanction.
In 2017, Cofece imposed a historical fine of 1.1 billion Mexican pesos (US$ 57.4 million at the time) to retirement fund managers Sura, XXI Banorte, Principal, Profuturo GNP and 11 people), after determining that between November 2012 and June 2014, executives of the aforementioned Afores entered into agreements to discourage the transfer of accounts, by establishing maximum transfer amounts.
Principal Afore and Profuturo GNP, who were fined more than 75 million and almost 326 million Mexican pesos (US$3.7 million and US$16.4 million respectively), paid the penalties. However, GNP decided to challenge the process. For its part, XXI Banorte adhered to Cofece’s leniency program, which decreased its fine of almost 429 million Mexican pesos (US$21.5 million) to just over 300 million Mexican pesos (US$15.2 million); Sura also opted for legal challenges. The administrator filed an appeal over “the severity of the fine”, with all these processes still ongoing.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Monday, May 21, joined the growing chorus of government officials concerned about tech monopolies, reported Bloomberg.
“These issues deserve to be reviewed carefully,” Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview early Monday in response to a question about the CBS News report. “These are issues the Justice Department needs to look at seriously, not for any one company, but as these technology companies have a greater and greater impact on the economy.”
The report highlighted how critics and rivals, such as Yelp, are trying to bring Europe’s antitrust approach to Google to the US. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union competition commissioner, told CBS that she is intent on stopping Google’s “illegal behavior” in web search, suggesting that the regulator isn’t appeased by the company’s proposed solution for the hefty charges the EU filed last year.
Mnuchin’s comments come on the heels of a “60 Minutes” segmenton Google’s unparalleled market share in online search. The Sunday night spot included an interview with Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp, which he said “would have no shot” if it were being built today.
“That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their approach,” Stoppelman told “60 Minutes.” “If you provide great content in one of these categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially threatening, they will snuff you out … They will make you disappear. They will bury you.”

“The only people that benefit from uncertainty in antitrust law are antitrust lawyers,” Senator Mike Lee (Republican – Utah) said in a press release. “Both businesses and consumers deserve clarity and certainty when it comes to federal antitrust law enforcement and the SMARTER Act would create a simpler and more equal system.”
Right now, agencies apply the same substantive law to the mergers they review, but they often differ in their procedures. The SMARTER Act fixes this problem by requiring the FTC to satisfy the same standards that DOJ must meet.
 
“This is an important issue for the business community and for all Americans,” Senator Orrin Hatch (Republican – Utah) said in a press release. “There is no good reason for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to apply different standards in enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Businesses seeking to merge deserve consistent treatment without regard to which agency decides to review the merger. I look forward to working with Senator Lee to move this legislation forward to bring much-needed reforms to the merger review process.”

Posted by Bloomberg
A New View of Antitrust Law That Favors Workers
By Cass R. Sunstein
In the last half-century, the most innovative work in antitrust law came from the University of Chicago. According to the Chicago School, led by the legendary economist Aaron Director and promoted by law professor Robert Bork, the goal of antitrust law should be to increase consumer welfare, not to combat bigness as such.
Chicago School proponents often argued in favor of government restraint. In their view, uses of the antitrust law to prevent mergers, or to break up large companies, often do more harm than good. Their arguments have had a major influence on both regulators and courts, frequently promoting a “hands off” attitude in the face of growing concentrations of economic power.
Members of the Chicago School have rarely focused on the welfare of workers. Nor have they explored the possibility that big companies (like Apple or Google) might use their market power to hurt employees.

588,"May 13, 2018",US: AT&T CEO: Cohen was a mistake,"
Randall Stephenson, the chief executive officer of AT&T, wrote in a company-wide letter to staff on Friday, May 11, that the telecom giant made “a serious misjudgment” in its decision to hire President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen as a consultant last year.
“Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged,” Stephenson wrote. “There is no other way to say it—AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.”
The letter said that while the deal with Cohen was “done according to the law” and was “entirely legitimate,” the association with Cohen was “a serious misjudgment.”
Trump didn’t directly address AT&T’s payment of US$600,000 to Cohen’s firm for advice in 2017, but the president did tweet late Friday that his administration has been opposed to AT&T’s merger with Time Warner in an apparent defense of the company receiving any preferential treatment.

589,"May 13, 2018",US: Giuliani: Trump did/didn’t interfere with AT&T case,"
President Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani seemed to suggest that the president had a larger role in the Justice Department’s decision to block AT&T’s proposed merger with Time Warner in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday, May 11.
In the interview, Giuliani states that Trump “denied the merger,” which appears to fly in the face of months of assurances from the DOJ and the White House that Trump had no influence over the decision.
Giuliani made the comments after being asked whether Trump had knowledge that Michael Cohen, his lawyer, had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from AT&T in the weeks after the election for consulting work on the merger.
“The president had no knowledge of it,” the former New York City mayor told HuffPost.
Then, in another interview on Saturday, Giuliani’s comments appear to walk back from his earlier claim in the interview with HuffPost that Trump had personally intervened to stop AT&T’s attempt to merge with Time Warner.
“The president denied the merger. They didn’t get the result they wanted,” Giuliani said. He added, “Whatever lobbying was done didn’t reach the president.”
Before taking up his role as the DOJ’s antitrust chief in 2017, Makan Delrahim told a Canadian outlet, “I don’t see this as a major antitrust problem.” But he seemingly changed his mind once on the job. The Justice Department cited antitrust concerns when it blocked the proposed US$85 billion merger in November.

Pharmaceutical company Mylan NV announced that certain employees of Mylan in Italy were served with search warrants issued by the public prosecutor’s office in Milan, Italy, seeking information concerning interactions with an Italian hospital and sales of certain reimbursable drugs.
The company was not immediately available for additional details outside business hours.
Shares of the drugmaker were down 1.2% at US$37.44 after the bell.
In 2016, Mylan’s pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial. An investigation was opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the US Department of Justice, agreeing to pay US$465 million.

591,"May 13, 2018",US: Lyft-Uber union law gets another day in court,"
Seattle was the first US city to pass a law allowing Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize. But since that law passed in 2015, the business community has continually challenged it.
A federal appeals court sided with the business community on Friday, May 11. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision saying Seattle doesn’t have the authority to say whether drivers can collectively bargain over the fees ride-hailing companies charge them, according to Reuters.
The court was examining Seattle’s law because of a lawsuit brought last year by the US Chamber of Commerce, which lists Uber and Lyft as members. The chamber said Seattle’s ordinance violates antitrust laws because it could allow independent contractors to collude through collective bargaining and fix prices.
“The court’s decision is a win for rideshare drivers, riders and the entire Seattle community,” said Uber spokesman Caleb Weaver.
Lyft, too, said it was pleased with the decision. “This positive development will maintain the flexibility of drivers to choose when, where and for how long they drive—the very things that make Lyft so attractive to drivers and useful for passengers,” Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin said.
Though the 9th Circuit ruled Friday that ride-hail drivers couldn’t negotiate fees, it did say states could regulate the rates Uber and Lyft charge passengers. It also said city laws on collective bargaining couldn’t be pre-empted by federal labor law.

592,"May 13, 2018",US: DOJ indicts FX trader for rigging,"
A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Akshay Aiyer, a former currency trader at a major US bank, for his alleged role in a conspiracy to manipulate prices in the foreign currency exchange market, the Justice Department (DOJ) announced on Thursday, May 10.
The one-count indictment, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Akshay Aiyer with conspiring to fix prices and rig bids and offers in Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and African (CEEMEA) currencies, which were generally traded against the US dollar and the euro.
According to the indictment, from at least as early as October 2010 through at least July 2013, Aiyer, along with other New York-based CEEMEA traders working for rival banks, participated in a conspiracy designed to suppress competition in order to increase each trader’s profits and decrease each trader’s losses.  Aiyer and his co-conspirators carried out this agreement by engaging in near-daily conversations through private electronic chat rooms, telephone calls, and text messages, in which they exchanged trading positions, confidential customer information, planned pricing for customer orders, and other categories of competitively sensitive information.  Aiyer and his co-conspirators then used this information to coordinate their live trading in CEEMEA currencies, including, at times, by certain traders refraining from trading against the others. Throughout the conspiracy, Aiyer and his co-conspirators took affirmative steps to conceal their anticompetitive behavior.
“As today’s indictment demonstrates, the Antitrust Division remains committed to holding individuals accountable for anticompetitive conduct that violates the integrity of global financial markets,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division.

593,"May 13, 2018",Switzerland: College student raises US$140k for whistleblower who lost everything,"
Swiss college student Natanael Wildermuth started a crowdfunding campaign to aid Adam Quadroni who lost everything after exposing a Swiss construction cartel.
Quadroni owned a construction company in the south-eastern Swiss region of Graubünden. Although he was a long term member of the construction cartel himself, Quadroni exposed the cartel to investigators. After blowing the whistle, Quadroni found his company losing business and in 2013 he had to declare bankruptcy. Last year he encountered more personal problems.
Wildermuth heard about Quadroni’s troubles and said he “wanted to help Quadroni get his life back on track.”
The crowdfunding campaign was originally aimed to raise US$100,000 for Quadroni, but as of May 12 the campaign had raised US$140,000 with over 1200 people donating to the fund. With the goal long since passed, new plans are being looked at including starting a foundation.
Whistleblowers within private firms receive only limited protection under the Swiss justice system. While employees within the federal administration—and, to differing degrees, cantonal employees—have access to an anonymous reporting service, employees of private firms often face losing their job and prosecution.
The Swiss parliament has been looking at legal changes to boost protection for whistleblowers for several years without making progress.

594,"May 9, 2018",US: Gov asks judge to force AT&T to sell Turner or DirecTV,"
 
Seven weeks after the trial over the suit the Justice Department (DOJ) brought to stop AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner began, the two sides have made their final pitches to the judge who will decide the fate of the US$85 billion deal.
In a post-trial brief made public Wednesday, May 9, DOJ attorneys told the judge, Richard Leon, that if he approves the deal he should do so only on the condition that AT&T sell off either its satellite television company DirecTV, or Time Warner’s Turner networks, a group that includes CNN, HLN, TBS and TNT.
The Judge had asked both sides to dedicate a portion in their post-trial briefs to proposed remedies, conditions he could impose on the deal to protect consumers from any sort of possible anticompetitive harm. Antitrust remedies can be either structural, like selling off a portion of a company, or behavioral, like promising not to engage in certain actions or agreeing to oversight.
The government’s post-trial brief asks for the exact remedies it was proposing before the trial even started. And in their own post-trial brief, made public last week, attorneys for AT&T and Time Warner told the judge they don’t believe any remedies are necessary at all, which may be a sign they are confident Leon will find in their favor.
AT&T has long rejected the idea of selling either Turner or DirecTV, saying that doing so would completely negate the point of the merger, which the company says is necessary if it is to compete in a fast-changing landscape with competitors like Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google.

595,"May 9, 2018",US: Sinclair to sell 7 TV Stations to Fox to win regulatory OK,"
Twenty-First Century Fox has agreed to buy seven TV stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for US$910 million, reported Bloomberg.
The move comes as Sinclair is selling some stations to meet regulatory approval for its pending US$3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media. Meanwhile, Disney is pursuing a US$52 billion takeover of much of Fox, though TV stations will stay with Rupert Murdoch’s family under a new Fox company.
The Justice Department is “wrapping up” its vetting of station buyers, and Sinclair wants to move on to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval “very shortly,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley told investors. Ripley said he expects a 30-day comment period from the FCC.
“Now that we have completed Fox, we are going to back in front of the FCC,” Ripley said. He said that would trigger a 30-day review period.
As proposed in May, the deal would have extended Sinclair’s reach to more than 70% of US homes, exceeding the national limit of 39%. Sinclair says its proposed divestitures would bring it into compliance with the national cap. That calculation assumes it can count the audience at some stations on a discounted basis, a procedure approved by the FCC but under legal attack.

Comcast is considering a making major bid for parts of 21st Century Fox, setting up for a battle with Disney, which is also trying to acquire the assets. This time, however, Comcast is bringing cash to the table.
Comcast will attempt to outbid Disney’s initial offer of US$52 billion for the assets, including Fox’s movie studio and international channels. Comcast is also in the midst of a bid for European satellite TV company Sky, offering US$31 billion to gain control of the company, which Fox has also been trying to buy.
Reuters reported that the likely bid is all cash and that Comcast had already begun discussions to line up financing from banks, asking for US$60 billion to finance the bid.
Comcast had reportedly approached Fox about a similar deal in the fall but was turned down by the Murdoch family, which controls Fox, because they prefered Disney stock to Comcast stock and also viewed a tie with Comcast as more likely to be blocked by regulators.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the initial Phase 1 investigation found that the deal could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for some bill payers.
The two companies set out the proposed merger in November, with SSE shareholders to get a 66% stake in the combined business.
A Phase II investigation by the CMA, typically lasts 24 weeks and can be extended. SSE said it expects to complete the formation and listing of the new company in the last quarter of 2018 or first quarter of 2019.

598,"May 1, 2018",US: DOJ wraps up AT&T antitrust trial with a call for remedies,"
The trial over the Justice Department’s (DOJ) lawsuit to block AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner ended Monday, April 30. The Wall Street Journal reported the the DOJ urged the judge in the AT&T merger case to consider “alternative” remedies if he decides not to block the planned acquisition of Time Warner outright.
In the last few minutes of his 75-minute long closing statement, the government’s lead attorney, Craig Conrath, said the DOJ prefers structural remedies to the deal, including “partial divestures.” Should the merger be approved, he argued, AT&T should be forced to sell a portion of Time Warner such as the Turner Networks, which include CNN, TNT and TBS. The Turner Networks’ value to rival distributors is a major sticking point in the DOJ’s lawsuit, which alleges that AT&T would be able to threaten to withhold Turner content during negotiations with distributors in order to raise prices and lure customers away from rivals.
AT&T and Time Warner lead attorney Dan Petrocelli slammed the government’s case, saying it’s “thin, tenuous” and a “house of cards.”
“This is a case of theories in search of facts,” he said, telling Leon that the trial “has exposed serious questions about the credibility of the government’s entire presentation.”
Judge Richard Leon, who presided over the seven-week bench trial, said that he plans to issue his ruling on June 12 but left open the possibility that a ruling could come sooner. A June 12 ruling will fall just nine days before the June 21 merger deadline between the two companies, at which point either side could walk away from the deal.
The judge’s decision will guide dealmakers on how aggressive they can be with “‘vertical mergers’,” where one company buys another in the same industry but operating at a different point in the supply chain.

600,"May 1, 2018",Australia: Aurizon claims bias in Queensland Competition Authority rail ruling,"
Rail transport operator, Aurizon, has taken a brutal fight with the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) to the state Supreme Court, alleging chairman Roy Green failed to keep “an impartial mind” when handing down a decision last year on how much money the rail group can make from its networks business.
The move by the rail group escalates the battle that has been underway between the company and its regional regulator since December, when the QCA.
Because the ruling would have retroactive effect to July of 2017, Aurizon announced to its customers in February of 2018 that it would revert to sticking rigidly to maintenance schedules in order to save costs, instead of operating a more flexible program that suited their needs better and increased network capacity by 20 million tonnes per year.
The company claims that the draft ruling is flawed in key assumptions it makes on cost of capital and cost of maintenance.
Aurizon has claimed that Professor Green, who has been chairman of the QCA since 2015, was conflicted when the QCA released its draft decision governing rail access on December 15 2017, because he was appointed chairman of the Port of Newcastle in New South Wales, which is used by miners operating in the Hunter Valley to export coal, on December 18.
“Aurizon Network is seeking judicial review of the draft decision on the basis that it was affected by legal error because the QCA did not afford procedural fairness to Aurizon Network due to Professor Green’s conflict of interest and the apprehension of bias,” the rail operator said on Monday, April 30.

Would AT&T’s Time Warner Deal Help or Hurt Consumers? Judge Will Now Decide











By Cecilia Kang
Lawyers faced off over the future of AT&T’s $85.4 billion blockbuster merger with Time Warner for a final time in a courtroom on Monday, sparring over what the deal would mean to consumers.
The Justice Department, which sued to block the deal, argued that the merger would cost people millions of dollars a year by limiting competition. If the judge does approve the deal, the government said, the court should force the companies to sell off certain business lines to protect consumers.
But the companies countered that the government had failed to make its case. They said consumers would benefit from the merger because it would allow Time Warner and AT&T to compete more effectively against Silicon Valley companies like Google and Netflix.
“The only lessening of competition that would occur is if this merger is blocked,” said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner.

Petroleo Brasileiro SA has announced that it will abandon plans to sell its liquid propane (LP) gas unit through an initial public offering (IPO), opting to reopen a traditional sales process.
The parastatal company has not set a date for interested companies to present their proposals, as they continue to discuss the best way to avoid any conflict with the country’s competition authorities.
Petrobras has been searching for international buyers for its LP gas unit, Liquigas. The company is mainly engaged in the sale of gas canisters, primarily used by Brazilian households that are not connected to the fixed distribution network. The segment could prove to be unknown to investors in more developed markets.
Petrobras has also explored ways to structure the sale without provoking the wrath competition regulators. A previous agreement, in which Petrobras would have sold its subsidiary to the investment fund Ultrapar Participações in 2016, was blocked by competition regulator CADE. Ultrapar controls the largest distributor of LP gas in Brazil, Ultragaz. Some of Ultragaz’s rivals on that bid may still be interested in a new sale.

Under the deal announced Sunday, April 29, to merge Sprint with T-Mobile in the United States, SoftBank will end up with a minority stake of about 27% in the combined company. T-Mobile’s owner, Deutsche Telekom, will hold around 42% and also have control of the board and voting rights.
The merger, if it gets past regulators, will fulfill Softbank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son’s long-standing goal of creating a heavyweight challenger to AT&T and Verizon. But he won’t be in the driver’s seat.
Son, an ambitious dealmaker, has seen his vision fall apart before, reported CNN. He masterminded SoftBank’s 2013 takeover of Sprint with the aim of quickly merging it with T-Mobile. But concerns about regulatory challenges from the Obama administration effectively killed that plan and talks with T-Mobile ended in 2014.
“I lost my confidence that moment,” Son said at an earnings presentation early last year. “I really didn’t like the world anymore, I did a lot of thinking, and I lost my hair,” he joked, gesturing to his bald pate.
There is significant skepticism to the deal being approved, as noted by Columbia University law professor Tim Wu in a tweet. Both companies’ stock traded at significantly lower prices, closing on Monday, April 30 6.22% (T-Mobile) and 13.69% (Sprint) lower than the market close on Friday, April 27. At time of writing, SoftBank Group was trading 2.2% higher.

T-Mobile and Sprint have reached a “definitive agreement” to merge in an all-stock deal, which would create a new company with a total value of US$146 billion, based on current stock prices.
The two companies, the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers, respectively, behind Verizon and AT&T, have been trying to merge for years. But previous efforts have failed, often falling apart under intense regulatory scrutiny.
This deal still needs regulatory approval, from both the Justice Department, which will weigh antitrust concerns, and the Federal Communications Commission, which will consider whether the deal is in the public interest.
US regulators have recently challenged AT&T’s US$85 billion deal to purchase Time Warner, Reuters notes, and “are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings.”
The companies say merging will allow them to lower prices and put more pressure on Verizon and AT&T.

AT&T and US antitrust enforcers are set for their final face-off in court over the telecommunications giant’s planned takeover of Time Warner Inc. now that testimony in the merger trial ended.
The two sides will make closing arguments Monday, April 30, in Washington before US District Judge Richard Leon, who will decide whether to grant the Justice Department’s (DOJ) request to block AT&T’s nearly US$109 billion acquisition of Time Warner on antitrust grounds.
The DoJ on Thursday, April 26, finished questioning its final witness in the case, Professor Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, who reemphasized his earlier testimony that the deal will reduce competition.

“We’ll see what happens,” he told reporters outside the courtroom. “I would never bring a case I don’t think I can win.”
The DoJ claims the combination will raise prices for pay-TV subscribers across the country by hundreds of millions of dollars, an assertion that AT&T dismisses.
On Thursday, government lawyers tried to introduce filings AT&T and its DirecTV unit made with the Federal Communications Commission that they say support the theory that the phone company will gain leverage over pay-TV rivals by acquiring Time Warner.

America’s antitrust apparatus prepares to act against big tech














A University of Chicago conclave of experts debates how far to go
The rise of the big tech firms is easy to spot in downtown Chicago. Apple’s minimalist store looms over the riverfront, close to a skyscraper carrying the name of another omnipresent brand—Trump. At a bus stop a Facebook advertisement promises that its new algorithm will combat fake news. On the Magnificent Mile’s digital hoardings Google urges pedestrians to swoon into the arms of its voice-activated assistant.
Inside the University of Chicago, a bastion of free-market thinkers and of free speech, tech has become more prominent, too. On April 19th and 20th most of America’s antitrust establishment—officials, economists and lawyers—as well as a smattering of Silicon Valley types, gathered to discuss whether big tech needed to be tamed. The conclave came just days after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief, testified before Congress.
One Facebook executive was brave enough to show his face in Chicago, bearing the smile of someone stuck at the dentist for two days without anaesthetic. The experts agreed that government intervention in big tech is needed. But debate raged about which institutions should do it, and about the trade-offs between innovation and regulation, between privacy and free flows of data, and between stopping manipulation and protecting free speech.
When you assemble a room full of intelligent critics, the dizzying scope of the complaints against the tech industry becomes clear. They come in three flavours. First, antitrust worries, which take in big tech firms’ high market shares, buying-up of promising competitors, and potential monopsony power over suppliers and vendors. The five biggest American tech firms together make about a tenth of all corporate profits. Second, the externalities they may impose on their users, including a loss of privacy and tech addiction. And third, their probable pollution of the public sphere with fake news, mass manipulation and lobbying.
The view in Chicago was that Facebook and Alphabet (which owns Google) are the most vulnerable to regulation given their surveillance-based models and high market shares. Apple was viewed as less problematic given that it does not sell ads and has big competitors such as Samsung. Amazon divides opinion: its stratospheric valuation suggests it will evolve into a price-gouging monopoly but at the moment it is lowering consumer prices. Microsoft, which faced an antitrust case in 1998-2001, is now seen as big tech’s harmless uncle, a label which should delight it.

608,"April 23, 2018",Australia: Facebook rejects Australian call for regulation,"
Tech giant Facebook has opposed calls by Australian media companies for digital platforms to be regulated, amid an inquiry into their impact on competition in news and advertising markets.
The government tasked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this year with assessing whether platforms such as Facebook and Google were using their market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of users, news media and advertisers.
Australian media groups, like their peers worldwide, are losing circulation and advertising revenues to digital competitors.
Australian media tycoon Kerry Stokes, the head of major commercial broadcaster Seven, on Monday, April 23, urged Canberra to take “serious action” against the two online titans.
“The government must act decisively to curtail the frightening power and influence these companies have,” Stokes told The Australian newspaper.
“The duopoly of Facebook and Google now control over 80 percent of the global digital ad market, taking away advertising dollars from local media without any of the controls and rules we must adhere to, creating an uneven playing field.”

Understanding the Driving Forces Behind OMO and M&A Wave By Hongjun Zhong1
The capital market experienced a boom at the turn of the year. There were many mergers-and-acquisitions transactions in the Chinese capital market in the past two months. Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent’s vigorous trading are drawing widespread attention. Tencent recently has taken a stake in Heilan Home (a leading enterprise in apparel industry), soon after that Alibaba has announced its RMB 5.45 billion ($866 million) strategic investment in leading home furnishing operator, Beijing Easyhome Furnishing Chain Store Group Co Ltd. Furthermore, Tencent Holdings, partnering with domestic supermarket operator Yonghui Superstores in which Tencent has bought a stake, strategically invested in Carrefour China. This act delivers a clear signal to market that the Internet giants intend to extend their online competitive advantages to offline markets through investments in traditional retailers. A key feature of recent investment boom is that it is not occurred within industry but across industry, and mixed vertical integration with both on- and offline, rather than the division of industries.
This trend of online giant’s merging or investing in offline corporates does not restrict to China. It also occurs in U.S. The most well-known M&A case in 2017 is the online retail giant Amazon bought the high-end grocery Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in cash. This is the largest acquisition deal ever...

610,"April 23, 2018",EEUU: AT&T y Verizon vuelven a ser investigados por colusión,"
AT&T y Verizon están siendo investigados por el Departamento de Justicia de EEUU (DOJ) para determinar si las empresas se habrían coludido para evitar que sus clientes cambien de proveedor fácilmente, según reporta el New York Times.
La investigación antimonopolio se refiere a la tecnología eSIM (SIM integrada) que se usa en lugar de las tarjetas SIM comunes en los Apple Watches y otros dispositivos como Google Pixel 2. Se supone que los eSIMs permiten a los clientes cambiar de operadores sin cambiar de tarjeta o dispositivo SIM, pero se acusa a AT&T y Verizon de “tratar de establecer estándares que les permitan bloquear un dispositivo de su red, incluso si tuviera tecnología eSIM”, dijo el informe del Times.
La investigación se abrió hace unos cinco meses, después de que al menos un fabricante de dispositivos (identificado como Apple por fuentes cercanas al caso) y un proveedor de servicios inalámbricos presentaron quejas formales ante el DOJ.

611,"April 22, 2018",US: AT&T and Verizon are being investigated for collusion again,"
AT&T and Verizon are being investigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) over whether they colluded in order to prevent customers from easily switching carriers.
The antitrust investigation, reported by The New York Times relates to the eSIM (embedded SIM) technology that is used instead of regular SIM cards in cellular-capable Apple Watches and other devices such as the Google Pixel 2. eSIMs are supposed to let customers switch carriers without changing to a different SIM card or device, but AT&T and Verizon are accused of “try[ing] to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology,” the Times report said.
The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the DOJ, two of people with knowledge of the investigation. The device maker was Apple, one of them said.

While Google’s appeal of the US$2.9 billion fine imposed by the European Commission in 2017 makes its way forward, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told colleagues that the other two antitrust cases against Google were “advancing.” according to a report from Reuters.
The EC opened its investigation into Android in 2015, following a complaint two years earlier from the lobbying group FairSearch.
A 2016 document seen by Reuters said the EU competition enforcer planned to levy a large fine against the company and would order it to stop giving revenue-sharing payments to smartphone makers to pre-install only Google Search. It is also expected to tell the company, a unit of Alphabet, to stop requiring Google’s Chrome browser and other apps to be installed alongside Google’s Play store.
In the AdSense case, Google was accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising in 2016.
Europe’s antitrust chief was quoted by Reuters as saying on Wednesday, April 19, that its Android and AdSense investigations are “advancing.”
“We are advancing on our two cases involving Google, both the Android case and the AdSense case,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager was quoted as telling EU lawmakers.

613,"April 18, 2018",Russia: Gov threatens to block Facebook amid crackdown on Telegram,"
Russia has threatened to block Facebook as the authorities attempt to extend their control of the Internet and shut down the encrypted messaging service Telegram.
Alexander Zharov, the head of the state communications oversight agency Roskomnadzor, said the agency would conduct a check of Facebook in 2018 to see whether it is storing Russians’ personal data on servers in the country, as is stipulated under a controversial 2014 law.
It would also make sure the US Internet giant is deleting information banned by the Russian authorities, noting that “they are being significantly late” to do so.
The watchdog agency was granted authority to block the Telegram app on Friday, April 13, by a Moscow court, but the effort to follow through that started Monday caused a widespread outcry after the unintended consequences became apparent.
Telegram tried to thwart the blockage by shifting its service to two American web hosts, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, while at the same time repeatedly changing its IP address to skip ahead of Roskomnadzor.
In response, rather than chasing individual IP addresses (a unique set of numbers that identifies a computer, smartphone or other device connected to the internet), the watchdog agency elected to shut down enormous blocks of IP addresses, called subnets.
In an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia, Zharov said Facebook is already “far behind” schedule in granting the government’s requests. This is despite two meetings a year that have been taking place between the two parties, the latest of which happened in February, according to TASS. 
He warned, “In case something fails to be implemented or the Russian government is not notified of their intention to take the necessary action, then the issue of a block will definitely arise.”

Testifying on Wednesday, April 18, in the trial of the government’s lawsuit seeking to block its merger with AT&T, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes painted a grim picture of the threat posed by tech giants, especially Netflix, Facebook, Google and Amazon.
What Bewkes described as “tectonic changes” introduced by those companies and others over the past five years, are grounded in the amount of data they can gather about viewers. Time Warner, comparatively, is in the dark. “We know how many people are watching” networks such as HBO or TNT,” he said. “But we don’t know their names. Our direct competitors do. …. They know all sorts of things that we don’t.” He hammered home that point on the advertising side, highlighting gains by digital players in a remarkably self-effacing display by a media executive on the eve of the upfronts, where the theme will be TV’s reliability and reach in a time of dubious data practices.
“We didn’t have all this business of direct video” when the company spun off Time Warner Cable, Bewkes said in federal court in Washington, D.C. Back then, he said, “Netflix was still sending you DVDs in the mail.”
Under questioning by Daniel Petrocelli, the lead attorney for AT&T and Time Warner, Bewkes described in detail the two main shifts that have left Time Warner struggling to keep up: technology allowing companies like Netflix and Amazon.com to stream movies and TV shows directly to consumers, and ad spending on Google and Facebook that is taking off “like a rocket.”

The European Union’s digital chief will meet with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in San Francisco as the world’s largest social network faces increasing scrutiny over its use of personal data, reported Bloomberg.
Andrus Ansip, European Commission Vice President in charge of digital issues will meet with Zuckerberg on Tuesday, April 17, as well as meeting with Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, to discuss issues such as data protection, online privacy, illegal content and fake news. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg spoke to Ansip’s justice counterpart last week in what was described as an open and constructive discussion, reported Bloomberg.
Zuckerberg has been called to appear in the European Parliament to explain how Facebook data of as many as 2.7 million Europeans could have been passed to Cambridge Analytica. Separately, the EU Commission is planning to unveil new legislation next week to set rules for how they deal with business users, part of a wave of new rules across Europe that seek to curb big internet firms, most of them American.
The Brussels-based Commission said Ansip would also meet with Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, Twitter General Counsel Sean Edgett and Netflix General Counsel David Hyman in individual meetings to talk about data protection, online privacy, illegal content, disinformation campaigns, digital copyright and artificial intelligence.

Remediating Social Media: Why Layers Still Matter for Internet Policy






By Annemarie Bridy (University of Idaho)
2017 was a bad year for the Internet. Journalists trying to get to the bottom of the Russian election meddling story discovered pathologies of the Internet’s attention economy that legal and media scholars have been writing about for several years. From filter bubbles and clickbait to revenge porn and “fake news,” the antisocial effects of social media are now front and center in a serious public debate about the future of the Internet and the firms that have come to dominate it. As the public learns more about the ease with which the Internet’s most popular platforms can be exploited to harass, deceive, and manipulate their users, there is a growing consensus that the Internet is broken and that tech titans dominating the Internet’s edge are largely to blame.
The drumbeat for a regulatory response is getting louder. And it’s coming from points across the political spectrum. Some are calling for interventions in the area of antitrust law. Others have proposed imposing at the Internet’s application layer content neutrality rules that have historically applied only at the network layer. To describe such rules, conservative activist Phil Kerpen coined the term “layer-neutral net neutrality.” Supporters of this approach assert that rules requiring social media platforms to behave like network infrastructure providers in their handling of users’ content will enhance freedom of expression and limit the role of dominant platforms as gatekeepers of the privatized public sphere. Former Democratic Senator Al Franken offered the same rationale in an op-ed in The Guardian. Franken wrote that “no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn’t. And Facebook, Google, and Amazon—like ISPs—should be ‘neutral’ in their treatment of lawful information and commerce on their platforms.”
This article is a high-level effort to explain, in terms of both regulatory history and shifting public attitudes about online speech, why adopting a must-carry obligation for social media platforms is not what the Internet needs now. Such a requirement would more likely exacerbate than remediate social media’s current problems with information quality and integrity. Part I discusses the historical layer-consciousness of Internet regulation and explains the public policies underlying differential treatment of “core” and “edge” services. Part II considers evolving speech norms at the Internet’s edge and the increasing pressure on social media platforms to more actively address some demonstrable failures in social media’s “marketplace of ideas.” Part III argues that a must-carry rule for social media platforms is precisely the wrong regulatory approach for addressing those failures. The better prescription, I argue, is to breathe new life into the underused “Good Samaritan” provision in § 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which was intended to protect and promote good faith content moderation at the Internet’s edge. What the Internet needs now is not layer-neutral net neutrality; it is an awakening to what James Grimmelmann has called “the virtues of moderation.”

New frontiers in competition and consumer law



By Serpil Senelmis
Tech giants like Google and Facebook are increasingly coming under scrutiny from competition authorities and governments around the world. From Europe to the US, there are investigations looking into the impact of digital platforms and the possible use and effects of market power. Australia has recently joined the international chorus, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commencing an 18-month inquiry into digital platforms. So, what’s driving this review and why is it important?
The competition regulator will be studying whether and how high-tech companies are using their market power in Australia, whether they are disadvantaging traditional media players and whether the diversity and quality of news content are being affected. The inquiry was announced after the latest round of journalism job cuts in December 2017. There’s been massive disruption in the conventional media landscape with huge job losses at Fairfax, News Corp, and Huffington Post Australia. Bigger media players like Network 10 haven’t come out unscathed either – after haemorrhaging cash, the television network went into administration and was bought at a distressed price by CBS last year.
Professor Caron Beaton-Wells, Director of the Global Competition and Consumer Law program at the University of Melbourne, explains that unlike some other ACCC activity, this isn’t an investigation into a potential breach of the law, nor does it necessarily foreshadow enforcement action. According to Professor Beaton-Wells, this inquiry means “the ACCC can take a deep dive into a sector and really understand how it’s working.” She adds, the ACCC can “put the industry on notice – that it’s watching – and provide a framework for future action if that’s necessary.”
The inquiry into digital platforms “is important because of its subject matter,” says Professor Beaton-Wells. She states, “Digital platforms are playing an increasingly central role in every aspect of our social and economic life. Online platforms are obviously very beneficial in many ways, but they also raise some concerns and hence the need for an inquiry of this nature.” Further elaborating, “There are concerns on the competition side, but they’re not the only concerns of course. There are concerns for privacy, there are concerns for cybersecurity, and some even argue there are concerns for democracy.”

619,"March 19, 2018",US: Twitter considers ad ban on cryptos,"
Twitter looks to be following in Facebook and Google’s footsteps as it prepares to prohibit cryptocurrency ads on its site.
According to Sky News, the policy, which will be implemented in two weeks, will prohibit advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICOs), token sales and cryptocurrency wallets globally.
There is also the chance that the social media site will ban all crypto exchange ads, with a few exceptions.
At the end of January, Facebook announced that it was banning ads that promote “financial products and services frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” Beyond its own app, Facebook will also ban such ads on Instagram and within its network of third-party apps.
And just this past week, Google announced it has decided to not run ads for cryptocurrencies as part of its efforts to clamp down on advertisements that run afoul of its policies. The company said the new policy, which is slated to launch in June, will ban ads for cryptocurrencies and related content and financial spread betting, among other things.
Both Facebook and Google also banned ads for binary options trading after it was revealed that victims’ losses in Britain have risen by 400,000% in six years.
This is another blow for cryptocurrency exchanges, with governments and financial institutions warning investors of the risks associated with the platforms.
Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued dozens of requests for information and subpoenas from companies who have dipped, or are dipping, corporate toes in the initial coin offerings pool.
In addition, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that cryptocurrencies are facing a regulatory crackdown, telling Sky News that the time has come to “regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities.”
“There are a number of problems with cryptocurrencies. They are small now, but they are getting bigger,” he said. “There are issues for authorities who deal with money laundering, terrorist financing and price fixing. There have been a number of incidents of theft – not just big crimes, but also steady thefts from people’s wallets.”

The Curious Case For Breaking Up Tech Giants


By Karen Webster
There’s no question that the world’s weather patterns are undergoing a massive change.
In the last few months alone, we’ve seen snow in Rome and three powerful nor’easters in Boston in the space of two and a half weeks — with some forecasts predicting a fourth this week. 2017 was the most destructive hurricane season in 82 years, with Harvey, Irma and Maria pummeling parts of the U.S. and the Caribbean, leaving tens of billions of dollars in damage in their wake. In Sept. 2017, more than 230 people lost their lives when Mexico City was struck by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake.
To name but a few.
This must all be because Beyoncé and Jay-Z had twins in July.
Think about it — did any of this happen before they had those twins?
It did not.
Those twins were born July 2017. All of these bad things happened after that.
Cause and effect.
Their twins. Our really, really bad weather.
I’d say there’s about as much of a correlation between our bad weather and the birth of those cute little twins as there is between Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon’s fortunes getting bigger and middle class wages getting smaller.
Yet, that’s the claim being made by Scott Galloway — serial entrepreneur and adjunct faculty member at the Stern School of Business who wrote a book, participated in numerous TV interviews and composed a 7,000-word article in Esquire saying just that.
His thesis is based almost entirely on what statisticians call spurious correlation — inferring cause and effect from the seeming correlation between two unrelated things. A famous one is the correlation between sunspots and murder rates — there is none.
Galloway’s narrative asserts that “the four” — Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google — should be broken up.
And that we should do that not because they’re tax evaders or evil — all things he said they, like all of us, are.
And not even because they’re job destroyers, which he said is the natural consequence of innovation, and innovation is goodness.
But because not breaking them up throws cold water on the American dream — which is to work hard, save money, be prosperous and even become a millionaire, as he told CNBC in a recent interview.
So, as capitalists, he said, it’s now time to “oxygenate” the economy and “prune [the] firms [that have] become invasive, cause premature death and won’t let other firms emerge.”

621,"March 18, 2018",Mergers of old-media titans miss the point,"
By Rana Foroohar
It is rather amazing that two huge US companies looking to cut an $85bn merger are looking like underdogs. But as AT&T and Time Warner go head to head with the US government over the legality of their proposed tie-up, that is precisely what they appear to be. 
Makan Delrahim, the Department of Justice’s antitrust head, plans to argue that telecoms powerhouse AT&T should be prevented from buying media company Time Warner because the two companies together will have monopoly powers that would result in higher cable prices for American consumers. The corporations themselves, of course, argue the opposite. 
They claim the merger is necessary to stave off competitive pressure from bigger fish — Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. I find myself agreeing with them. These tech platforms are among the largest and richest companies in the world and dominate their respective markets. Economic research shows that this kind of monopoly power typically stifles innovation, competition, job creation and growth. Whichever way the AT&T-Time Warner case goes, it will do little to solve these problems, because it will not address the main issue: US competition policy today is fundamentally unsuited to the digital economy. It is time to rethink antitrust policy and the definition not only of consumer welfare, but of welfare itself For decades now, American antitrust policy has centred around notions of “consumer welfare”. 
The key question about any given merger is whether it will make things better or worse for consumers. The definition of “better” has traditionally been defined by pricing. If consumer costs look likely to go down, a merger will go through. And yet the digital world is one in which data, not dollars, are the currency. Consumers receive services such as search, e-commerce and video streaming cheaply, or even for free. 
Free is not really free. We pay for these services by handing over our personal data in exchange for access. In this barter economy, using price as a measure of welfare is all but pointless. Consumers have no clear idea how valuable their data are to the companies that mine them. My guess is that the information is worth a lot more than the $65 a month in subscription fees that Time Warner receives for a cable and broadband bundle. The imbalance between Time Warner and the platform companies is highlighted by the AT&T-Time Warner pre-trial brief. As BTIG media analyst Richard Greenfield recently wrote to clients, this “reads like an instruction manual for investors explaining why they should no longer invest in legacy media companies”. Google offers up to 50 channels of premium content on YouTube for $40 a month. Amazon and Netflix have become content producers that compete for talent with cable network HBO. 
Apple and Facebook will each spend $1bn this year on video content. US digital advertising surpassed TV advertising in 2016, making it even tougher for companies like Time Warner to keep subscription fees low. Google and Facebook took 84 per cent of that digital advertising market last year. No wonder more than 22m US cable customers have cut the cord as of 2017 — up 33 per cent from 2016. 
If someone has monopoly power in this world, it is not the legacy media players. The tech platform companies argue that none of this is a problem, because the result is great for customers: they receive seamlessly delivered, cheap, high-quality programming. Applying this definition of consumer welfare to our digital economy will ensure more, not less, concentration of corporate power. 
That is a problem for people like me who believe that monopoly power is an obstacle to shared economic growth. It is time to rethink antitrust policy and the definition not only of consumer welfare, but of welfare itself. The conversation is already brewing, thanks to people like Barry Lynn, a former policy wonk at the New America Foundation, a think-tank. He argues for a return to an earlier approach to competition policy. Before the 1980s, US antitrust law held that too much economic power created too much political power — and that was inherently bad for consumers and society. 
It allowed big companies to create an uneven political playing field. (Fact: the tech sector, led by Google, is now the single largest corporate lobbying block in Washington.) This view implies a much broader notion of economic welfare, shifting the lens from the individual to the entire ecosystem. Walmart or Amazon, for example, might lower prices for consumers, but their size also allows them to squeeze their supply chains. 
That in turn could result in fewer start-ups and thus less job creation. That definition of welfare is harder to quantify, but it is already used by the US Federal Reserve, which under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is obliged to look after the overall economic development of communities. 
Since 2008, the Boston, Chicago and San Francisco Feds have all vigorously supported this goal, seeking to connect borrowers and lenders and support entrepreneurs. While the justice department is right to focus on corporate power, the Trump administration is picking the wrong target. Mergers between old media giants are beside the point in a digital world.

622,"March 15, 2018",US: TV bills will spike US$436m a year with AT&T-Time Warner merger?,"
If AT&T is allowed to buy Time Warner Inc., the Justice Department (DOJ) argued, it will raise the total annual US pay TV bill by US$436 million, reported Ars Technica.
The DOJ made that assertion in a trial brief (download the PDF here) last week, first reported on by Ars Technica. The DOJ is suing AT&T to block its US$85 billion bid to buy Time Warner.
“If TV program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,” the DOJ brief said. “In short, the transaction violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, because its effect ‘may be substantially to lessen competition.’ Prices for current services will go up and development of emerging competition will slow down.”
The DOJ cites calculations by economics professor Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley, who will be one of the government’s expert witnesses at the trial, which starts Monday, March 19, at the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The DOJ summarized Shapiro’s analysis in its brief last week, but it will be presented in more detail at the trial.

623,"March 13, 2018",Germany: Mundt plans third digital market investigation,"
The German antitrust regulator plan to open its third investigation into the digital market soon, its chief said on Tuesday, March 13, sending a warning to tech companies not to abuse their dominance or misuse their collection of personal data.
The comments underline growing regulatory concerns across Europe about the collection of personal data by tech companies.
Last month, the Federal Cartel Office kicked off a sector inquiry into online advertising after advertisers and publishers voiced worries about Google and Facebook’s strong market position.
The move came two months after the regulator launched a sector inquiry to find out how smart TV makers handled user data and the terms of their contracts. Smart TVs, which allow viewers to receive and transmit their user data, have become increasingly popular.
“There will be a third one (sector inquiry) in a short period of time which we are hoping to get out,” antitrust chief Andreas Mundt told a conference organized by the Studienvereinigung Kartellrecht association.

El Representante David Cicilline (Demócrata-Rhode Island) presentó este 7 de marzo de 2018 la Ley de Preservación y Competencia Periodística, para eximir a los editores de las leyes antimonopolio y así permitir que puedan negociar de forma colectiva con plataformas tecnológicas (Facebook, Google) sobre los términos de distribución de su contenido.
El demócrata de Rhode Island dijo que su proyecto de ley “aseguraría que los consumidores tengan acceso al mejor periodismo posible”. Señaló que Facebook y Google controlan alrededor del 75% del mercado publicitario digital de Estados Unidos.
En caso de convertirse en ley, Cicilline dijo que su proyecto  “abordaría el desequilibrio en el mercado provocado por el dominio de las plataformas y ayudaría a los editores de noticias confiables a protegerse a sí mismos y a sus lectores”. Su proyecto de ley proporcionaría una ventana de 48 meses para que los diarios ajusten los términos de remuneración a los editores por las ganancias obtenidas mediante subscripciones y publicidad.
“Estamos agradecidos con el congresista Cicilline por su compromiso por asegurar una competencia justa con las plataformas y por su trabajo para preservar el periodismo de calidad”, dijo el presidente de News Media Alliance, David Chavern, sobre la presentación del proyecto de ley. “Nuestra industria depende de nuestra capacidad para continuar invirtiendo en historias que denuncien la verdad y responsabilicen a nuestros funcionarios públicos”.

625,"March 11, 2018",AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case,"
Politics have been at the center of the public debate about the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AT&T’s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. But the trial itself, starting later this month, is shaping up to be a fight focused on classic issues in antitrust law.
In court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. AT&T and Time Warner will counter those arguments by saying that even with a merger, it is an underdog against online giants like Facebook and Google.
“If TV-program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,” the Justice Department said in its brief submitted on Friday evening.

626,"March 8, 2018",US: Newspapers seek antitrust exemption,"
Representative David Cicilline (Democrat-Rhode Island) introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act on March 7, 2018, to exempt publishers from antitrust laws so they can negotiate collectively with tech platforms (Facebook, Google) over the terms regarding distribution of their content.
The Rhode Island Democrat said his bill would “ensure consumers have access to the best journalism possible.” He noted that Facebook and Google control about 75% of the US digital advertising market.
If passed into law, Cicilline said his bill would “address the imbalance in the marketplace brought on by the platforms’ dominance and help trusted news publishers protect themselves and their readers.” His bill would provide a 48-month window for newspaper companies to iron out terms for the flow of subscription and ad dollars back to publishers.
“We are grateful to Congressman Cicilline for his commitment to ensuring fair competition with the platforms and for his work to preserve quality journalism,” News Media Alliance president David Chavern said of the bill’s introduction. “Our industry depends on our ability to continue to invest in stories that report the truth and hold our public officials accountable.”

France’s competition authority,Autorité de la Concurrence, is considering opening up antitrust investigations into the country’s online advertising market following an initial, one-year preliminary examination. 
The regulator mentioned the dominance of tech giants Facebook and Alphabet’s Google on the market and will decide upon potential investigations “over the next few months”, its president Isabelle de Silva said on Tuesday, March 6.
“What is clear is the overwhelmingly dominant position of Google and Facebook,” president of the French competition body, Isabelle de Silva, said. The Authority’s report highlighted that the two companies acted as both publishers and technical intermediaries for advertisers, giving them a competitive advantage.
“Facebook is only one option among many others for advertisers to reach audiences,” Delphine Reyre, Facebook’s director of policy for Europe, said in a statement.

628,"March 5, 2018",US: Nest no longer has a home at Amazon,"
Nest, the Internet-connected home device company owned by Google, was informed last week that Amazon won’t be selling any of the recent products the company launched.
Citing a person familiar with a conference call between the two companies, Business Insider reported that Nest employees were told the decision not to sell Nest products—including the Nest thermostat and Nest Secure home security system—came from the top and had nothing to do with the quality of the products. The Nest employees who took part on the call walked away with the impression that Amazon head Jeff Bezos was driving the decision, reported Business Insider. Amazon’s retail team did not say that explicitly during the meeting, the report noted.
Because of Amazon’s decision, Business Insider reported that Nest opted to stop selling all of its products on the eCommerce platform as of now. Once the current inventory is sold out, Amazon customers won’t be able to purchase any Nest products. The report noted that Google informed Nest previously that they had heard Amazon would not sell its newer products as it continues to battle with Google. Nest decided to pull the products it sells on Amazon because it thinks it’s best that they offer their entire product line or nothing at all, noted the report.
The move comes as Amazon is beefing up its own offering in the smart home market—where it sees Alexa, its voice-activated assistant, controlling all sorts of features and functions in the home. Late last month it acquired Ring, the digital security company that sells the popular Ring doorbell camera. According to CNBC, a Ring spokesperson confirmed the deal, telling CNBC the company will “be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.” CNBC reported Amazon is expected to maintain Ring as a standalone business, a past strategy with other acquisitions. While financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Reuters reported the deal could be worth more than US$1 billion,  potentially one of the biggest acquisitions for the company. Ring has raised US$209 million in funding, giving it a recent value of US$760 million or more.

The Supreme Court case that could give tech giants more power
Big tech platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Google — control a large and growing share of our commerce and communications, and the scope and degree of their dominance poses real hazards. A bipartisan consensus has formed around this idea. Senator Elizabeth Warren has charged tech giants with using their heft to “snuff out competition,” and even Senator Ted Cruz — usually a foe of government regulation — recently warned of their “unprecedented” size and power. While the potential tools for redressing the harms vary, a growing chorus is calling for the use of antitrust law.
But the decision in a case currently before the Supreme Court could block off that path, by effectively shielding big tech platforms from serious antitrust scrutiny. On Monday the Court heard Ohio v. American Express, a case centering on a technical but critical question about how to analyze harmful conduct by firms that serve multiple groups of users. Though the case concerns the credit card industry, it could have sweeping ramifications for the way in which antitrust law gets applied generally, especially with regards to the tech giants.

The FTC has had just two commissioners since the Trump administration came into office more than a year ago. The FTC works with the US Justice Department to enforce antitrust law in the US and also serves as a consumer-protection agency.
At their confirmation hearing, Simons said that the FTC should be open to investigating big tech firms like Google or Facebook if they use their considerable clout inappropriately and should create a drug pricing task force to identify unusual price increases.

The preliminary settlement with the German bank was disclosed in filings on Tuesday, February 27, with the US District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge’s approval.
Deutsche Bank is the third bank to resolve claims by so-called “over-the-counter” investors that transacted directly with banks on a panel to determine Libor.
Citigroup reached a similar US$130 million settlement last July, while the British bank Barclays settled for US$120 million in November 2015.

Tech Giants Are Less Powerful Than They Seem
By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.
Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that the Facebook algorithm will be revamped to downgrade third-party “news” may have been a lot of things—a way to calm critics of Facebook’s election role, a way to re-engage users who were turned off by the political din.

But it was also something else: At this late date, Mr. Zuckerberg, with two billion users and a $560 billion market cap, is still hunting for a sustainable product and revenue model for his company.
Idiocy is in a waxing phase in America. We know that. And Facebook and its social-media fellows have plenty to answer for in the court of public opinion, with their algorithms constantly supplying us things to be unhinged about. But antitrust is not a solution for the privacy and fake news problems that come with social media. And neither is antitrust called for on traditional monopoly grounds.
Google is said to be dominant in a certain kind of “search,” but searching for purchasable items now often begins on Amazon. Meanwhile, much of the online information that most preoccupies Americans is to be found inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps whose data isn’t reachable by Google.
Facebook is surely dominant in the business of algorithmically sifting your friends’ posts to decide which you’ll see, but there remain plenty of other ways for friends to exchange information.
Facebook and Google together are said to be dominant in digital advertising. But digital ads are ads, a $540 billion annual market they hardly dominate.
Amazon is said to be dominant in e-commerce, with a 44% share. But its share of total U.S. retail sales is 4%. Its share of global retail sales is less than 0.5%.

What’s more, companies dominant today won’t be dominant a decade or two from now. That’s the lesson of history. Today’s leaders will guard existing cash flows and leave it to others to try to catch the next bit of lightning in a bottle. And for good reason: The iPhone, Google’s search box and the Facebook twist on social media were far from certain to be the windfalls they turned out to be.
Are we not catching whiffs of impending maturity? Amazon is hunting for a second headquarters to house 50,000 new staff. It’s bulking up on storefronts and fleets of trucks and planes. Wasn’t the appeal of digital economics supposed to be the ability to grow without a commensurate rise in overhead? And who will run this sprawling retail conglomerate when Jeff Bezos is gone?
Facebook not only is running out of new users to sign up, its adherents are starting to notice that they see only a tiny, Facebook-biased fraction of what their “friends” intend them to see.

635,"February 20, 2018",Opinion By Former Senior Government Officials and Leading Antitrust Experts on the Significant Antitrust Risks Posed by Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm,"
Abstract:   There are material regulatory risks associated with any combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm. Given the parties’ competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the complexity of complying with a divestiture demand because of the difficulty the parties will have separating these businesses and selling them to an acceptable buyer, and the real risk that agencies (e.g., China’s MOFCOM) may demand significant restrictions on Broadcom’s post-merger licensing and distribution practices, the transaction presents significant antitrust risk.
See full PDF here 
February 20, 2018
Based on our experience as former senior government officials and practitioners with significant cross-border antitrust merger review experience, we write to share the significant antitrust risks posed by Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm.[1]
Broadcom’s February 9, 2018 proposed merger agreement states, in relevant part, that: (1) Broadcom agrees to use its “reasonable best efforts” to complete the process; (2) to that end, it is willing to divest Qualcomm’s network (but not mobile) WiFi and Radio Frequency Front-End (RFFE) assets or businesses (excluding integrated products such as Snapdragon) and any other Qualcomm assets, licenses, or other businesses so long as not material; and (3) Broadcom will pay Qualcomm a reverse break-up fee of $8 billion in the event that regulatory approval is not received, assuming that there has been no “material adverse effects” (MAEs) on Qualcomm’s businesses.
The proposed agreement further provides for the following limitations on Qualcomm during the period between signing and closing: (1) prohibitions on initiating litigation, including to enforce its intellectual property rights (IPRs) against infringers who refuse to pay; (2) prohibitions on entering into any license agreement or materially amending existing agreements; and (3) prohibitions on settling existing litigation without Broadcom’s consent. Based on public reports, we also understand that Broadcom has further stated that it is now willing to commit to additional divestitures, including its own connectivity businesses, but has not agreed to commit to accept conduct remedies such as prohibitions on bundling or tying products.[2]
Given these terms, shareholders should be aware of the following:

the real risk that foreign antitrust agencies will impose onerous remedies that either restrict the parties’ ability to engage in certain conduct or require them to take specific actions;
the prior actions of antitrust agencies in rejecting proposed divestiture buyers that do not have both the ability and incentive to compete with the combined entity on day 1 and to take the technologies to the next generation;
that similar complex cross-border deals have taken 18+ months to gain regulatory approval, especially where—as here—approval is required by numerous jurisdictions (here, the United States, the European Union, China, India, Korea, and Taiwan); and
the likelihood that Broadcom’s proposed limitations on how Qualcomm can run its business from signing to close violate antitrust “gun-jumping” rules, which alone could be the subject of a separate investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and others.

With respect to conduct remedies, there are countless examples showing that regulators can and do impose substantial conduct remedies, including those that could amount to an MAE, and that may not be merger-specific. These include:

Interoperability requirements (e.g., the European Commission’s (EC’s) Intel/McAfee and Intel/Altera decisions requiring the companies to take specific steps to ensure that their products interoperated with competitors’ products);
Prohibitions on tying or bundling products (e.g., the EC’s Intel/McAfee and China’s Ministry of Commerce’s Merck/AZ);
Prohibitions on seeking or enforcing injunctive relief on FRAND-assured SEPs (e.g., MOFCOM’s Microsoft-Nokia);
Price caps (e.g., MOFCOM’s Microsoft-Nokia and Merck-AZ imposing royalty caps on IPRs);
Requirements to invest in specific amounts of research and development (e.g., MOFCOM’s Samsung/Seagate, requiring Seagate to invest at least $800 million a year for three years in innovation to ensure that the company would bring more innovative products and solutions to consumers);
Non-merger-specific remedies to address other concerns the agencies may have already or discover during the review process (e.g., distribution-related remedies imposed by MOFCOM in ABI-SABMiller); and
Other non-merger specific remedies to protect domestic champions (e.g., in Google/Motorola, MOFCOM required Google to maintain Android as open and to continue to provide Android to Chinese manufacturers on an expeditious basis).

The real risk posed by these types of remedies generally requires deal protection for shareholders, including a “hell-or-high-water clause” (i.e., do whatever is necessary to get the deal done), or at least defining the MAE provision so as to exclude remedies that may be required by antitrust regulators. Such protections ensure that a buyer cannot walk away from the deal at any point during or after a protracted regulatory review period, particularly given the likely disruption caused to targets (here, Qualcomm) during such a review period.
With respect to divestitures, antitrust agencies will require that any divestiture remedies fully replace the loss of Qualcomm’s competitive pressure in the market, i.e., any remedy must make competition “whole” in the sense that it must put another competitor in a position to compete as effectively against Broadcom as Qualcomm does today (and likely into the future). And, of course, any divestiture transaction would itself have to be reviewed for antitrust and national security issues.
Prior agency precedent makes it clear that agencies require divestiture buyers have the incentive and ability to compete immediately, and continue competing into the future.

Applied Materials/Tokyo Electron (2015) was abandoned after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) rejected the parties’ tool-line (product) divestitures as insufficient to preserve existing competition with respect to “the development of equipment for next-generation semiconductors” on the grounds that proposed buyer was not already focused on the product-line and did not have the same capacity to innovate. The DOJ was also concerned that the transaction would have combined “the two largest competitors with the necessary know-how, resources and ability to develop and supply” the technology products at issue.
As DOJ’s then Chief Economist observed, “[n]aturally, the Antitrust Division would be . . . wary of the ability of any remedy to replicate [the] competitive dynamic” and DOJ ultimately concluded “that replicating the competitive significance of one of the most innovative companies in a sector that is virtually synonymous with innovation would be exceptionally challenging.”[3]
The U.S. antitrust agencies have also rejected proposed divestiture buyers because they could not effectively compete on Day 1. In Sysco Corp./US Foods Inc., the FTC rejected divestiture of facilities and sued to block the transaction; in Staples Inc./Office Depot Inc., the FTC rejected divestiture of significant contracts, and sued to block the transaction; and in Baker Hughes/Haliburton, the DOJ rejected divestiture package because, among other things, the discreet assets were insufficient for remedy.

With respect to likely review timing, recent deals suggest that the regulatory approval process is likely to take 18+ months (see e.g., Qualcomm/NXP—15+ months and counting despite the lack of direct competition between the parties; Penn State Hershey/Pinnacle—abandoned by the parties in 2016 after a 28 month review period; Advocacy Health Care/NorthShore University Health System—abandoned in 2017 after a 30 month review period; Halliburton/Baker Hughes—abandoned in 2016 after a 19 month review period; DuPont/Dow Chemical and Abbott Laboratories/Alere—each taking 20 months to gain necessary approvals. Indeed, the recent proposed merger of the #1 and #3 global suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment was abandoned after an 18-month review period.
In short, there are material regulatory risks associated with any combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm. In the United States, Europe, and China, in particular, this deal raises significant issues that will require a substantial amount of time and effort for global regulatory agencies to resolve. Given the parties’ competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the complexity of complying with a divestiture demand because of the difficulty the parties will have separating these businesses and selling them to an acceptable buyer, and the real risk that agencies (e.g., MOFCOM) may demand significant restrictions on Broadcom’s post-merger licensing and distribution practices, the transaction presents significant antitrust risk.

The Commission is currently looking at whether Facebook, Google or others have misused their market power in commercial dealings plus their impact on the “quality and choice of news.” They are also looking as what the digital platforms know about their users and whether this information has been collected in a transparent way.

Mr Sims, who is not currently on Facebook but intends to open an account shortly, said the ACCC’s inquiry will involve asking consumers how much they think the digital platforms know about them and comparing that to what is in fact being gathered.

President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) told the Senate Commerce Committee Wednesday, February 14, that he’s open to investigating big tech firms like Facebook and Google, should they use their power inappropriately.reported the Washington Post.
During a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, Joseph Simons, a corporate antitrust lawyer and the president’s choice to lead the FTC, said he would prioritize consumer protection issues “where harm is the greatest,” that would garner the “biggest bang for taxpayer dollar.”
“Oftentimes companies get big because they are successful with the consumer, they offer a good service at a low price. And that’s a good thing, and we don’t want to interfere with that,” Simons said when asked on his views of antitrust concerns in Silicon Valley. “On the other hand, companies that are already big and influential can sometimes use inappropriate means, anticompetitive means to get big or to stay big. And if that’s the case then we should be vigorously enforcing the antitrust laws.”
The nominees were asked about a wide range of topics, from how they’d address antitrust concerns over big tech companies to protecting consumers in the wake of serious data breaches and whether they felt the FTC was equipped to police the internet.
Confirmation of the four nominees is expected to go through smoothly. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, said he hoped to move the nominations quickly to the floor for a vote.

639,"February 14, 2018",US: Turner CEO calls Gov “Clueless” about AT&T-Time Warner merger,"
Turner CEO John Martin thinks his future bosses at AT&T have some work to do.  The telecommunications giants “have let us down,” Martin on Tuesday, February 13, told attendees at the Code Media conference in Huntington Beach, California. When asked if he meant AT&T, which is in the process of acquiring Turner parent company Time Warner, the exec responded, “I have DirecTV. I live in Beverly Hills. It’s not that good. They have not innovated quickly enough.”
Martin’s point was that the legacy media companies need to focus on the customer experience as much as on the content they are producing. By the time they catch up to Netflix and other streaming video providers, he added, “nobody is going to be watching anymore because they’re all going to be on the non-advertising supported platforms.”
Martin was joined onstage by A+E Networks chief Nancy Dubuc, who fielded questions about the Amazon Studios chief job and Vice Media. Together, they discussed the impact of media consolidation on their businesses, and Martin expressed frustration about the lengthy regulatory approval process for AT&T’s proposed $85 billion deal.
“I think the government is clueless,” he said, explaining that the Department of Justice should be more concerned about stopping Facebook and Google from growing too large. “It’s a massive misallocation of resources and capital to fight this thing. They’re going to lose.”

640,"February 11, 2018",US: Uber agrees to a US$245m settlement with Waymo,"
The lawsuit that Waymo/Google/Alphabet filed against Uber last year—alleging the theft of trade secrets relating to the company’s LiDAR tech for use in self-driving vehicles—has now ended, following a settlement.
Uber execs have reportedly agreed to pay Waymo US$245 million (via shares of its stock) in order to bring the lawsuit to a close—with the announcement coming just before the fifth day of testimony was set to begin on Friday, February 9, in San Francisco.
Uber has also agreed not to incorporate Waymo’s confidential information into its hardware and software, though Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi writes in a statement that he doesn’t believe his company used any of Waymo’s trade secrets in the first place.
A source familiar with the matter tells CNBC that Uber approached Waymo with a settlement offer within a week before the trial started.
The case started in February 2017 when Waymo accused Uber of using at least eight Waymo trade secrets in its self-driving cars. Waymo said that when Uber acquired the start-up Otto, founded by star Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, in late 2016, Levandowski brought some 14,000 Google files with him, some of which contained Waymo trade secrets. Uber rebutted that its self-driving sensor designs were unique and that Levandowski’s actions were unrelated to his work at Uber.

Is Knowledge (Market) Power? – On the Relationship Between Data Protection, ‘Data Power’ and Competition Law
By Torsten Körber (Universität zu Köln)
Everyone is talking about the relationship between data protection, “data power” and competition law. The increasing importance of data and the presumed concentration of data in the hands of certain companies have stoked fears, leading to calls for political regulation and increased antitrust oversight. The merger of Facebook and WhatsApp, the ongoing EU proceedings against Google, and the investigations of Facebook by the German FCO (Bundeskartellamt) have cast a spotlight on the role of competition law. The following contribution explores the significance of data and data protection in competition law. Section I examines the role of data in the Internet economy. Section II follows with an analysis of the competitive relevance of data to establish “data power” or market power. Building on this, Section III examines potentially abusive practices of “data rich” companies. Finally – particularly with a view to the current antitrust proceeding against Facebook – Section IV evaluates the relationship between data protection and competition law.

642,"February 5, 2018",Alemania: Regulador abre investigación sobre publicidad online,"
La autoridad antimonopolio de Alemania ha anunciado una nueva investigación al sector de publicidad y ventas en línea, la cual comenzará analizando los efectos de los desarrollos técnicos sobre la estructura del mercado y las oportunidades de mercado de los diversos actores involucrados. También especifica que investigará si las grandes plataformas publicitarias como Google y Facebook están operando como “jardines amurallados” y considerará su posible impacto sobre la competencia.
“Debido a la gran importancia económica de este sector para anunciantes y proveedores de contenido activos en Internet y en vista de las discusiones sobre el difícil entorno competitivo en este mercado, hemos decidido examinar este sector”, dijo Andreas Mundt, presidente del Bundeskartellamt.
“La cuestión del acceso y el procesamiento de datos también es muy relevante desde el punto de vista de la competencia”, agregó, y añadió que “han surgido grandes empresas individuales con considerable relevancia en el mercado como Google o Facebook que, en opinión de algunos integrantes del mercado, han sido capaces de establecer sistemas cerrados, los llamados ‘jardines amurallados’ “.
El Bundeskartellamt se centrará en los efectos de los desarrollos técnicos actuales y previsibles sobre la estructura del mercado y las oportunidades de mercado de los diversos actores. Examinará la importancia de los diferentes servicios técnicos y la forma en que funcionan. Estos incluyen opciones para medir la visibilidad, recopilar datos y prevenir el fraude, así como servicios en el nivel de marketing real y la adquisición de espacios publicitarios.
La autoridad también examinará si, como afirman algunos actores del mercado, en realidad existen sistemas cerrados a unos pocos grandes proveedores y qué significado tienen estos sistemas, si los hay.

643,"February 5, 2018",EEUU: Broadcom aumenta oferta por Qualcomm a más de US$123 mil millones,"
El fabricante de microprocesadores Broadcom ha decidido mejorar su oferta para adquirir a Qualcomm por más de US$123 mil millones. Esto ocurre tres meses después de que Broadcom hiciera una oferta inicial de US$103 mil millones para combinar a los dos gigantes del sector de semiconductores, según informa CNBC.
Broadcom, dirigida por el CEO Hock Tan, busca construir una gigantesca empresa de microchips para así obtener una importante cuota de mercado, asegurando ganancias de miles de millones de dólares conforme las compañías de telecomunicaciones inviertan en implementar la nueva tecnología 5G en redes que incorporen intensivamente a artículos domésticos como parte de una ‘Internet de cosas’.
Esta propuesta, que representa la oferta final por parte de Broadcom, “incluye sustancialmente más títulos accionarios de Broadcom, lo que permitirá a los accionistas de Qualcomm una mayor oportunidad de participar en los beneficios creados por las ventajas estratégicas y operativas de la compañía combinada”, dijo Tan en una carta enviada a Qualcomm, que se hizo público.
En lo que sería la mayor fusión tecnológica de la historia, Broadcom dijo que estaría dispuesto a aumentar la oferta en efectivo del acuerdo si la transacción no se completa dentro de un año después de cualquier acuerdo definitivo, y pagaría a Qualcomm una “tarifa de terminación inversa” significativa si los reguladores llegasen a bloquear el trato. Broadcom podría pagar una tarifa por terminación del acuerdo de hasta USD$10 mil millones a Qualcomm, informó la CNBC citando fuentes.
_
En noticias relacionadas, el director de la oficina de licenciamiento de Qualcomm anunció el 31 de enero, en la llamada trimestral para analistas financieros, que la compañía había llegado a un acuerdo con Samsung para licenciar sus tecnologías a futuro. Si bien Qualcomm y Samsung no están embrollados en un litigio directamente, la compañía coreana ha intervenido en las investigaciones de las autoridades de competencia surcoreanas en contra de la compañía estadunidense. Con el acuerdo, estas intervenciones serán retiradas, allanando parcialmente el camino para la apelación a la multa impuesta por la Comisión de Comercio Justo de Corea a Qualcomm por USD854 millones.

644,"February 4, 2018",Think Tanks weigh in on Ohio vs. Amex,"
Next month, the US Supreme Court will hear what legal experts describe as one of the most important antitrust cases in years. The focus of this dispute is on credit card fees and the rights of credit card networks to restrict business from recommending or offering incentives for customers that charge them less fees. At issue, however, is a crucial point of interpretation on how the rule of reason applies to multisided platforms and markets, which are becoming increasingly pervasive business models across the world economy.
The simple facts of the case are:

A district court ruled American Express was illegally using its market power to restrict competition between credit card platforms.
The second circuit of appeals court overturned the decision, saying the practice could have positive effects on the economy.

The second circuit decided it wasn’t fair to consider American Express’s relationship with retailers in isolation. Credit card networks run two-sided markets, peddling services simultaneously to shop owners and cardholders. Retailers want lower fees, and customers want airline miles and rental-car insurance. The networks cover these perks with revenue from transaction fees. Complaints about unfair treatment from stores had to be balanced against the way those decisions impact customers, the appeals court ruled.
The three following briefs amici curiae, go to the heart of this discussion.
Arguing in favor of the Second Circuit’s ruling is the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

This Court has explained that “the purpose of the inquiries into market definition and market power” in antitrust cases “is to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.” FTC v. Ind. Fed’n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460 (1986). In case after case, the Court has emphasized that these inquiries
require a close examination of “the economic reality of the market at issue.” Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 467 (1992); see United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 359 (1967) (rule of reason requires a focus on “the context of the particular industry”). This Court’s guidance concerning the rule of reason counsels caution when courts apply tests created in the context of single-sided markets to multi-sided firms.
Multi-sided firms are constrained by the availability of substitute products, but they may also face the additional constraint of interrelated demand from multiple sets of customers. One effect of suchinterrelated demand is to limit a multi-sided firm’s ability to unilaterally raise prices or reduce output.
If the tests of market definition and market power fail to account for these additional constraints, they may cause multi-sided firms to appear to enjoy power over price and output when they are, in fact, engaged in vigorous competition. Without considering the actual effects of multi-sidedness, courts may not be able to reliably determine whether a Sherman Act plaintiff has carried its prima facie burden to establish “the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.” Ind. Fed’n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 460.
This Court has warned against ignoring “[t]he cost of false positives” when crafting antitrust rules. Verizon Commc’ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 414 (2004). Ignoring the competitive realities of multi-sided firms would raise the risk of false positives and “interminable litigation,” id., stifling pro-competitive conduct and pro-consumer innovation. It would allow plaintiffs to base a prima facie case on little more than a caricature of a multi-sided firm’s competitive position, penalizing healthy competition and deterring the development of valuable new products and services that benefit both competition and consumers.
Read full brief HERE.
Arguing for the ruling to be overturned is Brief amicus curiae of American Antitrust Institute.
A prima facie case does not require showing harm to both sides of a two-sided platform. The court of appeals’ conclusion to the contrary is flawed, as an initial matter, because the relevant harms and benefits are those to the market(s) and consumers as a whole; even if higher benefits to Amex cardholders fully offset the higher fees charged to Amex merchants, anticompetitive harm would remain. In any event, an overall harm requirement is not legally supportable. The case law involving two-sided platforms does not impose such a requirement. Nor can such a requirement rest on plaintiffs’ supposedly erroneous market definition, for two reasons. First, as explained in the next part, a relevant market may comprise one side of a two-sided platform. And second, a showing of actual detrimental effects, which the district court found here, obviates the need for plaintiffs to define a relevant market.
An “overall harm” requirement is not supported by a danger of “false positives.” Assuming arguendo that increased benefits to Amex cardholders may properly be considered to be a procompetitive benefit, rather than part of the distortion of the competitive process, separating the cardholder and merchant sides of the platform means only that establishing anticompetitive harm on the merchant side shifts the burden to the defendant to establish offsetting benefits on the cardholder side.
Read full brief HERE.
Also arguing for the ruling to be overturned is Brief amicus curiae of Open Markets Institute.
By introducing a special rule for “two-sided” markets, the Second Circuit needlessly departed from a longstanding approach to antitrust law. Its new rule greatly raises the burden that a plaintiff in the “two-sided” market context must carry at the very earliest stage of litigation. Not only is the new rule unjustified, it is pegged to a concept that is contested and ill-defined.
Defendant companies ranging from airlines to chicken processors could reasonably claim that they meet the definition of “two-sided,” winning themselves more favorable judicial review. Basing a fundamental and often decisive inquiry on a slippery definition is a mistake. Troublingly, the Second Circuit’s approach also risks exempting from effective antitrust scrutiny the dominant tech platforms, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These firms enjoy dominant positions in key markets that provide ample opportunity for anticompetitive conduct, underscoring the need for robust antitrust enforcement. Yet if the Second Circuit’s rule is upheld, a wide range of anticompetitive activity would become virtually beyond reach, given the far higher burden that plaintiffs would have to meet to establish even a prima facie case. In practice, this approach would risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review. Because this result is intolerable, and because it rests on shaky and malleable economic reasoning, this Court should reverse the Second Circuit’s decision.

645,"February 1, 2018",US: Qualcomm hopes Samsung deal will help with antitrust issues,"
Chipmaker Qualcomm has struck a deal with Samsung that may quash its hefty antitrust case in South Korea and help ward off a hostile bid takeover from rival Broadcom. While the exact terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, the new patent cross-licensing agreement stipulates that Samsung “will be withdrawing” its interventions in Qualcomm’s appeal against its US$854 million fine from the Korean Fair Trade Commission.
The two companies plan to work together on Qualcomm’s processors, facilitating a “transition to 5G.” Qualcomm has already agreed similar commitments from a number of Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.
The partnership will help to counteract the damaging effects of the numerous fines and legal battles the company has faced in recent times reported Nasdaq. The deal was announced as Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue growth of just 1%, after it swung to a net loss of US$6 billion in the three months ending December 2017. It needs to start demonstrating strong growth again if it’s to avoid a hostile takeover bid from rival Broadcom which, if successful, would be the biggest takeover in tech history reported Nasdaq.
At time of writing, Qualcomm stock had risen 0.87% in after-hours trading.

646,"February 1, 2018",Germany: Regulator opens probe into online advertisers,"
According to a press release sent out on February 1, the Bundeskartellamt has launched a sector inquiry into the online advertising sector.
The antitrust office says it will start by looking into the effects of technical developments on the market structure and market opportunities of the various players involved. It also specifies it will investigate whether large ad platforms like Google and Facebook are operating as “walled gardens,” and consider their potential impact on competition.
“Due to the great economic importance of this sector for advertisers and content providers active on the Internet and in view of discussions about the difficult competitive environment in this market, we have decided to examine this sector,” said Andreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt, in a statement.
“The issue of access to and the processing of data is also highly relevant from a competition point of view,” he added, saying, “large single companies with considerable market relevance like Google or Facebook have emerged which, in the view of some market players, have been able to set up closed systems, so-called ‘walled gardens’.”
The Bundeskartellamt will focus on the effects of current and foreseeable technical developments on the market structure and the market opportunities of the various players. It will examine the significance of different technical services and the way in which they function. These include options for measuring visibility, collecting data and preventing fraud as well as services more on the level of the actual marketing and procurement of ad spaces.
The authority will also examine whether, as some market players claim, closed systems of a few large providers actually exist and what significance these systems have, if any.

647,"January 25, 2018",EU: “We are not trying to be superheroes” says Vestager,"
According to Politico, Margrethe Vestager hit back Thursday, January 25, against criticism that she was going overboard in trying to make markets fair, arguing that her investigators had no intention of behaving like “superheroes.”
“It’s not our job to rush around looking for people to rescue, getting involved in anything that looks unfair,” the powerful European commissioner for competition told a conference in Brussels.
Vestager on Wednesday handed down a billion-euro fine against US chipmaker Qualcomm for abusing a dominant position, and in the past few years she has meted out major penalties against firms ranging from Google to the Volkswagen Group. In her speeches she regularly riffs on the idea of fairness — much more so than her predecessors.
But the former Danish politician argued that her office was not guided by any misplaced or naive idealism. “Talking of fairness like that doesn’t make us Don Quixote,” she told the gathering, which was organized by the Global Competition Law Center.

By Francisc Ioanid Toma
KU Leuven – Faculty of Law, Students
Date Written: December 24, 2017
 
Abstract
The three central questions of this essay are: has Google via Android breached EU Competition rules? Is the EU jurisprudence applicable to Android? Does antitrust law lack the necessary tools to cope with the technological environment? Albeit these points are essential to be touched upon, they will be addressed in a modest manner due to word limit constraints.
To address these uncertainties, the challenges posed by Article 102 in fast-paced markets will be discussed. Afterwards, six characteristics of the digital sector and why they cause difficulties for EU Competition law will be examined.

649,"January 16, 2018",EU: Vestager wants second term as competition commissioner,"
Margrethe Vestager wants a second mandate as European Commissioner for Competition, she told Belgian newspapers L’Echo and De Tijd in an interview published the morning of January 16.
“What I would really like is a second mandate here at the Commission,” the Danish official said. “I have seen that it takes time to learn, train, do things properly and put things in place.”
“With a second mandate, I feel like we can do some fantastic things,” she said, specifying that she would like to retain the competition portfolio.
Vestager, one of the Commission’s most high-profile officials, made news this year for slapping hefty penalties on Apple and Google, and has set her sights on Silicon Valley’s tech giants over the way companies collect and use personal data.
Politico reported in November that French President Emmanuel Macron could back Vestager as the next Commission president, although she might struggle to find broad enough support to secure the nomination.
Asked about the possibility of taking the Commission top job, Vestager told the Belgian outlets, “It’s the same thing in European and national politics, there are rumors everywhere. But I take it as a nice compliment. It is always nice to know that someone thinks you are doing a good job.”

650,"January 8, 2018",UE: Vestager anuncia nuevo enfoque en ‘Big Data’,"
La comisionada encargada de la competencia de la UE, Margrethe Vestager, anunció que la agencia bajo su mando se concentrará en estudiar las implicaciones para la competencia de cómo las empresas almacenan y utilizan los llamados ‘big data’, enormes archivos informáticos de registros de clientes, estadísticas de la industria y otra información. La estrategia presentada difiere radicalmente del enfoque de no-intervención en los Estados Unidos, donde los reguladores enfatizan los beneficios que estos datos aportan a la innovación.
“En algunas áreas, estos datos son extremadamente valiosos”, dijo en una entrevista Vestager. “Pueden cerrar el mercado, pueden darles a las partes que  tienen estos datos oportunidades de negocios inmensas que no están disponibles para otros”.
La cuestión para los reguladores antimonopolio europeos es si las empresas con grandes datos, desde Google y Facebook hasta el fabricante alemán de autos BMW AG, pueden excluir a nuevos competidores de los mercados si controlan la información exclusiva necesaria para satisfacer a los clientes o reducir costos. Esto afectaría la forma en que la Comisión Europea analiza las fusiones y el poder de mercado de estas empresas.

651,"January 7, 2018",EU: Vestager announces focus on big data’s competition implications,"
European Union antitrust regulators are eyeing an increasingly important corporate data.
The EU’s competition chief is zeroing in on the implication to competition of how companies stockpile and use so-called big data, or enormous computer files of customer records, industry statistics and other information. The move diverges starkly from a hands-off approach in the US, where regulators emphasize the benefits big data brings to innovation.
“In some areas, these data are extremely valuable,” Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said in an interview. “They can foreclose the market—they can give the parties that have them immense business opportunities that are not available to others.”
At issue for European antitrust regulators is whether companies holding big data, from Alphabet’s Google and Facebook to German car maker BMW AG, can exclude new competitors from markets if they control exclusive information needed to satisfy customers or cut costs. This would impact how the European Commission analyzes mergers and companies’ market power.

CPI EU News Column edited by Thibault Schrepel, Sam Sadden & Jan Roth (CPI) presents:
The Commission unconditionally clears the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft By Anna Renata Pisarkiewicz (European University Institute)1
The Facts of the Microsoft/GitHub Acquisition
On September 14, 2018, Microsoft and GitHub notified the European Commission about their intention to merge. Both parties to the transaction supply various software development and operations (“DevOps”) tools that individuals and organizations use when developing and releasing software. GitHub, in particular, supplies the popular code hosting platform for version control and collaboration on software development, which can be used online (GitHub.com), and on-premises (GitHub Enterprise). At the time of the notification, with more than 28 million developers in its community, and 85 million code repositories, GitHub was the largest host of source code globally.2
Given that the EU turnover of GitHub was less than EUR 250 million in the last financial year for which data was available at the time of the notification, the transaction did not have a Union dimension under Article 1(2) or Article 1(3) of the Merger Regulation. However, it did have such a dimension pursuant to Article 4(5), as it was capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of four Member States, namely Austria, Cyprus, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Having reviewed the transaction, the Commission approved it ...

653,"December 19, 2017","Antitrust Chronicle® – Extra! Extra! Read All About Big Data, The News & Antitrust","
“Fake news” is nothing new. A century after William Randolph Hearst built what was then the largest international media empire – at times critiqued for its brand of yellow journalism, questionable sources and abuse of political influence – the topic of fake news is again in the spotlight and also part of today’s antitrust discussion. Our December 2017 Antitrust Chronicle® addresses these debates.
There was a time when we received our news from broadsides, news pasted on walls in public spaces. Later newspapers surpassed broadsides. The catchphrase “Extra! Extra! Read all about it!” came about from street vendors selling newspaper “extras” when there was breaking news. Eventually the radio and television brought serious competition to newspapers as a legitimate source of news.
Today, the Internet and social media are the modern day broadsides, instantly sending out news to the masses, and the shouts of “Extra! Extra! Read all about it!” are coming at us from more and more directions and in louder and more diverse voices, some of them hawking fake news stories.
Put simply, the way we get our news is changing. A significant percent of the U.S. population gets its news “free” from Facebook and Google. Some authors argue that in exchange for free access readers hand over control of their data, which has an impact on traditional newsmakers and future innovators using Artificial Intelligence methods that are highly reliant on this Big Data....

654,"December 19, 2017",Fake News Is A Real Antitrust Problem,"
By Sally Hubbard – 
This essay will explore two primary reasons why fake news is an antitrust problem. First, Facebook and Google compete against legitimate news publishers for user attention, data and advertising dollars. The tech platforms’ business incentives run counter to the interests of legitimate news publishers, and the platforms pull technological levers that harm publishers’ business models and advantage their own. Second, Facebook and Google lack meaningful competition in their primary spheres of social media and online search, respectively. The platforms have an outsized impact on the flow of information worldwide and do not face competitive pressure to stem the spread of fake news.

Uber, la aplicación de transporte privado que ha sido criticada por ocultar una violación de datos personales durante un año, y pagar a los piratas informáticos $100,000 por guardar silencio, ha sido nombrada como objeto de una investigación criminal por parte de agencias federales.
Según un informe de The New York Times citando documentos judiciales presentados por la oficina del fiscal de los Estados Unidos en California, ésta investigación sería la primera confirmación pública por parte del Departamento de Justicia acerca de una investigación federal dirigida hacia la compañía. Los documentos judiciales no dicen qué agencia gubernamental está investigando a Uber. The New York Times señaló que este y otros medios de comunicación han informado sobre una investigación a nivel federal, pero esta es la primera vez que se ha confirmado públicamente.
Las noticias surgieron de un caso judicial entre Uber y Waymo por el presunto robo de secretos comerciales por parte de Uber del programa de autocontrol de Waymo. Waymo es propiedad de Google. Waymo ha afirmado que un ex empleado, Anthony Levandowski, robó secretos comerciales antes de abandonar la empresa y los usó al ser contratado por Uber. Uber ha negado las acusaciónes. El juicio se ha fijado para el mes de enero.

656,"December 17, 2017",Colombia: SIC fines cement companies US$66m,"
On Tuesday, December 12, Cementos Argos, Cemex and Holcim were fined over 200 billion Colombian pesos (US$66 million) by competition watchdog, Superintendency for Industry and Commerce (SIC), for fixing prices in Colombia.
Together the companies account for more than 96% of the nation’s cement market and allegedly agreed to set prices for cement during a nearly three year period between January 2010 and December 2012. During that time the price of cement spiked almost 30%, however inflation was merely 9.3%.
“Argos, Cemex and Holcim did not offer an economically reasonable or truthful explanation that would justify the price parallels, nor the way prices are set within these companies,” the trade and industry regulator said in a statement.
Holcim said in a statement that it disagreed with the regulator’s findings and that it had turned over “conclusive proof that demonstrates that this anti-competitive conduct never existed.” The company further stated that it will use “administrative resources and judicial actions” to protest the fine.
The other two cement companies also said that they will protest the fine and deny any wrongdoing.

Uber, the ride-hailing app that has been under fire for covering up a data breach for a year — and paying hackers $100,000 to keep quiet — is the subject of a criminal investigation by federal investigators.
According to a report in The New York Times, citing court documents submitted by the United States attorney’s office in California, it marks the first public confirmation by the Department of Justice that there is a federal investigation into the company. The court documents don’t say which government agency is looking into Uber. The New York Times noted that it and other media outlooks have reported about an investigation on the federal level, but this is the first time it was made public.
The news came out of a court case between Uber and Waymo over the alleged theft of trade secrets by Uber from Waymo’s self-driving program. Waymo is owned by Google. Waymo has claimed that a former employee, Anthony Levandowski, stole trade secrets before leaving the company and used them at Uber. Uber has denied the claims with a trial slated for January.

658,"December 13, 2017",EU: Spotify and Deezer ask regulators to stop Apple from abusing its dominance,"
A group of European tech companies have asked EU regulators to put a stop to what they see as anti-competitive practices from companies like Apple and Amazon. According to a report in the Financial Times, “Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek and Deezer chief executive Hans-Holger Albrecht called on Brussels to ensure ‘a level playing field’ by reining in platforms that are ‘regularly abusing their advantaged position’.”
Spotify and Deezer are upset that Apple takes a 30 percent cut of the subscription fee when people sign up for its service through Apple’s App Store, even as Apple offers a competing music service of its own. The European Commission is preparing new regulations that will govern how big tech companies interact with the developers and merchants who rely on their platforms.
In June, EU regulators levied a record €2.4 billion fine against Google for demoting rivals and unfairly promoting its own services. Europe’s premier music services are clearly hoping that lawmakers in Brussels might bring a similarly aggressive approach to platforms run by other American tech titans.
The letter sent to the commission, which was also signed by a number of European game developers and digital publishers, asked that any new rules “go beyond mere transparency requirements, which alone will not ensure platforms act as gateways rather than become gatekeepers to the digital economy.”

The Committee on Standards in Public Life urged ministers to legislate to shift liability for illegal content on to social media and other internet companies to tackle an “intensely hostile online environment.”
Facebook, Twitter and Google “are not simply platforms for the content that others post” because they play a role in shaping what users see, and so “must take more responsibility for illegal material.”
Facebook and Google take more than US$6 billion a year of the US$10 billion spent on digital advertising in the UK as well as more than 80% of all growth.
This has led news publishers to complain that they provide unfair competition by profiting from the distribution of news content without paying for it or taking any legal responsibility for it.
The move by MPs comes as Facebook has said it will no longer record its non-US revenue through Ireland in a major change to where it pays tax.

Can Silicon Valley’s Pro-Antitrust Congressman Navigate His Monopoly-Friendly District?
By Tess Townsend
It shouldn’t have been surprising when Ro Khanna, the newly elected representative of California’s 17th congressional district, said the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission should review the potential impact on jobs and wages of Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods. Khanna, 41, has emerged in his first congressional term as one of the loudest voices on antitrust and economic competition issues, and the proposed merger between Amazon and Whole Foods had attracted the attention of anti-monopoly activists worried about the combination of a major grocery chain and Amazon’s automation and delivery infrastructure.
But it was surprising, mostly because of where Khanna’s district is located: Silicon Valley. While Amazon isn’t headquartered in Khanna’s state, its big-tech peers (and their employees) are housed in and around his district — and if there’s any industry you’d expect to be wary of antitrust talk, it’s tech. Google, Facebook, and Apple have all been accused of being monopolies. In many ways, the growing antitrust movement is antithetical to the business culture of the tech industry. Monopolies have been described as inevitable in Silicon Valley, or at least a common outcome, and even desirable. The Valley’s libertarian skepticism of government regulation, combined with its unrestrained idealism, has made it easier for tech people to believe monopolies are natural and good.

After years of pleasing its fan base among social progressives and proponents of economic disruption, Silicon Valley finds itself in the hot seat.On October 31, legal representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter appeared before the House and Senate judiciary committees to discuss Russian meddling efforts in the 2016 US election, including fake news stories and incendiary political ads propagated on the internet platforms and social media sites.
Public concerns inspired by the rise of big tech, however, are not exclusively grounded in the outsize political influence these companies wield. A recent and widely circulated Atlantic article examines the astonishing behavioral effects of smartphone and social media usage among today’s youth and paints a grim picture of tech-enabled isolation, depression, and social anxiety. Big tech is shaping our lives offline as much as online.
Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods this past summer sparked the fear that the online giant had simply amassed too much power. Amazon’s quest for a second headquarters—what two Brookings experts call “Amazon Idol”—not only underscores this fear, but demonstrates the ability of a single tech company to dictate the terms of regional economic development. And with rising market concentration throughout the economy reinvigorating interest in antitrust law and enforcement, the hitherto unchallenged power of big tech hangs in the balance.

662,"November 29, 2017",Bad Science: Abuse And Effects In Online Markets,"
By Alexander M. Waksman[1]
Imagine a scientist who has total conviction that a particular hypothesis is correct.  The scientist’s belief in their hypothesis is so strong that they dispense with the need to test it in experiments or compare it against empirical data.  Even when third parties carry out such tests, the scientist considers it unnecessary to take account of the results.  We would condemn that approach as “bad science”.
Antitrust may not be a science in the strict sense, but the same logic applies.  When a competition authority (or claimant) identifies a theory of harm, that theory ought to be tested against actual market developments to determine whether its predictions are correct.  As Commission guidance states, “economic theory is used to develop a testable hypothesis that is later checked against the data. In that case, the economic analysis makes predictions about reality that can be tested by observations and potentially rejected or verified.”[2]
Thus, a theory of harm is useful as a starting point, but it cannot be the whole story.  In particular, when the challenged conduct has been ongoing for a significant period of time and sufficient data are available, it makes good sense to ask whether the hypothesised anticompetitive outcomes have actually transpired.
The need to “test the hypothesis” is a controversial topic in abuse of dominance cases, where competition authorities, courts, and commentators offer differing formulations of the applicable legal standard.  It has particularly important consequences for firms operating in online markets, which are drawing increased antitrust intervention.

The Legal Standard: “Capability” or “Likelihood” of Restricting Competition

Former Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, observed that “in competition the best should win on the merits, but only on the merits.”[3]  The central challenge in abuse of dominance cases is therefore to distinguish competition on the merits from anticompetitive exclusionary conduct.  This is a difficult distinction to draw, particularly in online markets, where new business models, parameters of competition, and monetisation strategies frequently emerge.
One of the conditions for determining whether conduct is abusive is whether the conduct has the “effect” of excluding rivals.  Otherwise, as Advocate General Wahl observed, there would be a risk that “competition law sanctions form.”[4]  The precise meaning of “anticompetitive effects” has not been interpreted consistently, however.
On one view, conduct needs merely to be “capable” of restricting competition.[5]  Advocates General Wahl and Kokott have interpreted this as denoting conduct that is “likely” to restrict competition – albeit with some disagreement as to the level of “likelihood” that is required.[6]  The Court of Justice has stated that “only dominant undertakings whose conduct is likely to have an anticompetitive effect on the market fall within the scope” of abuse of dominance rules, and that “such an assessment seeks to determine whether the conduct of the dominant undertaking produces an actual or likely exclusionary effect, to the detriment of competition” (emphasis added).[7]
Beyond the distinction between “capability” and “likelihood” (or lack thereof), the Court’s formulation raises a broader question: when must competition authorities take into account “actual” effects and when is it sufficient only to show a “likelihood” or “capability” of restricting competition?
Traditionally, the European Commission and Courts treated “actual” and “likely” effects as alternatives.  In other words, the requirement to show exclusionary effects could be satisfied by demonstrating either that the conduct did in fact exclude competitors (the “actual” effect) or that it was likely to exclude rivals in the circumstances of the case (the “likely” effect).  While recognising that anticompetitive effects could not be merely “hypothetical”, the Court held that there was no need to show that the “likely” impact materialised into “concrete” or “actual” exclusion.[8]
But the distinction between “actual” and “likely” effects is not always clear-cut.  If the alleged “likely” effects do not occur, that casts doubt on whether such effects were ever truly “likely”.  In such circumstances, it is for the party alleging an abuse to explain why the theory of harm is correct, even though its predictions have not been borne out in practice.  And in a series of abuse of dominance cases, the European courts have treated actual effects as having significant probative value.
2. The Relevance of Actual Exclusionary Effects
In Microsoft the Commission determined that a tie between Windows OS and Windows Media Player could not be assumed to foreclose competition without further analysis.  It undertook a detailed assessment of the actual effects of the tie, including a review of its impact on the number of subscribers, users, and usage shares of rival media players over the course of five years.[9]  As the General Court observed, “the Commission examined the actual effects which the bundling had already had on the market.”[10]  The Commission took the same approach in the Microsoft (Tying) case, concerning the tie between Microsoft’s Windows operating system and the Internet Explorer browser.  The commitments decision noted that the Commission “had examined such effects closely,” including through extensive empirical surveys.[11]
The Microsoft cases thereby established a need to look closely at actual market developments in circumstances where the conduct cannot be considered “by nature” abusive.  Summarising the Windows Media Player case, Briss J stated that “the Commission [in Microsoft] had examined the actual effects on the market… For abuse to be established there must be a finding that the practice in question forecloses competition.  The legal principle I take from the authorities is simply that such a finding may be based on inference but the inference must be justified in all the circumstances.  Just because it is normally assumed, it does not follow that it will always be assumed.  The circumstances may be such that such an assumption cannot be made and a close analysis of the actual effects is required.”[12]
Likewise, in Posten Norge the EFTA Court accepted that “in some cases, the persistent lack of actual negative effects on competition may cast doubt on a finding by ESA that a certain conduct is liable to restrict competition.”[13]  On the facts of the case, though, the actual effects left “no doubt” that Posten Norge’s conduct had impeded competition.  Specifically, the Court had “no doubt that the applicant’s conduct made entry for its competitors more difficult”, including because of the existence of actual exclusionary effects: Posten Norge’s competitors “were unsuccessful in securing cooperation with Norway Post’s partners while the exclusivity agreements were in force, but succeeded in achieving such cooperation after the conduct had ended.” [14]
In Post Danmark I the Court again treated actual exclusionary effects as relevant to the analysis, although this time as evidence that the conduct was not abusive.  In reviewing the allegedly unlawful pricing strategy, the Court observed that the complainant had not been excluded or marginalised.  Rather, it had “managed to maintain its distribution network despite losing the volume of mail related to the three customers involved and managed, in 2007, to win back” two of these customers – an outcome that was not redolent of exclusion from the market.[15]
The approach in Microsoft, Posten Norge, and Post Danmark II is consistent with developments in the case law concerning Article 101, where – outside the narrow group of “by object” infringements – an agreement must be shown to have actual effects on the market for the agreements to be considered anticompetitive.[16]  There is no particular reason why the effects analysis should be different with respect to unilateral conduct.
3. Clarifying The Principles: Streetmap v Google 
The relevance of actual effects was addressed in the recent Streetmap v Google case, which concerned a Google Maps thumbnail being placed at the top of the Google search results page.  As an initial matter, Roth J noted that the Commission has – in many cases – examined the “experience over the years since the abuse started”, particularly in cases where the conduct is not one of the “classic forms of abuse”, citing Microsoft.[17]
Roth J went on to state that “in a case such as the present, I would find it difficult in practical terms to reconcile a finding that conduct had no anti-competitive effect at all with a conclusion that it was nonetheless reasonably likely to have such an effect… the appropriate approach, it seems to me, is that it is for Streetmap to establish that the conduct was reasonably likely to harm competition. In determining that question, the court will take into account, as a very relevant consideration, evidence as to what the actual effect of the conduct has been.”[18]
This approach follows an intuitive logic: If the conduct has failed to produce actual exclusionary effects, that casts doubts on whether it was ever likely to do so.  And although Roth J did not explain what he meant by a “case such as the present”, the CAT referred subsequently to the fact that the conduct in Streetmap had been ongoing for eight years and concerned internet searches – an activity that occurs “multiple times each day”.  Thus, “if [the conduct] were to have an anti-competitive or foreclosure effect, it was inconceivable that this would not have become evident.”[19]
Having carried out the assessment, the judgment concluded that introducing the Google Maps thumbnail did not have an appreciable effect in taking away custom from Streetmap.  Roth J stated: “In the light of that, I conclude that it was not reasonably likely to give rise to anti-competitive foreclosure.”[20]  In other words, since the conduct at issue did not have an actual appreciable effect, it could not be described as likely to produce anticompetitive foreclosure.
The Streetmap judgment is important not only as a matter of legal principle, but it could also have an impact on enforcement in other digital markets, which are drawing increased attention from antitrust authorities.  The European Commission has carried out investigations into Google Shopping,[21] the Android operating system,[22] AdSense for Search,[23] and Amazon’s eBooks contracts.[24]  The French and German competition authorities have outlined putative theories of harm relating to the exclusionary use of “big data” by dominant companies – an area which is also being probed in a national sector inquiry in Italy.[25]  And the UK competition authority has confirmed online markets as a “policy priority.”[26]  It is therefore worth considering what the cases mean for the effects analysis in online markets specifically.
4. Three Conditions For Assessing Actual Effects
The foregoing shows that actual effects can be highly relevant – or even dispositive – as to the question of whether exclusion was “likely” or “capable of” occurring.  The relevance of actual effects will vary on a case-by-case basis, though, depending on the following factors that can be discerned from the case law.
Factor 1: Whether the conduct is “by nature” liable to restrict competition.  Conduct that cannot be presumed to have anticompetitive effects, in the circumstances or market context of a given case, needs to be examined closely by reference to its actual effects on competition (per Microsoft and Huawei v Unwired Planet).  Thus, conduct that is “by nature” abusive may be treated as infringing Article 102 TFEU (subject to any objective justification) without recourse to a full analysis of actual effects – albeit the scope of “by nature” abuses is diminished, if not eliminated, following the recent Intel judgment).  By contrast, conduct that is not inherently abusive may require an assessment of actual market developments (depending on Factors 2 and 3, below).
Factor 2: Whether exclusionary effects would have been felt at the time of assessment.  In some cases, proceedings may arise at an early stage, too soon for the alleged anticompetitive effects to have manifested themselves.  Where intervention occurs at a later stage, though, it may be the case that any exclusionary effects would have been felt at the time when the conduct is assessed.  In the latter circumstance, actual market developments should be taken into account as part of the competitive assessment (per Streetmap v Google).
This factor depends on how long the conduct was in place (or how long ago it ceased), and whether there was a significant number of transactions during the period of the alleged abuse (per Socrates v Law Society).  In essence, the question is whether any anticompetitive effects would have occurred by the time of carrying out the antitrust assessment.
In previous cases concerning online markets, the challenged conduct has been in place long enough to cover a large number of interactions with customers or consumers, such that any anticompetitive impact would have been felt.  In Streetmap v Google, the conduct lasted for eight years, during which time users entered a vast number of search queries.  If the conduct was “likely” to affect the position of rivals, that would have been evident at the time when the High Court heard Streetmap’s case.  Likewise, the Microsoft cases concerned conduct that lasted several years.[27]
Even when conduct is in place for a short period of time, though, or has only recently begun, the sheer volume and frequency of user interactions with online services mean that any effects may have already been felt.  Indeed, this is inherent in the way that online service providers carry out research into their own products.  For example, in 2012 Facebook conducted a study to test whether changing users’ news feeds to show more “positive” or “negative” items could affect the emotions expressed in a user’s own posts.  Despite the experiment lasting just one week, researchers were able to benefit from a very large sample size of 689,003 users and could analyse over 3 million posts, resulting in empirical support for the far-reaching claim that “emotions can spread throughout a network.”[28]  This experiment confirms that conduct may trigger a change in observable user behaviour in even a short space of time.
Factor 3: Whether data concerning effects are available.  Although not discussed in the case law expressly, a further factor may be the availability – or ability to collect – data concerning actual effects, without which a review of actual effects would be impossible.  Commission guidance on the submission of economic evidence notes that the limitations of a dataset should be recognised, although deficiencies in the data should not necessarily prevent an economic analysis from carrying weight.[29]
The amount of user interactions with online services will in many cases generate sufficient data for actual effects to be examined.  By way of illustration, Ofcom reported that the average adult Internet user in the UK spends over 20 hours online per week, as of 2015.[30]  By August 2016, the average adult was reported to be spending almost 9 hours each day on media and communications activities – more time than spent sleeping.[31]  In July 2017, consumers in Britain spent on average £1.1 billion online each week – an increase of 15.1% compared with the previous year.[32]  And in the Google Shopping case the Commission reports having analysed 5.2 Terabytes of search results data, equating to 1.7 billion search queries.[33]
5. “Bad Science” In Online Markets
In competition law – as in science – the null hypothesis is true until proven otherwise.[34]  If a theory of harm predicts the exclusion or marginalisation of a dominant company’s rivals, only a “bad scientist” would disregard evidence that these predictions proved incorrect.  In online markets particularly, it is important not to assume that a theory of harm is correct without testing the theory’s predictions against real world events.  That is because conduct that may be liable to exclude rivals in offline markets could have a very different outcome in an online environment.
This was the insight of the Commission decision in Microsoft, where the ability of users to download alternatives to Windows Media Player (the tied product) – sometimes for free – meant that anticompetitive effects could not be presumed, and an assessment of actual effects was needed.  The Commission’s recent decisional practice in merger cases confirms the need to assess the specific features of online markets, rather than extrapolating from the offline environment, given features such as low barriers to entry, multi-homing, and ease of switching between services online.
In Microsoft/Skype, the Commission considered that Microsoft would lack incentives to tie or bundle its products with Skype following the concentration.  In particular, the Commission noted that consumers would not simply use “whatever communications product is provided with Windows” – rather, consumers use multiple communications services across different platforms.   Skype was offered for free, and consumers would likely migrate to other free services if Microsoft tried to impose a charge.  Switching was particularly easy since rival services were provided directly on the Internet, avoiding even the need for user downloads.[35]
Similar insights are set out in the Commission’s decision in Facebook/WhatsApp, which found “no significant costs preventing consumers from switching between different consumer communications apps”.  The services were offered for free, were easily downloadable, take up little memory space and are easy to use, and consumers could switch between them with ease.  Therefore, there were no “significant ‘traditional’ barriers” to entry.[36]
A review of actual effects therefore serves to avoid false positives in antitrust enforcement – the so-called “Type I error”.  In a recent speech concerning antitrust enforcement in the digital sector, FTC Commissioner Ohlhausen commented that “regulators are just people entrusted, temporarily, with the levers of government power. We possess no crystal ball with which we can unerringly see the road ahead, and we can be just as wrong about the way the future will unfold as anyone else. In my time here at the FTC, and throughout my career, I have tried to stress the need for regulators to acknowledge the limits of their actual knowledge before exercising government power.”[37]  This seems particularly true of the fast moving and unpredictable online world.
6. Conclusion
The foregoing analysis should not be taken as meaning that competition authorities (or claimants) are required to show actual exclusionary effects in every case.  As commentators have pointed out, such a position would require authorities to wait for observable anticompetitive effects to arise before intervening, by which point it may be too late to restore effective competition.[38]
Rather, the need to examine actual effects depends on the interplay of the three factors listed above: whether there is a “by nature” abuse; whether actual effects would already have been felt; and whether sufficient data to measure those effects are available.  In digital markets, this will more often than not mean that actual effects are highly relevant – or even dispositive – to the antitrust assessment.  Relying on a hypothesis that conduct is “likely” or capable” of excluding rivals is not enough.

The Trump Administration’s Incoherent Stance on Competition
By Jonathan Taplin
Peter Thiel, Facebook’s first outside investor, once wrote: “Competition is for losers. If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly.” Executives at Facebook, Google and Amazon seem to have taken his blunt advice.
If only the Trump administration could be so clear when it comes to its stance on competition. Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.
On the one hand, the FCC has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can’t pay the fees.

664,"November 27, 2017",Canadá: Trudeau expresa “gran preocupación” por ataques a la Neutralidad de Redes,"
El primer ministro canadiense, Justin Trudeau, ha expresado su descontento con el plan estadounidense para desmantelar la neutralidad de la red.
En declaraciones ante medios, Trudeau dijo que el plan de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC) de Estados Unidos de dar marcha atrás a la legislación de la era Obama que prohíbe a los proveedores de servicios de Internet reducir las velocidades o bloquear el acceso de los consumidores a contenidos específicos era profundamente preocupante.
“Estoy muy preocupado por los ataques a la neutralidad de la red”, dijo el miércoles 23 de noviembre. “La neutralidad de la red es algo esencial para las pequeñas empresas, para los consumidores, es esencial para mantener viva la libertad asociada con Internet”.
El presidente de la FCC, Ajit Pai, dijo que la Comisión celebrará una votación el 14 de diciembre sobre la iniciativa, que seguramente será aprobada por tres de los cinco comisionados, adscritos al partido republicano. El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, se ha opuesto durante mucho tiempo a la neutralidad de la red, calificándola de una “toma de poder” por parte de Obama desde 2014.
El plan estadounidense ha atraído la oposición generalizada de Silicon Valley, con un grupo que representa a la casa matriz de Google, Alphabet y Facebook, instando a la FCC a abandonar sus planes para eliminar la neutralidad de la red. Muchos argumentan que, sin la neutralidad consagrada en la ley, los proveedores de Internet existentes amenazarán la misma apertura de Internet.

665,"November 26, 2017",Russia: Uber’s merger with Yandex is approved,"
The Russian government has approved the merger of Uber and Yandex, the country’s largest technology company and most popular search engine. As a part of the deal, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company will invest US$225 million into the “Google of Russia,” while Yandex will take 59.3 % ownership of a jointly-held company through a US$100 million investment, reports Reuters.
The merger marks Uber’s expansion into Russia and was approved by the country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service‬‬ (FAS), so long as the company didn’t bar its drivers from working for competing services, the report says.
“The results of analysis of the market for the organization of information interaction between taxi drivers and passengers showed that the market is in the stage of active growth,” said a FAS statement. “In this case, there will be aggregators providing services through a new convenient way to order a taxi—in the mobile device application.”

AT&T’s CEO Meets Trump’s Justice
By Bret Stephens
“I have no evidence that there’s been inappropriate behavior. What I have is a really peculiar timeline.”
I’m on the line with Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive. I’ve heard other C.E.O.s offer up brutal judgments of this and previous administrations — invariably in off-the-record interviews. This one’s on the record.
Stephenson is battling the Justice Department, which this week sued to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. The suit marks the first time in nearly 40 years that Justice has tried to quash such a deal, known as a vertical merger. The Obama administration approved a similar merger — one that brings together companies that don’t compete and that offer different products and services — between Comcast and NBC Universal in 2011.
What’s different this time? Vertical mergers have long had liberal critics, and Senate liberals Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and others have expressed public misgivings about AT&T’s bid.
But this is supposed to be a pro-business, antiregulation, conservative administration. And Makan Delrahim, a political appointee who served as Donald Trump’s deputy White House counsel before taking over Justice’s Antitrust Division, previously said of the deal, “I don’t see this as a major antitrust problem.”
That was before he got his current job. Once he did, Stephenson says, “Temperatures change rather quickly, and Delrahim’s own attitude changes rather quickly.”

667,"November 23, 2017",Canada: Trudeau “very concerned about the attacks on net neutrality”,"
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is none too pleased with the American plan to dismantle net neutrality.
Speaking to reporters, Trudeau said the US Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) plan to roll back Obama-era legislation barring Internet service providers from slowing down or blocking consumer access to content was deeply worrisome.
“I am very concerned about the attacks on net neutrality,” he said Wednesday, November 23. “Net neutrality is something that is essential for small businesses, for consumers, it’s essential to keep the freedom associated with the Internet alive.”
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the Commission will hold a vote on December 14 on the initiative, which will almost surely pass because three of the five commissioners are Republicans. US President Donald Trump has long opposed net neutrality, calling it an Obama “power grab” as far back as 2014.
The American plan has attracted widespread opposition from Silicon Valley, with a group representing Google parent company Alphabet and Facebook urging the FCC to drop plans to scrap net neutrality. Many argue that without neutrality enshrined in law, incumbent Internet providers will threaten the very openness of the Internet.

668,"November 21, 2017",US: Trump’s FCC announces vote to kill net neutrality,"
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unveiled plans on Tuesday, November 21, to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape.
FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the Commission will vote at a December 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities.
The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content.
The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price.
It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules.

669,"November 21, 2017",EU: Vestager threatens Tech giants with tax reform,"
Europe’s fierce enforcer of competition rules is threatening tech giants with tough new rules on tax if politicians fail to come to an agreement on changes to the current system.
Efforts to amend rules that would apply tax more fairly to firms which largely operate online such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have been mooted in recent months.
France has led efforts calling for tax to be applied to sales rather than profit, gaining support from Germany, Italy and Spain. And more broadly, the OECD has led global efforts to clampdown on avoidance of corporation tax.
Now, Margrethe Vestager who levied the European Commission’s record €2.4 billion (US$2.7 billion at the time) fine against Google over the summer for anti-competitive behavior, has warned that it will make its own efforts to reform the system “if there is no international answer” by early next year.
“As we’ve looked at whether companies pay their fair share of tax, it’s become clear that our tax systems aren’t well designed for modern ways of doing business,” she said in a speech at France’s economy ministry on Tuesday morning, November 21.
“Tax systems that are based on a company’s physical assets can’t easily deal with digital companies. And in fact, domestic digital businesses pay less than half the effective tax rate of their offline equivalents.
“It will take more than competition rules to fix that issue. It will take a reform of our tax systems, not just nationally, but internationally.”

On Monday the Justice Department, sued AT&T to block its $85 billion merger with Time Warner, court filings show.  DOJ Complaint (PDF)
In a lawsuit filed in US District Court in Washington, federal prosecutors argued that the merger would hurt competitors and consumers.
“AT&T/DirecTV would hinder its rivals by forcing them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks, and it would use its increased power to slow the industry’s transition to new and exciting video distribution models that provide greater choice for consumers,” the filing reads.
David McAtee, AT&T’s general counsel, said in a statement that the company is prepared to fight the regulators.
“Today’s DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent,” McAtee said. “Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.”
Earlier this month it was reported that Justice Department officials had demanded that AT&T sell off CNN’s parent company from Time Warner as a condition for regulatory approval, raising questions about whether President Trump was intervening in the deal to retaliate against CNN for its critical coverage of him.
The Justice Department and the White House have both denied that there’s been any political interference in the merger review.
Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust regulator at the Justice Department, said in a speech last week that he plans to crack down on vertical mergers, such as the AT&T deal, that involve companies that don’t directly compete with each other. Delrahim criticized the Obama administration’s approval of similar mergers, such as Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal in 2011.

The Department of Justice’s Long-Awaited and Much Needed Course-Correction on FRAND-Assured Standard-Essential Patents By Douglas H. Ginsburg & Koren W. Wong-Ervin[1]
On November 10, 2017, the Assistant Attorney General (AAG) for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, Makan Delrahim, announced a crucial course-correction for policies involving standard-essential patents (SEPs) that a patent holder has voluntarily committed to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.[2]
Key takeaways include:

FRAND is not a compulsory licensing scheme.
Unilateral refusals to license should be per se lawful.
Seeking or enforcing injunctive relief and breach of a FRAND commitment normally raise contract or fraud, not antitrust, issues.
Disputes involving FRAND should be resolved through “freely negotiated licensing agreements.”
Antitrust enforcers have likely “strayed too far in the direction of accommodating the concerns of technology implementers,” which risks undermining incentives for innovators.
Holdout by implementers is a “more serious risk” than holdup by innovators.[3]
Holdup and holdout “are not symmetric” given that “innovators make an investment before they know whether that investment will ever pay off.”
An intellectual property right (IPR) policy of an SDO that is biased in favor of implementers or innovators should trigger “close antitrust scrutiny” into the process by which the policy was adopted.

672,"November 13, 2017",EEUU: Trump niega haber presionado por venta de CNN,"
El presidente Donald Trump, en comentarios a la prensa realizados el 10 de noviembre, rechazó haber presionado al Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) para hacer de la venta de CNN y otros activos una condición necesaria para la aprobación regulatoria de la propuesta de fusión, valuada en $85.400 millones de dólares, entre AT & T y Time Warner.
En cambio, Trump atribuyó la decisión a “un hombre, que es una persona muy respetada”, que Recode considera como una referencia a Makan Delrahim, jefe de la sección de Competencia del Departamento de Justicia. A principios de esta semana surgieron informes contradictorios acerca de las negociaciones, con versiones que sostienen que el Departamento de Justicia buscaría condicionar la aprobación del acuerdo a una desinversión de Turner Broadcasting (la cual incluye a CNN). Otra versión más sugiere que AT&T habría ofrecido vender el canal de noticias en respuesta a una serie de cuestiones más generales presentadas por el DOJ.
Sin embargo, ésta versión fue rechazada por Randall Stephenson, CEO de AT&T, quien negó haber ofrecido alguna vez la venta de CNN. “A lo largo de todo el proceso, nunca ofrecí vender CNN, ni tengo intenciones de hacerlo”, declaró Stephenson.
Delrahim y otros funcionarios del Departamento de Justicia han negado que el presidente estuviera involucrado en las negociaciones, pero los comentarios de Trump sobre el acuerdo han iincitado la especulación. Trump tiene una profunda animadversión personal contra la cadena CNN, a la que ha calificado de “noticias falsas” en numerosas ocasiones debido a su cobertura de ciertos temas, incluyendo la investigación activa sobre una posible colusión de su campaña con autoridades Rusas. Durante la campaña presidencial, Trump también citó la posible fusión como un ejemplo de la concentración de poder contra la cual se oponía.
Sin embargo, Delrahim dijo que no veía la fusión como “un problema de competencia importante”. Su cambio de opinión ha aumentado la sensación de que el dedo de Trump ahora descansa sobre la balanza. La intervención directa del Presidente podría representar un debilitamiento de la independencia del Departamento de Justicia en este y otros asuntos.
La posición del DOJ respecto a la fusión, ya sea bajo presión del Presidente Trump o no, representa un rompimiento no solo con las propias opiniones pasadas de Delrahim, sino con una ortodoxia republicana que duda en esgrimir el poder regulatorio. En cambio, la exigencia de desinvertir y separar las propiedades de los medios se alinea con posiciones izquierdistas que critican la concentración del poder. Incluso cuando AT & T y Time Warner esperan en el estrado, la discusión ha encontrado nueva vida con respecto a Facebook y Google, que cada vez más son vistos como poderosos monopolios mediáticos en sí mismos.

673,"November 12, 2017",US: Trump denies pressing for CNN sale in AT&T-Time Warner merger,"
President Donald Trump, in comments to reporters on Saturday, November 10, on Air Force One, said that he had not pressured the Justice Department (DOJ) to make selling CNN and other assets a condition for regulatory approval of a proposed US$85.4 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner.
Instead, Trump attributed the decision to “a man who’s a very respected person,” in remarks, which Recode interprets as referring to Makan Delrahim, head of antitrust regulation at the Justice Department. Earlier this week, conflicting reports emerged about negotiations on the deal, with one version of events saying the Justice Department has made divesting Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, a condition of regulatory approval. A conflicting account had AT&T offering to sell the news unit in response to more general Justice Department reservations about the deal.
Delrahim and other DOJ officials have denied that the President was in any way involved in the negotiations, but Trump’s previous comments on the deal have invited speculation to that effect. Trump has deep personal animus against CNN, which he has called “fake news” numerous times in response to reporting on matters including the probe into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia. During the Presidential campaign, Trump also cited the proposed merger as an example of the concentration of power that he stood against.
However, Delrahim at the time said he didn’t see the merger as “a major antitrust problem,” and his shifting position has added fuel to the sense that Trump’s finger is now on the scale. The President’s direct intervention could amount to a weakening of the DOJ’s independence on this and other issues.
Whether pressured by Trump or not, the DOJ’s reported position on the merger represents a break not only with Delrahim’s own past opinions, but with a Republican orthodoxy hesitant to flex regulatory power. Instead, the demand to divest media properties aligns with longtime left-wing positions critical of the concentration of media power. Even as AT&T and Time Warner are on the docket, those arguments are finding new life with regard to Facebook and Google, which are increasingly seen as powerful media monopolies in their own right — including by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.

674,"November 9, 2017","US: Net neutrality rules should apply to ISPs and websites, senator says","
Sen. Al Franken wants the US to impose net neutrality rules on Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and other Web companies.
Net neutrality rules today apply only to Internet service providers, such as cable companies and mobile carriers. ISPs are not allowed to block, throttle, or demand payments to prioritize delivery of lawful Internet traffic. The rules are meant to give all websites —both the established players and startups— a fair shot at reaching Internet users.
But Franken argues that similar non-discrimination rules should apply to the most dominant websites.
“As tech giants become a new kind of Internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn’t,” Franken wrote yesterday in an op-ed for The Guardian. “Facebook, Google, and Amazon —like ISPs— should be ‘neutral’ in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms.”
The double-barreled critique of major tech firms as non-neutral entities cuts against Silicon Valley’s longtime message to the country and reflects the growing skepticism in Washington toward the industry.

Justice Dept. to Boost Antitrust Staff Devoted to Global Competition
By Liz Crampton
The new head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division used his first official public appearance to promise to reshuffle resources to concentrate on international cooperation.
Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s antitrust division, said Oct. 27 the department will increase the ranks of attorneys working under Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roger Alford. Delrahim has tapped Alford to confront trade and international antitrust issues. Although the department generally can expect “belt-tightening” in funding, Delrahim said he will make sure the international section “has all the resources it needs.”
Delrahim said the proliferation of competition regimes around the world has brought new challenges because regulators have different views about what constitutes sound antitrust enforcement. The EU has targeted big companies like Google Inc. and Apple Inc., while Taiwan recently fined Qualcomm Inc. NT$23.4 billion ($773 million) for how it prices mobile phone chips and patents.

Apple, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler have warned EU regulators that adopting patent fee guidelines which favor Qualcomm and Ericsson could hurt consumers and hinder innovation.
The companies’ lobbying group, the Fair Standards Alliance (FSA), voiced their concerns in a letter dated October 16 to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska and their colleagues.
The move comes as the EU ponders whether a fridge -maker should pay a different rate for crucial patents than a carmaker, or whether a flat, fixed rate would be fairer, with trillions of dollars in sales at stake.
Sources say the latest Commission draft favors the patent fee model used by world’s top smartphone chip designers Qualcomm and Ericsson, which predominates in the tech industry and is based on how much value a technology adds to a product. It is opposed by Apple, Google and others in Silicon Valley, which favor fixed fees.

On Wednesday, October 18, Amazon sent emails to qualifying customers to notify them that credit has been added to their accounts in response to the Apple eBook Antitrust Settlement.
You were only eligible to receive credit if you had a US billing address and purchased a Kindle book between April 1, 2010, and May 21, 2012, published by one of five major US publishers: Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster.
The case, which was settled November 21, 2014, addressed the question of whether Apple and the five listed publishers conspired to fix and raise the retail prices of eBooks.
“Under the settlements, Apple provided funds for credits that were applied directly to Amazon accounts of eligible customers in June 2016,” Amazon explains. “These credits expired in June 2017. Customers who redeemed credits from the June 2016 distribution received additional credits in October 2017.”
Some retailers, like Google, are requiring customers to file Claim Forms to participate in the settlement. But most, including Barnes & Noble, are sending out emails like Amazon to notify customers about available credit.

679,"October 17, 2017","US: Facebook buys TBH, an anonymous polling app","
Facebook has acquired TBH, an app that allows teens to send anonymous compliments to each other. The cost has not been announced, but is reportedly less than $100 million.
The app, launched this summer in 37 US states only, has received more than five million downloads in a short space of time, thanks to its unique twist on the anonymous-messaging model of previous viral hits such as Secret, YikYak and Sarahah.
Users of the app are shown a positive question, asking them who “makes you laugh the hardest” or “has the most integrity”, along with a selection of four of their Facebook friends. The person they select as the answer is told that they were given the compliment, but not by who.
The model allows for the same sort of pleasant interaction with friends that previous anonymous messaging apps have enabled at their best moments, receiving nice messages from people who might be too embarrassed to say the same in person – as well as enabling a fair amount of anonymous flirting.
But it avoids the downside of many of its competitors, which is their capacity for anonymous bullying. By forcing users to only communicate through pre-checked questions, the app can keep things positive.
It seems to have worked: in a statement posted to the company’s website, TBH said that more than 1 billion messages had been sent since it launched.
At least for the moment, the acquisition won’t change how TBH works. Similar to Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook is leaving the app to run largely unaltered, with the same staff now operating from its Menlo Park headquarters.
“When we met with Facebook, we realised that we shared many of the same core values about connecting people through positive interactions,” TBH said in its statement. “Most of all, we were compelled by the ways they could help us realise TBH’s vision and bring it to more people.”
In a twist to the story, Matt Stoller, who was part of Barry Lynn’s team at Google-funded think-tank New America, tweeted: “Facebook is buying a competitor that undercuts its data-harvesting business model. FTC should block this merger.”

Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Internet of Platforms and Two-Sided Markets: Legal and Regulatory Implications for Competition and Consumers
By Rob Frieden (Pennsylvania State University)
Abstract:     This article examines developments in the Internet marketplace that favor embedded intermediaries that have significant market power and the ability to install a platform that both upstream sources of content and applications as well as downstream consumers need to access. Ventures such as Amazon, Facebook and Google have exploited, “winner take all” networking externalities resulting in the creation of seemingly impenetrable barriers to market entry even by innovative companies. Courts and regulatory agencies recognize the substantial market shares these ventures have acquired, but refrain from imposing sanctions on grounds that consumers accrue ample benefits when platform operators use upstream revenues to subsidize downstream services. Consumers also benefit when platform intermediaries eschew short term profits in the quest for greater product diversity and “shelf space” in the Internet marketplace. Additionally, courts and regulators may over-estimate the opportunities for consumers to migrate to alternatives, but underestimate the harms to competition and consumers occurring on either or both sides of an intermediary’s platform.
The article identifies four types of government responses to price and quality of service discrimination that exploits choke points within the Internet ecosystem where large volume of traffic has to traverse a single digital, broadband carrier’s network, or service provider’s platform. Governments can refrain from regulating access and accept aspects of market concentration as proper rewards to ventures offering desirable content and carriage services. Alternatively, they can impose access sanctions for antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, consumer harms and unreasonable access discrimination to offset market-driven concentration and dominance. Between these poles, governments can apply antitrust/competition policy remedies, or rely on expert regulatory agencies to respond to complaints.
The article examines digital broadband platform operators with an eye toward assessing the aggregate benefits and costs to both upstream firms and downstream consumers. The article notes that in some instances, government-imposed, ex ante safeguards anticipate and attempt to resolve transitory, comparatively insignificant, or possibly nonexistent problems. In other instances, governments have stated an intention to rely on ex post remedies, but they never get around to refining procedures to reduce the potential for false negatives that ignore or underestimate significant marketplace harm.
The article concludes that governments have failed to revise and recalibrate tools that examine potential marketplace distortions and assess the potential for damage to competition and consumers. The article demonstrates how the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission have relied on economic and legal doctrine ill-suited for digital broadband market assessments. These agencies have generated false positives, resulting in market intervention where not major problem exists and false negatives, where undetected major problems cause harm without remedy. Additionally these agencies appear to misallocate their resources and attention on insignificant matters when more compelling problems exists.
The article recommends that courts and government agencies consider both sides of an intermediary’s market when assessing current and prospective harms, commit to more accurate estimates of the potential for consumers to change platform allegiances and consider the overall impact of two-sided market domination instead of simply dismissing market concentration as necessary and harmless.

681,"October 9, 2017",Why “fake news” is an antitrust problem,"
By Sean Illing, VOX
Five of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization are tech companies. In the past 10 years, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have all joined Microsoft at the top of the list.
Each of these companies dominates its primary market, and is gradually expanding its reach into secondary markets. Have they become too big? Are they full-fledged monopolies at this point? And if so, should we rein them in?
To get answers to these questions, I reached out to Sally Hubbard, a senior editor of tech antitrust enforcement at the Capitol Forum, a nonpartisan legal investigative company that offers analysis to policymakers and industry stakeholders. I asked her to walk me through the case for using antitrust laws to regulate the major tech companies.
Antitrust laws exist in order prevent monopolization, which occurs when a company so dominates a market that it effectively eliminates the possibility of competition. This is tricky when it comes to a tech company like, say, Google, which has a monopoly in the search market but not in the digital advertising market.
Antitrust enforcement, at least in the past 40 years or so, has focused on protecting consumers from high prices due to a lack of competition. But the problems created by tech monopolies are different: Consumers aren’t paying higher prices to use these platforms, but they are handing over massive amounts of personal data and allowing companies like Facebook and Google to disproportionately influence the news and information Americans consume.
We don’t need to bust up these companies, Hubbard says, but there are very good reasons to use antitrust law to promote more competition in this space. “Fake news,” she told me, “is partly an antitrust problem” because the dominant algorithms of Facebook and Google control the flow of information. If there were more competition, purveyors of fake news would have to figure out how to game more algorithms.
Our full conversation, lightly edited for clarity, appears below.

Are the big tech companies monopolies?
Sean Illing
Can you make the case to me for why big tech companies like Facebook or Amazon or Google should be treated like monopolies?
Sally Hubbard
Monopoly enforcement is often about ensuring fair competition. One of the main arguments is that these platforms have gotten so large that they actually compete with companies that depend on their platforms to exist in the marketplace. This is what I call “platform privilege,” which is really the ability to prioritize their own products over those of competitors.
We’re seeing that in the Google Shopping case that the European Union has brought, where Google allegedly gave priority to its own comparison shopping services on its dominant search engine, so that its own Google Shopping comparison shopping service showed up first and other competitors that had comparison shopping services got put on page four.
Sean Illing
So these companies have gotten so large, so influential, that they’ve distorted competition in the markets they touch?
Sally Hubbard
That’s certainly one argument. I do think a privileged platform is a distortion of competition. You don’t have a level playing field when you’re competing against the company that determines whether you even reach the universe. What we ideally want is a marketplace where these products can come and they can compete on their merits against a huge company like Google, but if Google has the power to squeeze out competitors by placing their results at the bottom of search engines, that’s a problem for innovation, for a robust marketplace that is supposed to thrive on competition.
The promise of the internet was that it was going to be a level playing field where someone could start their business in their garage and there would be opportunities for them to enter the market. If these platforms have the ability to bury a competitor, that promise is dead.

Mergers Are Bad for Innovation
By Asher Schechter
As competition authorities and economists worry about the competitive implications of increasingly concentrated markets, horizontal merger reviews should be broadened to include their potential implications for future innovation. So said Tommaso Valletti, the European Commission’s Chief Competition Economist, during a keynote lecture at an antitrust conference at Northwestern University last week.
Valletti, an Economics professor at Imperial College Business School and at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, joined the European Commission a year ago. During this time, the European Commission made a number of high-profile decisions, such as leveling a record €2.42 billion antitrust fine on Google, vetoing the proposed merger between Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange, clearing the now-completed US$130 billion merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont (now known as DowDuPont), and launching an investigation of the proposed merger between Bayer and Monsanto.
Most of Valletti’s talk during the Searle Center’s 10th Annual Conference on Antitrust Economics and Competition Policy was devoted to the subject of horizontal mergers and their impact on innovation, through the prism of the Dupont-Dow merger, which the EC cleared under the condition that DuPont divest of its global R&D pesticide facilities. It is the first to be cleared of the three mega-mergers that will reduce the number of top firms in the industry from five to three. The other two pending mergers are the Bayer’s planned purchase of Monsanto and ChemChina’s plan to buy Syngenta.

The rise of global technology superstars such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google is creating new challenges for competition watchdogs. In 2017 they joined Microsoft to become the five most-valuable companies in the US, a ranking that included only the software company 10 years ago. They dominate their markets, from e-books and smartphones to search advertising and social-media traffic on mobile devices. New research connects the market power of these high-tech behemoths — part of a broader rise in concentration in many industries — with chronic economic problems, including the decline in workers’ share of national income and slower economic expansions. Their dominance is fueling a global debate over whether it’s time to rein in such winner-take-all companies.

FTC’s McSweeny is open to antitrust changes
By Alexei Alexis
Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Terrell McSweeny wants to “revitalize” antitrust enforcement but she warns that renewed enthusiasm for the issue won’t solve every concern about dominant companies like Amazon.com and Google.com.
Even with that caveat, she said in an interview with Bloomberg BNA that Congress could remove “antiquated” antitrust enforcement exemptions for industries such as the health care sector and ensure adequate resources for the FTC and the Justice Department’s antitrust division.
The FTC could also make some changes without Congress, such as reconsidering its guidelines on “vertical mergers” involving companies that don’t compete directly. “I think that’s an area we could definitely look at,” she said.
Some public interest advocates and Democrats are calling for a major antitrust overhaul, saying deficiencies in existing law have allowed companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook Inc. to become too powerful. McSweeny said some of those concerns, such as data privacy, are “not all appropriately addressed through competition.”

The companies and the FTC are close to reaching an agreement that would allow the deal to proceed, said the people, who declined to discuss details of the revised transaction. The number of stores involved in the latest iteration won’t change dramatically, one of the people said.
In June, Walgreens, the nation’s largest drugstore chain operator, said it would buy nearly half of the smaller rival’s stores for US$5.18 billion, after it failed to win approval to take over the company.

Estafadores especializados en el abuso de tarjetas de regalo comercializadas por el servicio de música de Apple, iTunes, han estafado a numerosas víctimas australianas, con perjuicios que ascienden a los cientos de miles de dólares.
Los defraudadores, que exigen tarjetas de regalo como pago por multas falsas, honorarios y problemas de seguridad en línea, ya han despojado casi AU$540,000 (US$431,829 dólares) a personas de todo el país este año, informa Scamwatch.
La Comisión Australiana de Competencia y Consumidores (ACCC, por sus siglas en inglés) dijo que la táctica era una tendencia creciente, con pérdidas de alrededor de 480,000 dólares (US$383,841) registradas en 2015-16.
“Los estafadores están consiguiendo cada vez más que sus víctimas paguen con las tarjetas de regalo de iTunes, ya que pueden rápidamente venderlas nuevamente y conservar el dinero”, dijo la vicepresidenta de ACCC, Delia Rickard.
Los engaños que utilizan las tarjetas de regalo suelen involucrar el convencer a la víctima a que adquiera una de éstas tarjetas, para luego hacerles revelar los números de serie de las mismas.

Posted by The Economist
Is Margrethe Vestager championing consumers or her political career?
Even her enemies admire the bloody-mindedness of Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy. Last autumn, not long after she had ordered Apple to pay €13bn ($14.5bn) in back-taxes to Ireland, to the fury of many in America, she flew across the Atlantic on a charm offensive. The Americans were not charmed; Ms Vestager was unmoved. Buckling up for the flight home, she tweeted that she had never felt so European.
Since she assumed her current role in November 2014, Ms Vestager has had several high-profile clashes with American tech firms. In May she fined Facebook €110m for misleading EU trustbusters about its takeover of WhatsApp, a messaging service. In June a long-running investigation resulted in a €2.4bn fine on Google for using its search engine to promote its own comparison-shopping service. EU trustbusters have also charged Google with using its Android operating system to promote its mobile-phone apps and services over those of rivals. That investigation continues.
Ms Vestager has said the job of agencies like hers is “not to get too cosy with special interests but to have the courage to defend the public interest”. Few would quibble with that. All too often regulators and trustbusters come to see the world as big business sees it, to society’s cost. But a long-standing concern is that the commission acts as prosecutor, judge and executioner in cases against dominant firms. The courts in Europe have been a weak check on its powers in recent years in this regard.
That may be changing. Last week the European Court of Justice asked the lower courts to look again at the economic merits of a case against Intel, which in 2009 was fined €1.06bn for abusing its dominant position in chipmaking. But the courts move slowly. Some worry that a number of Ms Vestager’s recent, crowd-pleasing victories over big tech firms may come back to haunt the commission. And by then she might have moved on to a bigger job.

Conservatives, liberals unite against Silicon Valley
By Nancy Scola
The days of unqualified praise from Washington are over for the country’s biggest tech companies, whose size and power are increasingly drawing attacks from both the left and the right.
Democrats are condemning Facebook for allowing “fake news” and Russia-linked ads during the election, while conservatives accuse Google of silencing right-leaning viewpoints. President Donald Trump routinely accuses Amazon of dodging taxes, and right-leaning news organizations like Fox News and Breitbart have begun mocking Silicon Valley leaders as power-hungry and out of touch.
It’s a sharp change of fortune for the tech sector, which long drew bipartisan praise as an engine of economic growth and innovation — and saw politicians deferring to the industry on issues like digital encryption and how the internet should operate. Now, with Democrats talking tough about applying antitrust scrutiny to “Big Tech” and Republicans condemning internet firms for their snap judgments about who gets to say what online, tech is encountering unaccustomed hostility from the political class — and tighter regulation no longer seems a far-fetched scenario.
“The free ride Silicon Valley has benefited from is finally coming to an end, and I see that on both sides of the political spectrum,” said John Simpson, privacy project director at Washington-based Consumer Watchdog.

Taiwanese news outlet Commercial Times reported Google has nearly completed an acquisition of HTC, the smartphone maker that builds the Google Pixel. Acquiring HTC would give Google strategic ownership of its mobile operating division and could help offset some of the strategic challenges the company’s mobile computing business could potentially face, according to one analyst.
Those challenges include deeper integration of hardware and software to alleviate Android fragmentation issues, optimization of development cycles, mitigation of rising Distribution TAC expenses and a counterpoint to the unbundling of apps that has resulted from the European Commission’s investigation of Android, the analyst said.
After a number of unsuccessful smartphone launches, HTC formed a separate division selling virtual reality headsets, which could be further reason for Google’s interest.

691,"September 11, 2017","UE: Tribunal ordena revisión a caso Intel, dando revés a reguladores","
Intel ha recibido un respiro del Tribunal de Justicia Europeo (TJE), el cual respaldó un recurso contra la fuerte multa impuesta por el regulador antimonopolio del bloque político. El fallo podría tener implicaciones para Google y Apple de Alphabet, que también se enfrentan a grandes multas.
En 2009, el regulador antimonopolio de la Comisión Europea multó a Intel por una multa récord de 1.060 millones de euros por haber abusado de su posición dominante en el mercado de unidades centrales de procesamiento x86 mediante la implementación de una estrategia para sacar a su competidor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) del mercado.
El regulador dijo que Intel infringió las normas de competencia de la UE cuando concedió rebajas a los principales fabricantes de computadoras, Dell, Lenovo, HP y NEC, a condición de que compraran todas sus CPU x86 de Intel, disminuyendo así la capacidad de los competidores para responder.
Intel apeló la multa en 2014, pero el Tribunal General desestimó la acción. La empresa tecnológica interpuso entonces un recurso contra la sentencia del Tribunal General ante el Tribunal de Justicia.
El TJE ha decretado que el Tribunal General no examinó todas las pruebas presentadas en el recurso, en relación con los presuntos errores cometidos por la comisión en su decisión inicial.
“Por lo tanto, el Tribunal de Justicia anula la sentencia del Tribunal de Primera Instancia como consecuencia de este incumplimiento en su análisis de si los descuentos en cuestión eran capaces de restringir la competencia”, indicó el Tribunal de Justicia. “El Tribunal remite el asunto al Tribunal General para que pueda examinar, a la luz de los argumentos expuestos por Intel, si los descuentos en cuestión son capaces de restringir la competencia”.

692,"September 6, 2017",EU: Court orders Intel case review in blow to EU antitrust regulators,"
Intel got a reprieve from the European Courts of Justice (ECJ), when Europe’s top court Wednesday backed an appeal against a massive fine imposed by the bloc’s antitrust regulator.
The ruling could have implications for Alphabet’s Google and Apple which are also facing large fines from Europe.
The European Commission’s antitrust regulator in 2009 fined Intel a record-breaking (at the time) €1.06 billion (US$1.26 billion) fine for having abused its dominant position for x86 central processing units by implementing a strategy aimed at pushing competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) out of the market.
The regulator said Intel broke EU competition rules when it granted rebated to major computer manufacturers – Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC – on the condition that they purchased all their x86 CPUs from Intel, thus diminishing the ability of competitors to compete.
Intel appealed the fine in 2014, but the General Court dismissed the action. The tech company then brought an appeal against the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice.
The ECJ on Wednesday, September 6, said the General Court failed to examine all the evidence presented in the appeal, concerning the alleged errors made by the commission in their initial ruling.
“The Court therefore sets aside the judgment of the General Court as a result of that failure in its analysis of whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition,” the ECJ said. “The Court refers the case back to the General Court so that it may examine, in the light of the arguments put forward by Intel, whether the rebates at issue are capable of restricting competition.”

The Next Battle in Antitrust Will Be About Whether One Company Knows Everything About You
By Bala Iyer, Mohan Subramaniam & U. Srinivasa Rangan
Google’s battle with the European Union has come to a head. On June 27 this year the EU fined Google $2.7 billion for alleged monopolistic or unfair trade practices. Google has appealed and is now preparing its defense. The EU’s case asserts, among other things, that Google unfairly exploits its dominance in search engines and smartphone operating systems to restrict competition in shopping services, ad placement services, and smartphone app store markets. In an earlier article, two of us (Bala and Srinivasa) provided a context to understand the respective argument of the EU and Google using the lens of digital-age markets. We highlighted how antitrust, the underpinnings of which are based on industrial-age economic theories, needs new thinking in the digital age to ensure that antitrust policies continue to remain effective guardians of consumer welfare without inadvertently impeding economic progress.
But as important as today’s antitrust questions are, regulators shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger picture. The coming battle in antitrust will not be about controlling markets in the traditional sense. It will be about the battle for control over consumers’ information. The tech titans are currently in a race to see which of them can build a better digital replica of their consumers, which means finding a way to not just collect user data but also make it harder for competitors to do so. Tomorrow’s monopolies won’t be able to be measured just by how much they sell us. They’ll be based on how much they know about us and how much better they can predict our behavior than competitors.

The EU Court of Justice (ECJ), Europe’s highest court, is expected to deliver verdict on the Intel antitrust fine imposed eight years ago on Wednesday, September 6.
The ruling will greatly impact how US companies reacted to EU legal penalties.
In 2009, Intel was hit with a US$1.26 billion fine for abusing its dominant market position by using various marketing stratagems and has been fighting the case since then.
According to commentators, if the ruling were to go in favour of Intel, then US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google, that had tended to accept EU antitrust penalties, may consider fighting the EU in court as a viable option.
Intel was slapped with the biggest ever antitrust penalty when the EC ruled that Intel blocked rival Advanced Micro Systems (AMD) from the computer chip market, abusing its dominant market position.
After general court judges dismissed Intel’s claim in 2014, the firm turned to the ECJ, its last option to fight against the fine.

Breaking from tech giants, Democrats consider becoming an antimonopoly party
By David Weigel
A messy, public brawl over a Google critic’s ouster from a Washington think tank has exposed a fissure in Democratic Party politics. On one side there’s a young and growing faction advocating new antimonopoly laws, and on the other a rival faction struggling to defend itself.
At issue is a decades-long relationship between Democrats and tech companies, with Democratic presidents signing off on deregulation and candidates embracing money and innovations from companies like Google and Facebook. Now, locked out of power and convinced that same coziness with large corporations cost them the presidency, Democrats are talking themselves into breaking with tech giants and becoming an antimonopoly party.
The argument had a breakthrough last week when it was reported that Barry Lynn, a monopoly critic and longtime scholar at the Google-funded New America Foundation, was leaving and taking his 10-person initiative with him.

The five car manufacturers are said to have operated a cartel over a number of years, in which prohibited agreements were being made on a large scale, including arrangements surrounding the exhaust gas values of internal combustion engines. Daimler and VW have both carried out internal investigations into the matter.
Vestager stressed that it was still too early to “speculate on the extent of the possible sanctions and a length of time for a decision from the EU Commission.” However, the competition watchdog placed the case on a par with the cartel offenses of Google and Facebook.
“I see no big difference between the business practices of American tech companies and those of German car makers,” she said. “When companies commit illegal acts, they are usually driven by greed or fear.”

Disruptive Innovations: CCI’s Progressive Outlook By Bharat Budholia & Aishwarya Gopalakrishnan[1]
INTRODUCTION
If one looks back at the progress of human kind- one will see that every step forward was always greeted with great scepticism. Inventions and new theories propounded were never accepted easily, for the simple reason that they were not understood well enough. In fact, innovations were always viewed as disruptive ideas. All innovators were ahead of their times and the merit of their ideas was acknowledged only after they were tried, tested and proved to be not only good but also better than the old ones. But time and again history has shown us that old ideas did bow out giving place to the new when their worth was proven, society was benefited and efficiency increased manifold – be it the transformation from doves to the postal system, telegraph, telephone, cellular phones and now the world wide web, that has revolutionized communications. Computers were viewed with great suspicion as they would leave a whole section of people jobless. However, these very same computers created an entirely new industry in the form of the software industry – which is one of the biggest in the world and employs millions today. All of these innovations which seemed disruptive initially have now woven themselves inextricably into the processes of production as well as consumption and have led t...

Abstract:     In his recent article, Antitrust and Information Technology, Professor Hovenkamp addresses some of the most important issues involving antitrust. In particular, he addresses the issues of market power, consumer choice in the context of Google, the Apple e-books case, net neutrality and antitrust issues involving FRAND commitments and patent pooling. In doing so, Professor Hovenkamp offers an intellectual tour du force of most of the important issues in this interface of antitrust, intellectual property and high tech. Further, Professor Hovenkamp offers a policy roadmap for courts and antitrust authorities. This response provides an overview of the article and offers some suggestions of further implications of Professor Hovenkamp’s work.

700,"August 16, 2017",Dissecting Professor Wu and Yelp’s Local Search Study: An Antitrust Law Analysis of The ‘Experimental Evidence’,"
By Joshua D. Wright (George Mason University)
Abstract:     In a 2015 article co-authored with three Yelp employees, Professor Wu purports to examine evidence from one experiment allegedly relevant to the question whether Google’s display of local search results in a defined space on the search results page violates the antitrust laws. The authors rely entirely upon this single experiment to support two central claims: that Google’s local results harm consumers and that this innovation violates the antitrust laws. A closer look at the authors’ experiment, however, makes clear it is does not substantiate either of these claims. I describe the methodological flaws in the authors’ approach in some detail, including their mistaken claim that the single experiment amounts to an “RCT,” or “randomized controlled trial.” I also identify the mistaken premise underlying their provocative legal claim – that is, that a firm can face antitrust liability for innovation that improves consumer welfare on the grounds that one can imagine an innovation that would have generated greater welfare improvements. Antitrust law has repeatedly considered and rejected this notion. Professor Wu and his co-authors draw even more provocative conclusions from this experiment, but ignore the fact that in the 5 years following Yelp’s initial complaints regarding local search, Yelp’s annual revenues grew from $83 to $713 million. In response to the common refrain of antitrust complainants that they could have performed even better but for the allegedly unlawful conduct, I explain the relevance of a rival’s economic success in the context of Section 2 claims involving exclusionary conduct. Professor Wu and his Yelp co-authors’ theory thus ultimately fails as a matter of economics, law, and data.

Abstract:      After a decade of bruising legal battles, the courts and software industry norms largely resolved the costly war over the scope of copyright protection for computer software. By the mid 1990s, freedom to develop interoperable devices, systems, and software triumphed over broad copyright protection for network features of computer software. Copyright peace prevailed throughout the software industry for the next 15 years. But in 2010, Oracle reignited the smoldering embers of that war when it brought suit alleging that Google infringed copyright in the Java application program interface packages (APIs)…
This article updates and expands upon an earlier “epitaph” for copyright protection of network features of computer software to address the second API copyright wave. As background, Part I reviews the first wave of API copyright legislation and litigation. Part II examines the Oracle v. Google litigation, tracing the development of Java and Android and the subsequent (and still ongoing) battle over the scope of copyright protection for APIs. Part III critically analyzes the Oracle v. Google decisions. It explains that copyright law’s fundamental exclusion of protection for functional features dictates that the labeling conventions and packaging of functions within interface specifications generally fall outside of the scope of copyright protection even as implementing code garners thin copyright protection. This interpretation of copyright law comports with fundamental principles channeling protection among the modes of intellectual property. It also serves the larger goals of intellectual property law and competition policy.

By Jakob Kucharczyk 
The European Commission’s competition investigation into Google’s Android mobile operating system (“OS”) has raised a lot of attention and commentary. So far most comments focused on the “abuse” part of that investigation. While the issue of “abuse” is arguably the more interesting part in most Article 102 cases, the finding of a dominant position is worth a broader discussion in the Android investigation. That is because it reveals a lot on how the Commission views the competitive dynamics in the mobile OS space. This article discusses this issue and explains how large market share is not a reliable proxy for market power.

Recent trends in KFTC enforcement activities regarding IPRs By Kyoung Yeon Kim, Yulchon LLC
Korea’s antitrust authority has, especially in recent years, come to aggressively regulate the use of intellectual property rights (IPRs). One might guess this to be the case merely based on the fact that the Korea Fair Trade Commission (the “KFTC”) has come to be perceived as one of the more aggressive competition authorities in the world, having been very active in enforcing general competition law, overall, throughout approximately the last 40 years.[2]  However, in fact, one can clearly perceive this reality if one examines the KFTC’s history of rulemaking, guidance, and investigative activities and enforcement actions related to IPRs.
I will first outline some of the major milestones in that history. Then, based on my understanding of past regulatory and enforcement activities, I will try to offer a few observations and questions as a practitioner directly and indirectly experienced in competition-law enforcement by the KFTC in relation to IPRs.
Brief Overview of the KFTC’s Past Rulemaking and Enforcement Activities
The Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (the “MRFTA”) has a provision, Article 59, that expressly addresses the application of antitrust law to IPRs. Article 59 currently reads: “This Act shall not apply to any act which is deemed the justifiable exercise of rights ...

706,"August 1, 2017",Ex-FCC Chair Tom Wheeler Dismantles The Case For Abandoning Net Neutrality,"
By Mark Sullivan
Tom Wheeler‘s legacy is the 2015 Open Internet Order passed by the Federal Communications Commission while he was FCC chairman, imposing network neutrality safeguards on big ISPs like AT&T and Comcast. The order was and is popular with the public, and yet is under serious threat from the current Republican-controlled FCC under Trump-appointed chairman Ajit Pai, a former FCC commissioner and Verizon lobbyist.
In order to impose the net neutrality safeguards–which prevent ISPs from blocking, slowing, or delivering some internet traffic faster than others–a federal court said Wheeler’s FCC would have to reclassify ISPs as “common carriers” under Title II of the 1934 Telecommunication Act. So it did, much to the displeasure of the ISPs.
Emboldened by the deregulatory agendas of both Trump and Pai, the ISPs are now pressing hard to get the FCC to roll back the Open Internet Order. Pai released a preliminary proposal for doing so in April. Lots of voices can now be heard talking about the issue this summer, both inside the Beltway and in Silicon Valley, but not Wheeler’s—until I talked to him on Thursday.

707,"July 31, 2017","Jean Tirole “We must protect the worker, not the job”","
One day, Jean Tirole, the French economist, stepped out onto the street and noticed people would stop him at every corner. “Please, we need an Economics book that we can understand!” they implored, as to some kind of Messiah. Tirole had, only recenty, the Nobel Prize in Economics (2014). And so, he decided to write a book meant for the public at large. The result is 577 pages long, and has been a success in France. Its title is “Economics for the Common Good”. It has now been released in Spain, under the Taurus publishing seal. The book was presented at the Rafael del Pino Foundation in Madrid, where the following interview took place. 
And just what Is Economics for the Common Good? “The economy is not a servant to private property and individual interests, nor to those who wish to use the State to impose their own values” Tirole says at the start of his book. “The economy serves the Common Good in order to make a better world.” Full stop. 
Tirole, born in Troyes in 1953, graduated as an engineer from the Paris Polytechnic School and went on to a Doctorate in Mathematics at the University of Paris-Dauphine. His greatest push, however, came when he left for the USA to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating in 1981 with a PhD. in Economic Sciences. The book sketches out, in layman’s terms, part of the work that would earn him the Nobel. Why is the economy so hard to understand? What are the limitations of the market? Why do certain social policies have such terrifying backlashes? What are the challenges presented by new technology? When should the State be reined in?

Q. Did anybody offer you advice for writing to a wider audience?
A  This is the first time I write for a mass audience. I have written for politicians before, or for experts in economics or for businesses. The problem is that we use academic jargon, and the problem was making something that other people could understand, as we tend to take things for granted. 
Q Isn’t that approach part of your idea of the Common Good?
A Yes. It’s important that we expand our knowledge. 
Q In your book, you say that one of the problems with the crisis in 2008 was that economists failed to inform people well.
A. For example, Spain was undergoing a financial bubble, and there were experts around who knew this. The Bank of Spain warned everyone, but they were never able to make the majority of people understand. 
Q You begin the book talking about cognitive bias, that is, the way our economic reasoning is influenced by hidden prejudices. 
A If we don’t understand our cognitive biases it can be hard to comprehend why people do certain things: Why we procrastinate with our chores, anything to do with alcohol consumption, savings… 
Q Was Brexit  a case of cognitive bias?
A No. It was a clear case of Imperfect Information. British people ware made to believe that they could do better with Brexit than without it. They had an incorrect notion of how much they would save if they no longer had to contribute to the EU’s budget. And that protectionism would benefit them. 
Q And that immigrants were taking their jobs…
A Look: Immigrants don’t steal jobs. People don’t understand, because they believe there’s a limited amount of jobs. In the short term it may be true, there may be a limited number of jobs, just as in the short term there is a limited number of books around. But countries with high immigration don’t have a very high unemployment. The US, Scandinavia, Britain and Germany all have lots of immigrants and low rates of unemployment. 
Q Can you solve a riddle for us? How is it that many US workers can believe that Trump will get them their jobs back, when there is very little unemployment in the country?
A Because there is a part of America that has become very rich, with very high income, while the poor have only had a 6% raise in their paychecks over very many years. Globalization has made the USA wealthier in general, but it has been uneven. If someone in the Midwest loses their job they won’t be finding a similar job in a similar environment; they will have to move, and switch jobs. This has caused some discontent. Trump has exploited this anger, by offering the wrong solutions. 
Q In the film ‘Gran Torino’, Clint Eastwood portrays a retired Ford factory worker who feels threatened by immigrants. Is this a good portrait of the USA?
A  True. Every country has its own films dealing with this phenomenon. In France it’s La Loi du Marché (The Law of the Market). It won an award at Cannes. It’s about an unemployed man who finds a job at the supermarket, but the position isn’t a good fit for his abilities, so he fights with his boss. Films like these reflect what people have suffered as the economy evolves. It’s real. I’m a supporter of globalization, because it has been generally good, but we haven’t paid enough attention to the losers of globalization. And now Populists are exploiting it the wrong way. 
Q Plenty of new parties in Spain are exploiting it.
A Spain has been hit hard by the economic crisis. People are right to complain, but they have been bad at choosing the right measures to take. 
Q What do you make of the crisis in Venezuela?
A Venezuela is precisely the wrong way to do things. It should be a very wealthy country, since they have the largest oil reserves in the world, and it’s a relatively small country of 30 million people. 
Q Norway has oil, it’s small and very rich. Venezuela isn’t. Why is that?
A It’s because, if you choose the wrong policies, you can make a country poorer. This has happened with North and South Korea. It happened in East and West Germany. We’re not talking about a 10% difference in income between them, we’re talking about a monstrous difference! In France we have people who think Venezuela should be a role model, and that puzzles me. They don’t know what’s really going on there. They can’t see what’s behind the curtain. 
Q In your book you speak about the impact that technology can have on jobs. If I were a taxi driver, would you recommend I switch to Uber?
A That is all going to become obsolete very quickly due to the rise of self-driving cars. 10 years from now I don’t think there will be Any taxis. If you’re a taxi driver you have two ways to react to Uber. You can either try to compete with Uber and become more efficient – which is what the taxi drivers of Paris are attempting – or you can block the streets and stick to your routine – which is what’s happening in Toulouse. I like Uber’s service, because it is very good. Of course, some things have to be brought to level with Taxis, such as having the same Social Security obligations. But it’s true that the taxi service in France is often very bad, expensive, low quality and some cheaters. 
Q What kind of question should we be asking about this?
A The key question here is how the Digital Economy is going to affect your job and your world. It’s changing everything. Your job as well as mine. That isn’t a new thing, there have always existed fears about the impact of technology on employment. However, the impact was relatively slow-acting before. Now the effects are felt very quickly. 
Q Exponentially?
A Yes. Jobs are changing very quickly. For example, thanks to genetics, blood tests and computers, we will soon have very precise medical diagnoses. What will a Doctor’s job be like in 10 years? Completely different. The job for a professor will be totally different. I may lose my job as a teacher in 5 or 10 years. We have to be prepared, and this is where the good and bad solutions come in. A bad solution is to try and protect jobs. As I say in my book, one should protect workers, not jobs. We have to protect people, because jobs will change in the future. We have to protect workers by giving them social security, of course, as well as entertainment, education… I don’t think we spend enough on education. We need a constant process of training, so people will learn new skills. We have to be learning all the time. 
Q If I were a student, what would you recommend?
A Education is also going to change. We will have to teach people how to learn more, and maybe give them less facts. You can find plenty of facts on Wikipedia. A physician using a certain software can even learn about genetics and perform tests. Knowledge of fact is less important, as it’s accessible to everyone through their computer screen. Thinking is more important. The way we think, the way we adapt our knowledge to new skills, that’s more important. We have to re-train ourselves all the time, and it’s not easy. 
Q So you’re telling us we have to learn how to learn?
A  Even professors will have to adapt to this trend. When I give a lecture I try not to give my students too many facts, since they can find that in books or articles. I try to say to them – “Here’s a situation, what do you think about it? What do you think of this measure?” 
Q Like Socrates. Helping them think. 
A I say to them: “How will you tackle this problem? What comes to mind?” That’s a lot harder than just passing on knowledge. Teaching facts is easy, since you simply have to read your own papers out in class. But believe me: It’s not easy at all to teach someone to think. Professors aren’t prepared for it, but it is very important. 
Q What about the good consequences of technology?
A On a global scale, we will be wealthier, with better sanitation, and we’ll live longer. Thin about search engines, Waze’s GPS, the internet in general. We will have better technology to help us combat ageing and increase the average amount of wealth. However, there will be consequences we have to deal with: One of them is that inequality will increase, both within and between countries. Within them, because there will be a greater demand for skilled people. Between them, because talent can move from one country to another. This is worrisome. If you look at the large new companies –Google, Apple, Microsoft – they are all immensely rich and have rich employees: the average salary at Facebook is two million Dollars a year. And they’re all in the USA. Those who invent things in other countries already speak English and are globalized. The danger lies in all that creativity and innovation being concentrated in only a handful of countries. 
Q Have you been pressured by any parties or interest groups to join them?
A It’s very clear to me that I won’t be getting into all that. During the elections in France I co-signed a letter speaking out against populism (referring to Marine Le Pen). But I want to stay apart from politics, whether on the left or right. [Tirole would not discuss Macron’s reform programme]. I can offer my advice privately, but not lend my support. I say this in the book: I don’t want to be someone who supports something. All I do is talk economics. My role is to explain. This is hard, because when you talk about the economy, if the Left and the Right are in disagreement they take it as your standing in favor of certain politicians. I don’t participate in these acts. I have my own values, like anybody else. I’m an Economist, and I’d like to remain in this position. 
Q Independent.
A Independent. It gives you more power. 
Q I believe I read in your book that the reason why developers bother with Open Source coding is that they are very selfish, and they are actually doing this to gain recognition and perhaps a job. 
A I don’t mean that they are selfish in that sense, but they respond to certain incentives. Most people are truly generous and want to work towards the Common Good. The other incentive is the opportunity to stand out, since these programmers sharing their code are usually quite good, and tend to be picked up by the likes of Google or Microsoft. That’s the kind of altruism I mean. And finally, the image. We all want other people to wee us as kind, generous, intelligent… We all respond to incentives.

708,"July 18, 2017",EU: Priceline wins approval for US$550m acquisition,"
Priceline Group Inc.’s US$550 million bid to buy rival online travel search site Momondo Group Ltd. got a green light July 17 from the EU’s Competition Commission (EC), which said the deal did not raise competitive concerns.
The EC unconditionally approved the deal, saying that the travel search companies’ operations are largely complementary and that the merged company will still face stiff competition from other big sites such as Skyscanner Ltd., Trivago NV, TripAdvisor Inc., and Google Inc.
Priceline announced the merger in February, proposing to fold Momondo’s metasearch capabilities into its existing Kayak unit.
The EU assessed the merger’s impact on metasearch sites in the European Economic Area. Travel metasearch sites allow travelers to search for and compare travel products using results from other search engines.
The EC “also examined a number of vertical relationships arising from the merging companies’ activities in the operation of metasearch sites and their activities in operating online travel agents downstream,” according to the EU’s statement on the deal.

709,"July 16, 2017",Japan: JFTC targeting dominance in data,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
Financial Times
By Robin Harding in Tokyo
Japan is considering tough new rules on handling data in an effort to head off digital monopolies, the country’s top competition regulator has said. In an interview with the Financial Times, Kazuyuki Sugimoto, head of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, said the issue of data was “crucial” for competition policy given the rise of digital groups such as Facebook, Google and Uber. A recent JFTC study group suggested blocking mergers that monopolise data; requiring changes in corporate privacy policies; banning digital platforms from collecting unnecessary customer data; and prosecuting companies that keep essential data from the competition.
Mr Sugimoto’s comments add to the global debate about how to tackle companies that gain market power by amassing data. The European Union recently hit Google with a €2.42bn antitrust fine for abusing its dominance in internet search. Google is disputing the finding.

710,"July 12, 2017",Philippines: Watchdog may probe garlic ‘cartel’,"
One strong indication of the presence of cartels is a sudden, irregular change in market prices, and this is what has gotten the chair of the Senate agriculture committee angry with respect to the supply and pricing of garlic.
According to Senator Cynthia Villar, prices have fluctuated sharply between May and June.
This time round, the antitrust watchdog may be brought in to investigate.
Economist Arsenio Balisacan, chairman of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), elaborated on the situation that has caused the alarm bells to be sounded by the senator.
“If there is a cartelistic arrangement or abuse of dominance in the market, ang mangyayari doon biglang tataas ang presyo, butover time bababa rin [what will happen is that prices will abruptly spike, but decline over time].”
For now, the agency will work on the national garlic development plan to increase local production.
That involves identifying more areas for growing garlic, to lessen the burden on Ilocos, Nueva Ecija and Mindoro, and improving productivity so farmers could plant more than once a year.

The Justice Department has been reviewing the case for eight months now, with executives deposed, rivals questioned and documents demanded.
But the nomination for the department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has been held up in a logjam in the Senate.
And then there is President Trump, who has been vocal about his opposition to the deal. Last week, The New York Times reported that members of the White House were discussing how they might use their perch over the merger review as leverage over CNN, which is owned by Time Warner.
The bid is still expected to be approved, and CNBC is reporting that the deal, which is expected to close by year end, could do so within 60 days.
It’s not just the companies involved that are in limbo — the rest of the business world is watching the regulatory process with intense interest to see how this Justice Department deals with antitrust matters — although the wait hasn’t stopped Verizon, for one, keeping an eye out for opportunities.

The Next Battle in Antitrust Will Be About Whether One Company Knows Everything About You
By Bala Iyer, Mohan Subramaniam & U. Srinivasa Rangan
Google’s battle with the European Union has come to a head. On June 27 this year the EU fined Google $2.7 billion for alleged monopolistic or unfair trade practices. Google has appealed and is now preparing its defense. The EU’s case asserts, among other things, that Google unfairly exploits its dominance in search engines and smartphone operating systems to restrict competition in shopping services, ad placement services, and smartphone app store markets. In an earlier article, two of us (Bala and Srinivasa) provided a context to understand the respective argument of the EU and Google using the lens of digital-age markets. We highlighted how antitrust, the underpinnings of which are based on industrial-age economic theories, needs new thinking in the digital age to ensure that antitrust policies continue to remain effective guardians of consumer welfare without inadvertently impeding economic progress.
But as important as today’s antitrust questions are, regulators shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger picture. The coming battle in antitrust will not be about controlling markets in the traditional sense. It will be about the battle for control over consumers’ information. The tech titans are currently in a race to see which of them can build a better digital replica of their consumers, which means finding a way to not just collect user data but also make it harder for competitors to do so. Tomorrow’s monopolies won’t be able to be measured just by how much they sell us. They’ll be based on how much they know about us and how much better they can predict our behavior than competitors.

Pricing Algorithms: Conscious Parallelism or Conscious Commitment? By Alex Okuliar and Elena Kamenir*
Edited by Koren W. Wong-Ervin and Rob Kwinter
Background
Headline after headline has proclaimed the demise of bricks-and-mortar retail and the rise of the online merchant. Recent studies show that 8 out of 10 Americans now shop online, with almost half of US adults shopping online either weekly or a few times a month.[1] The online retail environment, in addition to reshaping the physical retail landscape, also may be fundamentally changing merchant pricing behavior.  Using algorithms, competitors can now identify and “scrape” pricing information and pricing deviations. In particular, pricing algorithms—which are set by computers—can be programmed to react to certain programmed parameters (e.g., competitor pricing) in setting a price. The question for antitrust enforcers has become whether these programs can cross the line from benign conscious parallelism to something more.
The global enforcement community recently has taken notice of pricing algorithms and begun the debate over their antitrust implications. A background note by the OECD Secretariat, for example, states that “the increasing reliance of big online companies on secret algorithms poses a concern that the organization of the world’s information is, to some extent, controlled by automated systems in the hands of a few market players.”[2] One of the main concerns discussed in connection ...

714,"July 2, 2017",EU: Considers tough new competition powers,"
The EU’s competition watchdog is considering tough new powers to intervene earlier in antitrust problems in an effort to avoid the type of delays it faced in the Google investigation. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, told the Financial Times she was looking at broader powers to impose so-called interim measures, which order companies to cease suspected anti-competitive behaviour even before there is a formal finding of wrongdoing.
“The French have been very successful in doing interim measures for quite some time and that is, of course, of interest to us,” said the commissioner. A move by the European Commission to adopt such powers would give the world’s most active antitrust authority a much wider range of options to impose itself on dominant companies and shape behaviour in fast-moving markets such as the digital sector.
The commission at present must prove a company is causing “irrevocable harm” before imposing “interim measures” — a high threshold that means it is virtually impossible to use. “If you have a tool in the toolbox of interim measures then of course you should consider why is it that it’s never used,” said Mrs Vestager.
The commission is watching other jurisdictions to learn how to have a “more workable” tool. “To boil it down, it’s not being used because of the very, very high bar of irreparable harm,” she added. However, there were no concrete plans to change the rules just yet. She said the commission “had a lot of thinking to do” and was still trying to be “rather thorough than quick in this”.
Comparison shopping rivals had asked EU authorities to intervene to stop Google’s behaviour years ago, at a much earlier stage in the commission’s eight-year probe into the search giant.

US wireless carrier Sprint is in talks with Charter Communications and Comcast about a partnership to boost the two US cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with US wireless peer T-Mobile US on hold until the end of July, the sources said on Monday.
A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent.
Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications, the largest US telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011.
Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added.

716,"June 26, 2017",EU: Court ruling on Intel antitrust case next year says judge,"
Europe’s top court is likely to rule on Intel’s appeal against a record 1.06 billion euro (US$1.19 billion) EU antitrust fine next year, an EU judge said on Monday, a case that may affect companies such as Google and Qualcomm also in the EU’s crosshairs.
The European Commission hit Intel with the record penalty seven years ago, accusing it of trying to stifle rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.
The US chipmaker subsequently challenged the decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second highest.
Judges rejected its arguments in 2014, saying the Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the sanction amounting to 4.15% of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10%. The company then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
“I expect a judgment sometime next year,” Marc van der Woude, vice-president at the General Court, told a competition conference organized by Concurrence.
Intel got a boost last year when European Court of Justice court adviser Nils Wahl questioned whether the company’s actions had really harmed competition. The court follows such recommendations in four out of five cases.

717,"June 19, 2017","EEUU: Uber, investigado por FTC","
Uber, la revolucionaria empresa de transporte de pasajeros basada en línea, se encuentra bajo investigación por la Comisión Federal de Comercio (FTC) por posibles violaciones a la privacidad .
Actualmente se desconoce exactamente qué ha llamado el interés de los investigadores de la FTC. Algunas especulaciones adelantan que el tema podría relacionarse al uso, por parte de algunos empleados, de la herramienta llamada ”visión de Dios”, la cual habría permitido rastrear la ubicación de ciertos políticos y celebridades.
La versión concuerda con una tendencia reciente en la FTC, la cual ha prestado más atención a temas de privacidad en empresas tecnológicas. Google llegó a un acuerdo con la FTC en 2012 relacionado con el seguimiento no divulgado en Safari, en el que la compañía accedió a pagar $22.5 millones de dólares. En 2011, Facebook aceptó 20 años de auditorías de privacidad después de que la agencia alegara que la compañía no había seguido sus propias políticas de privacidad.
No se sabe en qué etapa se encuentra la investigación sobre Uber y podría desaparecer sin que se presenten cargos. Las investigaciones de la FTC por lo general se mantienen en secreto. Incluso si no hay cargos, una investigación de la FTC puede ser un proceso doloroso y tardado, lo cual podría representar un problema para Uber, quien ya se encuentra lidiando con problemas en distintas partes del mundo.

718,"June 16, 2017",US: Amazon to Acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 Billion,"
Amazon.com will acquire Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion, a bombshell of a deal that catapults the e-commerce giant into hundreds of physical stores and fulfills a long-held goal of selling more groceries.
Amazon agreed to pay $42 a share in cash for the organic-food chain, including debt, a roughly 27 percent premium to the stock price at Thursday’s close. John Mackey, Whole Foods’ outspoken co-founder, will continue to run the business — a victory after a fight with activist investor Jana Partners that threatened to drive him from power.
The deal sends shockwaves across both the online and brick-and-mortar industries. Grocery chains plunged on Friday — Wal-Mart Stores fell as much as 7.1 percent, while Kroger tumbled 17 percent — as investors worried that woes will mount in the increasingly cutthroat industry. Amazon and Whole Foods weren’t always seen as obvious partners, but Mackey has been under pressure to find an acquirer after Jana disclosed a more than 8 percent stake and began pushing for a buyout. That prodding irked Mackey, who has referred to Whole Foods as his “baby” and to Jana as “greedy bastards.”

719,"June 15, 2017",US: Uber under FTC investigation,"
Adding to the embattled ride-hailing company’s troubles, Uber is now reportedly under investigation for privacy violations by the Federal Trade Commission.
Currently it’s purely speculation exactly what has the FTC investigators interested in Uber, which was reported Thursday by Recode. The site speculated that it could be the employees’ use of “god view,” a tool that was used by some Uber employees to track the locations of some politicians and celebrities.
That would be in keeping with a trend at the FTC, which has been paying more attention to the privacy practices of tech companies in recent years. Google reached an agreement with the FTC in 2012 related to undisclosed tracking in Safari, in which the company agreed to pay $22.5 million. In 2011, Facebook agreed to 20 years of privacy audits after the FTC alleged the company hadn’t followed its own privacy policies.
It’s unknown what stage the Uber investigation is at, and it could well go away without any charges being filed. FTC investigations are usually kept under wraps, but Recode says it has spoken to four different sources “familiar with the matter.”
Even if there are no charges, an FTC inquiry is an expensive, time-consuming headache for any company, and Uber is already dealing with a lot of problems.

Foxconn has lined up several high-profile US technology firms to join its bid for Toshiba’s memory chip unit.
Apple and Dell are among the firms involved in the consortium, said Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou.
Foxconn, the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer, makes the iPhone for Apple.
Mr Gou said Amazon could also come on board, while talks continued with Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
It was not clear how much Foxconn planned to offer for the division, which analysts have valued at about US$18bn.
Earlier this year it was reported that Foxconn could offer as much as US$27bn for the unit. It was not clear why the potential bid was so much higher than its mooted value.
Toshiba is selling some or all of its chip unit to cover huge losses in its nuclear division, Westinghouse Electric, which has filed for bankruptcy.
It was the latest headache for the Japanese conglomerate. In 2015, Toshiba’s chief executive resigned after the firm said it had overstated profits for years. It is also set to post another annual loss.

Whether “Big Data” Could Facilitate Monopoly in the Platform Economy and How We Shall Step In – By Susan Ning, Han Wu & Yangdi Zhao
(King & Wood Mallesons, Beijing)
“Big Data”, one of the hot topics in recent years, has been widely discussed. The impact of “Big Data” on competition interests both practitioners and scholars. The major concern from antitrust perspective is whether “Big Data” could facility monopoly, especially in the platform economy where data could be easily accessed or collected by platforms from multiple sides of the market. The purpose of this article is to review the role of data in different stages of platform development and analyze the possibility of monopoly based on the interplay between data and platforms. We will also discuss when and how authorities should intervene with the anti-competitive behaviors in the platform economy driven by “Big Data” in different scenarios. 

General introduction of recent discussion about whether “Big Data” will facilitate monopoly

In the digital age, the volume and variety of data generated on a daily basis is growing at an unprecedented rate, so is companies’ ability to analyze and exploit it. The innovative application and exploitation of data is of immense value to businesses. This gives rise to concerns that the control of vast amounts of data gives such businesses enormous power.  As observed ...

722,"June 7, 2017",US: Judge orders Uber to hand over acquisition report of Levandowski startup,"
Uber has lost two key battles in its trade-secret litigation with Waymo, Google’s self-driving car spinoff.
First, a magistrate judge has ruled that Uber must hand over the due diligence report related to its $680 million acquisition of self-driving car startup Otto. Uber had been trying to keep that report secret by claiming attorney-client privilege.
US District Judge William Alsup also shot down a motion by Uber to put the litigation on hold while the company appeals Alsup’s decision that the case can’t be moved into arbitration.
Waymo has “a right to get to trial on October 2, and you’re doing everything you can to throw roadblocks in their way,” Alsup told Uber lawyers, according to reports on the hearing in The Recorder.
Alsup also refused to modify his order that pushed Uber to fire Anthony Levandowski, who headed up it’s self-driving car project. Levandowski’s lawyers argued in court that the order went too far in commanding Uber to do everything in its power to coerce the company’s employee.
“I’m not taking back a single word” of the order, Alsup responded.

723,"June 6, 2017",EU: Guess probed over distribution,"
Guess? faces a formal European Union antitrust investigation over suspicions the clothing manufacturer and retailer may be thwarting cross-border sales to potential consumers.
The European Commission will examine Guess’ distribution agreements and practices to determine whether they violate EU competition rules that allow consumers in the bloc to purchase from any retailer authorized by a manufacturer, including across national borders.
“One of the key benefits of the EU’s single market is that consumers can shop around for a better deal,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Tuesday in an emailed statement. Officials will check Guess is “playing by the rules and not preventing consumers from buying products across borders.”
The EU said that while the Guess probe is separate from a sweeping probe into online sales inquiry finalized last month, the case “follows up” on one of the issues identified. The digital economy is a focus for Vestager, who is investigating Alphabet’s Google over an online shopping search tool, phone software and advertising.

724,"June 5, 2017","US:  Apple, Amazon to Join Foxconn’s Toshiba Bid","
Apple and Amazon will pony up to pay a portion of contract manufacturer Foxconn’s bid to acquire Toshiba’s semiconductor business as the consumer electronics powerhouses move to secure a steady supply of NAND flash memory, Foxconn’s cheif executive told the Nikkei news service.
Apple and Amazon’s names have surfaced before in connection with a possible bid to buy the chip unit, which Toshiba is selling to help offset massive losses incurred by its nuclear power business in the U.S. In March, Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Apple, Google and Amazon all three their hats in the ring as potential suitors.
Apple and Amazon are dependent on NAND flash memory for their consumer electronics offerings, including iPhone, iPad and the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo. Many of these products are built by Foxconn. Last week, market research firm DRAMeXchange reported that contract prices for NAND rose 20 to 25 percent in the first quarter, stabilizing the price of NAND in what is traditionally a slower time of year for memory chip sales.
Foxconn reportedly bid more than $27 billion, more than any other bidder is thought to have offered, to acquire the semiconductor business of Toshiba, which is second in NAND sales worldwide behind Samsung. However, Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan and has a large number of manufacturing facilities in China, is considered a longshot to land the asset because the Japanese government is wary of giving China access to Toshiba’s NAND technology.
Speculation has been that the participation of Apple and Amazon could give weight and credibility to the Foxconn bid, perhaps enough to soften concerns about China.

725,"May 23, 2017",US: Supreme Court makes it much harder for patent trolls,"
The US Supreme Court handed down a ruling Monday that’s going to make life much harder for so-called “patent trolls” and will have significant implications for patent-rich Silicon Valley companies.
In a unanimous decision in the case TC Heartland v. Kraft Food Group Brands, the high court overturned a longstanding precedent that gave plaintiffs in patent cases latitude over where they filed their cases. Now patent suits can only be filed in courts located in the jurisdiction where the defendant company is incorporated.
Patent assertion entities, more commonly known as patent trolls, get nearly all their revenue from buying patent licenses and then suing other companies for infringement and damages. More times than not, they file their suits in the Eastern District of Texas. In fact, more than 35 percent of all patent lawsuits in the US are filed in the Texas district, known for large awards to patent plaintiffs.
Trolls will no longer be able to shop around for a sympathetic venue, which is good news for common patent suit targets like Apple and Alphabet’s Google.

Problematic Aspects of the Japan Fair Trade Commission’s Proposed Distribution Guidelines – By Koren W. Wong-Ervin* (Global Antitrust Institute) 
In April 2017, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) released its proposed revisions to its Guidelines Concerning Distribution Systems and Business Practices Under the Antimonopoly Act (Draft Guidelines). While the Draft Guidelines appropriately recognize that vertical restraints may have either pro- or anticompetitive effects, there are a number of troubling aspects, which were identified by the Global Antitrust Institute (GAI) at Scalia Law School at George Mason University in its comment to the agency.[1] These include:

Presumptions of illegality for conduct such as minimum resale price maintenance (RPM);
Failure to require proof of actual anticompetitive effects while requiring proof of actual procompetitive benefits;
Failure to require substantial but-for foreclosure, which includes an analysis of the counterfactual world to identify the difference between the percentage share of distribution foreclosed by the allegedly exclusionary agreements or conduct and the share of distribution in the absence of such an agreement;
Vague and ambiguous standards for unfair trade practice liability, for example, prohibiting unilateral refusals to deal that “tend to make it difficult for the refused competitor to carry on normal business activities...

727,"May 10, 2017",EU: EC publishes final e-commerce report,"
The European Commission’s final report on the e-commerce sector inquiry identifies business practices that may restrict competition. It allows the Commission to target its enforcement of EU antitrust rules in e-commerce markets and has already prompted companies to review their practices.
Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: “Certain practices by companies in e-commerce markets may restrict competition by unduly limiting how products are distributed throughout the EU. Our report confirms that. These restrictions could limit consumer choice and prevent lower prices online. At the same time, we find that there is a need to balance the interests of both online and ‘brick-and-mortar’ retailers. All to the benefit of consumers. Our findings help us to target the enforcement of EU competition rules in e-commerce markets”.
One of the main goals of the Commission’s Digital Single Market strategy is to ensure better access for consumers and businesses to goods and services. The e-commerce sector inquiry complements the Commission’s legislative proposals in this regard. The objective of the sector inquiry was to allow the Commission to identify possible competition concerns in European e-commerce markets.
The report published Wednesday presents the Commission’s definitive findings, taking account of comments received on the preliminary report of September 2016 and confirming to a large extent the preliminary report’s conclusions.

728,"May 10, 2017",US: Antitrust nominee addresses antitrust enforcement abroad,"
Makan Delrahim, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, spoke Wednesday about the need to change how antitrust laws are enforced abroad.
In an abbreviated confirmation hearing shared with two other Justice Department nominees, Delrahim pointed to his prior experience heading up international antitrust applications in the department during the George W. Bush administration. Asked by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who chairs a subcommittee on antitrust issues, what he would do differently in his role, Delrahim said he would focus on stopping US companies operating abroad from being treated unfairly.
That approach could benefit companies like Apple and Google, which the European Union is targeting for what it calls anti-competitive behavior.
Delrahim has the support of some former Obama administration officials.
“What we have seen is that there are certain foreign competition authorities that are using the antitrust laws to advance protectionist agendas and policies,” said Jim Tierney, former chief of the DOJ’s Networks and Technology Enforcement Section. “That’s a misuse of the antitrust laws, especially where they use the merger context to force companies to give up intellectual property rights.”

729,"May 7, 2017",EU: Complaint filed over data “gatekeepers”,"
In a letter sent to the European Union’s antitrust body, the chief executives of Spotify, streaming music firm Deezer, startup investor Rocket Internet and other Europe-based companies claim dominant internet platforms”  can and do abuse their privileged position,” reports the Financial Times.
The European companies complain some mobile operating systems, app stores and search engines abuse their commanding marketshare to act as “gatekeepers” to consumer choice, thus impeding segment rivals attempting to market products that compete with first-party services, the letter says.
While not named in the letter, Apple and Google are clearly targets of the complaint. Together, Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android control more than 90 percent of the mobile operating system market and maintain a set of terms and conditions that third-party apps must follow in order to market their wares on the respective app stores.
In particular, internet companies argue they are not able to access analytics data when customers sign up for service through app store portals. Further, app store owners allegedly promote their own products ahead of third-party offerings. For example, Apple often publishes App Store banners advertising Apple Music, a competitor to Spotify and Deezer.

How Your Digital Helper May Undermine Your Welfare, and Our Democracy
By Maurice E. Stucke (University of Tennessee) & Ariel Ezrachi (University of Oxford)
Abstract:         “All you need to do is say,” a recent article proclaimed, “’I want a beer’ and Alexa will oblige. The future is now.” Advances in technology have seemingly increased our choices and opened markets to competition. As we migrate from brick-and-mortar shops to online commerce, we seemingly are getting more of what we desire at better prices and quality. And yet, behind the competitive façade, a more complex reality exists. We explore in our book “Virtual Competition” several emerging threats, namely algorithmic collusion, behavioural discrimination and abuses by dominant super-platforms. But the harm is not just economic. The potential anticompetitive consequences go beyond our pocketbooks. The toll will likely be on our privacy, well-being and democracy.
To see why, this Essay examines the emerging frontier of digital personal assistants. These helpers are being developed by the leading online platforms: Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, Facebook’s M, and Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo. These super-platforms are heavily investing to improve their offerings. For those of us who grew up watching The Jetsons, the prospect of our own personal helper might seem marvelous. And yet, despite their promise, can personalized digital assistants actually reduce our welfare? Might their rise reduce the number of gateways to the digital world, increase the market power of a few firms, and limit competition? And if so, what are the potential social, political, and economic concerns?
Our Essay seeks to address these questions. We show how network effects, big data and big analytics will likely undermine attempts to curtail a digital assistant’s power, and will likely allow it to operate below the regulatory and antitrust radar screens. As a result, rather than advance our overall welfare, these digital assistants – if left to their own devices – can undermine our welfare.

Makan Delrahim Trump’s selection for the post, previously spent years working at a Washington, DC, where his legal and lobbying clients included such companies as AT&T, Comcast, Google and Qualcomm, according to federal records.

Recently Delrahim’s previous work has triggered renewed scrutiny as he seeks to lead antitrust at the Justice Department, a gig that requires confirmation by the US Senate. The top Democrat on the chamber’s leading antitrust committee, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, said in a statement to Recode that she would push Delrahim to sit out of investigations that overlap with his past clients.
During his testimony, Klobuchar said she would “ask [Delrahim] if he will recuse himself from matters related to his prior employment, as required.

732,"April 6, 2017",US: Ajit Pai and Ohlhausen say broadband market too competitive for strict privacy rules,"
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission today argued that strict privacy rules for ISPs aren’t necessary in part because the broadband market is more competitive than the search engine market.
An op-ed written by Pai and Acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen seem to ignore the lack of competition in home Internet service, focusing only on the competitive wireless broadband market. Because of this competition, it isn’t fair to impose different rules on ISPs than on websites, they wrote.
“Others argue that ISPs should be treated differently because consumers face a unique lack of choice and competition in the broadband marketplace,” Pai and Ohlhausen wrote in their op-ed for The Washington Post yesterday. “But that claim doesn’t hold up to scrutiny either. For example, according to one industry analysis, Google dominates desktop search with an estimated 81 percent market share (and 96 percent of the mobile search market), whereas Verizon, the largest mobile broadband provider, holds only an estimated 35 percent of its market.”

Posted by The Economist
Here we go again. Will the computer industry ever escape its antitrust problems?
“This antitrust thing will blow over.” Thus Bill Gates, then the boss of Microsoft, a decade ago as regulators launched an action against his company. The chiefs at other big technology firms, even if they were not quite so outspoken, doubtless held similar views when their companies were targeted by trustbusters. It was wishful thinking then, and remains so today, as long-running antitrust actions flare up again and regulators ponder new moves against the industry’s giants.
Perhaps as soon as next week the European Commission will issue its long-awaited decision in the case against Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker. It is expected to impose a whopping fine of at least €1 billion ($1.3 billion). In early June Microsoft will defend itself in a hearing in Brussels against accusations that it illegally bundled its web browser with its Windows operating system—the very practice that got the software company into trouble in the late 1990s. IBM, the target of trustbusters since the 1950s, faces a new antitrust complaint. And Google, the industry’s newest giant, is also coming under closer scrutiny. On April 29th it emerged that America’s Justice Department is examining whether Google’s settlement with authors and publishers over its book-search service violates antitrust laws; and on May 5th the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe to see whether Google’s sharing of two board members with Apple reduces competition between the two firms.
The computer industry makes more antitrust headlines than others, and seems unlikely to shake off these problems, for three reasons. The first is that technology heavyweights are often dominant in their respective markets. Ask any of the bosses of these firms why they are so dominant and they will probably respond that it is a result of billions spent on research and development. But they also operate in markets that allow a winner to take all (or most). Mainframes and operating systems benefit from strong network effects: the more applications run on them, for instance, the more users they attract, which encourages programmers to write more applications for them. With microprocessors, ever-increasing capital requirements mean only the biggest firms can afford to build their own factories. The markets for search and online advertising exhibit similar effects: the bigger a firm’s market share, the greater its ability to attract advertisers, thus bringing in the money to build ever bigger data centres. In each case it is difficult for an upstart to break in.

734,"April 5, 2017","Australia: ACCC Apple Pay decision prevents customer choice, says Westpac","
Westpac disagrees with the competition regulator’s recent decision to deny CBA, Westpac and NABs request to collectively negotiate with Apple over Apple Pay.
Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) denied an application by NAB, CBA and Westpac to collectively negotiate with Apple over access to Apple Pay and the NFC contactless payments features on iPhones. This means that the banks cannot offer their own digital wallets on the iPhone.
Prior to the decision George Frazis, CEO of Westpac consumer bank, had downplayed the banks battle over Apple Pay, and implied it was not worried by the ACCC’s impending decision.
However Frazis backtracked at the AFR 2017 Banking and Wealth Summit where he revealed just how much the bank wants to be able to offer Apple Pay to its customers.
“We want to be able to offer Apple Pay to our customers. If you think about what we’re arguing, it’s really for customer choice. They (the customers) have purchased this iPhone and effectively what Apple is doing is barring the NFC chip from any other application that you may want to put on when it comes to wallet,” Frazis said.
“It’s essentially like barring the GPS on the iPhone to Google Maps and you have to use Apple Maps, and I tell you what you’d have a whole lot of customers that are not too happy about it.”

735,"March 30, 2017",Australia: ACCC says final “no” to banks in Apple Pay spat,"
The competition regulator has rejected an application by the banks to collectively negotiate with technology giant Apple over access to the iPhone’s “near field communication” controller.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank had asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for permission to form a block in order to give them more negotiating power in discussions that would have asked Apple open the NFC to their own digital wallets. Apple has not made such a move for any bank in the world.
But ACCC chairman Rod Sims said on Friday: “We are concerned that the proposed conduct is likely to reduce or distort competition in a number of markets.”
The ACCC said if the banks were to get access to the NFC, it could reduce competition between Apple and Google’s Android phones, could reduce competition for payments devices other than smartphones, and could reduce the competitive tension between the banks in the supply of payment cards.
The ruling is particularly significant because, despite the popularity of phones running on Google’s Android operating system, Apple is by far the largest single supplier of phones in Australia.
The banks want their own digital wallets to access the NFC to enable contactless payments to be made through them. Apple only allows its digital wallet to access the NFC. But the banks have refused to do a commercial deal with Apple, effectively locking three-quarters of Australia’s card holders out of Apple Pay. The decision s each of the applicant banks will have to negotiate bilaterally with Apple if they want to provide Apple Pay to their millions of customers.

Book introduction: Antitrust law in the new economy
By Mark R. Patterson (Fordham University)
Abstract:      Markets run on information. Buyers make decisions by relying on information about the products available, and sellers decide what to produce based on information about what buyers want. But the ways in which this market information is acquired has changed, as consumers increasingly turn to sources that act as intermediaries for information — companies like Yelp and Google. In addition, various sorts of informational standards and certifications are playing a greater role in determining what goods sellers produce; the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, for example, can be seen as such a standard.
Antitrust Law in the New Economy considers a range of competition problems that involve information in the marketplace. Sellers sometimes have the ability and motivation to distort the truth about their products when they make data available to intermediaries like Google and Yelp. The intermediaries themselves, in turn, may have their own incentives to skew the information they provide to buyers, both to benefit advertisers and to gain advantages over their competition. And sellers that agree on product standards may do so in circumstances in which the standards merely eliminate competition or may adopt standard-setting processes that do not prevent manipulation by individual sellers.
Broadly speaking, competitive harm in these instances arises primarily from the production of low-quality information. Yet consumer protection law is poorly suited to addressing the issues because the relevant information is often neither advertising nor “false” or “misleading.” Instead, the problems are better characterized as forms of exclusion or collusion in information markets. Those forms of conduct are normally addressed by antitrust law, though antitrust law has not traditionally focused on such conduct in these informational contexts. However, by treating information markets — markets for Google search results, Yelp reviews, and LIBOR rates — as markets that are themselves proper subjects of antitrust scrutiny, antitrust law can be adapted to these problems.
The book discusses a range of ways in which antitrust can be applied to the manipulation of information for competitive advantage and the exploitation of consumers, and it considers related informational issues such as “confusopoly” and sellers’ use of consumers’ personal information. It also addresses how intellectual property law and legal protections for freedom of speech can limit the application of antitrust law. The goal of the book is to show that just as antitrust law serves to prevent anticompetitive conduct that results in supracompetitive prices, it can also prevent competitive harm from low-quality information.

By Tim Wu (Columbia University)
Abstract:     Human attention is a resource. An increasingly large and important sector of the economy, including firms such as Google, Facebook, Snap, along with parts of the traditional media, currently depend on attentional markets for their revenue. Their business model, however, present a challenge for laws premised on the presumption of cash markets. This paper introduces a novel economic and legal analysis of attention markets centered on the “attention broker,” the firms that attract and resell attention to advertisers.
The analysis has important payouts for two areas: antitrust analysis, and in particular the oversight of mergers in high technology markets, as well as the protection of the captive audiences from so-called “attentional theft.”

Will antitrust regulators please stand up — Apple’s free pass
By Nicolas Petit
Last week, Russia’s competition authority said that Apple colluded with resellers to fix the price of its iPhone. This unprecedented decision closes a long period of antitrust leniency towards the giant iPhone maker. And it also puts front and center the question of Apple’s industry dominance. According to every metric, Apple indeed appears to be a textbook monopoly. And yet, many antitrust eyes still seem unable to see it.
Let’s take a closer look, and pierce the veil of antitrust forbearance: year after year, Apple sits atop the rankings as the most successful company of the 21st century. It has been the world’s largest company by market capitalization for some time. It is also the most profitable company in the history of the modern economy. Its flagship product, the iPhone, is the most expensive mass-market smartphone ever sold. On each device, Apple’s earns a 69% gross margin. Last year, industry analysts were taken aback when Apple outsold Samsung.
Granted, high prices and large profits do not a monopolist make. So let us consider other metrics: amongst Tech’s frightful five, Apple is the slacker when it comes to investing in innovation. It spends less than 3.3% of its revenue on research and development. By way of comparison, Google, Microsoft and Facebook devote around 15%. In 2016, Apple did not even feature in the EU ranking of the top 50 highest R&D-intensive companies, trailing behind a host of less glitzy manufacturers of telecoms infrastructure equipment like Nokia and Ericsson and even of mundane suppliers of cars, chemicals, and agricultural products. At such low levels of R&D investment, it is even questionable that Apple can be called a “high tech” company (the minimum to be part of that league is 5–7.5%).
Apple also features as the world champ dividender in financial analysts’ recommendations. Instead of retaining earnings to devote to internal R&D projects as a patient capitalist, Apple returns comparatively more profits to shareholders than any of its peers. It also sits atop a mountain of unproductive capital.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is poised to fine US technology giant Google in the coming months for using its algorithm to unfairly demote rival shopping services in internet search results, said she was vigilant to such illegal practices.

She pointed to the challenge of tackling sophisticated cartels which use software to fix prices and allocate markets among themselves to the detriment of customers and the economy, saying sanctions should reflect and deter this new tool used by companies.

741,"February 23, 2017",US: Companies lobby for FTC choice that can take-on tech giants,"
Companies with past issues with Google believe President Trump should nominate Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes to be the next chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. The Wall Street Journal reported that a number of companies and interest groups have waged behind-the-scenes lobbying campaigns over who will chair the Federal Trade Commission
Reyes, a rising star in politics with a record of success as Utah’s attorney general, has proven to have strong ethics and would serve well. Looking at his record of achievement and resume indicates that Reyes would have an easy time being confirmed as the new chairman of the FTC.
Currently, the FTC is led by Acting Chair Maureen K. Ohlhausen who has been on the commission since April of 2012. Reyes has an impressive resume. He graduated summa cum laude from Brigham Young University and earned his law degree with honors from U.C. Berkeley in 1997. He then practiced law for 14 years as a partner at Parsons Behle & Latimer, the largest law firm in the State of Utah. When he ran, Attorney General Reyes secured over 60 percent of the vote in 2014.
According the article, Reyes makes the tech giant Google a little nervous. Reyes has stated he would like to see the FTC reopen the case against Google for anti-competitive behavior. The case stems from claims that Google improperly pressured mobile phone makers to install Google Apps on their phones. Under the Obama administration the Google investigation was swept under the rug and closed in 2013.

742,"February 16, 2017",US: Does the merger of Essilor and Luxottica matter?,"
In a $49 billion deal, Italian frames manufacturer Luxottica and French lens manufacturer Essilor announced that they will join up, EssilorLuxottica, that will be co-run by both groups.
BBC’s Ian Pollock writes that this largely uncommented deal should be a matter of more interest than its received.
These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France’s Essilor is the world’s number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy’s Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.
It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.
“The parties’ activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,” says Essilor.
There is some concern that if the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.

It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician’s shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.

743,"January 31, 2017","US: Amazon, Expedia, GitHub back lawsuit against Trump immigration bans","
On Monday Amazon and Expedia filed declarations of support for Washington state’s lawsuit against Trump’s executive order. This executive order things temporarily bans immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. There is also a tech industry meeting set for Tuesday to explore filing an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit against the bans.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told his employees in an email Monday that the company is also exploring other legal options, and that it is seeking to work with Congress on legislative action, according to several media reports.
“This executive order is one we do not support,” Bezos wrote. He said the United States is known for “harnessing” immigrants’ talents and that it’s “a distinctive competitive advantage for our country.” He ended the email by saying that affected employees — at least a few dozen, according to the company’s filing — should know that “the full extent of Amazon’s resources are behind you.”
Travel site Expedia also stressed that the ban could hurt its business.
Meanwhile, Github was organising a meeting of tech companies Tuesday to discuss how the industry can lend its legal support to a lawsuit against the bans, although it’s unclear which lawsuit that would be. Among those invited are Google, Netflix, Salesforce, Airbnb and SpaceX.

744,"January 30, 2017",Germany: WhatsApp sued by consumer watchdog,"
A German consumer group has sued Facebook’s WhatsApp in a Berlin court over clauses that allow the messaging service to collect and transfer user data between the platforms.
The suit is challenging the privacy terms WhatsApp changed in August, which allow for transferring some data to Facebook’s social network, VZBV said in a statement on Monday.
Each consumer must be able to decide on his own which personal data is revealed and how it is used, the group said.
“Our experts brought the misconduct to light. Now we’ll meet in court,” VZBV said. “Be it Facebook, Google, Amazon or now WhatsApp: we target violations.”
WhatsApp’s data rules have triggered a wave of concerns by European regulators.
The bloc’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, is now probing Menlo Park, California-based Facebook for possibly supplying “incorrect or misleading information” about how it planned to use customer data when it filed for approval to acquire WhatsApp.
German’s antitrust regulator is also probing the data transfer issue.
WhatsApp said in an e-mailed statement that its privacy policy and terms updates comply with the law and they give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, enabling them to chose how data is used.

745,"January 30, 2017",EEUU: Peter Thiel liderará búsqueda de equipo de competencia de Trump,"
El multimillonario inversionista Peter Thiel ha sido revelado como consejero para la administración del presidente Donald Trump, encargado de buscar candidatos para tomar los dos puestos más importantes para la aplicación de las leyes de competencia en EEUU.
Thiel se entrevistará con candidatos para el puesto de Director de la Comisión Federal de Comercio (FTC) y para el jefe del departamento de competencia en el Departamento de Justicia (DOJ). Maureen Ohlhausen, comisionada actual de la FTC, ha sido nombrada directora interina mientras se concreta la búsqueda de nuevos candidatos.
Joshua Wright, ex-comisionado de la agencia, ha sido considerado como el ‘favorito’ de Google para el puesto, aunque los reportes preliminares indican que se retiraría de la contienda. Sean Reyes, fiscal del estado de Utah, también es considerado un fuerte contrincante – una mala noticia para Google, pues Reyes es autor de una misiva a la FTC pidiendo a la agencia que reconsiderase abrir de nuevo un caso por abuso de monopolio contra Google.
El reto de Thiel será encontrar a candidatos Republicanos que no tomen una posición de libertarismo y que estén dispuestos a apoyar la visión de Trump en temas de competencia. Aunque Trump no ha revelado su opinión al respecto, durante la campaña utilizó frecuentemente la imagen de un régimen de competencia activo. Los intelectuales del libertarismo suelen considerar que el mercado puede regularse por si mismo – lo cual pone a Trump, una figura con una posición anti-monopolios considerable, en una situación difícil de navegar.
En el pasado, Thiel ha declarado estar a favor de los monopolios cuando el poder de mercado dominante ofrece a las empresas la capacidad para invertir e innovar. “Hay solo una cosa que puede permitir a los negocios trascender la brutal lucha diaria por la supervivencia: las ganancias de un monopolio” declaró en su libro, ‘Zero to One’.

746,"January 29, 2017",EU: Antitrust chief says fences hurt economies,"
Building fences and barriers will hurt economies and drive up prices, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Friday, days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to erect a wall on the southern US border with Mexico.
People who put their faith in fences instead of open markets are going about it the wrong way, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a conference in Copenhagen.
“Those defenses will not help. They’ll only weaken our economies and increase prices for consumers, without giving people any more control over their own lives,” she said, without referring to Trump directly.
“But when people have the sense that markets aren’t listening to their needs, then we shouldn’t be surprised if they start to look for radical alternatives.”
Vestager riled the previous US administration when she ordered iPhone maker Apple (AAPL.O) to pay up to 13 billion euros ($13.9 billion) in back taxes to Ireland last year because its tax deal was considered illegal state aid.
She is also investigating other major US companies, such as Internet search giant Google and mobile chipset maker Qualcomm, with both companies facing potential sanctions this year for alleged breaches of EU antitrust rules.

747,"January 26, 2017",US: Peter Thiel is leading the search for Trump Administration Antitrust Officials,"
Buzzfeed news is reporting that billionaire venture capitalist Pete Thiel will be heading up the Trump administration’s search for the nation’s two top antitrust enforcement jobs, according to two unnamed sources.
Thiel is vetting candidates for chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission and antitrust chief at the Department of Justice. Currently Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican FTC commission member, has been appointed acting chairwoman by the president, but the search for a permanent chairperson is ongoing.
Google favorite Joshua Wright, a former commissioner at the agency, is seen as Google’s favorite for the job — though early reports indicate that he is already out of the running. Sean Reyes, the Utah attorney general, is considered a leading contender – which is less good news for Google, since Reyes last year co-wrote a letter to the FTC asking the agency to consider reopening an antitrust case against Google that it has previously been closed.
Thiel’s challenge, according to the sources, is finding Republicans who are not as libertarian and who are willing to take a Trump-like approach to anti-trust. Though President Trump has no officially released position on the matter, during the campaign he described an active antitrust enforcement regime. Libertarians generally perceive that companies should be left alone — making a potentially robust antitrust position out of President Trump a bit difficult to navigate.
Plus, Thiel has been known to praise monopolies when he believes that dominant market power can give companies the ability to both invest and innovate more.
“Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits,” he wrote in his book Zero to One.

748,"January 26, 2017",US: Billionaire Thiel is leading the search for Trump’s antitrust officials,"
A leading Facebook board member and billionaire is now helping the Trump administration’s search to fill the government’s two top antitrust  vacancies, Buzzfeeed reported.
Thiel has argued that monopolies can be good if they are not “illegal bullies or government favorites” but rather “the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.” His singles out Google, which was the subject of an FTC antitrust investigation that closed in 2013.
Thiel is reported by Buzzfeed News to be helping Trump choose the next head of the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust chief at the Department of Justice.
One candidate to lead the FTC, Joshua Wright, a former commissioner at the agency. Joshua Wright, a conservative law professor who heads President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team for the Federal Trade Commission, is under consideration to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, two people with knowledge of the deliberations said. Others may also still be in the running.
The post would give Wright oversight of corporate mergers. A Republican who served as an FTC commissioner from 2013 to 2015, Wright promotes a laissez-faire approach to antitrust enforcement and has been outspoken about how consolidation can benefit consumers. He’s also a strong advocate for using economic analysis to inform enforcement decisions.
It is speculated that another leading contender to chair the FTC is Sean Reyes, the Utah attorney general, according to the Buzzfeed. Reyes co-wrote a letter to the FTC asking the agency to consider reopening an antitrust case against Google that it had closed without bringing charges.
It is said one challenge for Thiel will be finding candidates who are Republican and yet willing to diverge from the libertarian position that the government should basically leave companies alone. Trump’s campaign rhetoric suggested he would favor candidates who envision an active role for antitrust enforcement, and Thiel’s search has reflected that, Buzzfeed said.

749,"January 17, 2017","Android, iOS And Market Power – What Does Mobile Platform Competition Really Look Like?","
By Jakob Kucharczyk –
The European Commission’s competition investigation into Google’s Android mobile operating system (“OS”) has raised a lot of attention and commentary. So far most comments focused on the “abuse” part of that investigation. While the issue of “abuse” is arguably the more interesting part in most Article 102 cases, the finding of a dominant position is worth a broader discussion in the Android investigation. That is because it reveals a lot on how the Commission views the competitive dynamics in the mobile OS space. This article discusses this issue and explains how large market share is not a reliable proxy for market power.

750,"January 16, 2017",UE: Comisión propone nuevas reglas de privacidad,"
La Comisión Europea (EC) ha anunciado que buscará nuevas reglas para controlar el universo cibernético, buscando llevar a servicios como Facebook, Whatsapp, Google y otros a niveles de privacidad similares a aquellos impuestos a la industria de las telecomunicaciones.
Actualmente, los servicios electrónicos y programas de comunicación no se ven obligados a seguir las mismas reglas de privacidad que se aplican a operadores tradicionales. Sin embargo, la EC considera que esto debería cambiar. En caso de ser aprobada la propuesta, la Directiva Europea de Privacidad Electrónica (ePrivacy Directive) afectaría los servicios de aplicaciones incluyendo a Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Messenger, Gmail de Google y iMessage de Apple.
Además, la EC también buscaría implementar nuevas reglas en cuanto al uso de ‘cookies’, buscando llevar el manejo de éstos fragmentos de código de una manera más sencilla, evitando a los usuarios el actual bombardeo constante de solicitudes de acceso. La EC asegura que las nuevas reglas buscarán dar un mayor control al usuario, ofreciendo una forma sencilla para aceptar o rechazar servicios como registro de cookies u otros datos de identificación.
La nueva propuesta añade, con fines de eficiencia, que no deberá requerirse la aprobación de cookies que ayuden a mejorar la experiencia de usuarios y que no representen una intrusión a la privacidad – por ejemplo, recordar el historial de compras de un cliente para permitir retomar su actividad tras alguna interrupción.

751,"January 12, 2017",EU: Commission proposes new level of privacy regulations,"
The European Commission (EC) wants stricter privacy rules to govern the online environment, bringing Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, and others on par with telecoms in terms of privacy.
Current online services and communications apps currently don’t follow the same privacy rules that apply to telecom operators, but the EC believes they should. If the Commission’s latest proposal gets approval, Europe’s ePrivacy Directive would extend to services and apps including, but not limited to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp Messenger, Google’s Gmail and Apple’s iMessage.
Moreover, the EC also wants to implement some new rules regarding the use of cookies, aiming to make the so-called “cookie provision” more streamlined so that users would no longer get bombarded by a slew of consent requests. The Commission says that its new rules aim to put more control in the users’ hands, offering an easy way to accept or decline cookie tracking and other identifiers.
For streamlining purposes, the new proposal notes that no consent should be required for cookies that improve the online experience and are not privacy-intrusive. An example of such positive cookie use would be remembering users’ shopping card history so they could pick up where they left off.

752,"January 10, 2017",US: Why fake news is an antitrust problem: Forbes,"
On Tuesday January 10th, Forbes published an article explaining why fake news is an antitrust problem.
Sally Hubbard wrote “Facebook continues to face criticism for its failure to stop the proliferation of fake news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded that Facebook must ensure that any fixes to address the problem do not introduce bias into the system.
But is Facebook already biased?
When viewed through an antitrust lens, news publishers are Facebook’s competitors. They compete for users’ time spent online, user data and advertising dollars. This competitive dynamic may in part explain why Will Lewis, Dow Jones CEO and WSJ publisher, has accused Facebook (and Google) of “killing news.”
Indeed, competitive biases baked into Facebook’s design deserve a healthy portion of the responsibility for the rise of fake news. By pulling technological levers that keep users on its platform, thereby lessening clicks to news publishers’ sites, Facebook has sped the decline of legitimate news and provided a breeding ground for the fake variety.”

753,"January 10, 2017",EU: Dechert Snags Cadwalader’s Antitrust Team in Brussels,"
Dechert has hired a four-lawyer team from Cadwalader’s Brussels office as it moves to boost its European competition practice, leaving Cadwalader with six lawyers in the city.
The team, which joined Dechert today (10 January), is led by office head Alec Burnside (pictured), who joined Cadwalader from Linklaters in 2011 to launch the Brussels base for the US firm.
He is moving to Dechert alongside special counsel Anne MacGregor, who joins Dechert as a national partner, and associates Marjolein De Backer and Adam Kidane.
The hires significantly boost Dechert’s European competition practice, which also counts lawyers in Paris and Germany.
Dechert competition co-leader Michael Weiner said: “Alec is on everyone’s shortlist of outstanding competition law practitioners in Brussels. It’s a significant addition to the number of people in Brussels, but we will operate as a European team. We’re not finished expanding yet as there’s a growing need for European advice. The idea is that we need to have at least five first-rate partners in Europe as a minimum.”
Burnside is well known in competition circles for work including representing Aer Lingus on the defence of Ryanair’s repeated hostile bids and associated appeals. He is currently advising complainants including Getty Images in abuse of dominance proceedings against Google and previously worked on the mergers that created GlaxoSmithKline and BAE Systems.

754,"January 10, 2017",UK: Trinity Mirror and Express Newspapers ‘in merger talks again,"
Two of Britain’s biggest newspaper groups are reportedly holding talks over a potential merger deal.
Express Newspapers, owned by Richard Desmond, and Trinity Mirror, the owner of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, are understood to have reignited talks, with an official announcement to be made on Tuesday.
The two companies held discussions about a potential deal two years ago, but they fell through due to disagreements on pricing and substantial pension deficits on the Express titles.
At the time, the deal focused on a full sale of the Express newspapers, including the Daily Star, to Trinity Mirror. Exactly what is being negotiated in the latest round of talks is as yet unknown.
However, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told the Guardian that the talks are thought to have started late last year. It is believed they were focused on Trinity Mirror potentially taking a minority stake in Express Newspapers. Such a deal could mean merging back-room staff and sales operations, leading to significant savings.
The talks come as UK national newspaper publishers including Trinity Mirror, the Telegraph, the Sun and Times owner News UK and the Guardian explore combining print and digital sales to fight back against the growing dominance of Google and Facebook. Express Newspapers is not involved in this initiative, called Project Juno.

755,"January 4, 2017",The China-Korea IP & Competition Law Annual Report 2015,"

CPI Asia Column edited by Vanessa Yanhua Zhang (Global Economics Group) present:
The China-Korea IP & Competition Law Annual Report 2015 –By the China-Korea Market & Regulation Law Center (“MRLC”), Korea University (Seoul) and Renmin University (Beijing).
The China-Korea IP & Competition Law Annual Report 2015 has been published by the China-Korea Market & Regulation Law Center (“MRLC”), co-founded by the ICR Law Center of Korea University and the Economic Law Research Center of Renmin University.
The China-Korea IP & Competition Law Annual Report series offers expert, practical and in-depth introduction of yearly developments of Chinese and Korean laws in the fields of IP and Competition law in English, Chinese and Korean for an international audience. The first edition of this annual report was accepted with highest hospitality by experts all over the world as the first work of its kind to introduce annual developments of IP and Competition laws with a full scope.
This Report was undertaken based on understanding that there is a lack of knowledgeable text on the topic of Chinese and Korean IP & Competition laws, especially concerning the intersection between IP and competition laws. By combining the highest expertise and resources in the two jurisdictions while encompassing the major issues and cases of these fields, the annual report provides in-depth knowledge and discussion on the most cutting-edge and controversial issues in these fields of each jurisdiction.
Please click on the link below to reach amazon.com to find out more about the China-Korea IP & Competition Law Annual Report 2015 in e-book and paperback format.
Detailed Introduction
The primary difficulty experts encounter when analyzing cases of IP or competition laws in China or Korea is the problem of insufficient information regarding relevant legislation and enforcement. Although an abundance of cases and information is under construction in each jurisdiction, they are mostly only available in the local language. Hence, there is a general lack of knowledge on current issues available to foreign experts. Especially in China, where IP and competition laws are rapidly being established and revised, this creates a problem for international practitioners.
In the meantime, IP and competition laws have been a driving force of legal and commercial globalization. Thus, as it is widely accepted that lack of information is a market imperfection that distorts market process, this risk is magnified when the influence can stretch over the globe. In many cases of information shortage, the government attempts to cure the problem by generating the necessary information with public cost to achieve efficiency in the market. This is not, however, always the case when it comes to information crossing over different jurisdictions. In such cases, the cost is borne by the local community while the beneficiaries are usually foreign, creating limited incentive for the government to get involved. For example, in Korea and China, most competition case decisions are delivered only in the local language and translation is the responsibility of the defendant. In addition, most other legal sources, including legal provisions, case laws, and other institutional matters are not fully available in a translation.  It seems evident that such issues of externality harm legal development as well as globalization. Foreign actors who struggle with insufficient information may experience negative outcomes and shy away from further business in countries with such lack of information.
The China-Korea Market & Regulation Law Center (the “MRLC”), founded in 2013, takes such problems seriously. We believe that the MRLC may contribute to the international community by providing necessary and trustworthy information regarding developments in IP and competition laws of China and Korea in a timely manner. In fact, the MRLC is perfectly situated for such a mission as it is an interdisciplinary research center established between the prestigious law schools of China and Korea for academic, educational and practical cooperation in the fields of IP and competition laws. Hence, the MRLC aims to provide a platform for the international legal community to share ideas, expertise and comparative experiences. We believe that, by introducing annual development of IP and competition laws in China and Korea together in a comprehensive format, we can create a large synergistic effect in addition to delivering necessary information. This is all the more significant as China and Korea are quickly becoming home to the most cutting-edge legal developments and enforcement in the topic areas with close interactions among themselves.
MRLC hopes that our collaborative efforts between the most eminent Chinese and Korean legal experts brings about legal and institutional progress in the Asian region as a whole.

756,"January 2, 2017",US: NYTimes claims job hype to grease merger wheels,"
American companies are playing along with President-elect Donald Trump’s claims he is forcing businesses to create jobs in the US in order to benefit themselves, The New York Times editorial board claims.

In a Monday editorial, the board wrote, “President-elect Trump would like everybody to believe that his election is energizing the economy by forcing businesses to create thousands of jobs in the United States. And companies like Sprint seem perfectly happy to go along with this fiction because they know they can profit handsomely by cozying up to Mr. Trump.”
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said Sprint’s top executive had told him the company would add 5,000 jobs “because of what’s happening and the spirit and the hope.” But it turns out that the jobs are part of a previous commitment by Sprint’s parent company, SoftBank, whose chief executive said at Trump Tower in December that it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. And even that promise was part of a $100 billion technology fund that SoftBank announced in October, before the election. In sum, Mr. Trump’s statement was hot air, just like his tweet in which he thanked himselffor an increase in a consumer confidence index last month.

757,"January 2, 2017",EU: DG Comp accuses Facebook of misleading on WhatsApp,"
The European Union’s competition watchdog has sent formal charges to Facebook alleging that the social media company provided misleading information during an investigation of its acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014.
However, the statement of objections sent to Facebook will not affect the EC’s approval of the $22 billion merger in 2014, the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday.
Facebook becomes the latest Silicon Valley target of EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has demanded Apple (AAPL.O) pay back $14 billion in taxes to Ireland and hit Google with two market abuse investigations.
The issue regards a WhatsApp privacy policy change in August when it said it would share some users’ phone numbers with parent company Facebook, triggering investigations by a number of EU data protection authorities.
The Commission said Facebook had indicated in its notification of the planned acquisition that it would be unable reliably to match the two companies’ user accounts.
“The Commission’s preliminary view is that Facebook gave us incorrect or misleading information during the investigation into its acquisition of WhatsApp,” said Vestager.

The latter three limit remedies to the patent holder’s domestic practices in the licensing of their domestic patents, illustrating remedies that are consistent with principles of international comity.

759,"December 12, 2016",US: Top tech leaders to meet Trump,"
Many of the most prominent executives from Silicon Valley are expected to attend a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump this week that will help steer the complicated relationship between the incoming White House and some of the nation’s most valuable companies.
Expected attendees for the Wednesday summit include Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, and both the CEO and chairman of Google parent Alphabet,Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, people familiar with the plans said. The CEOs of Intel, International Business Machines, Oracle and Cisco Systems also are expected to attend, the people said.
The meeting’s agenda hasn’t been made public. Tech companies are concerned about Trump plans for immigration policy, antitrust enforcement and government demands for user data the companies have.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has emphasized the importance of boosting US jobs, a subject that could put tech firms on the defensive. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are five of the seven most valuable companies in the US, yet they generally employ fewer people than big firms in other industries. The five together employ about 600,000 people, many of whom work abroad. Wal-Mart Stores, meanwhile, employs 1.5 million in the US. The tech industry’s heavy reliance on software limits the need for as many employees as other industries to manufacture, sell and distribute products and services.

760,"December 5, 2016",Intellectual Property and Standard Setting,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
Intellectual Property and Standard Setting
Koren W. Wong-Ervin & Joshua D. Wright (George Mason University)
Abstract:      Standard setting has become increasingly important to the economy. Voluntary, open, and market driven standard setting promotes research and development investments in “best of generation” technologies that enable and accelerate follow on innovation, competition, and economic growth. Standard development organizations (SDOs) are private organizations that develop technical and other standards through a collaborative and consensus-driven process that balances the varied interests of industry participants, which include both producers and potential users of technology. SDOs provide a platform for industry scientists and engineers to come together and develop technical standards. Because standards may include technology that is the subject of intellectual property rights (IPRs) such as patents, SDOs historically have promoted widespread dissemination of standardized technologies through IPR Policies, which balance the rights of IPR holders with rights to access essential technology. Although SDO IPR Policies vary widely, many policies achieve this balance by seeking to have their members publicly declare any potential standard-essential patents (SEPs) (i.e., patents that are essential to practice a given standard) and to license them on “fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory” (FRAND) terms. Most SDOs clearly state that the purpose of the FRAND assurance is to both ensure access to the standardized technology and fairly compensate the contributors to the standard.
The issues and choices regarding specific IPR Policies are best left to individual SDOs and their members to decide, rather than government agencies. SDOs “vary widely in size, formality, organization and scope,” and therefore individual SDOs may need to adopt different approaches to meet the specific needs of their members. A government agency’s issuance of recommendations may unduly influence private SDOs and their members to adopt policies that might not otherwise gain consensus support within a particular SDO and that may not best meet the needs of that SDO, its members, and the public. This could occur because the SDO believes that failing to adopt the specified policy is not permitted or because failing to adopt the policy could subject the SDO and its members to other legal liabilities. Accordingly, the U.S. Antitrust Agencies have taken the position that they do “not advocate that SSOs [standard setting organizations or SDOs] adopt any specific disclosure or licensing policy, and the Agencies do not suggest that any specific disclosure or licensing policy is required.”
However, despite these statements, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division (DOJ) recently issued a Business Review Letter on the proposed amendments to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated’s (IEEE’s) IPR Policy. In the letter, the DOJ went well beyond its mission of providing a statement of its antitrustenforcement intentions with respect to the proposed amendments, and instead endorsed certain policy choices. Some of its preferred policies include provisions that essentially prohibit patent holders from seeking or enforcing injunctive relief on FRAND-assured SEPs, and provisions that essentially require component-level licensing; the latter is contrary to the long-standing industry practice of end-user device licensing. The IEEE’s controversial amendments were highly criticized by SEP holders and others on both procedural and substantive grounds. Recent econometric analysis reveals a biased treatment of substantive comments submitted to the IEEE by members opposed to the controversial revisions. Additional empirical evidence following the amendments shows a slowed rate of development for IEEE standards and numerous major SEP holders refusing to grant letters of assurance (i.e.,assurances to license under certain terms) under the new policy.
Another concerning development is the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) recent consent agreements with Bosch and Motorola Mobility/Google. The former prohibits the company from seeking or enforcing injunctive relief on FRAND-assured SEPs; the latter prohibits the companies from seeking injunctive relief on a worldwide basis except under certain circumstances. Following the FTC’s consent agreements, antitrust agencies around the world, including in Canada, China, Korea, and Japan, adopted similar approaches, namely creating competition law sanctions for seeking or enforcing injunctive relief against “willing licensees.” These developments represent a fundamental policy shift that threatens to disrupt the carefully balanced FRAND ecosystem without any evidence that the targeted conduct (namely “holdup” by patent holders) is a widespread or systemic problem that has led to higher prices, reduced output, or lower rates of innovation. Indeed, in contrast to the predictions of the theories that such injunctions will have anticompetitive effects, products that intensively use SEPs have seen robust innovation as well as falling prices and increased output when compared to industries that do not rely upon SEPs.

He also worked the Federal Trade Commission transition team under President Reagan and the FCC transition team under George W. Bush. Jamison, meanwhile, runs the Public Utility Resource Center at the University of Florida and is a former lobbyist for Sprint.
Trump had already hired Eisenach in October as an aide to help craft his telecoms policies and plans for the FCC. Monday’s announcement formalizes Eisenach’s role, and names him and Jamison to the “landing team” that will work directly with the current FCC administration on the transition.
Under the Obama administration, the FCC has advanced protections for net neutrality. The FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order ensured that Internet providers can’t discriminate between different types of content. That means that your Internet service can’t make you pay extra to get a “fast lane” to watch Netflix and relegate others to possibly unusable “slow lanes.”
Internet providers have historically opposed net neutrality, while streaming services and tech companies have supported it. In 2014, prior to the passage of the Open Internet Order, Google, Facebook, Twitter and more than 100 companies wrote to the FCC to say that limiting net neutrality protections would pose a ”grave threat to the Internet.” Google still maintains a pro-net neutrality site today that explains the company’s stance: “If Internet access providers can block some services and cut special deals that prioritize some companies’ content over others, that would threaten the innovation that makes the Internet awesome.”
Both Jamison and Eisenach’s positions are clear. In 2014, Eisenach called net neutrality “crony capitalism pure and simple.” And in a June 2016 paper, Jamison wrote, “Net neutrality is hindering the very innovations it is supposed to protect, creating undue scrutiny and threatening bans of pro-consumer services.” But what remains to be seen is what, if any, regulations they will erect in its place. Jamison, for example, argued in that same article in June that the US needed a do away with net neutrality but then institute a ”multistakeholder process” to resolve conflict without “creating a muddled market.”

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Extra-Jurisdictional Remedies Involving Patent Licensing
Koren W. Wong-Ervin, Joshua D. Wright, Bruce H. Kobayashi & Douglas H. Ginsburg (George Mason University)
Abstract:      In the last several years, competition agencies around the world have imposed or considered imposing extra-jurisdictional remedies on patent holders, particularly owners of standard-essential patents (SEPs) upon which the patent holder has made a commitment to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. For example, in January 2013, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered into a consent agreement with Motorola Mobility and its parent, Google, that, except in limited circumstances, prohibits the companies worldwide from seeking injunctive relief against infringers of any FRAND-assured SEP in its global portfolio. Similarly, the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission are reportedly considering imposing worldwide restraints on Qualcomm’s enforcement of its global patent portfolio in order to remedy alleged competition violations involving the company’s patent licensing practices.
Imposing worldwide remedies can conflict with principles of international comity and result in significant substantive conflicts with the antitrust agencies of other countries given the wide variety of approaches taken globally on antitrust matters involving intellectual property rights (IPRs), particularly with respect to honoring an IPR holder’s core right to exclude. This has the potential to produce significant negative effects on competition and welfare, particularly if conduct that is widely considered to be generally procompetitive is the object of the worldwide prohibition. Even when attacking universally condemned activity such as price fixing, global remedies risk overdeterrence when national authorities do not coordinate to adjust the penalties they impose. Moreover, as explained below, extra-jurisdictional remedies are likely unnecessary to resolve any alleged harm to consumers in the jurisdiction imposing them.
Each competition agency forgoing global remedies does not prevent competition law solutions to global harms, and is appropriate to mitigate the risk of overdeterrence. Honoring principles of comity also can mitigate a race to the bottom in competition law enforcement by preventing the lowest common denominator approach to competition law remedies from governing across the board. Indeed, some, including officials at the highest levels of the U.S. government, have raised concerns that foreign governments may be “using numerous mechanisms, including [antitrust laws] to lower the value of foreign-owned patents” in order to benefit those within their countries who implement foreign technology ; that is, the competition authority may be enforcing competition law not solely to protect their consumers from potentially anticompetitive licensing practices, but also to benefit local implementers or a “national champion” in a way that is inconsistent with the procompetitive goals of the competition laws of other jurisdictions. While competition officials across the globe have emphatically denied such claims, imposing welfare reducing global remedies on patent licensing, in addition to reducing competition and welfare, will also draw increased criticism and threaten to harm an agency’s credibility with stakeholders, the international antitrust community, and the public.
This article discusses the various approaches taken thus far, as exemplified by four recent decisions: one by the FTC against Google/MMI; two by the European Commission (DG Comp) against Motorola and Samsung, respectively; and one by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) against Qualcomm. In contrast with the FTC’s investigation, the latter three limit remedies to the patent holder’s domestic practices in the licensing of their domestic patents (i.e., activity and patents within the territory of the investigating authority), illustrating nicely remedies that are consistent with principles of international comity.

763,"November 16, 2016",US: Former FTC Commissioner to lead Trump transition on antitrust,"
Republican former US Federal Trade Commission member Joshua Wright will lead the transition team of President-elect Donald J. Trump that is focused on the FTC, MLex has learned.
Wright — who holds a law degree and a doctorate in economics — served as a commissioner from 2013 to 2015 before leaving to return to teaching at George Mason University Law School. He also joined as of counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, a prominent antitrust firm that frequently represents Google.
Over the next several weeks, transition officials grouped into agency review teams will meet with current staff at the agencies to discuss priorities, responsibilities and budgeting. The review teams will then craft detailed memos on the agencies and recommend candidates to fill key positions. In the case of antitrust, that includes the assistant attorney general for antitrust at the US Department of Justice, the FTC chair and a vacant commissioner slot.
In 2008 during President Barack Obama’s transition, different teams focused on the Department of Justice’s antitrust division and the FTC. Though Trump’s transition has a separate team for the Justice Department as a whole, Wright’s team may end up making recommendations related to the antitrust division, it is understood.
While at the FTC, Wright was a vocal proponent of greater use of economics in both antitrust and consumer protection cases. Before leaving the agency, he expressed hope that his replacement would also have an economics background.

US internet companies including Facebook and Amazon have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms.
The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet’s Google , Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign.
‘The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,’ reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters.
Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict US internet companies from growing in that market.

765,"November 14, 2016",Russia: Kasperskys claims Windows bundle is anti-competitive,"
After Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, ripped into Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior in Windows 10, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) opened a case against Microsoft for “abusing dominance.”
Microsoft claimed to have a “long history of cooperation” with Kaspersky and that it is “committed to work in full compliance with Russian law.”
Yet, Russia has already decided to block Microsoft-owned LinkedIn since the law requires Russian citizens’ personal data to be stored on servers within its country. In the past, Microsoft made LinkedIn censorship changes to cater to China, as opposed to being blocked like Google and Facebook. It remains to be seen if Microsoft will localize Russian users’ data as the country’s law demands. The New York Times added that it was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted, “rather than any other major social networking site,” but that is a “sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating” in Russia.
Speaking of growing tensions, Kaspersky has “had enough” and roasted Microsoft toasty last week for anti-competitive bundling in Windows 10, namely the way the bundled Defender is Microsoft’s way of “squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose.”
When upgrading, Windows 10 does have a habit of uninstalling users’ apps and replacing them with Microsoft-flavored versions. Even after selecting “Keep personal files and apps” during the upgrade process, third-party software can get axed and that includes antivirus. Kaspersky wants Microsoft to knock off that behavior and stop “foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks.”

766,"November 9, 2016",US: Is President Trump Bad News for Amazon?,"
As Donald Trump began his march to the White House last year, he became embroiled in numerous feuds. One that got a lot of attention starting last year was a spat with fellow billionaire and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over taxes, media coverage in the Bezos-owned Washington Post and antitrust issues.
Following Trump’s victory, Amazon’s stock opened down about 3 percent, not a major drop, and probably a lot less than expected after US markets freaked out as the tide shifted from Hillary Clinton to Trump. But Amazon did see a slightly sharper decline than some of its big tech contemporaries, such as Microsoft, Appleand Google parent Alphabet.
When it became clear that Donald Trump was on the way to becoming the next US president, Dow futures plummeted as the votes rolled in. But US markets recovered this morning, possibly due to Trump’s victory speech, which featured a more conciliatory tone than his divisive and angry rhetoric as a candidate.
To be sure, Amazon’s stock movement could have nothing to do with Trump. Amazon’s stock has shown to be volatile with multiple peaks and valleys through the years. But some outlets speculate that a Trump presidency could be bad news for Amazon and Bezos.
Trump’s first dustup with Bezos came late last year. Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. Trump has claimed he used the paper to influence politicians in Washington DC and keep them from taxing Amazon.
Trump has alluded to the possibility that Amazon could face antitrust issues under his presidency.

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice plans to begin criminally investigating and prosecuting employers who enter wage fixing and anti-poaching agreements with their competitors. In advance of its new push, the DOJ – together with the Federal Trade Commission – issued guidance targeted at Human Resources professionals, who often make hiring and compensation decisions at their companies, or are at least in a unique position to identify and prevent violations.
The following have been specifically identified by the FTC and DOJ as examples of “Antitrust Red Flags” for HR professionals:

Agreements with other companies about employee salaries, compensation, or other terms or conditions of employment;
Agreements with other companies regarding hiring/soliciting their employees – or even expressing a desire to avoid aggressive competition for talent;
Sharing information about employees’ compensation, or other terms or conditions of employment, with another employer;
Participating in a meeting or discussion in which the foregoing topics are discussed;
Discussing the above topics with peers from other companies – including during non-professional social events; or
Receiving data about another company’s employees’ compensation.

A Leverage Theory of Tying in Two-Sided Markets
Jay Pil Choi (Michigan State University) & Doh-Shin Jeon (Toulouse School of Economics)
Abstract:      Partly motivated by the recent antitrust investigations concerning Google, we develop a leverage theory of tying in two-sided markets. We analyze incentives for a monopolist to tie its monopolized product with another product in a two-sided market. Tying provides a mechanism to circumvent the non-negative price constraint in the tied product market without inviting an aggressive response as the rival firm faces the non-negative price constraint. We identify conditions under which tying in two-sided markets is profitable and explore its welfare implications. Our mechanism can be more widely applied to any markets in which sales to consumers in one market can generate additional revenues that cannot be competed away due to non-negative price constraints.

As a result, the FTC on Sunday said it has slapped three groups representing doctors in Korea – the Korean Medical Association, National Union of Medical Doctors and Korea Medical Clinic Association – with a fine of $1 million.
The Korean Medical Association pressured GE Healthcare between 2009 and 2012 not to sell its ultrasound devices to oriental medicine clinics, the antitrust agency said. The medical association even threatened that it would start a boycott against sales of the company’s products if it didn’t agree to its demand, the FTC said.
As a result, GE Healthcare cancelled its business with oriental medicine clinics including sales agreements for nine ultrasound devices.

Introduction: Big Data and Competition Policy
Maurice E. Stucke & Allen P. Grünes (The Konkurrenz Group)
Abstract:      Big Data and Big Analytics are a big deal today. Big Data is playing a pivotal role in many companies’ strategic decision-making. Companies are striving to acquire a ‘data advantage’ over rivals. Data-driven mergers are increasing. These data-driven business strategies and mergers raise significant implications for privacy, consumer protection and competition law. At the same time, European and United States’ competition authorities are beginning to consider the implications of a data-driven economy on competition policy. In 2015, the European Commission launched a competition inquiry into the e-commerce sector and issued a statement of objections in its Google investigation. The implications of Big Data on competition policy will likely be a part of the mix.
Big Data and Competition Policy is the first work to offer a detailed description of the important new issue of Big Data and explains how it relates to competition laws and policy, both in the EU and US. The book helps bring the reader quickly up to speed on what is Big Data, its competitive implications, the competition authorities’ approach to data-driven mergers and business strategies, and their current approach’s strengths and weaknesses.
Written by two recognized leading experts in competition law, this accessible work offers practical guidance and theoretical discussion of the potential benefits (including data-driven efficiencies) and concerns for the practitioner, policy maker, and academic alike.

772,"October 10, 2016",Venezuela: Aerolíneas buscan permiso para romper con leyes de competencia,"
Un número de aerolíneas estadounidenses se han acercado al Departamento de Transportes de EEUU para solicitar inmunidad, por un año, de las leyes de competencia del país, con tal de permitirles discutir estrategias que permitan recuperar más de $3,800 millones de dólares actualmente ‘secuestrados’ por el gobierno de Venezuela, país que se encuentra en una profunda depresión económica.
Funcionarios venezolanos han detenido casi por completo la repatriación de ingresos obtenidos por ventas de boletos de avión realizados en moneda nacional – el muy devaluado Bolivar. La inflación ha estallado en el país, con las reservas internacionales cayendo hasta los $12 mil millones de dólares. El gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro ha impuesto varios esquemas de intercambio, a pesar de los cuales la economía ha caído en desorden, provocando escasez. Como resultado, el flujo de dinero se ha reducido a un goteo para varias corporaciones y multinacionales que operan en Venezuela.
Las autoridades exigen aprobación por parte del gobierno para repatriar las ventas realizadas por empresas extranjeras a partir de 2003. En los últimos 21 meses, el gobiernod e Maduro ha permitido solo dos pequeños pagos a un par de aerolíneas extranjeras, dijo Jason Sinclair de la Asociación Internacional de Transporte Aéreo. Las aerolíneas, que previamente debían negociar sus pagos de manera individual, esperan recibir autorización para presentar un frente unido.
“El acercamiento de forma individual con el gobierno de Venezuela han sido, hasta ahora, infructuosas” comentó Jeffrey Shane, conejero general de la IATA. La inmundidad por parte del DOT “permitiría a las aerolíneas el considerar nuevas soluciones al problema, que no han sido capaces de explorar juntas anteriormente.”
Las aerolíneas de EEUU son particularmente sensibles a cualquier sospecha de falta de competencia, habiendo enfrentado una investigación por colusión de precios y capacidades hace tan solo un año.

773,"October 9, 2016",US/Venezuela: Airlines ask permission to break antitrust law,"
Airlines have a question for US regulators: Mind if we collude a bit?
The carriers have made an unusual request of the US Department of Transportation: They want antitrust immunity for one year so they can collectively discuss ways to retrieve $3.8 billion currently held hostage by Venezuela’s deep economic slide.
Since 2013, Venezuelan officials have virtually halted the repatriation of past ticket sales made in bolivars, the local currency. Inflation has soared and foreign currency reserves have dwindled to $12 billion, as the government of President Nicolás Maduro imposed various currency exchange rates and the economy fell into disarray andfood shortages. As a result, the flow of money homeward has slowed to a trickle for many multinational corporations operating in Venezuela.
Authorities first required government approval for the repatriation of foreign company sales in 2003. Over the past 21 months, Maduro’s government allowed only two small payments to a pair of foreign carriers, said Jason Sinclair, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association. Airlines that previously negotiated for payment individually are now hoping a united front can offer more leverage.
“Individual airline approaches to the Venezuelan government thus far have been unavailing,” IATA’s general counsel, Jeffrey Shane, wrote in a Sept. 22 filing with the DOT. Antitrust immunity “would permit the airlines to consider approaches to the problem, which they have not been permitted to explore together before now.”
US airlines are particularly sensitive to antitrust concerns as the Department of Justice began an inquiry more than a year ago into whether they had colluded on pricing through their comments about the industry’s capacity discipline.

New Zealand’s competition watchdog is facing a crucial decision on whether to allow a merger that would create a near-monopoly in the country’s struggling newspaper industry, with subscriber numbers falling and internet companies increasingly dominating the fast-growing digital advertising market.
New Zealand Media and Entertainment and Fairfax New Zealand say their proposed merger would allow them to compete effectively against global giants such as Facebook and Google in advertising while expanding the coverage of news. But critics of the deal are skeptical, saying the merged company would have too much power in New Zealand’s media landscape and that cost-cutting would lead to more job cuts and a decline in quality.
The regulator, the Commerce Commission, said it would release a draft decision on the merger in November, followed by a final decision by March 15 next year.

775,"October 3, 2016",EEUU: FTC no desiste en caso contra AT&T,"
La Comisión Federal de Comercio de EEUU (FTC), en voz de su presidenta Edith Ramirez, ha anunciado ante el Senado que “buscaremos una nueva audiencia en cuanto a éste tema” ante el Noveno Circuito de apelaciones.
Jueces de ésta instancia tomaron la parte de AT&T, fallando que la empresa puede quedar exenta de la supervisión de la FTC incluso cuando ésta provea servicios de operador no-comunes. La decisión pone en duda la capacidad de la FTC para hacer valer sus reglas en contra de otras empresas con actividades de operador común.
La decisión parece indicar que grandes empresas con pequeñas unidades de operación común seguirán siendo sujetas a la supervisión de la FTC. Según la corte, “el estatus de AT&Y como operador común no depende de su adquisición de una división menor, poco relacionada con las actividades principales de la empresa, y que genera una pequeña fracción de sus ingresos.”
La interpretación aceptada indica que la FTC aún podría aplicar sus reglamentos sobre entidades como la división de búsqueda de Google, aún cuando la empresa ofrece servicios de internet mediante fibra óptica como un servicio separado. Sin embargo, los jueces no ofrecieron lineamientos claros para determinar cuales empresas quedarían exentas de la supervisión de la FTC.
En un testimonio escrito, Edith Ramirez explicó la postura de la FTC, diciendo que la exención para los operadores comunes “tuvo su origen en una época en que los servicios de telecomunicaciones eran suministrados por monopolios fuertemente regulados. La excepción no tiene sentido en un ambiente poco regulado, donde las líneas entre las telecomunicaciones y otros servicios se han borrado, como por ejemplo cuando empresas de telecomunicación adquieren proveedores de banda ancha móvil, o los consumidores se comunican a través de redes sociales por encima de la telefonía fija.”

776,"September 28, 2016",US: FTC won’t let go of AT&T case,"
On Tuesday in a Federal Trade Commission oversight hearing, FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez told US senators “We are going to be seeking a rehearing in that matter” before the entire Ninth Circuit appeals court.
Ninth Circuit judges sided with AT&T, saying that the company is exempt from FTC oversight even when it’s providing non-common carrier services. This has raised questions about whether the FTC can enforce any of its rules against other companies that perform at least some common carrier activities.
The ruling seems to indicate that large companies with only small common carrier businesses are still subject to FTC oversight. The ruling said that “AT&T’s status as a common carrier is not based on its acquisition of some minor division unrelated to the company’s core activities that generates a tiny fraction of its revenue.”
This most likely means that the FTC can still apply its rules to Google’s search division even though the company separately offers fiber Internet service, but the judges did not set any clear guidelines for determining which companies may escape FTC jurisdiction.
In written testimony, Ramirez explained that the common carrier exemption “originated in an era when telecommunications services were provided by highly regulated monopolies. The exception no longer makes sense in today’s deregulated environment where the lines between telecommunications and other services are increasingly becoming blurred, such as when telecommunications companies are buying edge providers and consumers increasingly communicate over online social networks instead of landlines.”

Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $12.5 million to settle allegations that it failed to stop 15 large, faulty trades that allegedly caused stocks, including Google Inc. and Diageo PLC, to move abruptly, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.
The SEC said the trades that are part of the allegations occurred between 2012 and 2014 because internal controls to prevent erroneous trading orders were set at such a high level that they were ineffective. The internal controls included limits on trading volume and other things.
A representative from Merrill Lynch said the erroneous trades were canceled by the relevant exchanges in most instances, and the company is “not aware of any client who was harmed as a result.” He added the company believes it complies with regulators’ expectations. The company neither admitted nor denied the findings, according to the SEC settlement.

779,"September 18, 2016",EU: Vestager: ‘We have Amazon and McDonald’s in the pipeline’,"
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition Commissioner, has drawn praise and criticism regarding the Ireland-Apple case. In an interview with EurActiv.fr, she says Ireland’s appeal will actually strengthen the Commission’s case and says more tax rulings are in the pipeline, with Amazon and McDonald’s coming next.
Margrethe Vestager is the EU’s competition Commissioner, in charge of applying EU state aid and antitrust rules.
She spoke to EurActiv.fr’s Cécile Barbière and Aline Robert in Paris during a visit on 15 September.
The Luxleaks scandal has drawn international attention to Luxembourg’s tax rulings. How come Apple, in Ireland, is the first case to be uncovered by the Commission?
Luxembourg was one of the first ones because the Fiat case is a Luxembourg case. But it is of course much smaller. The taxes to be recovered from this Fiat holding is only 20 or 30 million euros. It’s a completely different magnitude. But the principle is the same: this is about allowing a company to have a benefit, a specific tax ruling, not available to any other company.
Ireland wants to appeal the decision. Could this weaken the Commission’s case?
On the contrary. Of course, we’ve prepared the case to be as robust as possible. I’ve asked my team to do the case, then change the angle, look at it once again, and have someone to be the devil’s advocate.
We knew we could end up in Court. Now, we have a very robust case.
When the court will have a say, there will be no dispute anymore. Others companies and the member states will be looking at this case and that may actually be a good thing.
What about the timeframe?
That is for the court to decide. What we’re doing right now is to work with the Irish authorities to do the exact calculation of the unpaid taxes.
Irish authorities shall use our methodology, and then they will recover the unpaid taxes and put them in a closed account. It has already happened in the Starbucks case and in the Fiat case.
Even if you appeal, it doesn’t hold the effect of the decision, you still have to do it.
You suggested that other European countries might want to ask their share of Apple’s 13 billion euro bill of unpaid taxes. For now, only Spain an Austria have done it. Are you hoping that other countries join the movement?
If a company has activities that generates profits in one country, it’s important for tax authorities to look into it. And that is of course for them to evaluate.
But there is a lack of transparency, it’s difficult for tax authorities to have the full picture. This case only started because of questions being asked in the US Senate!
The level of secrecy around these numbers and on tax rulings is high. Which is also why I am very strongly in favour of public country-by-country reporting. It will change how we work with corporate taxation and also with corporate culture.
The US has made a political reading of the Apple ruling, saying it raises issues of tax sovereignty. What’s your answer to their claims?
We take it very seriously. This is not politics, gut feeling or anti-Americanism or whatever. This is very old school Europe: we have been doing state aid control in the Commission since the beginning.
The US doesn’t have prohibition of state aid like we Europeans. So, of course, we have been trying to say: ‘you have to look at Europe with European glasses’. Because this is European legislation that applies here: This is specific to the EU, and we have been doing it for decades.
But one of the reasons why we very much want to tell about the case and explain how it works, is that the US is a very important partner when it comes to taxation.
We work very closely with the US within the framework of the OECD, the G20. If you want fair taxation it’s not just for us, here in Europe. We can take important steps, but it is a global issue. And therefore it is important for us to keep the dialogue open.
Is it politically conceivable for your next decision to be about another US company?
Well, I don’t have much choice because in my pipeline I have a number of US companies. I think in Europe we have this strange fascination with US companies. The huge majority of our decisions concern European companies, and not necessarily on taxation. The general rule is that it involves European companies. But since that is sort of normal for us, it is not in the headlines, it’s not in the public debate.
So the next decision could be about Google, for example?
We still need some of the answers in the Google case, but when it comes to tax rulings in the pipeline we have Amazon and McDonald’s, which are also very well-known US companies.
You also have IKEA.
Yes. We are still looking into the material that was handed to us by the Green group of the European Parliament, but we have no conclusions yet. It’s a bit early.

A German antitrust probe into Facebook’s user terms falls into a “gray zone between competition and privacy,” the European Union’s competition chief said, describing the social networking site as having “a very dominant position.”
While social networks aren’t a specific worry for EU regulators, they are concerned if they see competition being closed down, Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg TV in an interview Wednesday.
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office is investigatingwhether Facebook abused its power as a social network by forcing customers to agree to unfair terms on how their data is used.
Data and how it may be misused by fast-growing technology giants is a focus for Vestager, who’s probing Google on several fronts and quizzing Facebook on a U-turn over its use of WhatsApp data, two years after the EU cleared the deal. She’ll soon have to examine Microsoft Corp.’s acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn Corp. when they file for EU approval.

781,"September 13, 2016",EU: New rules look to unify digital markets,"
They provide similar services, so now they’ll be held to the same standards. A new draft proposal from the European Union may soon extend security rules that currently apply exclusively to telecom operators like Vodafone, Orange, and Deutsche Telekom to web services like Facebook-owned Whatsapp, Skype, and Apple’s FaceTime.
As first reported by Reuters, the European Commission plans to reveal reforms to its 15-year-old set of telecom regulations this coming week. The new rules will require web companies that also allow users to make calls and send messages to “ensure the security and integrity of their services, including reporting breaches to authorities and having contingency plans and service continuity strategies.”
It’s a victory for telecom companies, which have pointed out for years that so-called “over the top players” like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook do not face the same stringent regulations as more traditional communication firms, despite supplying extremely similar services. These new proposed changes may also help to even the score between European providers and largely US-based internet companies, which has long been a contentious subject within the European Union.
That said, not all web services will be required to uphold the exact same security obligations, as some of these services “do not exercise control over the transmission of their services over telecom networks,” Reuters reports.

782,"September 12, 2016","US: Lawsuit accuses Samsung, LG of agreeing to not poach each other’s employees","
Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics were accused of agreeing to avoid poaching each other’s US employees, according to a US civil lawsuit filed last week, in what has become a familiar allegation in Silicon Valley.
The proposed class action, filed in a Northern California federal court by an LG sales manager, accuses Samsung and LG of antitrust violations and driving down employee wages. The case is similar to one against Apple Inc, Google and other tech companies which settled last year for $415 million.
The plaintiff, A. Frost, says in the lawsuit that a recruiter contacted Frost via LinkedIn in 2013, seeking to fill a position with Samsung.
According to the lawsuit, the recruiter then informed Frost the same day: “I made a mistake! I’m not supposed to poach LG for Samsung!!! Sorry! The two companies have an agreement that they won’t steal each other’s employees.”
It is “implausible” that such a deal in the United States could have been reached without the consent of each company’s corporate parent in South Korea, says the lawsuit, which does not state a specific damages amount.
Of course, the lawsuit might remind you of a similar one that was filed against Apple, Google, and a number of other large tech companies last year that was eventually settled for $415 million. According to the plaintiffs, this anti-poaching agreement was made in an effort to keep wages relatively low, and centers around emails sent from Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs to Google executive Eric Schmidt, which said that Google was “relentlessly recruiting” from Apple’s iPod team, and asked for the poaching to stop.

783,"September 11, 2016",EU: Facebook privacy issues may not be competition matters says Vestager,"
Facebook’s problems with European privacy regulators do not mean that the social network has breached the bloc’s competition rules, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday.
“The German authority is concerned that Facebook may have forced its users to accept privacy terms that aren’t in line with the data protection rules,” Vestager said in the text of a speech to be delivered at a conference in Copenhagen.
“But as our German colleagues rightly point out, even if Facebook has broken those rules, that doesn’t automatically mean that it has also broken the competition rules as well,” she said.
The German government has been critical of Facebook in the past while political leaders and regulators have also complained that the world’s largest social network, with 1.6 billion monthly users, had been slow to tackle hate speech and anti-immigrant messages.
Facebook raised regulatory concerns last month when it loosened the privacy policy of WhatsApp, the world’s most popular mobile messaging application, prompting the chair of Europe’s leading group of privacy regulators to say that it would closely scrutinize the move.

US tech giants Google and Facebook are among multinationals spending more in Brussels as the European Commission eyes new business regulation after last week handing Apple a 13-billion-euro tax demand.
A new annual filing by Google to the EU’s Transparency Register showed it spent roughly 15-20 percent more on lobbying European Union officials and lawmakers last year than in 2014, itself some three times as much as in the year before that.
A review by Reuters of EU lobbying budgets of a handful of leading US firms which have been in the spotlight of European regulatory debates showed Google among the biggest spenders of all corporations, reporting a budget of 4.25-4.50 million euros. That compared to 3.5-4.0 million euros the year before and 1.25-1.5 million euros in 2013.

785,"September 4, 2016",US/China: Is Dell’s $60bn merger all about challenging Amazon’s dominance of cloud computing?,"
Just three years ago, the future was bleak for Texas technology company Dell Inc. Declining hardware sales and the rise of China’s contract manufacturing hammered the company’s core build-to-order hardware business model. After years of layoffs and restructuring, the company limped away from the stock market with a 2013 leveraged buyout, putting the company back into the hands of its namesake founder Michael Dell.
But if all goes as planned, by Wednesday Dell will start a new chapter for a company he founded more than 30 years ago from a University of Texas dorm room. And following its $60 billion merger with Massachusetts-based EMC Corp., a leader in data storage, slated to be officially sealed next week, Dell Inc. will soon be renamed Dell Technologies.
This deal — the largest-ever technology merger — makes Dell the biggest supplier of the hardware and software used in building cloud-computing networks that centralize storage, applications, databases and other elements delivered to numerous users on demand. The cloud, as it’s known, is the most vital platform on the internet right now. It’s what Netflix and Instagram use to deliver on-demand content, and it’s what corporate titans like General Electric and McDonald’s tap to store and process data globally.
Currently, the industry leader in cloud computing is Amazon Web Services, which offers dozens of cloud-based services to companies and government agencies worldwide, generating $10 billion in sales last year, a 10th of Amazon’s total revenue. Thus, Amazon controls nearly one-third of the global cloud-computing market, dwarfing its closest competitor, Microsoft’s Azure, which has a 10 percent market share. Other players include IBM, Google and Salesforce, but all of their cloud-computing market share combined make up just a little more than half of Amazon’s.
Although it might look like Dell is David going after a Goliath by challenging Amazon, the reality is a bit more complex. By acquiring a leader in data storage and related software, Dell Technologies is priming itself to become a leader in private and hybrid cloud services, said Raj Thangavelsamy, vice president of SSA & Company, an advisory firm specializing in corporate mergers and IT strategies.

Is Your Digital Assistant Devious?
Ariel Ezrachi (University of Oxford) & Maurice E. Stucke (University of Tennessee)
Abstract:       Who wouldn’t want a personal butler? Technological developments have moved us closer to that dream. The rise of digital personal assistants has already changed the way we shop, interact and surf the web. Technological developments and artificial intelligence are likely to further accelerate this trend. Indeed, all of the leading online platforms are currently investing in this technology. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook’s M, and Google Assistant can quickly provide us with information, if we so desire, and anticipate and fulfill certain needs and requests. Yet, could they also reduce our welfare? Could they limit competition and transfer our wealth to the providers? And if so, can competition law safeguard our welfare while enabling these technological developments?

News publishers would have stronger rights to demand payment from digital giants such as Google and Facebook in exchange for using their content, under proposed European rules that are designed to shore up the collapsing revenues of traditional media companies.
The measures are part of a series of reforms that the European commission plans to put out to consultation in September. They are designed to strengthen the rights of those who create and invest in original content, from authors and musicians to record labels, broadcasters and publishers.
The commission has come under increasing pressure from publishers to level the playing field. Google and Facebook have attracted a ballooning share of online advertising money, while revenues for news publishers have slumped despite their expanding online readerships.
In draft proposals setting out its preferred options, the commission says: “The sustainability of publishing industries in the EU may be at stake, with the risk of further negative consequences on media pluralism, democratic debate and quality of information.”
The digital groups have a “strong bargaining position”, which “makes it difficult for publishers to negotiate with them on an equal footing”, according to a version of the draft seen by the Guardian.
Brussels is looking at giving news publishers the exclusive right to make their content available to the public, and to reproduce it for digital purposes.

The Myth of Free
John M. Newman (University of Memphis)
Abstract:       Myths matter. This Article is the first to squarely confront a powerful myth that pervades modern economic, technological, and legal discourse: the Myth of Free. The prevailing view is that consumers capture massive welfare surplus from an ever-rising flood of innovative new products that are offered free of charge by firms like Google, Facebook, Pandora, and others. This windfall was made possible, we are told, by the convergence of digitization and networking, which eliminated the marginal costs of such products. Free was born, heralding the end of scarcity and an age of abundance.
But that orthodox origin story is fatally flawed. This Article first formalizes, then deconstructs, the Myth of Free. Unsurprisingly, given its faulty premises, the Myth’s conclusion is incorrect: there is still “no such thing as a free lunch.” Free does not signal the end of capitalism or the demise of standard economic theory.
Moreover, the Myth of Free is not benign. It has led to an undeserved protected status for certain suppliers, who receive legal immunity or favorable treatment in close cases involving contract, antitrust, consumer protection, and privacy laws. It has motivated policy proposals that would eliminate market interventions or (paradoxically) competitive markets themselves, without adequate justification in either case. Worse yet, policies designed for a post-scarcity world necessarily overlook the persistent problems attendant to scarcity. This Article seeks to dispel the Myth of Free before it can wreak further harm.

Abstract:      Yelp and other members of its “Focus on the User – Local” interest group commissioned a paper by Tim Wu, Michael Luca, and others (the “FOTUL Paper”). This paper ostensibly provides empirical data to show that Google is “degrading its own search results” for some queries by displaying a local results box containing Google’s own local results – rather than results taken from other local search services, such as Yelp. We examined the FOTUL Paper and its associated evidence, and conclude that its claims are not tenable. In particular, the FOTUL Paper’s testing methodology is invalid and does not support any of its claims.

James J. Tierney, the government antitrust lawyer who oversaw the complaint accusing six major Silicon Valley companies of colluding not to recruit competitors’ employees, is leaving the federal job to join the law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.
The chief of the Justice Department’s networks and technology enforcement section, Mr. Tierney, 62, worked for the government for 26 years. He oversaw all civil antitrust enforcement and competition policy in the areas of computer hardware and software, high technology component manufacturing, financial services, securities industries and professional associations.
In the no-poaching case, the government accused Adobe Systems, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit and Pixar Animation of entering into agreements that blocked the recruiting of each other’s employees. The government argued that such a pact undercut competition among companies vying for employees with advanced or highly specialized skills, and squelched competition among workers — effectively putting a lid on wages and depriving them of access to better job opportunities.
The agreements, overseen by senior executives, had barred companies from “cold calling” a competitor’s workers to make better compensation offers, according to a 2010 settlement.
The companies did not admit legal wrongdoing when they signed the settlement, which disallowed practices like the ban on cold calling and which was effective for five years.
Mr. Tierney, who has been the networks and technology section head since 2006, will join Orrick’s office in Washington as a partner with an antitrust practice, starting on Aug. 22. Founded in San Francisco, Orrick specializes in technology, energy and infrastructure law.

Understanding Online Platform Competition: Common Misunderstandings
Daniel H O’Connor (Computer & Communications Industry Association)
Abstract:      The Internet is arguably the most powerful force in the global economy. Similar to the printing press, electricity and the steam engine, the Internet has become, in the words of the OECD, a “general purpose technology enabler,” a once-in-a-generation technology that reorganizes world economic activity and spurs productivity. Although the positive effects of this reorganization are apparent, the rapid pace of innovation and the subsequent restructuring of economic activity have placed pressure on regulators to understand this vital but rapidly changing new economic sector.
Currently, there is a robust debate on how to police a relatively new economic actor: the online platform. While there is often a lack of clarity involving exactly what is considered an online platform, the term generally refers to any online service that can function as an intermediary between two or more clearly identified groups. Examples include Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Uber. Both the number and size of Internet platforms, many of which displace parts of the brick-and-mortar economy, have grown rapidly in recent years.
One area of debate involves questions about how existing laws should be applied to regulate the behavior of online platform operators. Another area of debate is more fundamental and controversial. It questions the adequacy of existing bodies of law to deal with the challenges presented by online platforms, and raises the prospect of new ex ante regulation of online platforms.
In this paper, I examine common mistakes that policymakers, regulators, and competition enforcers make when evaluating Internet competition, particularly in regards to online platforms. Defining markets based on a static view of competition, applying one-sided analysis to multi-sided markets, not recognizing the limits of network effects, and an overemphasis on the role of big data are common pitfalls that often lead observers to conclude that the Internet is far less competitive than it actually is. These mistakes lead to the misapplication of competition law itself, and fuel the perception that competition law is not sufficient and additional regulation is needed to police online platforms.

This article will place EU competition law policy in a comparative perspective, drawing comparisons with U.S. federal antitrust law, which differs on a number of key points relating to innovation. As a starting point, both EU and U.S. policy and law both seek to foster innovation. However, they can be argued to do this in slightly different ways.
This article highlights a number of important precedents, such as the Microsoft decision, to show how EU competition policy fosters a competitive marketplace, before applying these points to the ongoing investigation into Google, whose resolution may yet prove to be the most important restatement of EU competition policy towards on digital markets.

VidAngel, an online video service that allows consumers to watch major home-video releases in standard definition for $1, has filed a counter complaint against Hollywood studios who are seeking to shut them down.
Customers of VidAngel buy a movie online for $20, then have the option of setting filters to screen out objectionable content and watch the movie. The customer then sells back the movie for as much as $19.
VidAngel, however, contends that studios have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by pressuring Google to withhold its Chromecast support services from VidAngel, which depends on streaming services to get access to its customers. Its counterclaim was filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
VidAngel claims that the Walt Disney Co., 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Lucasfilm “have interfered with VidAngel’s attempts to partner with streaming content providers to filter movies.” They also claim that the studios have sought to “expand their copyright monopoly” by depriving consumers of the right to buy and sell copyrighted works.

La senadora demócrata Elizabeth Warren ha lanzado un ataque contra el gigante de las telecomunicaciones estadounidenses, Comcast, la cual provee de acceso a internet y televisión por cable a más de la mitad de los suscriptores del país. 
“El año pasado fue el mejor para Comcast en casi una década” dijo la senadora por el estado de Massachusetts. “Pero mientras que los gigantes de las telecomunicaciones continúan consumiéndose uno a otro, los consumidores han quedado relegados – con poca o nula oferta en cuanto a proveedores y pagando hasta por las narices por su servicio de cable e internet.”
El discurso de Warren, ofrecido durante un foro dedicado a los monopolios, forma parte de su larga campaña por mejorar la aplicación de las leyes antimonopolio del país a las grandes empresas de telecomunicaciones en EEUU, donde los consumidores a menudo pagan cuotas por servicios de cable e internet muy superiores a países comparables. 
Warren se refirió específicamente a Comcast, así como a empresas tecnológicas como Apple y Google, a las principales aerolíneas y a Wal-Mart. A pesar de algunas intervenciones por parte de la administración del presidente Obama, el mercado estadounidense se encuentra en un periodo intenso de consolidación. 
“Un liderazgo enérgico por parte del ejecutivo podría revivir la aplicación de las leyes antimonopolio en nuestro país y comenzar nuevamente la lucha en contra de los actores dominantes y su sobrecogedora influencia política” dijo Warren. “Pero también necesitamos una cosa más – y se trata de revivir el movimiento que vio surgir las leyes de competencia en primer lugar.”
Warren hizo un llamado a las agencias reguladoras, tales como el Departamento de Justicia y la Comisión Federal de Comercio (FTC) a ser más agresivas en su investigación y restricciones a las operaciones de fusión y adquisición.

On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren took on Comcast, the telecom company, which she said serves more than half of the nation’s cable and internet subscribers.
“Last year was Comcast’s best year in nearly a decade,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in prepared remarks for a speech. “But while big telecom giants have been consuming each other, consumers have been left out in the cold — facing little or no choice in service providers and paying through the nose for cable and internet service.
Warren’s speech at a forum on monopolies came as part of her advocacy for greater enforcement of antitrust laws as American consumers pay higher prices for cable and Internet services than those elsewhere.
Warren cited the cable giant specifically, along with technology players like Apple and Google, the big airlines and Wal-Mart. While the Obama administration has blocked some deals, the US has been through a strong period of business consolidation.
“Strong executive leadership could revive antitrust enforcement in this country and begin, once again, to fight back against dominant market power and overwhelming political power,” Warren said in the Capitol Visitor Center. “But we need something else too — and that’s a revival of the movement that created the antitrust laws in the first place.”
Warren said that federal regulators and the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission should be more aggressive about blocking mergers and acquisitions.

799,"June 16, 2016",The Rise of Big Data and the Loss of Privacy,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Rise of Big Data and the Loss of Privacy
Anca D Chirita (Durham University)
Abstract:      This paper explains why ‘big data’ matters and why privacy is now lost as a social norm. The European Data Protection Supervisor initially suggested a consumer protection approach to data owned by monopolists. It relied on the essential facility doctrine of intervention where a smaller entrant is foreclosed because it cannot access the data owned by the monopolist. Both the report and the doctrine are now of little help to competition authorities. Instead, the paper will evaluate the legal framework to clarify the scope of application of the data protection rules and elucidate whether competition intervention has any merit in its own right. Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the former Directive 95/46/EC will be mentioned before the paper fully engages with the recent developments in the area of data protection. In particular, drawing on the risks associated with data processing in both Directive EU/2016/680 and Regulation EU/2016/679, the paper seeks to determine how price discrimination can actually happen in the form of abuse of personal data. The latter carries an economic significance, as through the misuse of such data, consumers can be left worse off when bargaining or shopping online. Further risks associated with the processing of personal data concern health, which could, in turn, raise life insurance premium rates. In other cases, personal data can reveal a particular economic situation, personal preferences or interests, reliability, or behaviour, which could make price discrimination much easier.
The new regulation mentions the risks associated with online activity and the need to overcome different rules on the protection of personal data, which could distort competition. The major provision is one which explains that the regulation does not apply to a ‘purely personal or household activity’, including social networking and online activity. This is to be interpreted in the sense that data protection and supervision do not have as a purpose safeguarding the online privacy of individuals. This is significant since many influential commentators have long held that competition law should not become a regulatory tool for intervention in the area of personal data protection. Nonetheless, the regulatory approach to data processing aims primarily to protect employees from businesses that process personal data and that could lawfully disclose such data to the competent authorities in the wake of various investigations. However, the present framework can easily be abused or misused. It is broad on potential data subjects, as it includes ‘persons possessing relevant information or contacts’. So anyone’s personal data could be saved for unknown purposes.
The paper moves on to critically review the position of mere silence or inaction in the case of default settings of social networks or web browsers to review the position of informed consent under the new regulation. The paper argues that recent theories of informed consent place particular emphasis upon the degree of sophistication and the length of privacy policies, rather than affirmative box ticking. There are hidden ‘small prints’ or pitfalls, such as ‘improving customer experience’, which make it possible to process personal data without a just cause.
The paper examines Windows 10, Google, Facebook, Linked-In, Instagram, Snapchat, and Whisper’s privacy policies to establish compliance with data protection and reveal which distinctive categories of personal data are being processed. Existing evidence of price discrimination will be used to extract the pitfalls associated with social platforms based on trust and the potential abuse of consumer confidence that such data is safe from being shared with third parties. Although there are warnings regarding the selling of data, the paper will remain focused on the big data owned by the three main companies, namely, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. The selling of personal data could potentially lead competition authorities to uncover the bid-rigging of markets for personal data, which could extend competition intervention to include more ‘secretive’ social media, such as Whisper, Snapchat, or Instagram. Installed software and browsers can also be used as a means to improve users’ experience, but the processing of sensitive and confidential data has little to do with this purpose.
The paper agrees with the merits of the dissenting opinions by the late Commissioner Rosch and Commissioner Jones Harbour, albeit the paper argues that the EU Commission’s intervention is warranted by the enactment of the new rules on data protection, in particular, by what these rules have now left outside their material scope. Relying on Stiglitz’s theory of economic inequality, the paper argues in favour of considering data as the new currency in two-sided markets. While Google’s sale of its users’ privacy to third parties has famously been described as ‘Googlestroika’, namely, a ‘privacy derivative’, this zero-priced product remains problematic through the sharing of personal data with third parties.
In conclusion, the paper adds the abuse of personal data to the non-exhaustive list of abuse of dominance. The latter happens on online platforms, which are outside the scope of data protection laws. Such platforms misuse the trust and confidence of individual users by making them reveal personal data and by encouraging users to voluntarily consent to the transfer of personal data to third parties. Personal preferences or choices are later shared with advertisers and sellers and used to engage in price discrimination. Ultimately, data protection laws are useless in practice, as they solely highlight the need to educate consumers and raise awareness. There is, therefore, one active remedy left: the intervention of competition policy. Indeed, online price discrimination and booking manipulation based on users’ personal data is now a social norm.

US hotel chain Marriott International is on track to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its cash and share purchase of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The deal, currently worth $12.5 billion, will put Marriott’s brands including the Ritz-Carlton and Starwood’s Sheraton and Westin chains together to create the world’s largest hotel company and is one of many in the sector this year.
Consolidation has picked up pace amid rising competition from new rivals such as Airbnb and online travel sites such as booking.com and Tripadvisor. The merged company will have more than 5,500 hotels with 1.1 million rooms worldwide.
The European Commission has not called for a “state of play” meeting, the person said.
The EU competition enforcer only sets up such meetings when it has concerns a deal may hurt competition, giving parties an opportunity to offer concessions during a preliminary review or face a full-scale investigation.

801,"June 14, 2016",UK: Price comparison sites to be investigated by competition watchdog,"
The competition watchdog is to investigate suspected market rigging by energy price comparison websites.
The investigation will examine whether websites agreed not to compete with each other when consumers searched on Google for the best deals.
The Competition and Markets Authority said: “The CMA is investigating a suspected breach of competition law by some price comparison websites that offer energy tariff comparisons in relation to paid online search advertising.”
But in a bizarre twist, the initial investigation by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been switched to the CMA after Ofgem uncovered earlier dealings by its own staff with the comparison sites that could have called into question the impartiality of the investigation.
Ofgem said it found that two or more of the comparison sites had, since 2010, “been parties to an agreement or concerted practice relating to bidding and/or negative matching for search advertising which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.”
These practices included “agreements not to compete in relation to particular search terms used for the purposes of online search advertising”.
Negative matching is when an advertiser indicates to a search engine operator such as Google that it does not want its website to appear in the search results for specific keywords.

Free speech institutions help us read, watch, access, write, perform, display, transform what has been written, and publish what is newly or previously written or transformed. Yet copyright law potentially outlaws the unauthorized reading, watching, performing, transforming, or publishing of existing work. Fair use shields free speech institutions from some claims of infringement based on their mediating role.
Emerging copyright norms could harm the freedom and diversity of the Internet, however. Associations of media and Internet corporations have become prolific sources of proposed norms governing Internet speech and communication. They asked the Obama administration to pressure Web sites such as YouTube to agree to a series of Principles for User-Generated Content Services, which would delete (or filter) quotations of media content in audio or audiovisual form, often without regard to fair use. An Open Book Alliance filed briefs in federal court arguing that Google should be restricted from contracting with publishers to create digital libraries of books. The Associated Press and Media Bloggers Association proposed that fair use be restricted online in ways that are contrary to established custom in print and on television, as well as online. Media corporations requested a National Broadband Plan that endorsed filtering out copyrighted material.
This article explores how negotiations between copyright industry trade associations and online services present a risk to free speech institutions. Specifically, the norms advanced by the associations are often framed so as to preserve revenue streams at expense of Internet users’ freedom of expression. Industry groups frequently characterize as “piracy” or a “threat” what courts or legislators would regard as First-Amendment protected, transformative fair use, outside the scope of copyright or trademark rights, or free competition under antitrust law. Moreover, such negotiations may increase the price of information works while reducing the quality of Internet services, including their interactivity and accessibility to the poor and those on fixed incomes. This article therefore describes the problem of non-price-related restraints on upstart Internet and social media companies, such as a requirement to filter out quotations. Such restraints do not burden incumbents, which typically do not confront prepublication filtering of their content.
Antitrust cases and constitutional doctrine are slow to evolve, however. For this reason, the article calls for reform of the fair use privilege of free speech institutions in three key areas: burden of proof, due process, and liability standards. The reforms are intended to serve core constitutional values: liberty of expression, communicative privacy, separation of powers, and the rule of law. Other scholars have proposed reforms to the fair use doctrine that alter procedures, focus on quantitative thresholds of use, or protect a subset of free speech institutions’ activity. This article proposes reforming the statute to shield fair users from liability if they do not harm the copyright holder, and to fix evidentiary problems which they face in proving a lack of harm. The proposed reforms will amend the fair use statute to prevent free speech institutions from confronting an impossible standard, i.e. a burden of disproving potential harm in aggregate.

803,"May 30, 2016",UE: Se avecina multa record a fabricantes de camiones,"
Se espera que la Unión Europea anunciará la multa por cartelización más grande de su historia en los próximos días, sancionando a los principales fabricantes de camiones de Europa a causa de una supuesta manipulación de precios, además de haber retrasado intencionalmente la introducción de nuevas tecnologías de reducción de emisiones contaminantes. 
Margrethe Vestager, comisionada de competencia de la Unión, presentó la lista de cargos en contra de DAF, Daimler, Iveco, Scania, MAN y Volvo/Renault en 2014. Cuatro de éstas empresas ya han apartado fondos en preparación de una fuerte multa, sumando aproximadamente $2,600 millones de dólares.
Fuentes cercanas a las deliberaciones han dicho que se espera un anuncio de multa definitiva este mismo año, quizá en las próximas semanas, a no ser que la comisión de marcha atrás. 
La posible multa sobrepasaría con mucho el record actual de la comisión, el cual es de 1,400 millones de euros, dictado en un caso de cartelización en el mercado de tubos de monitor para computadora en 2012. La multa también sobrepasa las sanciones aplicadas a cárteles en las tasas de interés del euro y el yen. Vestager ha comparado el caso contra los fabricantes de camiones con su célebre enfrentamiento al gigante de la informática Google, o al monopolio exportador ruso de Gazprom. 
La investigación de la comisión se centra en las acciones de las seis empresas entre 1997 y 2011. Las acusaciones describen varios mecanismos mediante los cuales los fabricantes lograban coordinar sus precios. Además, y de gran resonancia tras el escándalo de Volkswagen, las empresas también han sido acusadas de haber acordado “el momento y el nivel de aumento de precios para la introducción de nuevas tecnologías de emisiones.”

804,"May 29, 2016",UK: Competition watchdog attacks cloud storage providers,"
Cloud storage providers are treating customers unfairly and risk users losing access to their photos and other personal possessions, the competition regulator said.
An investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority found providers offered contract terms and practices that could breach consumer law.
About three in 10 adults in the UK use cloud services to store personal items such as photos, music, films and other documents on a remote server. Most services are free with smartphones and tablets. Providers include Apple iCloud, GoogleDrive, and Dropbox.
The CMA said that while cloud storage was a valuable service it was unhappy with some areas, including the ability of providers to change contract terms at any time, for any reason, and without giving notice.
Nisha Arora, the senior director of consumer at the CMA, said: “Cloud storage offers a convenient means of keeping family photos, favourite music and films and important documents safe, and accessing them quickly from any device.
“Our review found that people find these services really valuable. However, we also heard some complaints resulting from unfair terms in contracts. If left unchanged, these terms could result in people losing access to their treasured possessions or facing unexpected charges.”

805,"May 29, 2016",EU: Record cartel fine on truck makers could be coming,"
The EU is set to issue the biggest cartel fine in its history, punishing Europe’s largest truckmakers over charges that they fixed prices and delayed the introduction of new emission technologies.
Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, issued the original charge sheet against DAF, Daimler, Iveco, Scania, MAN and Volvo/Renault in 2014. Four of those companies have now set aside provisions amounting to $2.6bn.
People close to the discussions on penalties say that they are expecting the fine this year, possibly within weeks, unless there is a reversal by the European Commission.
The expected fine easily outstrips the EU’s previous record of €1.4bn for a television and computer monitor tubes cartel in 2012, and dwarfs those imposed over euro and yen interest rate derivative cartels. Ms Vestager has compared the action against the truckmakers to her landmark antitrust showdowns with Google, the US search group, and Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly.
Her probe focuses on the behaviour of the six companies between 1997 and 2011, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. The charges describe several ways in which the manufacturers allegedly colluded on price. Most sensitively after the Volkswagen scandal, the companies are also accused of agreeing the “timing and price increase levels for the introduction of new emission technologies”.

Restrictions on Innovation in EU Competition Law
This paper discusses, in light of the practice of the European Commission, the different ways in which innovation considerations can be introduced in EU competition law. In some cases, such considerations have played an indirect role in the analysis. These are instances in which harm to innovation has been presumed or inferred by proxy from the effects of a practice on the competitive process (for instance, the foreclosure of a rival or the creation of a near monopoly).

A Competition Perspective on Apportionment of Patent Infringement Remedies –
By John Dubiansky1 (Federal Trade Commission)
Edited by Koren W. Wong-Ervin, Director of the Global Antitrust Institute and Adjunct Professor at George Mason University School of Law
Introduction
In a series of recent decisions computing damages for patent infringement,[i] the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applied the century-old rule of apportionment articulated by the Supreme Court in 1884 in Garretson v. Clark.[ii] The rule addresses damages when only one sub-component of a multi-component product infringes the asserted patent. It limits damages to the “value attributable to the infringing features of the product, and no more,”[iii] to avoid “improper[] compensate[ion] for non-infringing components.”[iv] As with any other remedy doctrine, apportionment can affect competition in technology markets because court-awarded damages provide a benchmark used in patent valuation and license negotiation.[v] A damages rule that yields unpredictable results can frustrate attempts to agree on value through bilateral negotiation, impeding licensing and leading to unnecessary litigation.
Background
Modern products—particularly in the information, communications and technology sectors—may embody hundreds or thousands of patents.[vi] Isolating the contribution of any one patent’s claimed technology to the end product can prove analytically challenging both for the courts ...

To settle its own potential liability, Sony will also be contributing $13 million to plaintiffs.
To settle claims that it struck a secret deal with other studios not to suppress wages and work opportunities in the animation industry, Sony Pictures has agreed to pay out $13 million. Perhaps more intriguingly, Sony is promising to help out plaintiffs who continue to pursue Disney in an ongoing putative class action.
The lawsuit emanates from a pact that George Lucas reached with Steve Jobs in the 1980s. At the time, the two agreed to restrain competition for skilled labor at both Pixar and Lucasfilm. Over time, more companies are said to have jointed into a “gentleman’s agreement” not to cold call each other’s employees, provide notifications when providing job offers, and make no counteroffers. In 2010, after an antitrust investigation, the Justice Department reached a settlementwith Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe and Pixar that forbade the anti-poaching pacts. Then, civil lawsuits began. The tech companies made a $415 million settlement with former employees while Pixar and Lucasfilm arrived at a $9 million deal.
In Sept. 2014, more lawsuits came against Disney’s Pixar and Lucasfilm units, Sony Pictures, Blue Sky Studios and others. The actions were eventually consolidated, and US District Court judge Lucy Koh ruled against a motion to dismiss.

Las reuniones representan una ampliación de una investigación iniciada el año pasado.

De hecho, la FTC parece querer utilizar parte de la evidencia utilizada por las autoridades europeas en su propio caso.

The FTC is examining issues similar to European regulators, who last week charged Google with improperly using Android’s status as the world’s most popular smartphone operating system to force device makers and wireless carriers to favor Google’s search engine and other services. Indeed, the FTC is hoping to access some of the evidence behind European regulators’ case, a person said.

Appropriability and the European Commission’s Android Investigation
Abstract:        This paper seeks to ascertain whether Google’s Android licensing terms, which are currently under scrutiny from the European Commission, could be excused under an innovation defense framework. The paper starts by analyzing Google’s business model with regard to its Android OS. It then identifies the Commission’s main concerns. It argues that Google is simply pursuing a sensible appropriation strategy. Finally, it puts forward a framework which hinges on the concept of “appropriability”, and tentatively applies it to Google’s behavior.

European Union Competition Law, Intellectual Property Law and Standardization
Damien Geradin (George Mason University School of Law)
Abstract:      This paper provides an overview of the efforts of the European Commission to identify and, when necessary, challenge anticompetitive behaviour with respect to standardization and the licensing of standardized technologies, as well as the case-law of the CJEU on the same subject. The paper starts by discussing the 1992 Communication on Intellectual Property Rights and Standardization, which was the first important contribution of the Commission on the complex interface between standardization, intellectual property and competition law. It then analyses the first major investigations that the Commission made into the licensing conduct of SEP holders, i.e. the proceedings against Rambus and Qualcomm. Next, it discusses the 2010 Commission Guidelines on horizontal cooperation agreements, which contain a chapter dedicated to the application of EU competition rules to standardization agreements. The paper then examines how the Commission has dealt with mergers involving firms holding large SEP portfolios, such as its Google/MMI and Microsoft/Nokia decisions respectively adopted in 2012 and 2013. The paper also analyses the Commission decisions of 2014 against Motorola and Samsung regarding the use of injunctions by SEP holders to enforce their patents against standard implementers. It also analyses the Huawei v. ZTE judgment adopted by the CJEU in 2015, in which the CJEU was asked to determine the circumstances in which SEP holders could seek injunctions against standard implementers without breaching Article 102 TFEU. The paper then discusses several forms of licensing or litigation conduct, which can be problematic under EU competition law, but which have not yet been dealt with by the EU courts or the Commission. Finally, the paper concludes.

Many of the most dynamic public companies, from Alibaba to Facebook to Visa, and the most valuable start-ups, such as Airbnb and Uber, are matchmakers that connect one group of customers with another group of customers. Economists call matchmakers multisided platforms because they provide physical or virtual platforms for multiple groups to get together. Dating sites connect people with potential matches, for example, and ride-sharing apps do the same for drivers and riders.

Although matchmakers have been around for millennia, they’re becoming more and more popular—and profitable—due to dramatic advances in technology, and a lot of companies that have managed to crack the code of this business model have become today’s power brokers.  Three of the five largest firms by market cap are matchmakers as are 7 of the 10 largest unicorns, which are startup companies valued at over a billion dollars.
Following Dr. Evans’s presentation Dr. Evans will then moderate a panel of executives from Uber and Visa, a leading Singapore startup, and the Computer and Communications Industry Association. They will be joined by two of the foremost antitrust and regulatory experts in the world.

Multinational companies will be forced to disclose profits earned and taxes paid in Europe and the world’s shadiest fiscal havens, under proposals announced on Tuesday by EU regulators.
The European commission wants all large companies to publish a country-by-country breakdown of profits, taxes, employees and turnover in all 28 member states of the EU, as well as some of the most problematic tax havens.
American and Chinese companies with a subsidiary in Europe would also be subject to the transparency drive, as the rules would hit all global corporations with a large presence in Europe.
If agreed, the new disclosure requirements would shine a spotlight on some of the world’s most powerful companies, including Apple, Google and Starbucks, which have been caught up in a public furore over their tax bills.
Lord Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, said the new rules would give the public “a clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying tax where they make their profits”.
The proposals would be good for competition, he said, by levelling the playing field between large corporations and smaller firms. “By using complicated tax arrangements, some multinationals can pay nearly a third less tax than companies that only operate in one country.”

Systemic Efficiencies in ICT: Evidence from Recent Cases
Konstantinos Stylianou (University of Leeds)
Abstract:     This paper introduces the concept of systemic efficiencies and applies it to three case studies: the ongoing Google Android investigation in the US and EU, the recent IBM mainframe cases in the US and EU, and the i-mode mobile Internet access architecture in Japan and the US and EU.
Systemic efficiencies are enhancements in the production process or operation of large complex systems, commonly found in the information and communication sector. They involve and affect multiple and dispersed parts of large complex systems whose components are intricately interconnected in a way that changes in one part may trigger readjustments in other parts. Because they draw from multiple parts, they require a holistic overview of the system in which they are interwoven, which makes them harder to identify and appreciate, as evidenced by the lack of adequate consideration in antitrust and regulatory proceedings, including the Google Android and IBM cases this paper will discuss.
Systemic efficiencies can attract regulatory and antitrust scrutiny because they usually emerge through and because of pervasive control over the system and the production process in the industry. Systems organization scholarship, notably from Sanchez & Mahoney, Baldwin & Clark, Langlois, Richardson, and Schilling, suggest that control is necessary as the focusing mechanism that brings together the various parts implicated in the systemic efficiency, without which the attempted combination, novelty, innovation, readjustment or other efficiency might collapse under its own complexity.
At the same time, the fact that systemic efficiencies are so integrative and extensive means that they can bring about dramatic innovations in the industry, such that would not occur at a smaller scale or insular environments. This paper highlights two main benefits: a) the morphing of systemic efficiencies into systemic innovations, which are characterized as “game changers” and can result in new technologies, products, services or even new markets; b) the raising of total welfare through ecosystem value creation and maintenance, a result that is obtained through the synthesis of Baldwin & Woodard’s platform architecture theory and Iansiti & Levien’s keystone firms theory and insights from leveraging (in)compatibility.
Three case studies — i-mode in Japan, US and EU, Google Android in the US and EU, and IBM mainframes in US and EU — will be used to demonstrate how systemic efficiencies manifest themselves and the value they contribute: a) i-mode, a pre- and early-3G Internet access architecture, was a monumental success in Japan, but a failure in Europe and the US, largely because NTT DoCoMo was the only telecom operator who coordinated the multiple parts of the i-mode system (app developers, protocols, payment system, hardware requirements etc) in a coherent way to allow an efficient cooperation among them to emerge; b) a systemic efficiencies analysis of the ongoing Google investigations would suggest that Google’s Android strategy can also be explained by its aim to prevent the extensive fragmentation that plagues the Android ecosystem in at least three regards: the update process, security, and user experience; c) in a series of recent cases against IBM’s mainframes tying and refusal to supply practices, antitrust courts missed an opportunity to identify and appreciate one of the main benefits of IBM’s strategy, namely the maintenance and advancement of the mainframe industry’s dynamism over the course of four decades, through the evolution of the system of IBM mainframes that spawned various clones and complementary actors.

The Magic of China IP Misuse Guidelines – By He Jing & Hou Lei (AnJie Law Firm)
The drafting process of various China IP misuse guidelines, circulated by National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), have taken up lots of attention in recent months.  The multiple editions of the drafts, which are all made public to local and global legal community, attracted rounds of discussions and submissions among professional groups and government agencies.  At the same time, the access to the other two draft IP misuse guidelines, being drafted by State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), is restrictive.  Now, it is believed that all the work drafts of the IP Misuse Guidelines have been sent, if not, will soon be sent to the State Council Anti-monopoly Commission for review and consolidation.  We may anticipate something for public comments later this year.
The intensive drafting work has contrasted with somewhat less aggressive antitrust enforcement activities involving IP in China.  People may wonder whether China intends to make some adjustment through such rule-making process, or this is simply silence before next storm.
This article is intended to examine the motivations, the history and current status of the China IP Misuse Guidelines that are being made by multiple regulatory authorities.  In ...

Posted by Social Science Research Network
The Internet of Platforms and Walled Gardens: Implications for Openness and Neutrality
Rob Frieden (Pennsylvania State University)
Abstract:     This paper will examine developments in the Internet marketplace that limit and condition access in light of growing incentives to offer prioritized interconnection at a premium price. Commercially-driven interconnection and compensation arrangements support biased networks rather than open ones. Single ventures, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix have exploited, “winner take all” networking externalities resulting in the creation of dominant platforms and walled gardens. Advocates for network neutrality claim that limited and “pay to play” access will threaten a competitive marketplace of ideas by imposing higher costs on unaffiliated, disfavored and cash-poor content providers. Opponents argue that Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) should have the flexibility to customize services and accrue marketplace rewards for superior products and services.
The paper identifies four types of government responses to price and quality of service discrimination that can exploit, or remedy choke points within the Internet ecosystem where large volumes of traffic have to traverse a single ISP network, or service provider platform. Governments can refrain from regulating access and accept aspects of market concentration as proper rewards to ventures offering desirable content and carriage services. Alternatively, they can impose access neutrality requirements to offset market-driven concentration and dominance. Between these poles, governments can apply antitrust/competition policy remedies, or rely on expert regulatory agencies to respond to complaints.

820,"March 16, 2016",EU: Lawmakers grill multinationals on tax structures,"
European lawmakers on Tuesday grilled multinationals, including AlphabetInc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and McDonald’s Corp., on their tax structures in Europe, raising political pressure on the firms as governments across the bloc attempt to wring out more corporate tax revenue.
In a sometimes tense session, legislators accused the companies of using complex structures to funnel tens of billions of dollars of profit out of Europe without paying what lawmakers argued was a fair amount of tax.
“Does this activity embarrass Alphabet or you? Do you feel embarrassed?” Paul Tang, a Dutch member of the Socialists and Democrats alliance, asked a Google executive.
Company representatives shot back that their structures followed current laws and it was up to legislators to change them. “We make use of tax incentives, tax structures that are well known, that are widely accessible and used by most multinationals,” said Adam Cohen, head of economic policy for Google in Europe.

821,"March 16, 2016",EU: EC seeks more info from Ireland on Apple tax case,"
The European Commission is still seeking information from Ireland before taking a decision on its investigation into Apple’s tax arrangements in the country. The EC wrote to Irish authorities last week, seeking further information pertaining to the case, the Irish Times reports. It follows a submission by Ireland’s Revenue Commissioners of additional information to the EC in late January.
The EC first questioned Ireland’s advance tax rulings with Apple in June 2013, and in September 2014 it opened a formal complaint amid concerns the deal with Ireland violates EU state aid rules and the low tax paid by Apple could be putting it at an unfair competitive advantage. Despite recent speculation that a verdict could be delivered in April, the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager said a week ago: “Don’t hold your breath”.
On 15 March, Apple defended its tax practices at a hearing in the European Parliament in Brussels, claiming it has paid “every cent of tax” that is due in Ireland. Addressing members of the European Parliament’s Special Committee on Tax Rulings, Apple’s Cathy Kearney, vice-president for operations based in Cork, said the company’s tax arrangements in Ireland did not involve state aid. She said the Irish government shared the view of the company, which has been based in Ireland since 1980. Representatives from Google, Ikea and McDonald’s also were quizzed by MEPs at the special hearing.

News Corp’s chief executive will meet the EU antitrust chief this week, the company said, with the focus expected to be on the EU’s investigation into whether Internet search engine Google abused its dominance.
CEO Robert Thomson will meet European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on March 10 for the third time, a News Corp spokesman said, without providing details. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed the meeting.
The European Commission opened a case against Google in late 2010, but has yet to decide whether to penalise the company.
News Corp, controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the owner of the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins, is one of more than a dozen companies that have urged the European Commission to act against Google.

823,"March 7, 2016",Germany: Vestager says regulator well suited to investigate Facebook,"
Germany, which launched an investigation into social network Facebook last week, is well placed to handle the case, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Monday.
The comments by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager came after the German competition office said last week it was investigating Facebook for suspected abuse of market power over breaches of data protection laws.
The German cartel office will examine whether Facebook users were properly informed about the type and extent of personal data collected by the company, and if this was in line with German antitrust rules.
Vestager, whose antitrust cases include a number of high-profile technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple, welcomed the German investigation.
“It shouldn’t only be the Commission doing things that are new in terms of developing competition law,” Vestager told reporters when asked if the EU was going to act against Facebook, or let Germany take the lead
“They are well suited to do it. And since they both do it with the German and European perspective, then basically they do it in a way which is beneficial to all,” she said.

Autoridades de competencia alemanas han iniciado procedimientos en contra de Facebook, buscando determinar si la red social ha abusado su poder de mercado e infringido las reglas de protección de datos locales. 
En su declaración, la Bundeskartellamt dijo que existen sospechas iniciales de que los términos de usuario presentados por Facebook violan lo previsto en la ley de protección de datos. “El uso de términos y condiciones ilegales por parte de Facebook podría representar una imposición abusiva de condiciones sobre sus usuarios” dijo la autoridad.
La Bundeskartellamt ha dicho que examinará la posible conexión entre la posición dominante de Facebook en el mercado de redes sociales y el uso de dichas cláusulas. 
El tema de la protección  de datos ha ganado relevancia con el surgimiento de Facebook y Google como grandes empresas dedicadas al manejo de datos. La forma de regular la industria ha sido una preocupación particular de los reguladores europeos y autoridades de protección de datos. 
La Bundeskartellamt ha dicho que Facebook recoge una gran cantidad de datos personales de diversos usuarios y por varias fuentes y, al crear perfiles de sus usuarios, permite a sus clientes dirigir de forma más eficiente su publicidad. Señaló que aunque los usuarios primero deben acceder a que Facebook recopile y utilice sus datos al aceptar los términos y condiciones, resulta difícil “comprender y evaluar el alcance de este acuerdo.”

825,"March 6, 2016",Germany:  BASF considering bid for DuPont,"
BASF SE is working with advisers and financing banks to examine the merits of making a counter bid for DuPont the $55 billion chemical company that agreed to a merger with Dow Chemical in December, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Ludwigshafen, Germany-based chemical producer hasn’t made a decision yet about proceeding with an offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. No formal approach has been made to DuPont, the people said.
BASF, which has been working with advisers since last year to explore a bid for DuPont, held talks with the US company before it agreed to merge with Dow, said the people. Those talks didn’t progress, the people said.
BASF is the world’s third-largest producer of weed-killers, insecticides and other pesticides, after Syngenta AG and Bayer AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buying DuPont would add to its agricultural chemical portfolio and give it the second-biggest producer of crop seeds, such as corn genetically modified to withstand insects and herbicides. Monsanto is the largest seed company.

826,"March 2, 2016",Germany: Competition authorities investigate Facebook,"
German competition authorities have launched proceedings against Facebook to investigate if the social network abused its market power by infringing data protection rules.
A statement by the Bundeskartellamt said there was an initial suspicion that Facebook’s conditions of use were in violation of German data protection provisions.
“Facebook’s use of unlawful terms and conditions could represent an abusive imposition of unfair conditions on users,” the statement said.
The Bundeskartellamt said it would examine a possible connection between Facebook’s dominant position in social networks and the use of such clauses.
The issue of data protection has grown in importance as internet companies such as Facebook and Google have become big, data-driven businesses. How to regulate the industry as it has become more pervasive is a concern for European regulators and data protection authorities.
The Bundeskartellamt said Facebook collected large amounts of personal user data from various sources and, by creating user profiles, enabled its customers to use more targeted advertising. It said users had to first agree to Facebook collecting and using their data when they accepted its terms of service, but it was difficult for them “to understand and assess the scope of the agreement”.

827,"February 23, 2016",España: Telefónica y Vodafone exigen reglas parejas a regulador,"
Dos de los mayores operadores de telefonía y telecomunicación en España, Vodafone y Telefónica, han lanzado un mensaje a los reguladores europeos, exigiendo que se dicten reglas claras para todos los operadores de telecomunicaciones, así como “competencia e inversión” en el sector. Por su parte,  Telefónica reclamó por que la legislación al respecto otorgue el “Mismo servicio, mismas reglas, misma protección”.
Sin nombrar a otros operadores y competidores, tanto Vodafone como Telefónica han resaltado la importancia de poner en marcha una ordenación del mercado digital europeo. El problema principal que preocupa a ambas siendo la competencia con grandes gigantes tecnológicos como Google y Facebook, quienes ofrecen servicios que compiten contra aquellos provistos por las telefónicas, explotando una red por la que no pagan. 
Vittorio Colao, Presidente de la inglesa Vodafone, insistió en la importancia de que las nuevas reglas permitan “inversiones y competencia, porque no son excluyentes”. Vodafone, en el periodo 2014-2016, ha desembolsado 19,000 millones de libras en su inversión en sistemas de red (4G y 5G) y en otras áreas como las plataformas de la nube o el llamado ‘Internet de las cosas’.
Colao concluyó con la importancia de luchar contra los monopolios, sin nombrar a ningún competidor específico. Sin embargo, fue claro en su petición: “Ningún actor dominante debe dirigir el mercado; no se debe permitir posiciones dominantes”.

828,"February 23, 2016",Spain: Telefónica and Vodafone demand ‘equal rules’ for telecomm,"
Two of Spain’s major telephone operators, Vodafone and Telefónica, have issued a joint message to European regulators, demanding a rewrite of competition rules in order to ensure clear and equal regulation for all telecommunications companies, as well as encouraging “competition and investment” in the sector. Telefónica specifically called for new legislation that will provide “Same service, Same rules, Same protections.”
While not naming other competitors, Telefónica joined Vodafone in highlighting the need for a re-structuring of Europe’s digital markets. The main issue identified by the companies, while not explicitly stated, was the threat from technology giants such as Google and Facebook, who they say offer services that compete directly with their own while using networks they haven’t paid to install. 
Vittorio Colao, CEO of British-based Vodafone, insisted on the need for new rules that will allow for “investment and competition, which aren’t mutually exclusive”. Vodafone has invested over 19 billion pounds in 2014-2016 in developing its 4g and 5g networks, as well as other high-connectivity areas such as cloud computing and ‘the internet of things’. 
Colao concluded with remarks on the importance of fighting monopolies, while again refusing to name any specific competitors. However, he made a clear request that “No dominant actor be allowed to run the market; dominant positions must not be allowed.”

US multinationals such as Google, Facebook and Amazon will be forced to publicly disclose their earnings and tax bills in Europe, under legislation being drafted by the EU executive.
The European commission is to table legislation in early April aimed at making the world’s largest multinational corporations open their tax arrangements with EU governments to full public scrutiny.
According to three senior EU officials familiar with the proposals, initial conclusions from an ongoing impact assessment have found in favour of obliging large corporations to reveal their profits and the tax they pay in every country in which they operate within the EU.
The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is said to be in favour of the initiative. A consensus has formed around making the rules apply to the world’s biggest conglomerates, including those from the US, the officials said.
Eurocrats “are currently finalising the impact assessment work. It’s likely there will be some form of legislative initiative announced for the beginning of April … for public country-by-country reporting,” said a source.

830,"February 8, 2016",UE: Vestager rechaza críticas de EEUU por casos contra Apple y Starbucks,"
Margrethe Vestager, a la cabeza de la agencia de competencia Europea, reiteró sus intenciones de ir tras Apple, Starbucks y McDonalds para deshacer los tratos preferenciales que tienen éstas empresas dentro del continente. La funcionaria rechazó también las críticas emitidas por Estados Unidos a estas acciones en contra de empresas multinacionales. 
La Comisionada hizo sus declaraciones a escasos días de que el funcionario del Departamento de Tesorería de EEUU, Robert Stack, se reuniese con ella en un esfuerzo por detener la campaña que dirige Vestager por terminar con acuerdos impositivos que considera demasiado favorables. 
Vestager indicó no haber sido convencida por los argumentos de Stack, los cuales son similares a aquellos expresados en diciembre en el Senado. “Es el mismo argumento que hemos oído antes.” dijo a los reporteros reunidos por la conferencia del Global Competition Law Centre. “Tal y como es el derecho de las autoridades de EEUU el cobrar impuestos cuando son repatriadas las ganancias, también es derecho de las autoridades europeas el cobrar impuestos por el dinero generado en nuestros países miembros.”
Las empresas han negado haber violado ley alguna. Starbucks fue ordenado a pagar 30 millones de Euros en impuestos atrasados a Países Bajos en Octubre, mientras que Apple podría enfrentar una sanción aún más grande en Irlanda, en un caso que se decidirá esta primavera. 
Vestager ha dicho que es aún muy pronto para saber si se investigará a fondo el acuerdo alcanzado por Google con las autoridades británicas, por 130 millones de libras. El Partido Nacionalista Escocés ha presentado una queja formal ante la comisión a causa de éste acuerdo.

831,"February 1, 2016","EU: Vestager rejects US criticism of Apple, Starbucks tax cases","
Europe’s antitrust chief signalled on Monday her determination to go after Apple, Starbucks and McDonald’s over their sweetheart tax deals in the bloc, dismissing US criticism of her crackdown on the companies.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s comments come three days after senior US Treasury official Robert Stack met her team in the latest lobbying effort against her clampdown on tax deals involving US. as well as EU companies.
Vestager, who was not at the meeting, indicated she had not been swayed by Stack’s arguments, similar to those made to a Senate committee last December.
“It is the same argument as we have heard before,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Global Competition Law Centre.
“Just as it is an obvious right for US tax authorities to tax revenues when they are repatriated, it is also for European tax authorities to tax money that is made in the member states.”
All the companies have denied wrongdoing. While Starbucks was told to pay up to 30 million euros in back taxes to the Netherlands in October last year, Apple could end up with a bigger bill to the Irish. A decision is likely to come in the spring.
Vestager also said it was too early to decide whether to investigate Google’s 130 million pound settlement with British tax authorities. The Scottish National Party has formally complained about it to the European Commission.

832,"February 1, 2016",EU: Vestager considers lower fines for companies that cooperate,"
Companies that admit to breaking the law could be rewarded with lower fines to help speed up anti-competitive investigations, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
The European Commission typically takes several years to wrap up cases, which critics say is not helpful for consumers or competitors.
Its investigation into complaints that Google allegedly abuses its dominance of online search results has dragged on for nearly six years, and a case against Russian gas company Gazprom is also unresolved after six years.
“We should reward companies that admit to having broken the law, especially when they come up with remedies to make the markets more competitive, or companies that provide evidence voluntarily,” Vestager told a conference organised by the Global Competition Law Centre.
“Because the faster we can wrap up a case and restore competition to the market, the less consumers will suffer. And to get that result, I think it’s worth cutting the fines we impose.”
Vestager said the fines could be reduced by more than 10 percent, with the size depending on the level of cooperation.

Un senador del partido demócrata ha acusado a las autoridades europeas de levantar casos por competencia para disimular sus propios intereses en el sector de la tecnología. La acusación es el último capítulo en una larga serie de conflictos entre gigantes tecnológicos americanos y gobiernos europeos por temas de privacidad. 
El senador Mark Warner de Virginia entabló una fuerte discusión con la ex-comisionada digital de la UE, Neelie Kroes, con quien compartió el escenario durante el Consumer Electronics Show de Las Vegas. El senador cuestionó los motivos detrás de los planes de la comunidad europea por establecer reglamentos de privacidad unificados a lo largo del continente. 
“Las acciones de la UE podrían constituir una política industrial, en la cual dicen ‘Queremos apoyar a más empresas tecnológicas europeas, simulando temas de competencia’, o alegar motivos de seguridad para decir ‘tenemos que colocar los servidores en lugares específicos para localizar la información.” Dijo el senador. 
Kroes estuvo al frente del caso de la UE en contra de Microsoft, así como varios casos más durante su década como parte de la Comisión Europea. El caso ayudó a sentar precedentes para la investigación actual en contra de Google. Microsoft finalmente fue multado con 1,640 millones de Euros por llevar a cabo prácticas anticompetitivas.

A Democratic senator has accused Europe of using antitrust cases to disguise its own technology interests, the latest exchange in an ongoing tussle between American tech giants and European governments over privacy.
Virginia’s Mark Warner locked horns with former European digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, who appeared alongside him at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The senator questioned the motives behind the EU’s plans for pan-European data privacy rules.
“The actions of the EU may have been industrial policy saying, ‘We want to try and support more European tech in the guise of anti-trust’, or for security concerns, saying, ‘We have to locate servers in certain places in terms of locating information’,” he said.
“That is more about 20th century nationalistic policy than about technology.”

Kroes headed the EU’s high-profile case against Microsoft, among others, during her decade-long tenure at the European commission, a case that set a precedent for the current antitrust investigation against Google. Microsoft was eventually fined a total of €1.64bn for anticompetitive practices.

841,"December 24, 2015",An Introduction to Network Industries,"
This three session course discusses Network Industries:
Networks have frequently been at the heart of the great regulated industries of the day. This was true of railroads and telegraphs and is just as true of today’s natural gas industry, the electricity industry and telecommunications. The modern treatment of network industries focuses on approaches to regulating natural monopolies. Many of these industries are organized around physical networks, while others turn on platform competition and virtual networks.
This course will serve as an introduction to the law and economics of these industries. It will be based on the full-quarter course that Prof. Picker teaches at the University of Chicago Law School

842,"December 24, 2015",It Takes 2 to Tango: Competition Policy Analysis for 2-Sided Markets,"

Two-sided markets is one of the hottest areas in economics and competition policy. Some businesses operate platforms that connect two groups of customers, help those customers interact, and in doing so create value. Economists and antitrust practitioners have known for a long time that advertising-supported media had two groups of customers: the readers and the advertisers. But only since 2000 have economists understood that having two groups of distinct customers is a common feature of many businesses, old and new, and that this feature has tremendous implications for the economics of these businesses. From shopping malls to computer-operating systems to payment schemes to search-based advertising, two-sided issues loom large.
It is now widely recognized by antitrust and economic scholars that analyzing competitive practices such as mergers and abuse of dominance in these two-sided industries requires special consideration. This course, by two of the leading contributors to the two-sided literature, will provide a basic introduction to two-sided markets and then show how the concepts can be applied for market definition and for analyzing monopolization and abuse of dominance cases.
This course consists of the following three classes:
2SM1A: The New Economics of 2-Sided Markets
2SM1B: Market Definition & Market Power with 2 Customer Sides
2BM1C: Analysis of Abuse & Monopolization in 2-Sided Markets

Since 2012, when the Commission launched its State Aid Modernisation (“SAM”) reform of aid policy, new regulations have been steadily forthcoming—including, just last week, the adoption of new General Block Exemptions. So it’s more than timely that this issue brings us up to date on State aid. The first group of papers analyze the new reforms from a variety of perspectives. We then look at where State aid and private mandates intersect, followed by an especially topical question: How will State aid in the financial sector work with the reformed EU Banking Union? Our last article strays from the topic, but merits being Of Special Interest given how many high tech mergers authorities are currently analyzing—there are interesting lessons to be gained from a look back at the Google-AdMob merger.

845,"December 22, 2015",What a Difference a Year Makes: An Emerging Consensus on the Treatment of Standard-Essential Patents,"
Jonathan Kanter, Oct 15, 2013
These days, it is difficult to identify an antitrust issue that is generating more discussion than standard-essential patents. To some, SEPs are to antitrust what Breaking Bad is to television: a complex and important subject worthy of discussion. To others, SEPs are to antitrust what Miley Cyrus is to pop culture: a fad that consumes way too much attention and distracts from other more important subjects. In either case, antitrust lawyers and economists cannot stop scrutinizing the issue with vigor, fascination, and (sometimes) an admirable level of obsession.
Even just a year ago, the role of SEPs in litigation and the scope of commitments to license SEPs on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms seemed so divisive and controversial that one could not imagine any resolution in the fore. As the so-called “smartphone wars” reached a fever pitch, antitrust emerged at the center of the controversy. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division was in the midst of reviewing two major transactions involving large patent portfolios: Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, along with MMI’s patent portfolio, and the Rockstar Consortium’s acquisition of certain patents auctioned off by then-defunct Nortel Networks.
Shortly thereafter, complaints began flowing into enforcement authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the conduct of individual companies. The European Commission, DOJ, and Federal Trade Commission responded by opening their own conduct investigations.
These events led commentators and regulators alike to grapple with two important but controversial questions: Do SEPs warrant special antitrust consideration? And, if so, how should antitrust laws address concerns inherent in the defensive use of SEPs?
Quite remarkably, antitrust enforcement authorities and courts have begun to converge around answers to some of these questions. In the last year alone we have seen two FTC consent decrees, two EC Statements of Objections, and four District Court opinions all suggesting that SEPs warrant a certain degree of special treatment under U.S. and European law.
Setting aside the rhetoric of interested parties on all sides of the issue-which remains as divisive as ever-one can see a consensus beginning to emerge around certain key principles. Courts, agencies, and policy makers all appear to agree that SEP holders should abide by their F/RAND commitments and refrain from obtaining injunctive relief against willing licensees. This is not to suggest that either enforcement authorities or standards bodies broadly agree on all issues related to SEPs. To the contrary, these issues remain quite contentious. Still, the emerging alignment among key decision makers is somewhat remarkable considering the intense level of attention and controversy.

For all but cartel cases, the EC has been increasingly relying on commitment procedures to resolve competition concerns. Yet, despite their popularity, there is often confusion among commitments, settlements, and remedies. And with the recent Microsoft  fine, the question has to be asked: Just how certain can companies be about the finality of these agreements? And what happens when two jurisidictions disagree? Our distinguished panel looks at these and other questions regarding this popular part of the antitrust toolkit.
And in our Of Current Interest Section, we look at two diverse questions – What impact does competition have on trade? And how effective are cartel fines in Russia’s developing antitrust regime.

The ongoing saga of the Google book settlement has all the earmarks of a classic: On one hand is its lofty goal of preventing a repetition of the burning of the Library of Alexander and preserving written content; on the other is the issue of unprotected, defenseless orphans. Practically, however, this is a rich case dealing with serious issues: copyright protections in a digital world, privacy, international conflicts, monopolies, forward-looking class certifications, court v. legislative decision-making. Our authors tackle these and others from a variety of perspectives. And, for a postscript, we keep the UPP debate going, with a hard look at practicality.

The U.K. competition authority structure is undergoing remodeling and we have several experts weighing in to take questions: How is the new organization going to react with other U.K. authorities? How best to integrate two different approaches to decision making? Should merger notification still be voluntary? What are the appropriate safeguards to ensure impartial decisions? What does the removal of “dishonesty” from the cartel offense mean? Both already established and newly developing competition regimes should be able to learn a lot from the U.K. process. And since we like to track of the ongoing saga of the antitrust world v. Google, we present a comparison with the historical Microsoft case. Enjoy!

A number of entities are not very happy these days with the big three credit rating agencies. And that displeasure is stretched pretty much across the board, world-wide. Those who are displeased with recent ratings movements have been mulling over using competition policy and antitrust laws as a potential counter-attack; after all, there are only three significant agencies, so isn’t that a concentration of market power? This issue takes a look both at whether the displeasure is indeed warranted and, if so, whether antitrust is an appropriate arena for the battle.
And continuing our policy of looking at recent case rulings, we have two articles that address recent EU and U.S. decisions in the fields of parential liability and class certification. Enjoy!

Letter from the Editor – Autumn 2014
Jean Tirole, who has been a regular contributor to CPI over the years, both begins our issue, with an article on payment card regulation co-authored with Helene Bourguignon and Renato Gomes, and ends our issue with the classic. Richard Schmalensee, who taught Tirole when he getting his Ph.D. at MIT, provides an overview of the importance of Rochet and Tirole’s work on multi-sided platforms to industrial organization generally and antitrust specifically. Between these bookends we present a diverse selection of articles on the law and economics of multi-sided platforms by key contributors in the area. Our next section benefits from the fact that 2014 was a watershed year for court decisions on multi-sided platforms.



A Symposium on Antitrust Economics of Multi-Sided Platforms



Helene Bourguignon, Renato Gomes, Jean Tirole, Jan 30, 2015
Card Surcharges and Cash Discounts: Simple Economics and Regulatory Lessons
The role of payment cards in modern economies can hardly be underrated. In 2013, debit and credit card transactions represented roughly half of all consumer payment transactions in Western Europe, and accounted for more than 45% of all payment transactions in the United States. The payment card industry has faced intense antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, partly in response to the merchants’ recurrent complaints about high transaction fees.
Glen Weyl, Alexander White, Jan 30, 2015
Let the Right “One” Win: Policy Lessons from the New Economics of Platforms
Many of the leading controversies in competition policy in the last two decades, especially those surrounding the Microsoft case, reflect the challenges posed by platform industries. Unfortunately, too often economists and policymakers have drawn the wrong lessons when thinking about such industries.
Dennis Carlton, Ralph Winter, Jan 30, 2015
Competition Policy and Regulation in Credit Card Markets: Insights from Single-sided Market Analysis
This paper reexamines the economics of two common features of credit card networks: the interchange fee paid by merchant banks, or acquirers, to cardholder banks, or issuers; and the restraint commonly placed on merchants against surcharging for credit card transactions.

The Antitrust Analysis of Rules and Standards for Software Platforms
Software platforms usually impose rules and standards and often exclude participants that harm others in the community, and reward participants that benefit others in the community. Competition policy should presume that these governance systems, and the restrictions they place on platform participants—including their possible expulsion from the platform—are efficient and pro-competitive. Software platforms could, however, employ governance systems to foreclose competition.
Benjamin Edelman, Julian Wright, Jan 30, 2015
Price Restrictions in Multi-sided Platforms: Practices and Responses
In connecting buyers to sellers, some two-sided platforms require that sellers offer their lowest prices through the platform, disallowing lower prices for direct sales or sales through competing platforms. In this article, we explore the various contexts where such restrictions have arisen, then consider effects on competition, entry, and efficiency.

Antitrust Issues in Two-Sided Network Markets: Lessons from In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
In 2013, I served as a court-appointed expert in consolidated class and individual plaintiff antitrust litigation against Visa and Mastercard in the Eastern District of New York. The litigation involved a challenge to default interchange fees established by Visa and Mastercard, and to certain network rules imposed on affiliated merchants.

David Evans, Jun 09, 2012
This column is about the antitrust of “multi-sided platforms.” These creatures, which are also known as “two-sided markets”, play critical roles in a lot of industries. Examples include Apple’s mobile software platform, Deutsche Bourse’s financial exchange platforms, Facebook’s social networking platform, Google’s search engine, Monster’s job board, News Corp’s advertising businesses, Sotheby’s auction house, Simon’s Mall, and Visa International. They range from the old (the village matchmaker) to the new (mobile-based social networking).
The concept of multi-sided platforms was introduced a bit more than a decade ago. Today, there are hundreds of articles by economists on the topic, many of which are relevant to antitrust practitioners, and dozens of articles in law reviews. The economics of multi-sided platforms has been a key topic in antitrust cases around the world in industries ranging from advertising to payments to shopping malls.
This column provides a place for economists and lawyers to discuss competition policy towards multi-sided platforms. We’re looking for contributors to this monthly column and hope to get a vibrant debate going. The column is going to focus on anything that’s of interest to the antitrust community surrounding multi-sided platforms. Submissions should be in range of 800-2000 words.
I’m going to kick the series off with a discussion of how platforms deal with customers who do bad things and why this matters for competition policy. If you want some background on multi-sided platforms you might want to check out my online course on multi-sided platforms for business professionals, the course Dick Schmalensee and I gave on the antitrust of multi-sided platforms, and collection of essays on platform economics.

The focus of much of this issue concerns digital media and communications, but first we introduce CPI’s new publishing technology with two audio interviews with leading competition authorities. Then we look at the interplay among online communications platforms, consumer privacy, and consumer protection. We examine what import a price of zero has for antitrust, ask “Is the Web Dead,” provide an analytical history of search engines, and take a retrospective look at Baidu. On a different track, we investigate interchange fees, how to analyze mergers in innovation markets, survey aftermarkets, and answer “Is antitrust enforcement irrelevant?” The Classic is the Jeff Rohlfs’ 1974 article that modernized network effects analysis and, as Richard Schmalensee describes in his introduction, provided an prescient model of Facebook.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
European Union Competition Law in the Digital Era Massimiliano Kadar (European Commission)
Abstract: What is the role of competition policy in the digital economy? The question is not new, and many have commented on this topic already at the end of the 1990s, particularly in the context of the United States Department of Justice’s proceedings against Microsoft. In recent years, however, the debate has been fuelled by the ever-growing digitalisation of our lives, as well as by the considerable public attention received by the European Commission’s competition case on Google’s activities related to general internet search.
Some believe that competition authorities should refrain from intervening in fast-moving, technology driven industries, as the cost of intervention in those industries would generally outweigh possible benefits. Almost on the opposite front, others have argued that a muscular intervention from competition authorities is needed, but that this is not sufficient to constrain the market power of large companies operating in the digital space. Some of those observers argue that a new regulatory framework would be required to address problems such as access to “essential” digital platforms by third parties, which are not within the scope of existing non-competition laws (e.g. on privacy and copyright) and are also not allegedly tackled by competition law enforcers effectively. A third group argues that competition policy is the right tool to address issues related to market power in digital markets, and conversely that ex-ante regulation would not be desirable insofar as it would likely result in undue constraints on innovation. However, according to these observers, the current European Union competition law legal framework may have to be reassessed and potentially improved to meet the challenges posed by digital markets.
In this article, after having defined the main features of digital markets, I will discuss in turn the above arguments and criticisms. I will conclude that (i) competition law enforcers’ intervention in digital markets is appropriate and desirable, when the circumstances of a case justify it; (ii) competition law cannot deal with all perceived issues in a given market. However, it is the right tool to remedy distortions to competition caused by market power. Conversely, the introduction of pervasive ex-ante regulation in digital markets to ensure access to “essential platforms” does not appear to be warranted; and (iii) in general, the current legal framework appears to be suitable and sufficiently flexible to allow the Commission to intervene and remedy competitive distortions in digital markets. Whilst some of the proposals to further enhance the effectiveness of the enforcement system may have some merit in principle, more in-depth research would be required before any legislative reform.

862,"December 7, 2015",UE: Qualcomm enfrenta cargos por depredación,"
La Unión Europea se encuentra preparando argumentos para la presentación de una queja formal en contra de Qualcomm Inc. Se sospecha que la multinacional habría puesto en marcha tácticas de depredación de precios, dañando fuertemente a sus rivales más pequeños.
La autoridad reguladora se encuentra en los últimos preparativos para emitir una ‘declaratoria de objeción’, basada en una denuncia presentada por la empresa Nvidia Corp. Dicha queja solicitaba a la UE tomar acciones contra modelos de precios de depredación en el mercado de los ‘chips’ utilizados en teléfonos celulares. Qualcomm ha diseñado la mayor parte de los chips que permiten el funcionamiento de los teléfonos inteligentes del mundo mediante el otorgamiento de licencias para el uso de su tecnología.
Qualcomm se une a una creciente lista de empresas norteamericanas que deberán enfrentar cargos en la Unión Europea. Entre ellas se encuentran gigantes como Google, Microsoft Corp. e Intel Corp. La declaratoria de objeción puede llevar al cobro de multas de hasta el 10% de los ingresos globales de la empresa a menos que esta última acceda a modificar su comportamiento.
Las autoridades europeas también anunciaron que lanzarán una segunda investigación sobre la empresa, ésta para verificar si Qualcomm ha otorgado rebajas, reembolsos o realizado pagos u otros incentivos financieros para clientes frecuentes de sus componentes. Una tercera acusación, la cual alegaba que la empresa cobraba cantidades excesivas en torno a sus patentes, fue desechada en 2009.

863,"December 2, 2015",EU: Qualcomm to face antitrust complaint on predatory pricing,"
The European Union is preparing an antitrust complaint against Qualcomm Inc. over suspected predatory pricing tactics that could hobble smaller rivals, according to three people familiar with the probe.
Regulators are in the final stages of preparing a so-called statement of objections, based on a complaint by a unit of Nvidia Corp., that asked the EU to act against predatory pricing for mobile-phone chips, the people said. Qualcomm designs chipsets that power most of the world’s smartphones, licensing its technology across the industry.
Qualcomm would add to a growing list of U.S. technology companies to face EU antitrust action, following probes into Google, Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. A statement of objections may lead to fines, capped at 10 percent of yearly global revenue, which can be avoided if a company agrees to make changes to business behavior.
Regulators are less advanced with another probe into whether the company grants payments, rebates or other financial incentives to customers in returning for buying Qualcomm chipsets. Another case that focused on complaints that the company was charging excessive royalties on patents was dropped in 2009.

An investigation is to be launched into whether internet users are being charged unfairly when they use cloud storage services.
The Competition and Markets Authority said some providers may be breaching consumer laws.
It will look into complaints that prices can go up after a customer has taken out a contract – or that the amount of data storage can be changed.
Users of lap-tops, mobiles and tablets are increasingly taking advantage of such services, to store photos, documents, TV programmes and films.
By storing such files in the cloud, rather than on the device itself, users get more memory, and the ability to access them from anywhere in the world.
Usually cloud storage providers offer a certain amount of memory for free, but can charge up to £40 a month for extra gigabytes.
Amongst the biggest providers are Dropbox, Google Drive and Apple’s iCloud.

865,"November 11, 2015",EU: Brussels investigates Android map apps to see if they displace Euro rivals,"
Regulators are investigating whether Google has been supplanting native mapping applications and devices with its own Google Maps, thus causing a competition vacuum.
A questionnaire obtained by Bloomberg has been sent to rival companies asking for any evidence that the prevalence of Google Maps has damaged sales of rival devices such as TomTom, Garmin and HERE.
Officials will also be looking for data on user numbers, preinstallation of mapping apps and the costs faced by cartographers to make mobile-ready versions of their work.
The news is yet another blow to Alphabet, the company that used to be Google but now owns it, who last week faced a second legal challenge from Streetmap, the mapping app we all used at the turn of the millennium.
Streetmap believes that the loss of traffic caused by Google’s prioritisation of its own maps in results is costing them dearly. Most of us didn’t know they were still a thing.

Abstract: “Free” products have exploded in popularity along with widespread Internet adoption — but many of them are not truly free. Customers often transfer something of value, typically their attention or personal information, in order to access zero-price products. This dynamic brings zero-price markets within the scope of antitrust law. Unfortunately, despite the critical role that such products now play in modern economies, the antitrust enterprise has failed to adequately account for the unique attributes of zero-price markets. Particularly in view of the rising tide of antitrust investigations and litigation targeting high-profile suppliers of zero-price products, this failure is indefensible.
This Article identifies and addresses several foundational aspects of antitrust law that are challenged by zero prices. First, as to consumer standing, it establishes that attention and information qualify as “property” under the Clayton Act. Second, it proposes altering the traditional tests for market definition and market power by, among other things, implementing a “SSNIC” variant of the hypothetical-monopolist test. It also suggests that analysts should incorporate into such inquiries behavioral-economics research demonstrating the “zero-price effect.” Third, this Article demonstrates the unviability of the “free goods defense.” Fourth, it proposes damages-valuation methods that do not depend on unreliable stated preferences. Finally, it surveys and critiques the existing antitrust case law involving conduct in zero-price markets by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others.

Should China Harmonize Its Merger Assessment With the U.S. and EU Ioannis Kokkoris (University of London)
Abstract: China’s Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) came into force in August 2008, and has been deemed “the equivalent of the United States’ (U.S.) Sherman Antitrust Act or the analogous portions of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.”
From the very beginning, the merger control regime in China has been more intensively scrutinized and analyzed than the enforcement of anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominance, and many of the merger parties are multinational corporations whose mergers would be notified to multi-jurisdictions. Consequently, there were some controversial decisions, such as P3 Alliance, Google/Motorola, Seagate/Samsung, which are divergent from the decisions of the major merger authorities such as the European Union (EU) Commission or the U.S. FTC for the same cases. Some of the decisions made by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) were fraught with unusual analytical process and remedies. The Chinese competition authorities have also been involved in international cartels (e.g. LCD panel) as well as abuse of dominance cases (e.g. Qualcomm) that were investi-gated by a number of major jurisdictions. The international profile of the Chinese antitrust authorities is described as “one of the world’s youngest and least understood regulators.”

868,"October 19, 2015",EU: Eric Schmidt: ‘European law is biased against large companies’,"
Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt gave an address at Stanford in which he talked about the attitude of European law towards “large companies,” many of which come from the US.
The remarks, which were transcribed by Chris Yeh, come in response to a student question about antitrust, a process that Google has been subject to multiple times in Europe.
“Obviously, it’s a concern,” Schmidt said. “But now that the Europeans are focused on all the American companies, it’s a little easier. European law is biased against large companies. There’s a commissioner in Europe who launched a study he listed 32 companies, 31 of which were American.”
Various aspects of Google’s business have been subject to scrutiny by EU regulators, including the shopping channel on Google Search which was found to favour some links over others without being transparent about who was paying for exposure. Google, for its part, emphasizes how much traffic the company drives to e-commerce websites.

869,"October 15, 2015",Canada: Bell gets slapped for fake App Store reviews,"
Bell Canada has been handed down a $1.25 million CAD ($970,719) fine by Canada’s competition bureau after its employees posted fake reviews of Bell apps.
According to the regulator, the carrier “encouraged” staff members to post glowing testimonials of the MyBell Mobile and Virgin My Account apps on the App Store and Google Play. Unfortunately, these overenthusiastic write-ups neglected to mention that they were written by people on Bell’s dollar.
The dodgy behavior was initially exposed by Scott Stratten, who was already well aware of the apps’ poor standing on iTunes. Suddenly, however, the rating skyrocketed thanks to a series of five-star reviews, and Stratten smelled a rat. After some digging on LinkedIn, he uncovered that the most praiseworthy mentions were all directors, marketing managers and other people paid by Bell Canada.

La Jueza de distrito Lucy Koh ha emitido su aprobación definitiva para el acuerdo entre Apple y sus co-defensores, el cual aguardaban desde hace ocho meses una vez que se acordara la suma en enero.
La demanda fue presentada en 2011, cuando obreros de Apple, Google, Intel y Adobe acusaron a sus patrones de institucionaliza reglas de ‘no cazar cabezas’ (no poaching) que actúan como un supresór del salario y dificultan la movilidad entre compañías. Los directivos de ambas empresas fueron cuestionados, aunque el caso ganó fama tras surgir acusaciones contra Steve Jobs, el ahora fallecido fundador de Apple. De acuerdo a los demandantes, Jobs habría instigado una serie de lineamientos ‘anti-cazador de cabezas’ para ayudarle a retener su talento, incluyendo la creación de listas ‘para no llamarles.’
Los acusados habrían accedido a un pago fuera de corte con un valor de 324.5 millones hace un año. Sin embargo, el representante del caso colectivo, Michael Devine, antiguo ingeniero de sistemas en Adobe, presentó sus objeciones acerca de la oferta al calificarla de ser “inadecuada”. La Juez Koh rechazó esta oferta, citando un caso de $20 millones de dólares, también involucrado con el presente, entre las casas Intuit, Pizar y Lucasfilm.
Cada uno de los 64,466 demandantes recibirá una fracción del monto estipulado, basándose en su salario base total durante el periodo llamado ‘de conspiración’ ocurrido entre 2005 y 2009.

La Unión Europea presentará cargos en contra de seis grandes estudios de Hollywood y contra el canal de paga Sky TV por violar las leyes de competencia de este continente. La acción representa el esfuerzo más reciente por parte de la organización basada en Bruselas por combatir las barreras digitales en Europa.
La UE ha acusado a Disney, NBC Universal, Paramount Pictures, Sony, 20th Century Fox y Warner Bros., así como a la empresa Anglo-irlandesa Sky TV, por utilizar sus licencias de reproducción para bloquear el acceso a su contenido en países miembros de la Unión.
Los cargos son los más recientes en ser presentadas por la recia Comisionada de Competencia, Margrethe Vestager, quien recientemente se ha enfrentado a los gigantes Google (telecomunicaciones) y Gazprom (energía). “Los consumidores quieren ver los canales de paga de su elección, sin importar donde vivan o se trasladen dentro de la Unión Europea.Nuestra investigación sobre la competencia en la economía de internet dentro de la UE nos revela que esto no es lo que ocurre hoy en día” declaró Vestager.

Abstract: Data control, among the newest forms of power fostered by information and communication technologies (ICTs), triggers a continuous (re)negotiation of public and private orderings, with direct implications on both regulators and intermediaries. This article examines the stance of the European Union (EU) regarding the position of Google – the world’s largest internet services company as per its 2014 market value – in two controversial instances: the ‘right to be forgotten’ and the implementation of EU competition rules. It provides an analysis of these evolving debates and their meaning for EU regulatory thrust more broadly, discussing the shift in the approach to digital markets and the proactive development of a European framework influential beyond continental boundaries.

Brussels accuses Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros, as well as Britain and Ireland’s Sky TV of using movie licenses to block access to their content in other European Union countries.
The charges are the newest in a series made by the EU’s steely new Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, fresh from taking on Internet giant Google and Russian energy behemoth Gazprom.
“European consumers want to watch the pay-TV channels of their choice regardless of where they live or travel in the EU. Our EU economy Internet antitrust investigation shows that they cannot do this today,” Vestager said in a statement.
“We believe that this may be in breach of EU competition rules,” she said. “The studios and Sky UK now have the chance to respond to our concerns.”
There was no immediate reaction from the Hollywood studios or Sky TV to the announcement, which follows an investigation launched in January 2014.

Interview With Joaquin Almunia interview by Juan Delgado (Global Economics Group)
Joaquin Almunia has occupied particularly important positions in Europe. As Economics and Finance Commissioner he lived through the start of the financial crisis and, as Competition Commissioner, zealously oversaw the bank rescue process. His time at the Directorate General for Competition has produced important landmarks such as the Google case, the tax benefits to large enterprises and the Antitrust Damages Directive. Today, we ask him to look ahead and analyze the future changes to competition policy and to Europe itself… As we have come to expect, his response was far from disappointing.
JUAN DELGADO – Mr. Almunia, we are now witnessing the start of a Competition Policy for the Internet. Do you think the future of competition policy and anticompetitive practices lies within the Web, or do we still have plenty left in the “physical world”?
Joaquín Almunia: The online world has created new tensions between platforms, content providers and infrastructure owners. The power of platforms grows as their capacity to obtain and process data increases, and along with it the creation of dominant positions and the possibility for abuse also grows. On the other hand, the internet generates large efficiencies, and so the application of C...

The European Union should be wary of creating new regulations targeting large internet companies like Google and Facebook, the bloc’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Thursday, arguing that the bloc should seek to enforce existing antitrust laws to keep big companies in check.
Senior EU officials have floated a plan to create a new EU-wide regulator for a swath of mainly U.S.-based Internet companies, amid concerns that some of these firms are obstructing access to key online markets, according to an internal document seen by The Wall Street Journal.
Speaking at an event in London, Ms. Vestager said it would be “tricky” to design EU regulation targeting the various large Internet firms like Facebook, Amazon.com and eBay because it was hard to establish what they had in common besides “facilitating something.”

This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Richard Pepper, Paul Gilbert, May 29, 2015
It is now trite to observe the amount of data generated by modern society. Statistics abound about the data-rich environment created by technological advances and the digital economy:

every couple of days, humanity now generates 5 exabytes of data; this roughly corresponds to the volume of data produced in the entire period between the dawn of time and 2003;
every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data—so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone.

These data may be personal: social media content, eMail addresses, employment histories, financial information, shopping habits, and so on. Commercial enterprises (online and offline) proactively collect these types of data to improve their services, design and target marketing, and sell to third parties. This raises real questions about how to protect personal data against unauthorized or inappropriate use. The European institutions have recognized this challenge and are progressing towards a more stringent, harmonized data protection regime through the proposed General Data Protection Regulation.
Several observers have also called for privacy to play a greater role in merger control, including under the European Merger Regulation. Notably, in a 2014 preliminary opinion, the European Data Protection Supervisor criticized the European Commission for not assessing market power by reference to “control of commercialisable personal information” and instead adopting “a purely economic approach to the [Google/DoubleClick] case” where it failed to consider “how the merger could have affected the users whose data would be further processed by merging the two companies’ datasets … that were not envisioned when the data were originally submitted.” In doing so, the Commission was said to have “neglected the longer term impact on the welfare of millions of Users in the event that the combined undertaking’s information generated by search (Google) and browsing (DoubleClick) were later processed for incompatible purposes.”
This paper argues that privacy concerns should not enjoy specific privileges under the European Merger Regulation and there are no sound policy reasons that support their introduction. It observes the ways in which privacy issues are already taken into account in the Commission’s substantive assessment, and it highlights the risks that arise from an over-emphasis on access to data in merger control.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Android and Antitrust: Attempts at a ‘More Technological Approach’ Simonetta Vezzoso (University of Trento)
Abstract: Scholars in the tradition of industrial economics have developed a comprehensive theory of multi-sided markets that is increasingly influential also in competition policy circles. This type of economic analysis is potentially significant in cases where the fundamental defining characteristic of multi-sided businesses, namely the fact that they supply multiple customer groups whose demands are interdependent, is critical for the assessment of competition effects. A good example of this already influential approach, and of what it could imply for competition policy, is provided by recent discussions with regard to possible allegations of anticompetitive practices by Google in connection with Android, the Internet search giant’s successful software platform for mobile devices. Some aspects of Android’s governance system have attracted the interest of competition policy enforcers. Grounded in the logic of indirect network effects, the economics of two sided markets is capable of providing a comprehensive and enticingly manageable framework for the analysis of many of Android’s practices under increased antitrust scrutiny. In particular, the economics of two-sided markets suggests that alleged anticompetitive practices by platform owners like Google should be better presumed to be procompetitive efforts to harness externalities for the platform. It is still open for debate, however, whether the economic theory of multisided markets provides the type of economic analysis which looks most promising in dealing with allegations of anticompetitive conduct by multi-sided businesses in high-tech industries. In fact, the economics of two sided market understates the technological nature of platforms (all platform participants are considered consumers), and focuses mainly on the transactional side (chicken and egg problem). It follows that the same economic insights are conveniently applied both to heterosexual dating clubs and to software platforms. Hence, the mechanics of technological platforms, and the reasons behind some practices by platform owners, are only partially elucidated. One way of improving the current understanding of software platforms for the purpose of competition enforcement in high-tech markets is by bringing together the transactional and the technological views of platforms.

Antitrust Enforcement with Respect to Intellectual Property in China – Fay Zhou, Xi Liao & Christoph Barth (LinkLaters LLP)
Enforcement activity at the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property (“IP”) rights is one of the hot topics these days and heavily debated among practitioners and industry participants in the US and EU. It is widely recognised that antitrust and IP law share the common purpose of promoting innovation and enhancing consumer welfare and are thus complementary instruments. Antitrust law seeks to promote consumer welfare by prohibiting certain actions that may harm competition with respect to either existing or new ways of serving consumers. IP law grants technology owners a monopoly to reward them for the development of the respective technology and incentivise further innovation. In the absence of IP law, rapid imitation would chill innovation, ultimately to the detriment of consumers. It is thus recognised that antitrust enforcement in this area should be limited and primarily focus on transactions capable of lessening competition among rival technologies, while other enforcement action may interfere with the principal goals of IP rights. Attempts to restrain licensing fees in the short term can thus undermine incentives to invest and thereby slow down innovation and economic growth.
China is still a comparatively new player in the anti...

Amazon has begun booking revenue by country in some of its biggest markets, including the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain. The practice began on May 1 and will roll out across other European operations.
The move could significantly increase Amazon’s tax bill in many EU countries. It did not acknowledge whether it was responding to pressure from regulators.

The Antitrust Analysis of Rules and Standards for Software Platforms and Its Implications for China – David S. Evans (Global Economics Group) & Vanessa Yanhua Zhang (Global Economics Group)1
Introduction
Many people use software platforms and the applications that run on them during much of the day for work and leisure. They run our mobile phones, computers, and videogame consoles and are behind our social networks. New ones are behind innovations in payments, transportation, health and fitness, connected homes, and connected shopping, all of which are transforming how we live.
Software platforms create value by providing an environment in which many different types of economic agents can benefit.2 These economic agents typically include end users, application developers, and hardware makers. They may also include advertisers, content providers, and other economic agents depending on the platform and the business model it has adopted.
There are positive externalities between these different groups.More demand from any group of economic agents usually increases the value of the platform to the other groups of economic agents. As with other multi-sided platforms there are positive indirect network effects: more applications leads to more end users, which leads to more interest from application developers and hardware makers, and so forth.
Software platforms also have c...

886,"May 7, 2015",US/EU: Silicon Valley find flaws in EU online proposal,"
US technology firms are voicing major concerns with a European proposal unveiled Wednesday that they say could discourage the creation of new online business and target US companies.
“Imposing regulator barriers would be a grave mistake for Europe, and would have harmful effects on trans-Atlantic trade and investment,” Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, told The Wall Street Journal.
The Information Technology Industry Council has noted that leaked documents showed nearly all the businesses that the commission wants to review are major U.S. tech companies — from Amazon and Yahoo to Microsoft and Google.
“Instead of enhancing integration, the commission would in effect be creating a digital fortress around Europe – a move that would have devastating consequences for Europe’s efforts to spur innovation and technology by its own companies,” Dean Garfield, the group’s president, wrote in an op-ed.

887,"May 6, 2015",EU: Antitrust probe into e-commerce sector launched,"
The EU formally opened an anti-trust inquiry into Europe’s online shopping marketplace on Wednesday amid concerns about how major websites such as Amazon and Google use their influence.
The competition probe is the most aggressive part of a new digital market strategy unveiled by the European Commission vice president Andrus Ansip aimed at dragging the 28-state bloc into the 21st century.
“The European Commission has launched a competition inquiry into the e-commerce sector in the European Union in the context of the Digital Single Market Strategy,” the Commission said in a statement.
The anti-trust probe will particularly focus on areas such as electronics, clothing, shoes and digital content for which so-called e-commerce is most used for, it said.

Google and Amazon could face increased scrutiny starting Wednesday, when the European Commission outlines its strategy to make European companies more competitive online, and to simplify online shopping and movie streaming across borders.
On Wednesday, the European Commission will propose rules for the technology industry with implications for everyone from room-sharing website Airbnb to e-commerce and companies like Google and Amazon.com.
In particular, the EU’s executive arm will examine whether extra regulation is needed to curb web companies’ market power, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Bloomberg.

A probe into online platforms such as Amazon and Google will be launched this year by Brussels.

Draft proposals from the European Commission state that a probe will start before the end of 2015 and will focus on the role of paid for links and advertisements in search results.
It will also look at the ability of individuals and businesses to move from platform to platform, however, this will not form part of the ongoing competition probe into Google.
The planned assessment has come after pressure on the EU from French and German ministers’ to investigate the dominant role being played by some web giants.
A general regulatory framework has been called for by French economic minister Emmanuel Macron and his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
When Competition Fails to Optimise Quality: A Look at Search Engines Maurice E. Stucke (University of Tennessee) & Ariel Ezrachi (University of Oxford)
Abstract: The European Commission’s Statement of Objections forms the latest addition to the ongoing debate on the possible misuse of Google’s position in the search engine market. The scholarly debate, however, has largely been over the exclusionary effects of search degradation. Less attention has been attributed to the dimension of quality – whether and how a search engine, faced with rivals, could degrade quality on the free side.
We set out to address this fundamental issue: With the proliferation of numerous web search engines and their free usage and availability, could any search engine degrade quality?
We begin our analysis with a review of the network effects that may impact the relative power of a search engine. We next identify three necessary, but not sufficient, variables for quality degradation to occur in search results. With these three variables in mind, we consider instances when a search engine could degrade quality despite competition from rival engines.

891,"April 23, 2015",EU: New web regulator considered,"
The European Union is considering creating a powerful new regulator to oversee a swath of mainly U.S.- based Internet platforms, according to an internal policy document that lays bare the deep concerns in top EU policy circles around the threat posed by companies like Google and Facebook.
Such a move would be the biggest hurdle yet for U.S. Internet firms operating in Europe, many of which are already facing investigations and lawsuits over issues ranging from unfair competition to tax avoidance.
The paper warns that some online platforms–such as search engines, online marketplaces and social networks–“are transforming into super-nodes that can be of systemic importance for the rest of the economy.”
“Only a very limited part of the economy will not depend on them in the near future,” it says. It lists 32 examples of such platforms, all but five of which are US based.

Monopolistic practices include “contracts, agreements, arrangements or tie-ups among competitive economic agents aimed at manipulating prices, restricting supply or demand, or segmenting markets,” the Cofece said.
“Coordination of positions in bidding processes and the exchange of information for carrying out any of the aforementioned conduct” also would constitute monopolistic behavior.

La titular de la Comisión de Competencia de la Unión Europea, Margrethe Vestager, emitió una advertencia a los directores del gigante paraestatal ruso Gazprom, al pronunciar un discurso en el que prometió actuar con decisión en contra de cualquier empresa energética que viole las leyes de competencia.
La Comisión ha investigado a Gazprom por más de dos años a raíz de supuestos sobre-cargos a sus clientes europeos, sabotear a rivales y por impedir el flujo de gas a lo largo de la región de manera libre.
La comisionada, en su primer viaje a EEUU desde su nombramiento, añadió en su discurso que buscaría tomar una línea dura contra las compañías energéticas que “dañen a sus rivales, bloqueen el paso de energía de un país de Europa a otro, o amenacen con cortar el suministro.”
A pesar de que en ningún momento mencionó directamente el nombre de Gazprom, el discurso fue pronunciado a pocos días de que el comisionado de Energía de la UE anunciara la próxima presentación de resultados en una investigación dirigida hacia Gazprom.

The European Union’s competition chief sent a warning shot to Russian gas giant Gazprom on Thursday when she pledged to act decisively against energy companies that break competition law.
The European Commission has been investigating Gazprom for more than two years for allegedly over-charging customers in eastern Europe, thwarting rival suppliers and blocking the free flow of gas across the region.
Margrethe Vestager, making her first U.S. trip since she took office in November, said in a speech in Washington she would be tough with energy companies that “harm rivals, block energy flows from on EU country to another, or threaten to close the tap.”
Although she did not mention Gazprom by name, her speech comes in the wake of remarks by the bloc’s energy chief that the Commission would present the results of the Gazprom investigation very soon.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Theories of Self-Preferencing Under Article 102 TFEU: A Reply to Bo Vesterdorf Nicolas Petit (University of Liege)
Abstract: In a 2015 paper, Bo Vesterdorf argues that there is no legal basis for the decisional implementation of theories of abusive self-preferencing under Article 102 TFEU. His paper comes in the context of the headline-grabbing Google search investigation in the EU. In Vesterdorf’s view, the sole legal avenue that may be used to order a dominant firm “not to favour” its own services is the essential facilities doctrine. Vesterdorf goes on to make a very restrictive description of the scope and conditions of application of the essential facilities doctrine in EU competition law.
This paper is a reply to Bo Vesterdorf’s paper. It shows that the Vesterdorf paper does not withstand a comprehensive positive law analyzis. The case-law provides several legal basis for the promotion of theories of abusive self-preferencing under Article 102 TFEU. Moreover, in positive EU competition law, the essential facilities doctrine is not the narrow theory of liability described in Vesterdorf’s paper. Finally, the concept of “competition on the merits” is of limited help to redeem a dominant firm’s abusive conduct.

898,"April 5, 2015",EU: The European Union takes aim at American Tech Giants,"
The European Union is putting pressure on US tech giants such as Google, Facebook and even Apple in regards to the companies’ business practices and privacy settings. According to EU officials, the European Commission is close to formally filing antitrust charges against Google, and it is also stepping up its investigation of Facebook’s privacy policies.
The European Commission has been investigating Google for years. During this time, investigators have managed to collect many confidential complaints made by various European firms about the tech giant, and now the commission has begun asking for permission to go public with the testimonies.
Many experts believe that the EU will file formal antitrust charges against Google within just a few short weeks. The commission is reportedly preparing a document named Statement of Objections that is believed to be aimed at convincing Google to go for a settlement instead of making its way to court.
If Google and the Commission fail to reach an agreement, the EU could issue a series of fines and force Google to pay up to 10% of revenues from its last years, which stand at more than $6 billion.

In a deal reached last year, Swisscom is to combine directory operator local.ch, which provides information on phone numbers, with Swiss media company Tamedia’s search and information service search.ch in a joint subsidiary.
Together the local online directories will reach 3.6 million internet users per month in Switzerland, and the merger will be completed by mid-2015, the companies said in a joint statement.
“Although the fusion results in a monopoly, we are not blocking the plans because we don’t expect them to restrict competition,” WEKO said in a statement.

Muzzling Antitrust: Information Products, Innovation and Free Speech–  Hillary Greene (University of Connecticut)
Abstract: How well does the American legal system balance the diverse values society espouses? Courts must often navigate values that are not consistent, commensurate, or subject to ordinal ranking. This article examines the confluence of incommensurate values within the important context of antitrust challenges to information product redesigns (e.g., Google, Nielsen).
The information economy has given rise to the emergence of powerful firms in the business of information products. Some of these firms have had product redesigns challenged as anticompetitive. This article examines two defenses to these challenges. First, the products constitute protected speech and should be immunized entirely from antitrust scrutiny. Second, the product changes embody procompetitive innovations and, therefore, are not anticompetitive.

902,"March 16, 2015","Standard Setting, Patents, and Competition Law Enforcement—The Need for U.S. Policy Reform","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Alden Abbott, Mar 16, 2015
The setting of industry standards is widely recognized as a driver of economic growth—standards may reduce production costs; increase innovation, efficiency (through greater product interoperability, for example), and consumer choice; foster public health and safety; and facilitate international trade. In the United States, standards development is sector-based and market-led, with American businesses typically voluntarily collaborating within private standard-setting organizations to develop standards that all firms from their sector (including firms not within the SSO) can employ. Outside the United States, governments more frequently are involved in promoting and providing guidance to particular SSOs.
Many SSOs require their members to offer to license their patents that cover technology necessary to implement a standard—standard-essential patents —on “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory” terms. Standards can also be set in the marketplace, where firms compete to have their own technology accepted by users as a de facto standard (Microsoft’s Windows operating system and the Android mobile operating system currently developed by Google are examples).
Despite its substantial benefits, however, standard setting has long been a concern of antitrust law enforcers, primarily because it brings together competitors that have an inherent incentive to restrict competition among themselves. In recent years, competition law has focused substantial attention on potential competitive abuses stemming from patents held by individual standard-setting participants or their transferees.
This article briefly surveys the current U.S. competition law treatment of patent rights affected by standard setting, which centers on preventing “excessive” returns to individual patent holders, as contrasted to the traditional concern with forestalling collusion among competitors. I conclude that the current approach is welfare-inimical and misplaced. It should be replaced instead with an exclusive focus on potential collusion among patentees, an approach that would better promote consumer welfare and innovation.

It is the second bid to end the four-year battle over claims the firms conspired to avoid hiring from each other. Companies are offering $90.5 million more than in the original accord, which was rejected by a judge in August, while the lawyers’ take remains fixed at $81 million.
For the companies, which include Adobe Systems Inc. and Intel Corp., approval of the deal would remove the threat of a jury trial that might result in damages of more than $9 billion.

Expedia’s deal to buy rival Orbitz makes it one of the most acquisitive online travel companies, but it wasn’t long ago that it was warning regulators against a deal in the industry reports the Wall Street Journal.
In 2010, the online travel firm criticized a merger that shook up the industry, arguing the US Justice Department should block Google’s $US700 million acquisition of flight-information software company ITA Travel.
“Google has tremendous power in the search market, and it gives Google the ability to steer users in directions that are best for Google,” Expedia counsel Thomas Barnett told The Wall Street Journal at the time.
Now Expedia is the web giant asking regulators for approval to seal a US $1.34 billion takeover of Orbitz. The deal would leave the US and Europe’s most familiar travel websites under the control of just two companies: Expedia and Priceline.
David Balto, a former policy director of the FTC’s bureau of competition, said antitrust reviews would likely define online travel as narrowly as possible in the Orbitz deal. Expedia could find itself exposed to the same fears it raised in the Google case.

9th Circuit affirms: St Luke’s/Saltzer merger violates Section 7There are many lessons in the Ninth Circuit’s opinion about the interpretation and application of Section 7, including the evidentiary burden-shifting that allows a court to make the final determination that a merger is likely to harm competition.Debbie Feinstein (FTC)



















Takeaways from the Ninth Circuit’s Opinion Affirming the FTC’s Victory Against the St. Luke’s/Saltzer MergerThis case demonstrates that courts are unlikely to deviate from traditional antitrust merger analysis even when a transaction arguably furthers the “laudable” goals of high-profile legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act.Andrew Forman, et al. (Cadwalader Advisory)

(Crowell Moring Newsletter)



















European Antitrust Watchdogs Warn Of Uncertain Future For Pay-For-Delay SettlementsIt was pointed out that, even if settlements can indeed be a legitimate tool to put an end to or to avoid litigation, and even if there were a public policy to encourage settlements, this would by no means exempt such agreements from antitrust scrutiny.Irene Fraile (Antitrust Today)

909,"February 15, 2015",EU: Obama comments on European antitrust case,"
In a recent interview with Kara Swisher from Re/code Obama said Europe’s concern about privacy for users of Facebook and Google are “more commercially driven than anything else.” He said European companies that “can’t compete with ours” are using the issue to try to put up “roadblocks” for U.S. tech firms.
The European Union continues to hold out in its long-standing antitrust case against Google while the U.S. settled years ago over the same issues. In November, the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution to break up Google, after it made Google hide search results about people who want them zapped. In response Obama said the European companies were sore losers and were using their governments to gain footing against American rivals on Friday.
“In defense of Google and Facebook, sometimes the European response here is more commercially driven than anything else,” Obama said on this one-on-one with Kara Swisher.
“We have owned the Internet. Our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it, in ways they can’t compete. And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is designed to carve out their commercial interests.”
The president also discussed the ongoing issue over privacy and protection as his administration.

912,"January 30, 2015",Letter from the Editor – Autumn 2014,"
This issue completes the tenth year of Competition Policy International. During this time the CPI Journal has published 303 articles and our companion publication, CPI’s Antitrust Chronicle, has published another 1,138. Taken together, CPI’s complete works demonstrate—perhaps more effectively than anywhere else—the vibrancy, diversity, and increasing importance that antitrust issues have assumed in global legal, political, scholarly, and cultural arenas.
We owe some of our success to our decision, when we started in 2004, to take a different approach than most journals at the time. We encouraged authors—economists and lawyers alike—to write in clear English and to avoid the footnote-per-sentence model of American law reviews. That has helped our authors win numerous awards given to American lawyers for legal writing, among them the Antitrust Writing Awards and the Burton Awards. What we’ve lost in density we hopefully have more than made up for in clarity.
We also decided to take a different tact on finding good articles. Rather than the typical model where editors and referees pore over submissions to find the gems among the dross we chose to commission authors we have confidence in to write about topics that readers would care about. We first select topics and then seek writers.
And of course, as our title suggests, our approach is global, reflecting how antitrust has flourished around the world over the last 10 years. More countries now have competition laws ...

913,"January 29, 2015","An Instant Classic: Rochet & Tirole, Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets","
Richard Schmalensee, Jan 30, 2015
The press release announcing that Jean Tirole had been awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences noted that he had “made important theoretical research contributions in a number of areas.” One of his most important contributions was the discovery and pioneering analysis of multi-sided platforms (“MSPs”) in his 2003 paper with Jean-Charles Rochet, Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets. According to Google Scholar, this paper has been cited over 1800 times, fourth among Jean’s many papers. The Rochet & Tirole (“RT”) paper has spawned an enormous literature in a very short time—over 200 papers by the end of 2012,4 and the economics of multi-sided platforms is now a standard component of graduate courses in industrial organization. The RT paper is the first post-2000 academic paper to be deemed a classic by Competition Policy International, an honor it richly deserves.

914,"January 29, 2015",Card Surcharges and Cash Discounts: Simple Economics and Regulatory Lessons,"
Helene Bourguignon, Renato Gomes, Jean Tirole, Jan 30, 2015
The role of payment cards in modern economies can hardly be underrated. In 2013, debit and credit card transactions represented roughly half of all consumer payment transactions in Western Europe, and accounted for more than 45% of all payment transactions in the United States. The payment card industry has faced intense antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, partly in response to the merchants’ recurrent complaints about high transaction fees. In the past, regulation has mainly targeted the fees imposed by payment card networks. For instance, the most commonly used regulatory instrument caps the “interchange fee,” which is the payment made by the merchant’s bank (called the acquirer) to the cardholder’s bank (the issuer). This interchange fee in turn impacts the merchant fee, which has sparked the controversy in the first place. The last few years have witnessed a renewed interest in policies allowing merchants to differentiate price according to payment choice. Absent public regulation on the matter, payment systems (open systems such as Visa and MasterCard, but also closed systems such as Amex, PayPal, and Google Wallet) have prohibited merchants from levying surcharges on their own payment method (the so called “no surcharge rule”). Arguably, one natural alternative to traditional regulation of interchange fees is to let merchants price discriminate as a function of payment method, allowing them to pass through to consumers any excessive merchant fees. The primary object of this note is to shed light on this debate, and clarify how optimal regulation of cash discounts/card surcharges by merchants is related to traditional modes of regulation of merchant fees.

915,"January 20, 2015",US: St. Lukes ordered to undo Saltzer acquisition,"
Idaho based hospital operator St. Alphonsus Health System, Inc. won its antitrust lawsuit against St. Luke’s Health System Ltd. this week. St. Luke’s moved to acquire one of Idaho’s oldest and largest independent healthcare groups Saltzer Medical Group. St. Alphonsus sued saying that the combined healthcare system would account for over 60 percent of the adult primary care physicians. The Federal Trade Commission and the Idaho Attorney General launched their own investigations and later joined the lawsuit after finding that the joined healthcare system would also account for about 90 percent of the pediatric physicians.
The new London partnership includes a group of five Who’s Who Legal-listed lawyers who join from Edwards Wildman. 
The suit had a difficult start as a judge refused preliminarily enjoin the acquisition and required a trial, during which St. Luke’s completed its acquisition of Saltzer. In January last year a bench judge ruled in St. Alphonsus’ favor and ordered St. Luke’s to divest itself of Saltzer. St. Luke’s appealed the ruling, but the court again ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.

The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) has fined Ryanair, a low cost airline, $638,825 for unfair business practices. The complaints center around the company using call centers for its clients that only use premium numbers. The investigation into the company’s business practices was initiated in June 2014, and Tuesday at the conclusion of the investigation the ICA has issued a fine as well as requiring Ryanair to take specified measures within 90 days. The measure include eliminating the premium rate phone numbers, lowered tariffs for phone support and allowing a customer service chat support through its website.
Ryanair has already started on some of the measures, which caused the ICA to deliver a lower fine.

919,"January 12, 2015",US: Animation studios move against lawsuit,"
Since 2009, several of the major animation studios have been investigated about anti-poaching practices and, in 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched its own investigation into the allegations. Now, several studios are petitioning for a complete dismissal of one lawsuit say reports.Several lawsuits were consolidated since September readdressing the same issue, this time directed at The Walt Disney Company, Sony, Blue Sky Studios and DreamWorks Animation.
In Friday’s request for dismissal, the defendants stated that the new allegations are too late and that the statute of limitations has passed for the recent lawsuit. Additionally, they state that the allegations are non-specific and even showed multiple situations in which the defendants, specifically Sony, showed strong competitive hiring practices. The defendants also made allegations against the law firm of Cohen Milstein claiming that the law firm took its stance after the judge had rejected the settlement of $325 million in the similar class action suit against Apple and Google.
The dismissal request is scheduled to be heard on March 26 by US District Judge Lucy Koh.The DOJ’s investigation ended with several companies agreeing to a prohibition against enforcing anti-poaching pacts for five years and authorities decided to not prosecute. In 2011, a class action lawsuit was filed against Pixar, Lucasfilm, Adobe, Inuit, Google and Apple claiming the companies had a non-solicitation agreement. Pixar and Lucasfilm settled for $9 million each, while the remaining defendants have appealed after a judge decided that a joint settlement of $325 million was insufficient.

920,"January 12, 2015",South Korea: Samsung future in hands of Microsoft royalty spat outcome,"
Samsung is reportedly mulling a new partnership with Microsoft, a curious business move for the South Korean firm considering it is still in the midst of a patent dispute with the US computer giant.
According to reports, Samsung is looking to loosen its dependence on Google’s Android mobile operating system and possibly look towards Microsoft’s Windows 8.1 system when manufacturing smartphones, according to unnamed sources.
One unnamed official told reporters that “Samsung has run pilot programs on the stability of Windows 8.1 software on devices. It is interested in promoting Windows mobiles.”
But Samsung’s ongoing patent licensing dispute with Microsoft presents a major hurdle for Samsung’s potential new Windows phones. The companies secured an agreement several years ago that saw Microsoft obtain licensing royalties from Samsung.
Samsung, however, argues that Microsoft nullified their agreement when it acquired Nokia’s handset operations, placing Microsoft in direct competition with Samsung. Microsoft has since filed a lawsuit against Samsung to recover $1 billion in royalty fees.
Reports say Samsung is still fighting for antitrust authorities in the US, China and South Korea to nullify the Nokia acquisition.

Five years after EU authorities forced Microsoft to display a browser choice screen for its consumers as part of a landmark antitrust ruling, reports say the company has pulled the plug on the screen.
The European Commission demanded Microsoft show the screen to allow users to choose which browser to use, an order that was part of a settlement reached with the company following an investigation into allegations that Microsoft’s tying of Internet Explorer with Windows was anticompetitive. The settlement was reached in 2009.
The screen provided download links for rival browsers, including Google Chrome and Apple Safari. It was displayed only in the EU.
Microsoft announced Wednesday that it would retire the screen. In a statement, the company said “the obligations imposed by that decision have expired and as a result the Browser Choice Update will no longer be delivered to new users.
Just last year, the Commission fined Microsoft $732 million for omitting the ballot screen from its Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for 14 months, reports say. Microsoft claimed it was a technical error.

923,"December 16, 2014","Yes We Can, But Should We? Merger Remedies During the First Obama Administration","






This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle

Keith Klovers, Christine Wilson, Dec 16, 2014
During the 2008 Presidential election, Barack Obama promised to “reinvigorate” antitrust enforcement in the United States. Candidate Obama focused in part on merger enforcement, an area in which he promised to “step up review of merger activity and take effective action to stop or restructure those mergers that are likely to harm consumer welfare.” Candidate Obama also argued, “we probably have to update how we approach antitrust to figure out what is truly anticompetitive behavior.” Following his election, observers predicted a significant change of position at both the Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.
Subsequent merger cases suggest that the Agencies revised their approach, sometimes significantly. These changes were particularly evident in the realm of merger remedies. During President Obama’s first term, the Agencies—particularly the DOJ—imposed a string of novel merger remedies, including: (i) compulsory innovation (Google-ITA); (ii) compulsory FRAND licensing of a product that did not yet exist (also Google-ITA); (iii) the imposition of divestitures creating two new competitors to replace the loss of one competitor (Ticketmaster-Live Nation); (iv) prospective mandates on the level of employment and output (Gazette-Daily Mail); (v) long-term bans on serving specific current clients (Ticketmaster-Live Nation and Election Systems & Software-Premier Election Solutions); and (vi) significant restrictions on the use of intellectual property, particularly patents in the pharmaceutical industry (Perrigo-Paddock) or those viewed as standard-essential (Bosch-SPX and Google-Motorola).
These novel remedies represent a significant and potentially troubling departure from traditional agency practice.

The nation’s top patent court issued a landmark decision last Thursday that declares how patent licensing fees should be determined, reports say.
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declared that those fees should be based on the incremental value of each invention and not the value of the standard as a whole. The ruling also limited the ability to argue that patents are misused to gain higher royalties in some cases.
Reports say the decision was the first by any appeals court.
The ruling was made on technology giant Ericsson’s contribution to industry standard for Wi-Fi, which incorporates more than one thousand patents, according to reports. Those standards are set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which is currently debating changes that could possibly contradict this court ruling.

929,"November 12, 2014","US: Microsoft, Oracle gear up for latest non-poaching fight","
Microsoft, Oracle and several animation companies are filing their first briefs in the latest legal battle over non-poaching agreements, say reports.
The companies are facing allegations of anticompetitive conduct by colluding to agree to not hire each others’ employees, which kept salaries unfairly low, plaintiffs argue.
The case is the third major wave in non-poaching litigation in the past two years. Several months ago Google, Apple, Adobe and Intel settled non-poaching claims for $324.5 million; that case is ongoing, however, as US District Judge Lucy Koh denied acceptance of the offer, arguing it was too low for Silicon Valley employees. The companies appealed her decision and the matter is currently at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Last year, Pixar Animation, Lucasfilm and Intuit settled their own non-poaching claims for $20 million.
Now, however, Microsoft is looking to distance itself from being grouped into what some claim is a conspiracy between technology companies to keep wages low. A lawyer for Microsoft filed a brief Monday claiming “nothing…suggests this ‘overarching conspiracy’ included Microsoft.”
Similarly, Oracle has denied involvement in such collusion. “Oracle was deliberately excluded from all prior litigation filed in this matter because all the parties investigating the issue concluded that there was absolutely no evidence that Oracle was involved,” the company’s Vice President Deborah Hellinger said last month.

Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP announced this week that it has launched an investigation into possible anticompetitive conduct by retailers CVS and Rite Aid in their decision to not accept Apple Pay at their locations.
According to a press release published by the firm on Tuesday, Schubert is considering a possible class action against the retailers for their refusal to accept contactless payments, including recently-launched Apple Pay and competitor Google Wallet. CVS and Rite Aid both disabled their systems from accepting the mobile payment methods just one week after Apple Pay launched. Reports say the decision was sparked by the Merchant Customer Exchange, of which both retailers are members. MCX has developed its own, competing mobile payment system, known as CurrentC, to avoid fees charged by credit card issuers when mobile payment systems like Google Wallet and Apple Pay are used.
CurrentC does not allow credit cards in its system, reports say.
Schubert is now seeking input from consumers on the impact of CVS and Rite Aid’s decision to not accept the mobile payment methods, and is investigating whether the retailers’ action violates antitrust law.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia‘s final day as competition chief is Friday, when his successor, Margrethe Vestager, will take his place and inherit a slew of high-profile competition cases.
Experts and industry players are all watching Vestager, and reports say her first few weeks will be crucial in determining how she will execute her pro-competition rule.
In an essay written by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft lawyers Alec Burnside and Anne MacGregor, the authors argue that while the European Commission’s trend has been a relatively straight path of action, Almunia proved a more outspoken competition chief than others before him.
Experts are now wondering if Vestager will similarly make waves as she takes on some of the biggest competition cases currently pending across the globe.
Those cases, of course, include the longstanding antitrust investigation into Google, its market dominance and the way it displays rivals search results.

936,"October 28, 2014",France: Digital Minister eyes complexities of antitrust in high-tech,"
France’s Digital Minister Axelle Lemaire spoke at a global technology conference this week to discuss how the EU plans to update its rules for global technology conglomerates, and among those updates necessary, Lemaire said, is antitrust revisions.
The Minister said Tuesday that current antitrust laws cannot easily apply to technology giants like Google. “They are not monopolies in the sense that their behavior doesn’t result in an increase in prices,” she said at the conference held with Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith.
She noted that France is working with Germany and other jurisdictions to explore how to reign in the power of what the French call “les GAFAs” – the Googles, Apples, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.
Reports earlier this month emerged that Lemaire met with officials in Berlin to discuss possible updates to EU competition laws in efforts to restore a “level playing field,” according to an unnamed source.
On Tuesday, however, Lemaire declined to elaborate exactly how regulators would achieve this.
The event was launched by WSJD Live.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia appears poised to hand off his regulatory torch to successor Margrethe Vestager when he leaves office at the end of the month.
According to reports, Almunia spoke with reporters regarding the progress of current competition cases and the potential for new investigations. “There will be no opening of new cases,” he said. “No, there is no time. It will be up to the new Commission.”
Reporters had asked Almunia about earlier suggestions that the EU would open cases into Google’s Android operating system or allegations of foreign exchange benchmark rigging. But the commissioner assured that any developments in those matters will be handled by Vestager.

A lawsuit was filed against technology company Oracle accusing the firm of colluding with rivals to not hire each other’s employees, the same allegations that have plagued major Silicon Valley firms including Apple and Google.
A lawsuit was filed this week is seeking to join the ongoing litigation against Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe, whose settlement offer is currently on appeal.
According to court documents, the lawsuit against Oracle should be joined with the other because a “substantial portion of both cases concerns the same parties and events. These two cases concern overlapping conspiracies that each grew out of the same unlawful anti-solicitation agreement between Google and others, including Oracle.”
Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe have offered $325.4 million to settle the allegations with a class of 64,000 employees. That deal was denied by IS District Judge Lucy Koh, who criticized the offer as inadequate even though the class had approved of the deal.
Now, however, as the defendants fight to have the offer approved by an appellate court, the employees now agree that the settlement is too little.

Plaintiffs suing four major technology companies for allegations they colluded not to hire each other’s employees are reportedly urging an appellate court to reject the defendants’ settlement offer after a federal judge rejected it.
According to reports, the tech employees have asked the court to reject the $324.5 million settlement offered by Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel after US District Judge Lucy Koh tossed the deal, denouncing it as far too inadequate. The defendants appealed her decision, saying it was made in “clear legal error.”
Reports say the plaintiffs filed with the court Tuesday asking for another rejection of the deal, noting that the class would defer to Judge Koh’s “sound judgment about how best to oversee this litigation.” The employees had originally approved of the offer.

A former DreamWorks Animation artist has filed a class action lawsuit against DreamWorks Animation, Disney, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Lucasfilm and others accusing the companies of colluding to not hire each others’ employees to keep wages down, say reports. The case follows just months after several major Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google, Apple and Pixar, were accused of similar anticompetitive conduct.
US District Judge Lucy Koh has presided over the class action suit against those firms since the US Department of Justice opened a case into the matter in 2010, which was soon followed by a class action. Judge Koh recently rejected a settlement proposed by Google, Apple and Intuit for $325 million, criticizing the offer as too low.
Now, Judge Koh will reportedly reside over the most recent non-poaching class action suit. Plaintiffs in the case are seeking relief, including compensatory damages that could potentially be trebled under antitrust law, reports say.

942,"October 8, 2014",EU: Commissioners race to the finish line as new EC steps up,"
The EU’s competition chief is racing to the finish line of his term with a slew of recent announcements. While Commission insiders tell reporters that this end-of-term activity is not unusual, some critics say it may bar successors from taking control of their own agendas once in office.
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has made a slew of announcements in recent weeks, most notably with plans of an investigation into corporations’ tax relationships with certain member states. Starbucks, Apple, Fiat, and now Amazon are all being put under the spotlight for tax breaks given to them in the EU, and the Commission is now probing whether those breaks constitute illegal state aid.
In her confirmation hearings, Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager said those tax probes are a “high priority” for her term, and vowed to continue cases launched by Almunia with as much force.
Also among the closely-watched cases launched by Almunia is the investigation into Google’s alleged abuse of its market dominance in the way it displays rival search results. Vestager is expected to carry the torch passed by Almunia on this matter as well, and she will come into office just weeks after Almunia back-tracked and decided that Google’s third round of concessions was not enough to ease competition concerns.
According to reports, some experts are concerned that Almunia is too quickly launching new cases to be handed to his successor. Some claim, say reports, that the slew of announcements sets out Vestager’s agenda after Almunia’s departure without Vestager having much say.

943,"October 5, 2014",EU: New competition chief Vestager quickly confirmed,"
The new European Commission competition head, Margrethe Vestager, has been confirmed by the European Parliament to her position, reports say.
Officials announced Friday that Vestager secured confirmation for the position, to which she was appointed last month. She will start on November 1.
Vestager will take the place of current Commissioner Joaquin Almunia and therefore inherit several significant and controversial cases currently being examined by antitrust authorities. Among those cases is the ongoing probe of Google, which has thrice failed to convince the Commission that its concessions are adequate to end the investigation. Google is accused of abusing its market dominance in the way it displays its own services in search results over rivals’ services.
While Vestager received swift clearance from Parliament, reports say some other nominees were not so lucky.
Three of new EC chief Jean-Claude Juncker’s nominations had their approval delayed following hearings at Parliament. New economy chief Pierre Moscovici, new head of financial services Jonathan Hill, and new climate and energy commissioner Miguel Arias Canete were not immediately cleared by lawmakers to take their positions.

The European Commission’s new competition chief, whose appointment was announced earlier this month, has made her official entrance on the scene in speaking with reporters before her confirmation hearing, only days away.
Margrethe Vestager spoke with media to announce an aggressive and firm stance as new competition chief, telling reporters that neither “loud people” in government or major corporations, or “anti-Americanism,” will impact her decision-making abilities in the competition probes to come.
Vestager will succeed current European competition chief Joaquin Almunia, who recently announced that he has sought more concessions from Google in a years-long antitrust investigation that will now be handed down to Vestager.
While the new commissioner declined to comment on specific cases, she said that she will remain a fair judge of mergers and acquisitions and would not be bullied by corporations or individuals looking to sway her future decisions.
Vestager was Denmark’s economy minister until her nomination to the European Commission position. Her official confirmation to the post will take place on October 2, according to reports.

945,"September 10, 2014",EU: New EU Competition Commissioner appointed,"
A new head of competition at the European Commission was announced Wednesday.
The Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, announced the appointment of Margrethe Vestager, the former economy minister of Denmark, to succeed European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia later this year as competition chief. Almunia’s term ends October 31.
Vestager will inherit several high-profile competition cases that will remain unresolved when Almunia leaves his post. Those cases include investigations into JPMorgan Chase, Russia’s Gazprom and, perhaps most high-profile, Google.
Following the announcement of her appointment, Vestager spoke in Copenhagen, telling reporters that “the most important is that cases are treated with fairness and transparency.”
”No matter if you’re from Spain, Germany or somewhere else, it’s crucial that you feel that your case is dealt with in a fair and equal matter,” she said.
The Google investigation
Almunia confirmed Wednesday that the Commission will demand further concessions from Google to end an antitrust case that has lasted several years. His announcement confirms that he will not be able to close the case before his term ends, as he has previously hoped to do.
Vestager will now be tasked with resolving the matter.
Almunia appeared steadfast in accepting Google’s latest revised round of concessions to settle the dispute stemming from the way the company displays its search results. On Wednesday, the competition chief bowed to the most recent wave of criticism against the deal, confirming that the case will not be closed before he leaves office.
Soon after Juncker announced the appointment of Vestager and other EU Commissioners, the newly-appointed digital policy chief, Gunther Oettinger, spoke openly about the Google investigation.
While he is not directly responsible for resolving the matter, Oettinger spoke soon after his appointment was announced to warn Google that the company is facing a renewed crackdown from the EU with the new EU Commission staff.

Canada’s Competition Bureau told a hearing on Monday that television consumers should be able to pick and choose which channels they want to pay for and slammed channel bundling as “price discrimination,” according to reports.
The hearing, meant to discuss the future of the television industry, was held by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Several proposals were offered at the discussions to boost competition in the industry, but the Bureau declined to support any specific plan.
Instead, Bureau representative Renee Duplantis offered overall support to improved competition, telling the hearing that the watchdog “fully supports the move to improve consumer choice and flexibility.”
”Bundling in and of itself is a form of price discrimination,” she said.
The hearing will invite cable providers and online content providers, including Netflix and Google, to discuss the matter over the next two weeks. Reports say the notion of “pick and pay” options for channel purchasing will also be a subject of discussion.

As major technology companies continue to fight to settle a lawsuit accusing the firms of forming non-poaching agreements, similar allegations have now been filed against Walt Disney, DreamWorks Animation and other film industry conglomerates.
Reports say the latest suit may signal a wave of incoming litigation challenging non-poaching agreements, in which competing companies agree not to hire each others’ employees so as to artificially keep wages low. The class action against Disney, DreamWorks and others accuses the companies of colluding to not hire each other’s software engineers, digital artists and animators, according to reports.
Meanwhile, Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe are fighting to have a proposed $324.5 million settlement offer approved to end litigation filed against them for non-poaching claims. The settlement offer was rejected by a judge several weeks ago after it was slammed as insufficient.
That Silicon Valley lawsuit has earned significant attention as reports say case documents include potentially damning evidence in the form of emails sent by Apple founder Steve Jobs and his role in the alleged collusion.

The companies issued a filing late last week to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, asking the court to overturn Judge Koh’s rejection of the settlement, arguing that she “committed clear legal error” and “impermissibly substituted the court’s assessment of the value of the case for that of the parties who have been litigating the case for more than three years,” say reports.
The class action on behalf of thousands of tech employees was filed against the firms accusing them of colluding to strike non-poaching agreements between each other, artificially keeping wages low, the plaintiffs said.

952,"August 22, 2014","Competition, Innovation, and Dynamic Change in the Internet Information Search Industry","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
R. Shyam Khemani, Aug 22, 2014
At the core of the widely acknowledged economic and social benefits accruing from the internet are the internet search engines such as Bing, Google, and Yahoo!, among several others. These search engines act as intermediaries by providing timely and relevant information sought by internet users, and connect those users to suppliers of various products and services.
In the development and evolution of the internet information search industry, there have been marked increases in the number of search engines as well as churning, i.e., entry-exit and changes in their respective ranks. This is to be expected in new, dynamic, fast-changing and innovative industries, especially as the internet and related service providers are generally viewed as still being in the “infancy” stage of development. Without this dynamic competitive process (which the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter termed “creative destruction”), there would be less or no technological change and progress. During any given time period, some firm(s) are likely to emerge as leader(s), while others may decline in their market position or exit. This process is especially characteristic of the internet search engine industry.
Google has emerged as a leading internet search engine in several countries. Various allegations of anticompetitive practices have prompted investigations by different competition authorities. In this regard, we note that most of the investigations are in response to complaints by rivals rather than consumers—contrary to a basic tenet of the objectives of competition law: To protect and promote the competitive process in order to maximize consumer welfare, but not to protect competitors.
In this connection, it is critical for any competition authority investigating alleged dominance and abuse of dominant market position to ascertain if a firm’s market position—such as  Google’s—is a result of anticompetitive business practices in violation of competition law and, further, to establish whether there are appreciable adverse effects on consumers; namely, the principal users of the internet search engine. Equally, competition authorities need to ascertain if a firm’s alleged dominant market position stems from “superior competitive performance” over rivals. Finally, they must ensure that competitors are not misusing competition law to: (i) impose costs through unnecessary litigation, (ii) tarnish the leading firm’s reputation, and/or (iii) detract its management from better serving its customers.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Out of the Murky Lagoon and Into…Is There a Emerging Consistent US Government Policy on Standard Essential Patents – Mark Bohannon (Red Hat, Inc.)
ABSTRACT: In January 2013, the USDOJ and USPTO issued a Policy Statement on remedies for Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) which concluded, that while an Section 337 exclusion order issued by the US International Trade Commission (ITC) for infringement of encumbered SEPs may be appropriate in some circumstances, “depending on the facts of individual cases, the public interest may preclude the issuance of an exclusion order in cases where the infringer is acting within the scope of the patent holder’s F/RAND commitment and is able, and has not refused, to license on F/RAND terms.” Contemporaneously, the FTC entered into a settlement with Google which defined what constitutes an SEP and demarcates specific steps to determine what is, in fact, an unwilling licensee, proscribing unilateral action by the SEP holder seeking damages or injunctions.
Together, these action bring some order to what has been a murky area in telecommunications standards. But, unlike the FTC in its settlement agreement, the USDOJ/PTO Policy Statement, went further, evidencing what appears to be an overreaching regarding U.S. Government (USG) policy on voluntary industry standards (and how patents relate to them), even though the factual situations arose in the peculiar industry of telecommunications. This paper explains how that sector differs from others, focusing especially on standards for software, Internet and Web fields, analyzes the risk (and inconsistency with other USG policies) for assuming that there is one approach for how patents are treated in standardization activities across all sectors, and outlines next step considerations for policy makers.

Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe offered $324.5 million in settlement funds to thousands of tech employees that sued the companies for anticompetitive non-poaching agreements. But Judge Koh swiftly rejected the sum as one that “falls below the range of reasonableness.”
Experts and industry insiders had previously criticized the settlement, arguing that after taxes and fees the 64,000 plaintiffs would be awarded about $3,750.
The lawsuit, which included additional companies Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar until they settled last year, became a high-profile case representative of Silicon Valley’s alleged anticompetitive behavior against its employees. One expert hired for the case had previously estimated that damages should reach about $3 billion.

955,"July 24, 2014",Multinational: YouTube music chief quits amid indie label dispute,"
Another blow has been dealt to the delayed music-streaming project of Google-owned YouTube as its product manager has quit, reports say.
Music project manager Chris LaRosa will leave the company Friday to join a start up; La Rosa marks the second major departure from the new music service in the last year.
According to a source, both resignations were a direct result of delays that the company have had to deal with. A significant cause of those delays are ongoing disagreements between Google and independent labels.
YouTube reportedly decided not to negotiate with indie label licensing body Merlin in the UK and instead forced unfair terms on those labels. According to the labels, they had to either agree to the terms – which, they say, offered lower royalties than what was offered to major labels – or have their music content swiped from YouTube. The contracts, the labels also argued, included most favored nation clauses and other anticompetitive aspects.
One advocate for the labels, Impala, has filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission over the situation despite YouTube’s eventual decision to negotiate with the indie labels. According to reports, similar complaints are expected in US, Brazil and other jurisdictions.
The antitrust troubles have caused significant delays to launching the project, according to reports. The first version of the streaming service was developed more than one year ago.
Reports did not indicate who would replace LaRosa at YouTube.

The lawsuit filed in May says Google unfairly forces smartphone manufacturers to preload Google apps on Android phones. If the lawsuit proceeds, reports say the case could crack open a trove of hidden Google emails and contracts with smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics.
Google motioned to have the case dismissed earlier this month on grounds that even with Google-owned applications preloaded on phones, consumers can still use and download competing applications.
But if the case continues, reports say Google rivals could use revelations from the case to fight Google overseas.
Google continues to face criticism by consumer advocates, rival tech companies and competition regulators in the EU as the European Commission gears up to settle with Google to close a separate case. European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has assured opponents of the settlement that Google will continue to face intense scrutiny and new investigations by EU competition authorities.
While Microsoft is not a plaintiff in the case in the US, it is among several Google competitors that filed complaints with the European Commission last year over similar issues. The Commission is still debating whether to open a formal investigation based on that complaint.

958,"July 14, 2014",US: Android wants OS lawsuit tossed,"
Android is seeking the dismissal of a lawsuit targeting its operating system, reports say, as Android owner Google reportedly filed a motion in court late last week.
A class action was filed against Google in May claiming that Google unfairly licenses Android to smartphone manufacturers, undermining competitors for mobile services like online search. The suit was filed by two smartphone customers and is seeking class action status.
The case accuses Google of forcing smartphone makers like Samsung to set Google as the default search servicer on Android smartphones, giving Google an unfair advantage within Android’s dominant market share across the globe.
But Google filed a motion Friday, say reports, arguing that smartphone makers can install the Android operating system on the phones they make without installing Google-specific applications.
”Google’s conduct is not only fully consistent with but actually promotes lawful competition,” the company said in its filing.

959,"July 9, 2014",US: Fake docs add bizarre twist to non-poaching suit,"
A bizarre yet seemingly legitimate court filing produced in a high-profile antitrust case regarding the hiring practices of major tech firms including Apple and Google has turned out to be a fake, adding a new twist in the plot.
According to reports, the document filed Monday was filed as a motion by additional plaintiffs; the document described alleged connections between US District Judge Lucy Joh and the White House, President Barack Obama’s ties with the defendants, and other strange claims.
The document also reportedly used lawyer Cathy Elliot Jones’s state bar number and signature.
”That’s my state bar number, but I did not file that,” she said. “Somebody just hijacked my name and bar number. I’m really mad about this.”
On Tuesday afternoon, reports say, yet another similar document appeared on the docket.
The court denied the first fake notion and began investigating the incident, but has not commented on the reported second fake filing. A spokesperson said the filing involved the court’s electronic filing system and that an investigation is under way.
Such false filings are rare, reports say.
The matter has added a new twist to the case in which 64,000 tech employees of Silicon Valley sued Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe of unfairly colluding and striking anticompetitive agreements to not hire each others employees in efforts to keep wages down between 2005 and 2009. While the plaintiffs sought $3 billion in damages, a $324 million settlement is currently pending approval.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Let’s Talk About Android – Observations on Competition in the Field of Mobile Operating  – Torsten Koerber (Georg-August-Universität)
ABSTRACT: The paper examines whether the royalty-free distribution of the Android OS and the Google Mobile Applications Suite (GMS) is in line with competition law, in particular with Article 102 TFEU.
The author takes a look at Google’s business model and at the contractual framework of Android mobile OS and GMS licensing. He assesses market definition and competition on the markets for mobile OS and mobile apps.Then he turns to the crucial question of abuse of market power. Frist, he analyses whether royalty-free licensing of open source software can constitute a price-based exclusionary conduct or even predatory pricing in a two- or multisided environment. Then he turns to the question whether licensing all Google apps in a single suite of apps (GMS) constitutes an anti-competitive tying practice or creates pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits.
Throughout the paper the author compares the particularities of competition in the “new” mobile ecosystems to the “old” world of client PC operating systems that formed the background of the Microsoft tying cases.

YouTube has reportedly responded to recent outcry from smaller music labels slamming the Google-owned video streaming service for anticompetitive behavior.
Just weeks after reports emerged that YouTube was forcing certain contractual terms on indie labels if they wanted to have their music streamed from YouTube’s new music service, YouTube has reportedly announced that it would open itself up to negotiations with the labels. The labels were warned that if they did not agree to the contracts, their music would be taken down from YouTube within mere days.
But now YouTube seems to be open to altering the licensing terms with those labels. Reports say, however, that YouTube will still take down the labels’ music if parties cannot agree on contract terms.
The labels had previously called on European competition authorities to investigate the matter.

962,"July 4, 2014",Beyond Comcast-Time Warner Cable: The Fragmentation of the American Internet,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Anant Raut, Apr 14, 2014
The fate of Comcast-Time Warner Cable is almost an afterthought for web content creators, who are facing a much more existential threat. The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Verizon v. F.C.C. seemed to sound the death knell for net neutrality, validating “pipe” owners’ discretion to price discriminate the web content they carry. Unless the Federal Communications Commission (moved quickly to take regulatory action, warned the commentators, broadband providers such as Comcast and Verizon would extort a toll from high-volume content providers such as Google, Netflix, and ESPN to ensure that their content loaded just as smoothly as their competitors’, or, for an extra price, faster, essentially creating a protection racket under the guise of an economically efficient two-sided market.
Except the big content providers may not be as captive as we think. Over the years, hints have emerged that the most successful content providers have tried to reduce their dependency on the pipe owners: whether Netflix caching its content directly in the last mile through Open Connect; Google experimenting with running a lightning-fast fiber network; or Apple stitching together its own delivery network ahead of its rumored move into higher content offerings. Should the FCC fail to restore net neutrality rules, this may be the moment when the biggest content providers decide to disintermediate the pipe owners entirely and sell broadband service directly to consumers.
But a splintering of the neutral net into branded internets would only widen the digital divide in this country. Because of the capital costs of building and maintaining broadband architecture, the branded internets are likely to focus on dense, urban markets where the bulk of their users live. Left behind will be the rural, less affluent regions of the country that already have trouble getting more than one internet provider to compete for their business. If the FCC fails to reverse the D.C. Circuit’s decision, then the market will find a way to correct itself; but in a way that only benefits the most profitable segment of the consumer market.

963,"July 2, 2014",US: Appeals court changes mind about Motorola LCD suit dismissal,"
An appeals court in Chicago announced Tuesday that it has decided to vacate its earlier decision to uphold the dismissal of Motorola Mobility’s lawsuit claiming it was a victim of the LCD panel price-fixing collusion, according to reports.
The court’s decision revives Motorola’s case against various LCD makers including Samsung Electrics and Sharp. The case will now be heard again.
The court did not offer a reason for its change of heart.
Mobile phone manufacturer Motorola, owned by Google, is suing companies that were found to have manipulated LCD screen prices. The case has earned significant attention by antitrust experts because Motorola is fighting the actions of LCD makers’ overseas affiliates.
The appeals court found last March that those overseas companies were beyond the reach of US antitrust law, and therefore dismissed the case.
The court is headed by US Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner.
”If the remedies are inadequate, or if the countries don’t have or don’t enforce antitrust laws, these were the risks that the subsidiaries (and hence Motorola) assumed by deciding to do business in those countries,” Posner wrote in the March decision.
That ruling aligned with last January’s ruling by US District Judge Joan B. Gottschall, who found similar reasoning for dismissing the case.
But Motorola was backed by the American Antitrust Institute and the Federal Trade Commission in its pursuit to have its case heard. Experts warned that dismissing the case on these grounds has wide, negative implications for the effectiveness and strength of federal antitrust law.

One week after a letter reportedly sent by European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia that hinted more Google probes could be coming, reports say the regulator publically acknowledged that even as a current case with the search giant is wrapping up, the company still faces possible competition investigations.
Almunia’s remarks follow the expected conclusion of a competition case over Google’s search practices and while additional complaints against the company continue to be filed.
In one of the most recent complaints, music trade group Impala asked the European Commission to examine Google-owned YouTube and its alleged anticompetitive contracts the video streaming service is forcing on smaller, independent music labels to participate in its new music streaming program.
”We are receiving more complaints, for instance the way Google leverages the search engine,” Almunia said at a conference this week. “YouTube, for instance, it’s another kind of activity where Google can also leverage their market power in search engine, and maybe this will give way to another investigation.”
Previous reports said a leaked memo sent by Almunia aimed to convince his fellow Commissioners that they should pass his proposed settlement with Google, because future investigations are likely on the way.

965,"June 26, 2014","EU: Commission asked to intervene in YouTube, indie label row","
A music trade association has reportedly asked the European Commission to intervene in a dispute between small music labels and Google-owned YouTube, claiming that agreements YouTube forces upon those labels for participation in its new music streaming service are anticompetitive.
YouTube announced last week plans to launch its new music streaming service to rival companies like Spotify. But Impala argues that YouTube is abusing its market strength and could force unfair terms on smaller labels or block those labels’ content from its site.
YouTube, Impala claims, is also planning on using least-favored nation clauses.
While YouTube is not expected to launch the service until later this summer, reports earlier this month emerged that the leading video streaming website plans to pull small labels’ content form its platform unless they agree to the terms.
”This goes far beyond what would be agreed with any other service,” Impala said of the reported contracts.
The Commission did not comment on the matter.

967,"June 20, 2014",US: Non-poaching settlement in jeopardy,"
A federal judge has reportedly expressed concern about approving tech companies’ settlement offer proposed to end a lawsuit filed against the firms’ non-poaching agreements.
US District Judge Lucy Koh said Thursday that the plaintiffs have leverage against the companies, Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel, should they go to trial. The companies offered a $324.5 million settlement to plaintiffs to end litigation after plaintiffs, thousands of Silicon Valley workers, sued the companies in 2011 for antitrust violations, accusing the companies of illegally colluding with each other not to hire each other’s employees.
The plaintiffs were seeking $3 billion in damages, which could be trebled to $9 billion.
But the settlement was reached last April. Now, reports say that deal may not get a pass.
”I just have concerns about whether this is really fair to the class,” Judge Koh said Thursday regarding the settlement. She added that she has not yet made a decision regarding the offer’s approval.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs, however, said that a settlement was likely their best option, noting that the $324.5 million offer is “bar far” the largest antitrust employee settlement ever reached, and that the plaintiffs are facing significant risks if and when the case is appealed.
The lawyer added that the Supreme Court is not likely to hear a case with such a large class.
But Judge Koh was reportedly skeptical that the case would reach the nation’s top court. “if there was gong to be a good case for further restricting class actions, I’m no sure this is the one,” she said.

According to an unnamed source, the European Commission has informed Ireland that it may expand its investigation into the nation’s tax practices, which already includes Ireland’s relationship with Apple.
The Commission launched a probe into Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and their tax relationships with major companies, over concern that the nations’ lenient tax policies could be considered anticompetitive under EU rules. The investigation will also look at those businesses, which include Apple and Google.
Now, reports say the Commission could expand the case in Ireland; critics say the nation is too lenient with tax rules applied to Apple. Reports say the technology firmed has saved millions of dollars from tax breaks. The Commission, the source said, is concerned that similar tax rules have unfairly been applied to other companies as well.
The tax practices came under EU scrutiny following calls for action by France and Germany, reports say.
In a speech on Friday in Luxembourg, EU tax commissioner Algirdas Semetas spoke out against unfair tax rules and said regulators “must verify that the principles of fair ply are not being undermined.”

969,"June 20, 2014",US: SCOTUS ruling puts patent troll victimsâ€™ future in question,"
Last Thursday’s ruling by the US Supreme Court regarding software patents is leaving questions for victims of patent troll abuse, according to reports.
SCOTUS announced its ruling late last week that some patents in Alice Corp. vs. CLS Bank were invalid because they represented an abstract idea, even though those ideas were applied to a computer. According to the Main Street Patent Coalition, of which several retail groups are a member, the ruling could help patent troll abuses.
”Overbroad and abstract patents like the one invalidated today provide the ammunition for patent trolls to prey on businesses,” the Coalition said following the SCOTUS ruling.
But the high court’s decision also leaves some questions regarding patents, especially since the Senate decided to postpone efforts to overhaul the patent system with the goal of reining in such patent trolls, which obtain patents for the sole purpose of obtaining licensing fees or suing those that use those patents. Many of the patent obtained by the trolls are the vague intellectual properties SCOTUS just ruled cannot be patented.
The head of the Application Developers Alliance, Jon Potter, said the case highlights the need to overhaul the patent system, and calls into questions thousands of patents that have been issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office that could not be considered invalid.
”The question for Congress and for app developers is how many of these mistakes has the PTO made? And how will Congress help patent troll victims that are abuse by hundreds of trolls wielding thousands of patents that never should have been issued?”
The Alliance, with members that include Yahoo and Google, is now calling on Congress to pick up its patent reform goals once again, especially as software developers warn against an overly broad application of SCOTUS’s ruling.

Google is raising competition concerns yet again, this time in its remarks to The Financial Times announcing plans to cut off independent record labels from posting their bands’ music videos on YouTube due to royalty disputes.
According to reports, Google is rumored to be launching its own music streaming service but has been accused of offering unfair contractual terms to smaller music labels compared with the three leading competitors.
The smaller labels requested that the Commission investigate these contracts, claiming that Google offered them less favorable terms and using coercion to have them sign; the labels claim Google threatened to pull their content from YouTube unless they signed the contracts that offered lower royalty rates to the companies compared with larger labels.
Now, reports say, YouTube executive Robert Kynci seems to be confirming rumors that YouTube will be pulling indie label videos, telling reporters that some of the content will begin disappearing “within days.”
YouTube, which is dominant in the online video streaming industry, is running the risk of antitrust issues, some reports say, by refusing to engage with smaller companies.

971,"June 18, 2014","EU: Commission solidifies IP rules with Samsung, Motorola cases","
The European Commission quietly released a competition policy brief earlier this month to elaborate on the application of two recent patent cases to the competition regulator’s policy on Intellectual Property.
In the release, the Commission elaborates on how two cases involving Samsung and Google’s Motorola have helped shaped the EU’s patent rules and response to cases involving standard-essential patents. The cases, the Commission says, set two crucial precedents and “legal certainty” in industries that involve SEPs.
”[The cases] constitute a guide for Member State courts, as well as to standard-setting organizations, on the interpretation of EU competition rules regarding the enforcement of FRAND-encumbered SEPs,” the brief says.
In the Samsung case, the company sought legal action against rival Apple in various jurisdictions for patent infringement, despite Apple being considered a “willing licensee” of Samsung patents. The matter was probed by the Commission, resulting in Samsung agreeing not to pursue further injunctions in the EU regarding SEPs for mobile devices for the next five years.
In the Motorola case, the Google-owned company also sought injunctions against Apple, also considered a willing licensee; the Commission, in this case, had previously voiced concerns that Google’s acquisition of Motorola could lead the company to leverage its SEPs against rivals. The Commission found Motorola to be abusing its dominant position because it sought injunction against a willing licensee for SEPs.
Both cases, the Commission says, streamline the EU’s rules concerning intellectual property and patent infringement, and “confirm the Commission’s balanced approach with respect to IP rights and competition.”
”In concrete terms, these decisions clarify that SEP holders should not abuse their market power by ‘holding up’ willing licensees with injunctions,” the regulator writes.

While Microsoft generally keeps its patent licensing agreements tightly under wraps, China’s Ministry of Commerce offered a glimpse into the money the tech giant makes from those deals, particularly with rival Google.
MOFCOM reportedly published details of Microsoft’s licensing deals made with Google for Android smartphone devices, reporting 73 standard-essential patents that were reviewed by regulators. The information was published on its site in part of its review of Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Nokia’s handset operations, a $7.2 billion deal that concerned Chinese authorities over how it would affect Microsoft’s patent licensing agreements. Reports say MOFCOM examined the deal to determine whether the patents acquired through the Nokia purchase would encourage the companies to hike licensing fees.
MOFCOM approved of the merger last April.
In addition to the SEPs, MOFCOM reported 127 patents implemented in Android products that were developed by Microsoft. Reports say Microsoft acquired those patents through its involvement in the Rockstar Consortium, which also includes Apple, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony, formed to negotiate licensing deals.
Reports did not indicate the financial details of Microsoft’s licensing deals, but analysts late last year calculated the company was earning up to $2 billion through those agreements.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Competition Policy and the Technologies of Information – Herbert J. Hovenkamp (University of Iowa – College of Law)
ABSTRACT: When we speak about information and competition policy we are usually thinking about oral or written communications that have an anticompetitive potential, and mainly in the context of collusion of exclusionary threats. These are important topics. Indeed, among the most difficult problems that competition policy has had to confront over the years is understanding communications that can be construed as either threats to exclude or as offers to collude or facilitators of collusion.
My topic here, however, is the relationship between information technologies and competition policy. Technological change can both induce and undermine the use of information to facilitate anticompetitive practices. This change is partly a result of digitization and the many products and processes that it enables. The technologies of information account for a significant portion of the difficulties that competition law encounters when its addresses intellectual property rights. In addition, changes in the technologies of information affect the structures of certain products, in the process either increasing or decreasing the potential for competitive harm.
This paper focuses briefly on five issues: (1) assessments of market power and the opportunities for its exercise in information technologies; (2) the U.S. and EU antitrust or quasi-antitrust inquiries into Google Search; (3) the eBooks price-fixing and most-favored nation litigation; (4) the appropriate role of competition policy in facilitating internet neutrality; (5) the special problems posed by the patent laws in antitrust analysis of information technologies.

CPI Asia Column edited by Vanessa Zhang (Global Economics Group) presents:
Merger Control in China: Understanding MOFCOM’s Unique Approach – Sébastien J. Evrard  & Baohui Zhang* (Jones Day)
Almost 15 years ago, the European Commission decided to block the merger between GE and Honeywell, which had been cleared by the US Department of Justice and a number of other jurisdictions. This decision unleashed a firestorm of criticism.1 Since then, the enforcement of merger control provisions on both sides of the Atlantic has been – by and large – consistent.2
As merger control enforcement in the US and EU was converging, China developed as a third major antitrust jurisdiction.3 The Anti-Monopoly Law (“AML”) came into force in 2008 and its enforcement frequently makes the headlines.4 On the merger control side, MOFCOM does not hesitate to take decisions in global transactions that are not consistent with those taken by other antitrust enforcers.5
MOFCOM’s unique approach in some global transaction has not resulted in the same level of criticism as what the European Commission had to endure in the wake of GE/Honeywell. This could be because the additional remedies imposed were not perceived by the parties as onerous enough to complain publicly. This could also be because of the recognition that MOFCOM is a relatively new enforcer and is therefore going through a learning curve.

Apple confirmed the news of its planned $3 billion acquisition of Beats Wednesday and, according to reports, the deal means Apple will continue running the Beats Music smartphone app for both Android and Windows.
It marks the first time Apple will continue running an app on rival platforms following an application; according to reports, the company usually discontinues the app for Google-owned Android and Microsoft’s Windows.
An upper-level Apple executive, Eddy Cue, confirmed Wednesday that the company intends to keep Beats running on rival platforms. Reports suggest that not only will that agreement allow a further reach of the Apple brand, but it could also help Apple receive antitrust clearance for the acquisition.
The buyout is expected to close later this year.

Those ski endorsement deals, made with professional skiers, is the most expensive yet most effective ways to market ski equipment, the FTC said.
Regulators probed the companies and reportedly found that they had made the unfair agreements starting in 2004. The deals allowed the two companies to not bid against each other for endorsement deals.

While unnamed sources say the deal should be announced soon, reports say Google is preparing for a stringent antitrust review of the deal. YouTube is currently the number-one online video platform, a fact that could raise competition concerns with the Department of Justice, which reports expect to review the acquisition.
According to reports, Twitch holds about 1.8 percent of the market share.
Neither YouTube nor Google have confirmed reports of the buyout plans.

981,"May 12, 2014",US: FCC net neutrality revisions may be too little too late,"
As the Federal Communications Commission continues to come under fire for reportedly leaked net neutrality proposals that would allow companies to pay for priority content delivery, reports say the regulator could delay a vote on the proposed rules and is reportedly revising some of the policy.
Reports say an unnamed official said the changes would ensure nonpaying content providers would not be placed at an unfair disadvantage, and that the FCC must guarantee this. The source did say, however, that the rules will still allow some content to pay for faster Internet delivery.
But reports say even the changes may be insufficient to appease critics, who have championed the FCC to bar a content provider’s ability to pay for priority delivery. Companies as large as Facebook and Google have written to the FCC to promote such open Internet rules.
The FCC was dealt a blow earlier this year when its initial proposals for net neutrality were twice rejected by a court; according to the unnamed FCC official, the aim of the regulator at this point is to put net neutrality rules in place as quickly as possible.

982,"May 12, 2014",US: Plaintiff wants Silicon Valley non-poaching settlement tossed,"
In what reports describe as a rare gesture, Michael Devine, a freelance programmer who was one of four plaintiffs named in a high-profile non-poaching suit against Silicon Valley’s largest firms, has reportedly sent a letter to US District Judge Lucy H. Koh asking her to reject the $324 million settlement negotiated by Devine’s own lawyers.
”The class wants a chance at real justice,” the programmer wrote. “We want our day in court.”
The settlement offered by the tech giants, including Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe, is only one-tenth of the $3 billion estimated to have been lost by the 64,000 class members in the non-poaching collusion, the letter wrote. Plus, Devine wrote, the settlement is an easy fix for the companies in making an embarrassing lawsuit go away.
The companies were sued by the class for allegations of unfairly agreeing not to hire each others’ employees, artificially keeping wages low and stifling competition. The suit was set for trial at the end of the month until lawyers negotiated the settlement deal.
Before a settlement was reached, reports said a trial was set to unleash embarrassing and damaging revelations of the tech companies and how they operate. A rejected settlement could place that damning trial back on track.
But according to experts, a significant portion of the class would need to back Devine for a successful rejection of the settlement.

983,"May 11, 2014",US: Appeals court revamps Oracle/Android IP fight,"
Computer technology conglomerate Oracle has taken a major step forward in its efforts to sue Google for about $1 billion over allegations of patent infringement, according to reports.
An appellate court issued a victory to Oracle last Friday when it reversed an earlier ruling that said Oracle could not copyright aspects of the Java programming language, reports say; that Java script is the grounds for an intellectual property dispute between Oracle and Google. Oracle claims Google illegally incorporated parts of that Java language to develop its popular Android smartphone operating system.
Reports say Android remains the world’s best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle had originally sued Google in 2010, but a federal judge found that Oracle could not claim copyright protection over the Java language.
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington disagreed, however. In the three-judge panel’s decision, Federal Circuit Judge Kathleen O’Malley explained that the judges “conclude that a set of commands to instruct a computer to carry out desired operations may contain expression that is eligible for copyright protection.”
The case has increased in profile since its 2010 filing, reports say, not only because of testimony given in 2012 by high-level executives from Google and Oracle, but also because the panel has now ordered a new look at whether Oracle can obtain damages or whether Google’s use of the technology was protected under fair use, according to reports.

Days after silicon valley companies agreed to settle with tech employees who claimed the companies colluded to keep wages down, dozens of companies in Massachusetts are reportedly calling on the state to ban non-poaching agreements.
Reports say a letter has been hand delivered to Massachusetts senators and representatives asking lawmakers to ban non-compete agreements that allegedly lead major technology companies to agree not to hire each others’ employees.
The companies that are calling for the ban include various private companies including Actifio, DataXu and Veracode, according to reports. Smaller companies include FitnessKeeper and Boundless.
There were no public technology companies that signed the letter.
In their plea, the companies call upon lawmakers to follow in the path of other states that have banned such non-compete agreements.
The letter follows only days after various tech companies, including Apple and Google, settled a class action suit accusing the companies of harming competition with such non-poaching deals. The US Department of Justice has similarly probed such behavior among various companies.

The plaintiffs argued the agreements unfairly kept wages artificially low. The class had originally sought $3 billion in damages, which could have been tripled to $9 billion.

The company, which Google is set to sell to Lenovo Group, will instead be ordered to drop the legal injunctions; two sources said the Commission could announce its decision as early as this week.
The regulator is probing whether Motorola harmed competition by unfairly suing its rival Apple to block Apple product sales. The lawsuits filed by Motorola involve standard-essential patents that are necessary to ensure certain products, like smartphones, align with industry standards.
The Commission declined to comment on the sources’ information, but European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said earlier this month that he plans to settle the case with Motorola by the end of this month.

The defendants accused of anticompetitively striking agreements not to hire each others’ employees have reportedly settled with plaintiffs, according to court documents filed Thursday.
Major technology companies, including Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe, have decided to settle with tech workers who filed the class action suit in 2011 against the firms, arguing the companies kept workers’ wages artificially low by striking non-poaching agreements.
While terms of the settlement were not disclosed, the plaintiffs, made up of tens of thousands of tech workers, had been seeking $3 billion in damages. The settlement follows in the footsteps of fellow Silicon Valley tech groups Lucasfilm, Pixar and Intuit, which had already settled for $20 million.
The class action was filed following an investigation by federal officials that found evidence of such non-hiring agreements. The case grabbed national attention as the sides argued over whether emails exchanged between Apple founder Steve Jobs and other tech executives, reportedly conversing about their agreements to not hire each others’ employees, should be admissible as they portrayed Jobs in a poor light.

990,"April 24, 2014",US: The FCC backs away from net neutrality,"
The Federal Communications Commission announced Wednesday that it will allow content providers to pay Internet service providers priority streaming, a move that throws the future of net neutrality into uncertainty.
The FCC’s announcement follows three months after an appeals court twice struck down the agency’s original proposal that looked to guarantee so-called open Internet, which would prohibit companies like Google or Netflix to pay ISPs for faster content streaming. The move was meant to level the playing field for all content providers, some of which may not have the funds to pay for faster content delivery to viewers.
But FCC head Tom Wheeler defended the FCC’s change of heart on the matter, slamming critics of the proposals who say they destroy net neutrality as “flat out wrong.”
Instead, Wheeler said, the proposals would allow appeals courts to enforce and define the guidelines of net neutrality.
According to reports, the FCC’s new rule proposals could lead to top content companies charging viewers more to make up for costs paid to ISPs for priority streaming.
The hypothesized effects of the FCC’s announcement have been attacked by consumer groups and customers alike. Common Cause’s Media and Democracy Reform Initiative program director Todd O’Boyle, for example, said the rules, if they move forward, “will represent Washington at its worst.”

991,"April 20, 2014",US: No-hiring defendants pick apart the evidence,"
Defendants facing billions in damages for allegations of anticompetitive non-poaching agreements are looking to have certain types of evidence barred from being admitted to the case, according to reports.
Apple and other tech giants out of Silicon Valley are reportedly requesting that evidence from an earlier case with the Department of Justice be excluded from the current lawsuit accusing the companies of violating antitrust law with their non-compete agreements.
The DOJ first uncovered possible collusion in 2010 when it issued a complaint against Apple, Google, Adobe, Intel, Intuit, LucasFilm and Pixar, accusing the companies of agreeing not to hire each others’ employees.
The companies eventually settled and agreed to no longer enforce such non-compete deals, though did not admit any wrongdoing. LucasFilm, Pixar and Intuit settled the case late last year. US District Judge Lucy Koh gave the final okay to those settlements on Thursday.
The remaining defendants have now asked Judge Koh to declare evidence from the DOJ case as inadmissible, calling the consent decree “hearsay.”
Steve Jobs’s character in question
Plaintiffs in the case are also being challenged over plans to enter into evidence excerpts of Apple founder Steve Jobs’s biography that may portray the executive in a negative light – a factor that defendants say should not be admissible in the case.
Employees that filed the class action have reportedly referred to materials in the case’s pretrial period related to Jobs’s character; while defendants agree that emails between Jobs and other tech executives allegedly discussing their non-poaching agreements are admissible, the companies say that any references to Jobs’s character are “free-floating character assassination.”
According to reports, the plaintiffs referred to a biography of Steve Jobs written by Walter Isaacson, in which the executive is described as a dual “good Steve” and “bad Steve.” One statement reads, “Manipulation, selfishness, or downright rudeness, we couldn’t figure out the motivation behind his madness.”
The tech workers say that not everything in the biography is mere hearsay.
In a separate motion, reports say the class has requested a per se analysis of the allegations, rather than a rule-of-reason analysis, which the plaintiffs say will lead to a mere “quick look” at the charges.
The class is seeking up to $3 billion from the employees for allegations of keeping salaries stagnant thanks to the non-poaching agreements allegedly made between 2005 and 2009The case is set for trial late next month.

992,"April 14, 2014",The Beneficent Monopolist,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Allen Grunes, Maurice Stucke, Apr 14, 2014
The predictions that this merger will experience relatively smooth sailing, we argue, may be wrong for several reasons:

A merger can violate section 7 of the Clayton Act without the parties competing in the same geographic markets.
The Congressional command for section 7 is to arrest a trend toward concentration in its incipiency before the trend develops to the point that a market is left in the grip of a few powerful companies. One potential consequence of this merger is to accelerate the trend toward concentration among content providers and cable companies or other distributors. Indeed, arguably, Comcast itself set the stage for further consolidation when it entered into the NBCUniversal joint venture.
One reason Congress sought to thwart a market dominated by a few firms is to prevent coordination or collusion. As evidenced by the enforcement action involving the Verizon/Spectrum Co. deals, where DOJ sought to limit what could be regarded as a truce between Comcast and its most significant competitor, Verizon, we are already beyond that point.
Comcast’s “no-competitive-overlap” argument considers only cable and internet subscribers. It ignores how the competition laws were also enacted to protect sellers from powerful buyers. Thus, another concern is how the acquisition would increase Comcast’s power to disadvantage sellers of video content.
In investigating Comcast’s deal with General Electric that ultimately enabled Comcast to control NBCUniversal, the DOJ discussed various ways Comcast could disadvantage its traditional video competitors (direct broadcast satellite and telephone companies) plus the emerging online video programming distributors. In acquiring TWC, Comcast will have even more power to raise the costs of its traditional video competitors and also to thwart emerging OVD rivals by impairing or delaying the delivery of their content.

Our focus is to assess three of the arguments Comcast likely will make to argue that its acquisition of TWC is unlikely to lessen competition: (a) the broadband market is becoming more competitive-Google has introduced Google Fiber in a number of markets, and mobile broadband offered by wireless providers like AT&T and Sprint is competitive with fixed broadband; (b) Netflix and traditional media companies have sufficient clout to negotiate with Comcast and the government should not intervene on their behalf; and (c) the “wide array of FCC and antitrust rules and conditions from the NBCUniversal transaction in place . . . more than adequately address any potential vertical foreclosure concerns in the area of video programming.”

Days after a bug in the encryption technology, known as “Heartbleed,” surfaced as a massive threat to online users’ privacy, the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are urging companies to collaborate and share information regarding cybersecurity details without fear of antitrust repercussions.
Reports say companies had approached the DOJ with concerns about sharing such information over fears antitrust law would penalize the act.
”Legitimate cyber threat sharing can help secure the nation’s networks,” DOJ official James Cole said at a press meeting, held jointly with the FTC.
The companies that reportedly approached Cole with concerns were not named.
Cybersecurity within top companies in the nation have risen to the top of consumer and regulator concerns as high-profile security breaches continue to break news. Notably, Target Corp. revealed the cyber theft of 40 million credit and debit card records, and millions of other personal information.
But the FTC and DOJ are now encouraging companies to collaborate on cybersecurity efforts as the most recent threat, known as Heartbleed, continues to make headlines. Heartbleed has compromised potentially millions of personal data; while the exact breadth of the breach is unknown, online companies – including Yahoo, Google and Facebook – are urging consumers to change their login passwords to protect information.

As rumors heat up of a possible Google-owned wireless network, reports say Comcast could also be hopping on the mobile voice bandwagon should its acquisition of Time Warner Cable receive approval.
According to reports, Comcast teased the possibility of establishing its own mobile voice services in its filing with the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC, along with the Department of Justice, will review its proposed $45 billion merger with TWC.
To convince critics of the cable merger, Comcast reportedly stated to the FCC that the buyout would allow the company to expand the number of Wi-Fi access locations throughout the nation. With that, the company said, it “could make a ‘Wi-Fi-first’ service, which combines commercial mobile radio service with Wi-Fi, a more viable alternative.”
That idea, say reports, likely means Comcast is looking at using Wi-Fi to connect wireless calls.
According to reports, Comcast’s hypothetical plans could upend the wireless industry and its current top four players, especially if Google is planning something similar.
Google is said to be considering a service to offer wireless data to Google Fiber subscribers, which would also see voice calls being connected over Wi-Fi on Google’s networks.

A feud between Apple and Google over standard mobile phone patent royalties could be back from the dead as Apple has reportedly asked an appeals court to revive the case nearly four years after it began.
Legal representatives for Apple approached the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington on Tuesday to request a new look at the case, which accuses Google of charging unfair royalties for its patent licensing in violation of FRAND agreements.
According to reports, Google-owned Motorola charged 2.25 percent of an iPhone sale price – about $12 – for its technology, while Apple refused to pay any more than $1 per iPhone.
A scheduled trial to determine the royalty fees was tossed after Apple made that refusal.
The two companies have been feuding over patents since October 2010, say reports; additional litigation is currently pending in Miami, and a separate patent case was tossed in Chicago after Circuit Judge Richard Posner rejected Apple’s and Microsoft’s damage claims. The Federal Circuit heard arguments regarding the Chicago case last September.
The breadth of patent litigation between the enemy technology giants earned criticism from Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore. “I don’t understand what any of you are doing,” she reportedly told the companies. “Why are you suing each other in 15 different courts? I don’t think even you can keep track of which patent is in which court.”

MEPs have reportedly approved of proposed amendments to telco reforms that would introduce the principle of net neutrality in a victory for Internet giants including Google and Netflix.
European Parliament’s newly approved legislation would bar Internet service providers from charging extra for delivering certain types of content. The idea of net neutrality has come to the forefront of Internet companies’ concerns as companies like Netflix are threatened with having to pay extra to ensure video streaming is delivered to customers with sufficient quality. Similarly, consumer groups champion the policy as one that allows consumer choice and places companies on a level competitive playing field.
While the MEPs vote was a win for such companies, other telcos, including Vodafone, have reportedly argued that they should be allowed to require such extra fees to companies that rely most heavily on their delivery services.

The Beneficent Monopolist – Allen P. Grunes (GeyerGorey LLP) and Maurice E. Stucke (University of Tennessee College of Law)
ABSTRACT: In examining Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC), we assess three of the arguments Comcast likely will make to the Department of Justice and FCC. Comcast will likely argue that its acquisition of TWC is unlikely to lessen competition because: (a) the broadband market is becoming more competitive: Google has introduced Google Fiber in a number of markets, and mobile broadband offered by wireless providers like AT&T and Sprint is competitive with fixed broadband; (b) Netflix and traditional media companies have sufficient clout to negotiate with Comcast and the government should not intervene on their behalf; and (c) the “wide array of FCC and antitrust rules and conditions from the NBCUniversal transaction in place . . . more than adequately address any potential vertical foreclosure concerns in the area of video programming.”
We argue that notwithstanding Comcast’s and TWC’s assertions, combining two monopolies does not yield better service, lower retail prices, more innovation, and greater choices for consumers. Nor should the DOJ and FCC simply extend the prior behavioral remedies to this merger. Behavioral remedies are a poor substitute for market competition. Comcast and TWC have not overcome the presumption of illegality for this merger and are unlikely to do so. As was the case with AT&T/T-Mobile, DOJ should just say no.

ABSTRACT: Google’s domination of online search in Europe and the United States has attracted antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC” or “the commission”) recently concluded an investigation but declined to take major enforcement action, and investigation of the European Commission (“EC”) continues to drag on. These investigations covered a variety of allegedly anticompetitive behavior, such as “manipulat[ing] Google search results to penalize competitors or to privilege other Google products and features.” In addition, numerous private antitrust suits have been filed against Google, though none so far successful.

1001,"March 24, 2014",US: Silicon Valley no-poaching collusion goes deeper than previously thought,"
Reports say anticompetitive agreements made between Silicon Valley rivals including Apple and Google may have been more widespread than previously thought.
More than 60,000 tech workers are suing the companies, as well as Intel, Pixar, Adobe and Induit, over allegations the companies made illegal agreements not to hire each others’ employees. The US Department of Justice investigated similar claims of no-solicitation contracts, eventually settling the matter in 2010.
But with the recently-filed lawsuit, the claims have been revisited.
Some reports have revealed secret internal memos from Google and Apple that demonstrate such hiring agreements may have spanned over several years; the reports claim the documentation shows Apple’s Steve Jobs and Google’s Eric Schmidt formed a non-poaching agreement cartel that involved dozens of other companies, including Dell, Microsoft, Paypal, Comcast and more.
Reports say the memos date back to 2005. One of the documents reportedly shows Schmidt admitting to Google “driving up salaries across the board.”
The trial, given the go-ahead by a judge last January, is scheduled to begin May 27. The plaintiffs accuse the company an “overarching conspiracy” to strike illegal hiring agreements that have been found to be nearly identical to each other; the defendants have previously claimed those contract similarities are merely coincidence.
The revelations follow the unsealing of court filings that show Facebook declined to partake in such anti-poaching agreements, according to reports.
According to court documents, Facebook’s COO Sheryl Sandberg was approached by Google telling her to “lower the rate” Facebook hires Google employees. Facebook declined, however, a move that has now made Facebook a star witness in the case, rather than a defendant.

Google and Samsung Electronics are reportedly calling on Chinese regulators to monitor patent licensing fees charged by Nokia for wireless technology don’t spike following Microsoft’s planned buyout of the company’s handset operations.
Reports say the US and South Korean firms have joined China-based Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp to bring attention to their concerns regarding the fees and how the merger would affect Microsoft’s market share.
According to reports, the companies are asking Chinese officials to impose concessions on the acquisition.
The nation’s Ministry of Commerce launched a merger review into the deal but is likely to approve of the buyout, reports say, following the EU’s unconditional clearance given last December.
Microsoft plans to acquire Nokia assets, including a major patent portfolio, though some patents will remain with Nokia as the company moves away from the smartphone industry.

Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa is reportedly willing to bend in favor of competition regulators to secure a successful acquisition of O2 Ireland, according to a source.
Hutchison’s Three Ireland is looking to acquire its rival, owned by Telefonica, for $1 billion, but the European Commission is reportedly concerned of how the deal would harm wireless market competition.
Now, said a source, Hutchison is willing to divest spectrum and extend its current network sharing deal with a competitor to appease concerns.
Reports say Hutchison’s willingness to compromise suggests EU regulators are holding a tight grip over the telco industry. The Commission is reportedly concerned that Hutchison’s acquisition, which will reduce the number of competitors from four to three, will spike prices for consumers.
The Commission first launched its merger review into the deal more than three months ago.

Apple Inc has reportedly filed legal action against China’s State Intellectual Property Office over intellectual property violations regarding Apple’s “Siri” voice recognition technology, say reports.
The technology giant had previously requested the Chinese IP regulators to declare a rival company’s voice recognition software patent invalid, but the Office reportedly denied the request.
Apple has also sued rival Zhizhen Network Technology, the developer of the software similar to Siri’s.
Apple’s lawsuit will be heard by the Beijing Number One Intermediate People’s Court on Thursday.
The legal battle continues a long-running dispute between Apple and Zhizhen, the latter of which accused the iPhone maker of infringing on its patent for its Ziao i Robot software, the technology that is comprable to Siri. Zhizhen patented the voice recognition technology in 2004. The Chinese tech firm brought its case against Apple last July, but the court has not announced a decision on the matter.

Ahead of the closure of its $7.4 billion Nokia handset buyout, Microsoft is distancing itself from Nokia’s recently-announced for a new low-cost smartphone, powered by an offshoot of Google’s Android.
Nokia announced earlier this week plans for a new smartphone with pre-installed Microsoft services. The plan is known as the Android Open Source Project
But as Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia is pending, experts are unsure whether the tech giant will continue that line after the merger is complete.
Microsoft further propelled uncertainty on Tuesday when it distanced itself from its future merger target, noting that the companies “operate as two independent companies as required by antitrust law, and we will until the acquisition is complete.”

As Comcast remains at the top of the headlines for its recently announced plans of acquiring Time Warner Cable, the nation’s top cable company is facing a new dilemma, this time in the auto industry.
Reports say Comcast is rivaling General Motors to acquire crucial radio waves that could either be used for Web data wi-fi or for communications technology in high-technology cars.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced earlier this month that legislation for “talking” cars will be written before the end of President Obama’s term. That announcement, say reports, sparked a rivalry between the cable and auto industries; General Motors says the spectrum that can be used for life-saving car communications technology should take precedence over expanded wireless and web data services.
But Comcast, along with other technology giants like Google and Microsoft, claim such technology is a long-shot this early, and are now pushing for the Federal Communications Commission to allow the tech firms access to the spectrum.

1008,"February 13, 2014","US: Debate explodes after Comcast, Time Warner tie-up announcement","
Immediately following the announcement that Time Warner has chosen to be acquired by Comcast in a $45 billion deal, debate exploded over how the merger would affect consumers and whether authorities will actually clear the deal.
The merger sparked concern among consumer groups that the combination of the nation’s top-two cable companies will hike prices and create a near monopoly. But Comcast head Brian Roberts defended the deal Thursday as “pro-competitive,” “pro-consumer” and “in the public’s interest.”
The executive reportedly cited companies like Netflix and Google Fiber – a service projected to hold just 2 percent of the market –  as competition that will continue to test the newly-combined company as consumers edge away from their television sets and look to their computers for television streaming.
But according to some, there are significant hurdles to authorities clearing the deal as the companies will be forced to ensure that no more than 30 percent of the market is controlled, a policy under antitrust law.
Public Knowledge Senior Staff Attorney John Bergmayer said that should the merger go through, “it would yield unprecedented gatekeeper power in several important markets,” leading Comcast to become “the bully in the schoolyard.”
The US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission are expected to scrutinize the merger plans.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia announced plans to issue a prohibition decision against Motorola Mobility in efforts to curb the smartphone company’s patent litigation against Apple Inc.
Almunia told reporters of regulatory plans that will likely include an order for Motorola to change its behavior; the commissioner did not specify whether the company would be subject to fines.
The European Commission’s efforts are part of a broader agenda to put a haly to anticompetitive litigation launched between technology giants for use of each other’s patents. The practice, some experts conclude, not only harms competition but also innovation.
Almunia’s announcement, suggesting an impeding Motorola defeat, comes as HTC and Nokia announced an end to all pending patent law suits against each other, having struck a licensing agreement.
Google recently sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo Group, but will retain Motorola’s patent portfolio, say reports.

Smartphone giant Samsung has plenty to gain through its quest to rival Apple and Google with its own, new operating system Tizen, but according to reports, the company is hitting some major roadblocks.
Samsung is looking to break the operating system duopoly of Google and Apple with Tizen, which holds the potential for major financial gains for Samsung through third-party app sales. Apple earned $16 billion in app sales along in the most recent fiscal year, reports say.
Samsung would like to take a bite out of those profits. In a statement last month, Samsung co-Chief Executive Boo-Keun Yoon said that he does not feel one “can lead the market by focusing solely on software or hardware.”
But the bold effort is proving to hold major hurdles. Tizen partner NTT DoCoMo, for example, Japan’s largest telecommunications provider, was set to announce its first Tizen-ready smartphone last month. But the company suddenly shelved its plans on its released date due to a lack of demand for an alternative to Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS systems.
Now, say reports, an official launch for Tizen seems less certain, DoCoMo said it would watch market patterns to decide on a potential release of the phone.
Tizen, which was set to be released in 2012, stems from an earlier Samsung project Bada, which was eventually scrapped.
US wireless giant Sprint had partnered with Tizen in support of more operating system competition, but ultimately left the Tizen Association in 2013.

The resignations are part of a contest to the European Parliament election, reports say, meaning Almunia will likely have to pick up the slack. The added duties come this April mean the competition chief will also likely have to conclude major cases, like the one investigating Google, ahead of time.
Almunia is slated to conclude his term as Commissioner later this year after serving in the position since 2009.
Reports say in the few weeks he has to conclude major cases, the Commission is rumored to be close to a resolution with Google over concerns of how the company displays rival search results. But with a high-profile case regarding Russian gas giant Gazprom, reports say Almunia will likely launch formal charges against the company for price discrimination.
Without concluding the cases, Almunia’s predecessor will have to take over decisions of the high-profile probes.

According to reports, the dispute sprouted when the Nortel patent portfolio was up for grabs in 2011 when the Canadian telco went bankrupt.

Rockstar also sued Google for patent infringement, a case that is still unresolved respite the apparent settlement with Huawei. Reports say the Consortium is suing Google for infringing upon seven patents regarding technology that relates Internet searches to advertisements.

1020,"January 15, 2014",Angels Rush in Where Fools Fear to Tread: State Enforcement Against Patent Trolls,"
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Jay Himes, Matthew Perez, Jan 14, 2014
Nobody likes trolls-those mythical creatures, “considered dangerous to human beings,” who hide under bridges waiting to prey on unsuspecting travelers. Like their mythological namesakes, patent trolls-or, as they are known in more polite company, patent assertion entities (“PAEs”)—are fearsome to many a business. Patent trolls have sued major technology companies like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, and Google for years. Apple alone has faced over 170 lawsuits from patent trolls in the past five years.
Patent trolls, it is often said, seek only to extort licensing fees for patents that they do not practice (or ever intend to practice), but that they claim have been infringed. As Kent Walker, Google’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel, has put it:
Trolls use the threat of time-consuming and expensive litigation to extort settlements, even where their claims wouldn’t hold up in court.
This kind of patent troll litigation has grown like a particularly noxious weed, increasing four-fold since 2005. By some estimates it cost the U.S. economy nearly $500 billion over the past two decades. And the problem is growing.
“Growing,” indeed. According to a June 2013 presidential report, “[t]he increase in the number of suits filed [by patent trolls] for patent infringement has . . . been accompanied by an increasingly large number of suits threatened. . . . Conservative estimates place the number of threats in the last year alone [2012] at a minimum of 60,000 and more likely at over 100,000.” Of late, patent trolls have begun to issue demand letters to businesses across the country-often start-up and small companies, or “downstream” technology users-accusing them of infringing patents that the trolls hold and demanding licensing fees to avoid infringement litigation. “Although the amount of money extracted from each company is small, the number of potential defendants makes this strategy potentially profitable overall.”
Patent trolls “significantly retard innovation in the United States and result in economic ‘dead weight loss’ in the form of reduced innovation, income, and jobs for the American economy.” Thus, they have commanded the attention of both federal and state authorities. The FTC has invited public comments concerning their practices as part of a recently launched Commission review of PAEs. Senators John Cornyn and Patrick Leahy have introduced separate bills designed to address perceived abuses by PAEs. President Obama himself has weighed in: “[They] don’t actually produce anything themselves. They’re just trying to essentially leverage and hijack someone else’s idea to see if they can extort some money out of them.”
Nothing has yet been done at the federal level, however. And like nature itself, State Attorneys General abhor a vacuum. The “first-movers”—the AGs in Nebraska, Minnesota, Vermont, and New York—have each attempted to curb the ability of patent trolls to issue cease and desist or demand letters to businesses within their States. Can they do it—inasmuch as patent law is itself constitutionally based and, therefore, potentially preemptive of state enforcement? The answer is, predictably, an unequivocal “maybe.” We chart the path to maybe-land below. We first describe recent state activity, and then discuss the case law on federal patent preemption. We conclude by revisiting state efforts to curb patent troll abuse against the backdrop of preemption case law.

1021,"December 30, 2013",What a Difference a Year Makes: An Emerging Consensus on the Treatment of Standard-Essential Patents,"
Jonathan Kanter, Dec 30, 2013
These days, it is difficult to identify an antitrust issue that is generating more discussion than standard-essential patents. To some, SEPs are to antitrust what Breaking Bad is to television: a complex and important subject worthy of discussion. To others, SEPs are to antitrust what Miley Cyrus is to pop culture: a fad that consumes way too much attention and distracts from other more important subjects. In either case, antitrust lawyers and economists cannot stop scrutinizing the issue with vigor, fascination, and (sometimes) an admirable level of obsession.
Even just a year ago, the role of SEPs in litigation and the scope of commitments to license SEPs on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms seemed so divisive and controversial that one could not imagine any resolution in the fore. As the so-called “smartphone wars” reached a fever pitch, antitrust emerged at the center of the controversy. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division was in the midst of reviewing two major transactions involving large patent portfolios: Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, along with MMI’s patent portfolio, and the Rockstar Consortium’s acquisition of certain patents auctioned off by then-defunct Nortel Networks.
Shortly thereafter, complaints began flowing into enforcement authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the conduct of individual companies. The European Commission, DOJ, and Federal Trade Commission responded by opening their own conduct investigations.
These events led commentators and regulators alike to grapple with two important but controversial questions: Do SEPs warrant special antitrust consideration? And, if so, how should antitrust laws address concerns inherent in the defensive use of SEPs?
Quite remarkably, antitrust enforcement authorities and courts have begun to converge around answers to some of these questions. In the last year alone we have seen two FTC consent decrees, two EC Statements of Objections, and four District Court opinions all suggesting that SEPs warrant a certain degree of special treatment under U.S. and European law.
Setting aside the rhetoric of interested parties on all sides of the issue-which remains as divisive as ever-one can see a consensus beginning to emerge around certain key principles. Courts, agencies, and policy makers all appear to agree that SEP holders should abide by their F/RAND commitments and refrain from obtaining injunctive relief against willing licensees. This is not to suggest that either enforcement authorities or standards bodies broadly agree on all issues related to SEPs. To the contrary, these issues remain quite contentious. Still, the emerging alignment among key decision makers is somewhat remarkable considering the intense level of attention and controversy.

1023,"December 9, 2013",EU: Almunia not satisfied with Samsung patent litigation offer,"
Samsung’s offer to not bring rivals to court over patent infringement over the next five years is an unsatisfactory offer to European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, the regulator said Monday in a speech.
Samsung will likely have to offer more to end the Commission’s probe into the world’s top smartphone manufacturer, and whether the company’s infringed competition rules in taking rivals to court over patent disputes.
In addition to the five-year offer, Samsung proposed to discuss licensing fees with its rivals for one year, and to let a court settle patent disputes should those discussions lead to a disagreement.
Almunia told reporters that rivals’ feedback will be considered, suggesting the response from Samsung competitors has been less than positive, though he did not elaborate.
The investigation into Samsung overlaps as Samsung and rival Apple take each other to court over disputes over their smartphone patents; cases in more than 10 nations around the globe have been filed.
Almunia offered a speech in Paris Monday to discuss the role of patents – and, more broadly, intellectual property – in EU competition policy, announcing that he does not agree with the view that competition regulation and the IP community have “misaligned objectives.”
In mentioning Samsung in his speech, Almunia noted that the company’s offers have been market-tested, but need improvements. The competition chief also touched upon Google’s Motorola buyout and Microsoft’s recently-approved acquisition of Nokia, and how those mergers will impact patent litigation, though said that Nokia’s plans to keep its patent portfolio – seen as a threat that Nokia may charge more to license those patents – fall outside the Commission’s jurisdiction of merger reviews. Still, the regulator warned Nokia not to turn into a patent troll.

Amid allegations of spying by various US-based technology firms, some EU authorities have called for domestic IT groups to ban together and rival US giants.
The idea, reports say, would be to create the equivalent of an ‘IT Airbus;’ Airbus was created through EU aviation groups joining together in 2001 to rival the US mega-airliner Boeing.
Germany’s largest IT firm SAP, however, has rejected such an idea, saying the move would threaten competition and innovation.
”A merger between some European IT companies with the aim of drawing a line between them and the rest of the global market does not make any sense,” SAP co-chief executive Jim Hagemann said Wednesday.
The problem, he said, is that IT is a global industry that cannot be concentrated in one geographical area to combat another.
But some politicians who favor the idea say IT firms including Merkel would allow the EU to be less dependent on US dominating tech groups including Google and Microsoft.

Introduction by editor Vanessa Zhang
As interaction between the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) and intellectual property right (IPR) becomes center of debates worldwide, China has also geared up in the AML enforcement involving IPR. No matter private litigation or agency investigation, people would like to understand the nuts and bolts of how Chinese authorities take charge of the cases. In this month’s Asia Column, we have an insightful article which sheds some light on this issue. Enjoy reading and have a nice holiday season!
Summary
The recent rulings of the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court and the Guangdong Higher People’s Court in Huawei v. InterDigital addressed several important issues at the crossroads between antitrust law and intellectual property in China in respect of standards essential patents (SEPs).
On the issue of how the holders of standards essential patents can enforce their rights, it appears from this case that the Chinese courts share similar competition concerns with regulators and courts in developed jurisdictions such as the US and EU.
However, a China-specific consideration may impact the courts decisions in relation to SEP cases: the encouragement of indigeno...

The Perils of Excessive Discretion: The Elusive Meaning of Unfairness in Section 5 of the FTC Act
ABSTRACT: Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act gives the FTC an undefined mandate to prosecute “unfair methods of competition.” For nearly 100 years, the Commission has searched tirelessly for the meaning of this amorphous concept. Since 1992, the FTC has continued to define Section 5 through a series of consent decrees. Absent any external constraint, the FTC appears to have broad discretion to define the reach of Section 5 beyond the Sherman Act. This discretion causes uncertainty, which is likely to deter beneficial conduct. It also creates incentives to divert resources from productive to redistributional purposes. The recent FTC investigation of Google illustrates the FTC’s discretion to define the reach of Section 5. This paper suggests that the FTC issue a binding statement making Section 5 coterminous with the Sherman Act or limiting Section 5 to conduct that clearly harms consumers through adverse effects on competition, and that would not otherwise fall under the antitrust laws.

Israel’s Babylon announced Monday that its proposed merger with software application firm ironSource would be cancelled indefinitely following weaker third quarter profits.
Following the news, Google said it would not renew its partnership with Babylon; Google’s backing out is more bad news for Babylon, as Google made up about 43 percent of the company’s revenue.
Babylon shares rose Monday, however, following Yahoo’s announcement that it would not cancel a cooperation agreement.
Babylon was looking to double its market capitalization through the merger with ironSource, also based in Israel.
According to Babylon, the company’s failed merger did not account for Google’s decision to not renew their partnership contract, which expires at the end of the month.

1031,"November 3, 2013",US: Tech giants go to war over Android patents,"
A group of tech conglomerates self-proclaimed as the “Rockstar Consortium” filed a lawsuit late last week against several rivals, including Google and Samsung, over accusations of patent infringement regarding Android-related patents.
Reports say the lawsuit was filed by the consortium made up of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Sony and others against companies that offer Android products, including HTC, Huawei, LG, Samsung, ZTE, Pantech and Asus.
The defendants are accused of infringing on patents owned by Rockstar, acquired from Nortel in 2011 for $4.5 billion, beating out rival bidder Google. The patents reportedly cover 4G data networking, wireless, Internet and other portfolios for mobile devices.
The patent lawsuit comes about six months after Google submitted comments to the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns the company has for so-called patent trolls, which are companies that acquire patents for the sole purpose of launching lawsuits against companies that infringe on those patents, usually essential to the function of various products.

1033,"October 22, 2013","China: Yahoo must uphold search partnership with Microsoft, says judge","
A partnership between Yahoo! and Microsoft – which has Yahoo!’s search producing results from Microsoft’s search engine Bing – must be upheld in Taiwan and Hong Kong, a judge ruled.
US District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. ruled Yahoo! cannot back out of the alliance, inked to last a decade and signed in 2009. The partnership aimed to compete against search dominator Google.
The deal was made under former leadership for both Yahoo and Microsoft. Now, reports say Yahoo!’s current CEO Marissa Mayer attempted to slow the rollout of the search alliance within Taiwan and Hong Kong because she was unhappy with the deal.
Judge Patterson Jr. ruled that the search partnership must be implemented by October 28 in Taiwan and by November 11 in Hong Kong.
Reports say part of the reason Mayer wanted to delay the implementation of the partnership was to ensure that the terms of the deal would remain the same under Microsoft’s new CEO, following the exit of its current head Steve Ballmer.
According to reports, the search partnership was made following Yahoo!’s decline of a $44.6 billion buyout offer from Microsoft. The two companies have implemented their joint venture in 14 of their targeted 16 global markets so far.

More recent reports say Google, Cisco and SAP may be new contenders for Blackberry, sending the company’s shares up nearly four percent.
The matter is complicated by potential legal action against the company by shareholders, one of which told reporters that lawyers are looking into past opportunities for Blackberry to make a sale. The company reportedly turned down a buyout offer from Amazon and others in 2011.
Despite the new bidding rumors, one analyst told reporters that any serious offers are unlikely to come from Google, Cisco or SAP.

1035,"September 30, 2013",EU: Commission grills Motorola on patent litigation against Apple,"
The European Commission launched a daylong oral hearing Monday following its complaint sent to Motorola Mobility, the smartphone unit of Google, over allegations Motorola is abusing its dominance by launching litigation against rivals based on its standard essential patents.
The regulator will now press Motorola on the issue during the oral hearing. A spokesperson for the Commission declined to comment on the matter, however, as hearings are confidential.
The watchdog’s probe launched into Motorola in April of last year surrounds a much broader, controversial topic of excessive litigation stemming from standard essential patents. Experts are now studying how such lawsuits could harm competition.
Motorola launched a case against Apple based on the essential patents in Germany. In response, Apple and Microsoft both lodged complaints against the Google-owned firm.
Last week, Samsung Electronics submitted concessions in hopes of ending a similar case against the smartphone giant within the EU.

1037,"September 15, 2013",EU: Commission to define stance on standard-essential patents soon,"
The European Commission’s Joaquin Almunia said Friday at a conference in Italy that two investigations regarding disputes of standard-essential patents are “advanced” and could be concluded soon. The Commission’s decisions on the two cases will define the regulator’s stance on patents moving forward, reports say.
The investigations are looking into whether technology firms Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility are abusing mobile phone patents. Both companies were sent statement of objections.
The cases are part of a major power struggle between the companies, Google and Apple, which have all been trading victories as they sue each other for infringing on the so-called essential patents. Standard-essentials are patents for functions and technology necessary for a device to properly function.
According to Almunia, the Commission is cracking down on the “rules of the game” to stop such back-and-forth lawsuits and prevent companies from anticompetitively suing counterparts for infringements on essential patents.
While reports say a decision on the cases could be reached soon, Almunia assured that a date cannot be predicted at this time.
The Commission opened a probe into Samsung after the company began suing Apple within the EU in 2011 for infringements on 3G patent technology; a similar probe was launched with Motorola, which runs on Google Android software, after Microsoft and Apple issued complaints regarding smartphone patents.

1038,"September 12, 2013",EU: Watchdog moves to curb tax avoidance strategies by multinational cosâ€™,"
The European Commission confirmed Thursday it initiated an informal probe into tax rulings for multinational companies under state aid law and is now seeking information on the matter. The Financial Times reported Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have all been the subject of requests for information regarding the matter; a spokesman for EU Commissioner Joaquin Almunia confirmed the reports, stating the watchdog “is simply gathering information on tax rulings.”
According to reports, as the EU works to reduce debts and increase revenue, company taxes have come under the watch of the Commission. Calls to crack down on multinational companies’ strategies to avoid taxes have also increased.
Earlier this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development offered a blueprint for such a crackdown. Companies like Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. are named in reports for using such strategies.
The Financial Times reported Starbucks and Apple Inc. were among the companies requested for information regarding tax policy.

Verizon Communications has reportedly reached an agreement with UK-based peer Vodafone to acquire the remaining 45 percent of Verizon Wireless it does not already own, resulting in Verizon taking full control of its US wireless operations and the third-largest merger-and-acquisition deal in history, valued at $130 billion.
According to a statement released Monday, both companies’ executive boards have cleared the deal. The parties now expect to finalize the transaction in the first quarter of 2014.
The two have functioned as partners for 14 years.
If completed, the buyout would be the largest since Vodafone acquired Mannesmann AG 13 years ago. Reports say that financial details of the transaction place Verizon Wireless’s total value at about $290 billion, larger than Google Inc.’s market capitalization.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit banned Verizon, Ford and the American Association of Advertising Agencies from taking part in the legal dispute between Apple and Motorola regarding smartphone patents. The decision was made Thursday.
The companies were looking to get involved to support the FRAND standard in a joint effort to end import bans of products using standard-essential patents. The three were also encouraging restraint on issued royalty damages.
Apple reportedly approved of the involvement of the three, but Motorola, owned by Google, objected based on the company’s believe the three companies stood in support of Apple.
Motorola originally sued Apple for infringing on its patents for wireless devices; Apple responded with its countersuit in 2010 for touchscreen patent violations. The case continues as a judge denied Motorola’s request for injunctive relief against the iPhone in 2012, a ruling now on appeal by Motorola. The cross-appeal will be heard on September 11, say reports.

Following the US Department of Justice’s lawsuit filing against American Airlines and US Airways regarding their proposed merger, the regulator’s antitrust division named its newest head of litigation.
David Gelfand, a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP, was named Wednesday to the position as the regulator gears up for court in the airline merger case. He has previously represented Google in the company’s buyouts of AdMob and DoubleClick.
Gelfand will replace Joseph Wayland, the DOJ’s top litigator who resigned last November. Wayland served in the position for two years and led the blockage of AT&T’s T-Mobile US buyout attempt.
American Airlines parent company AMR Corp. recently announced it is seeking a trial as early as November 12, while the DOJ is looking to wait until next February. In a joint filing, the airlines said that such a late trail would “case serious harm and cannot be justified.”

1044,"August 1, 2013",EU: Is antitrust mega-lobbying backfiring?,"
The tendency to over-lobby on major cases taken up by the European Commission may actually be backfiring on major corporations like Google and MasterCard, according to a blog post published Wednesday by the Financial Times. The post comes just one day following the European Commission’s swiping payments regulations that restricts credit card giants’ interchange fees, a major blow to MasterCard that spent time and money lobbying the issue. MasterCard’s approached was slammed as a “mad campaign,” one that was “insufferable and counterproductive,” according to European Commissioner Michel Barnier. While the blog considers that MasterCard’s lobbying may have been successful in that the European Commission did not outright ban interchange fees entirely, the author, Alex Barker, suggests that such mega-lobbying may make EU regulators “more irritated than converted.” A similar example occurred with the antitrust case against Google and its methods of displaying search results; the lobbyists on the side of Microsoft rallying against Google, often portrayed as the fighters for consumer rights, appeared to have annoyed EU Commissioner Juaquin Almunia. In a past interview he described the complaints as “noise and fury,” and a fury that “neither Google nor the Commission” partook in. It’s a trend that may warrant lessons learned from future lobbyists, said Barker.

1049,"June 17, 2013",Not Enough Girls in the Club: The European Antitrust Approach Towards Multisided Markets,"
Christian Ahlborn, Christoph Barth, Jun 17, 2013
Long before the era of e-commerce, girls would be let into nightclubs for free (or get bonus drinks) while guys would be charged often “excessive” prices to get past the bouncer. Multisided markets involve economic platforms that provide related goods or services to two or more distinct customer groups where the value of the product to one customer group is dependent on the number of users or participants “on the other side.” An obvious contemporary example is smartphone operating systems that connect users of handsets with application providers: the larger the number of handset users, the more attractive is the platform to application providers (and vice versa). For online dating-in some ways the internet equivalent of a traditional nightclub-meanwhile, the match-making platform’s attractiveness to men is, again, dependent on the number of participating women (and vice versa).
The task of platform operators in multisided markets is to overcome co-ordination problems and to bring both (or all) sides “on board.” In setting prices for the various groups, they take into account the relationship among the various groups and the interdependencies of their demands, i.e. they internalize the network externalities between the various groups. Platform operators often achieve this balancing act by charging very different prices to the different groups of customers even where the underlying costs for the various users are the same.
In fact, there are frequent examples where for “one side” the use of the platform is free: Google makes available its search engine for free while charging advertisers (the same is true for Microsoft or Yahoo). Similarly, certain daily or weekly newspapers require their advertisers to pay all costs incurred and stock exchanges charge “liquidity takers” a commission for every share bought or sold, while “liquidity makers” get a significant rebate (or sometimes even paid for providing additional liquidity).
While economists have made significant progress over the last decade in describing and understanding multisided markets, competition authorities have struggled to come to terms with their specific characteristics (such as the interdependencies between markets and the implications for pricing) and in adapting traditional antitrust tools accordingly. In Europe, the competition authorities and courts have developed three distinct approaches to the analysis of multisided markets.

Intel is reportedly looking to break into the online television business as reports announced the company’s plans to launch its Intel TV product sometime this year. But the plans are meeting much resistance from cable companies, who have recently turned to defending their practices of bundling hundreds of television channels in one package. For at least a year the US  Department of Justice has been looking into the cable giants’ practices and, just this week, executives from Charter Communications and Warner Cable have publically supported their companies. According to Charter’s chief financial officer Chris Winfrey, it is in the consumer’s best interest for cable companies to maintain “the ecosystem” of how television is delivered to consumers. But as the cable companies continue to face scrutiny, they are also forced to fight the threat of companies streaming television online through banning programmers from providing content to online services. One such online service could be Intel’s new product, though as of yet it has not found sufficient programming to launch. If successful, reports say companies like Google and Apple could soon follow suit, changing the television landscape indefinitely.

Reports have surfaced that the Financial Times has gained access to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission to various competitors about Apple Inc.’s business practices. The questionnaire, sent to various wireless carriers, reportedly inquired about the company’s channel terms and alleged 4G restrictions on the iPhone 5. Rivals of the tech giant reportedly sent complaints to antitrust regulators concerning what they claim as disproportionate sales quotas imposed onto wireless carriers in order to encourage iPhone and iPad sales. The discovery of the questionnaire suggest the Commission has initiated a quiet investigation into the company; formal complaints against Apple have not been issued, however, nor has an official investigation been launched. The news comes just one week after reports emerged that the Federal Trade Commission has initiated another investigation into Apple rival Google, which is also under investigation from the European Commission.

The International Trade Commission released its ruling Thursday in a case initiated by Motorola Mobility, which accused Microsoft of violating Motorola’s patent with its Xbox gaming console. According to reports, the ITC has ruled that Microsoft did not violate the patent; if the outcome were against Microsoft, it would have threatened the company with a forced barring of imports of the gaming console to the US. The case is a major win for Microsoft, which is currently involved in another spat with Apple and mobile companies that use Google’s Android processing platform Motorola Mobility is one such company that uses Android for its smartphones.

Robert O’Donoghue, May 23, 2013

CPI Europe Column edited by Anna Tzanaki (Competition Policy International) presents:
Injunctions And Standard Essential Patents (SEPs): The Problems Of Arguing From The Particular To The General by Robert O’Donoghue* (Brick Court Chambers)
Introduction by Europe Column editor Anna Tzanaki
In the May edition of CPI’s Europe Column, Robert O’Donoghue (Brick Court Chambers) turns his attention to the “patent wars” debate and explains intricate issues pertaining to injunctive relief and standard essential patents (SEPs), which have been at the forefront of the Commission’s antitrust agenda recently. Over the past year, EU regulators have reiterated their view that seeking an injunction against a potential licensee of a SEP may, albeit exceptionally, constitute an abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU. The debate is framed around high profile cases involving some of the modern high tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Google/Motorola. 
 The potential concern with regards to SEPs in nascent, cutting edge markets is the strategic use of patents to inhibit innovation and competition on the merits among market rivals. In this regard, the Commission seems to find that while injunctions to enforce IP rights are legitimate in principle, owners of SEPs agreed on FRAND licensing terms must fulfill certain conditions before resorting to injunctive relief, e.g. that a potential licensee is unwilling to cross-license its own ...

May 21, 2013

CPI Asia Column edited by Vanessa Yanhua Zhang (Global Economics Group) presents:
MOFCOM Publishes Draft Merger Remedy Rules – James Modrall, Matthew Bachrack,& Cunzhen Huang (Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP)
Since China’s Anti-Monopoly Law (the “AML”) came into effect in 2008, China’s Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) has adopted 18 conditional decisions requiring concessions from the companies concerned before their transactions could proceed. MOFCOM’s remedy policy has attracted considerable attention among multinational companies, because MOFCOM’s approach often differs from that of other antitrust authorities. The antitrust community thus eagerly awaited MOFCOM’s first set of comprehensive rules on merger remedies.
MOFCOM’s draft “Rules on Attaching Restrictive Conditions to Concentrations between Undertakings (Draft for Comment)” (the “Draft Rules”),1 published on March 27, 2013, address a wide range of issues, including the design, implementation, monitoring, modification and waiver of merger remedies, as well as liability for breach. Unfortunately, the Draft Rules provide no guidance on the types of remedies MOFCOM prefers to address specific types of antitrust concern, in particular the unusual behavioral remedies MOFCOM has required in a number of recent cases. The Draft Rules also include a worrying new provision apparently allowing MOFCOM unilaterally to impose stricter remedies after the fact when it conc...

1063,"April 1, 2013",The European Commission’s Practice Under Article 9 Regulation 1/2003: A Commitment a Day Keeps the Court Away?,"
Paul Lugard, Martin Mollmann, Apr 01, 2013
No less than three recent high profile cases have put the EU antitrust commitment procedure in the spotlights. First, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) recently announced that it had terminated its investigation into Google’s services regarding search engines and web advertising, the EU Commission’s parallel attempts to reach an agreement with Google on similar commitments have been ongoing for about a year and are expected not to be finalized before Autumn 2013. Second, on March 6, 2013 the Commission imposed a EUR 561 million (U.S.$794 million) fine on Microsoft for having breached its 2009 “choice screen” commitment intended to offer consumers a choice of web browsers. Finally, on March 13, 2013, the Commission published in the Official Journal the text of the December 2012 commitment decision regarding the e-Books investigation involving Apple and four publishers. These three matters underscore the importance of the EU commitment procedure, and the controversies surrounding the use of this EU-style consent decree procedure.
As with all good things in life, the commitments procedure should be used with moderation to avoid indigestion. Although the commitment procedure was only introduced in 2004 in EU antitrust proceedings as a means to rapidly resolve cases, it has over the past years become a cornerstone of the Commission’s antitrust policy. Such success was not foreseen. In fact, when the Article 9 of Regulation 1/2003 was introduced, a prominent former EU Commission official expected the commitment procedure to remain an exceptional, alternative enforcement instrument in the Commission’s toolbox.
While the Commission already had the means to informally settle antitrust investigations prior to the adoption of Regulation 1/2003, Article 9 provided it with a clearer legislative framework and, importantly, clarified the rights of third parties.
It is sometimes argued that the commitment procedure of Article 9 has been inspired by a long standing U.S. procedure which allows the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the FTC to settle investigations by “consent decrees” (DOJ) or “consent orders” (FTC). These instruments are used in the vast majority of proceedings and allow the agencies to close a case on the basis of agreed concessions. One important difference with the EU system is, however, that DOJ decrees are reviewed by courts to determine whether the decree is in the public interest. Also, contrary to the EU system, U.S. negotiated settlements may include fines imposed on companies.
The frequent use of the EU commitment procedure supports the idea that the EU and the U.S. systems are converging. The frequency of negotiated outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic leads to similar questions, in particular with respect to the desired level of legal certainty and guidance, as well as the role and interests of third parties.
An antitrust enforcement system based solely on infringement procedures without any room for negotiated outcomes would undoubtedly be inefficient and inappropriate. But the question is whether the extensive use by the Commission of this new enforcement tool and the (partly self-inflicted) marginalization of the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in this area have not overshadowed the need to establish a balance between enforcement efficiencies on the one hand, and imperatives of legal certainty, due process, and non-discrimination on the other.

1065,"March 26, 2013",Global Antitrust: Does It Have Limits?,"
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Tad Lipsky (Latham) asks Global Antitrust: Does It Have Limits?
ABSTRACT: Before 1985 there was only one mandatory suspensive premerger notification scheme of general applicability in the world—Hart-Scott-Rodino review in the United States ; now there are scores.
Similarly, antitrust challenges to monopolization were almost exclusively American until at least the early 1970s (about the time the European Commission first squared off against IBM Corp.), but“abuse of dominance” claims are now increasingly common not only in Europe but also in Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and elsewhere, and they are a realistic threat to companies operating in almost any economically significant jurisdiction. Finally, aggressive prosecution of price fixing and analogous covert cartel behavior—long a hallmark of U.S. antitrust enforcement—now appears in waves of coordinated “dawn raids” upon suspected wrongdoers in Brazil, Canada, the European Union and its Member States, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and a steadily increasing number of other jurisdictions in addition to the United States. This spectacular global expansion of antitrust enforcement has never received much commentary outside the confines of the antitrust community—the antitrust bar, enforcement agency officials, the economists who assist in advocacy on behalf of parties engaged in antitrust disputes, as well as academics interested in antitrust issues and policies. Major antitrust matters do attain some higher visibility in the financial press and, more rarely, even in the mass media. Examples include EU and U.S. investigations of Google, the EU’s initial objections to the acquisition of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing (later resolved), and the clear conflict between the U.S. and EU over General Electric’s proposed acquisition of Honeywell International (which the parties ultimately abandoned). The main U.S. case against Microsoft was followed closely in the popular media, although years of drama ended with only a mild behavioral consent decree. A recent EU investigation of alleged abuse of dominance by Russian energy utility Gazprom led to front-page global coverage of powerful figures on both sides of the underlying dispute (over natural-gas prices)—Russian President Putin and EU Vice President and Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
On the whole, however, antitrust’s transition from an American sport to a global one has occurred well beneath the threshold of public attention and without media-worthy controversy.

Microsoft Fined for Non-Compliance: A Game-Changer in Antitrust Settlements  by Mario Mariniello (Bruegel)
Introduction by Europe Column editor Anna Tzanaki
Our March Europe Column is dedicated to the Commission’s landmark decision earlier this month fining Microsoft for breach of its legally binding commitments. Microsoft offered voluntary commitments to close the Commission’s tying case back in 2009, by pledging to introduce a web browser ballot screen. Notably this was the first time that the Commission has fined a company for not respecting an antitrust settlement. However, the calculation of the fine was equally interesting, and as duly noted by Commissioner Almunia, it served as a signaling mechanism of specific and general deterrence against future infringements. This is of critical importance if the Commission is to continue adopting Article 9 commitments decisions, while ensuring strict compliance and the benefits of antitrust settlements. Competitors such as Google may be happy to see strict enforcement of Microsoft’s commitments but they should be careful about not finding themselves in a similar situation…
 Mario Mariniello (Bruegel) explains the intricacies of the Microsoft fining decision and provides an insightful cost-benefit analysis of settlement decisions as a matter of antitrust policy. We hope you enjoy this month’s Europe Column!

A new trend is beginning to emerge that may cast yet another shadow over Facebook and its market power. According to reports, investors, entrepreneurs and the makers of Facebook applications are increasingly concerned over Facebook’s apparent ability to make-or-break the success of those apps, as the social network has the power to control how third-party apps connect to customers. Viddy, a Facebook app for sharing videos, is one such application whose success and eventual downfall significantly rode on the heels of Facebook, according to the company. Facebook’s director of developer products Douglas Purdy, however, argues that the consumer controls who succeeds and who falls in the Facebook realm. And, as app developers face the struggle, reports say they could turn to Facebook rivals such as Google Inc.’s Play Market or Apple Inc.’s App Store.

David Evans, Richard Schmalensee, Nov 13, 2012
Adapted from the Introduction and Conclusions to The Antitrust Analysis of Multi-Sided Platforms by David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee, which is forthcoming in Roger Blair and Daniel Sokol, eds., Oxford Handbook on International Antitrust Economics, Oxford University Press.
Since the birth of the multi-sided platform literature, three noteworthy developments have taken place.

First, there has emerged a large and rapidly expanding literature on multi-sided platforms in economics, antitrust, and strategic management. We have identified more than 150 articles on multi-sided platforms that have appeared in print or in working paper form since we last surveyed this area in 2007 for an ABA compendium on antitrust. It is still early in the development of this corner of industrial organization, and by no means have all important questions been answered.
Second, competition authorities around the world have used the multi-sided platform framework to evaluate cases and reach decisions. The OECD 2009 survey examined how various authorities were approaching cases involving platforms. The multi-sided platform literature is regularly cited in submissions in legal and investigative proceedings.
Third, a number of large global multi-sided platforms have emerged as a result of ongoing revolutions involving the Internet, mobile devices, and information technology more broadly. These platforms have garnered considerable attention from antitrust authorities—for example the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s and the European Commission’s investigations of Google—and private complainants—such as Qihoo 360’s lawsuit against Tencent in China and the Consumer Watchdog complaint against Facebook in the U.S. Read more…

Wei Han, Feb 26, 2013
Even though the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China (“AML”) has been in force for a relatively short span of time, antitrust law enforcement in China has attracted the attention of observers around the world. The main reason concerns curiosity regarding how the Chinese competition authorities review global M&A transactions. In the past few years, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) has approved a series of global transactions-such as Google’s acquisition of Motorola’s mobile business or the two hard disk drive deals-subject to conditions though.
This article will first discuss the legislation on merger remedies in China. Then, it will provide background on some of the cases where remedies were imposed. Finally, the article will point to the problems encountered in the merger remedy area in China-both in the existing legislation and in MOFCOM’s case practice-and I will put forward some personal suggestions on how these problems can be solved.

David Evans, Feb 14, 2013

 
There’s an old saying that nothing’s certain but death and taxes. I want to add something else to the list. There are only 168 hours in a week. Everything you do from sleeping to working to watching television to eating and romance you need to do in those 168 hours. That’s one tough constraint.
Now you might ask, what does this have to do with the purported subject of this column—the antitrust economics of multi-sided platforms? Plenty it turns out, as I explain in my recent paper on attention rivals.
There are many multi-sided platforms that are in the business of trying to get a piece of your 168-a-week time allotment hours. Most of them turn around and sell access to the time you are spending on their platform to various businesses that would like to reach you—like advertisers, merchants that want to sell to you directly, and companies that want you to use their applications.
Most of the online platforms are attention rivals and those are the businesses I focus on in the paper and in this column.
Facebook has secured a big chunk of people’s time. And they make money from that attention by selling space to advertisers on Facebook pages. Those advertisers hope that you’ll give them a piece of the attention you are giving to Facebook. Amazon on the other hand gets a lot of people to go to its pages to read reviews, browse merchandise, and then buy products. They share that attention with merchants who sell through Amazon.

1075,"February 13, 2013","What’s in a Name? Measuring Prominence, and its Impact on Organic Traffic from Search Engines","
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Michael R. Baye (Department of Business Economics and Public Policy, Indiana University Kelley School of Business), Babur De los Santos (Department of Business Economics and Public Policy, Indiana University Kelley School of Business) and Matthijs R. Wildenbeest (Department of Business Economics and Public Policy, Indiana University Kelley School of Business) ask What’s in a Name? Measuring Prominence, and its Impact on Organic Traffic from Search Engines
ABSTRACT: Organic product search results on Google and Bing do not systematically include information about seller characteristics (e.g., feedback ratings and prices). Consequently, it is often assumed that a retailer’s organic traffic is driven by the prominence of its position in the list of search results. We propose a novel measure of the prominence of a retailer’s name, and show that it is also an important predictor of the organic traffic retailers enjoy from product searches through Google and Bing. We also show that failure to account for the prominence of retailers’ names–as well as the endogeneity of retailers’ positions in the list of search results–significantly inflates the estimated impact of screen position on organic clicks.

1076,"February 6, 2013","EU/US: For US antitrust activism, Brussels is the place to be","
As Washington’s reputation as a “broken” spot for policy-making continues to grow, US lobbyists, activists and organizations are increasingly traveling to Brussels to promote their agendas, especially when it comes to antitrust issues. Among the most prominent examples of the new trend is the recent cases against Google, which ended quietly in the US but rages on among European regulators. Along with Google, Facebook and the US Chamber of Commerce all have lobbyists in Europe. In 2009 another notable addition to this trend occurred, when activist group Knowledge Ecology International asked the European Commission to block a merger between Sun Microsystems and Oracle; the result was a delay in the merger, though it was eventually approved in 2010 after speculative pressure from the US.

1077,"January 23, 2013","US: Steve Jobs threatened Palm with patent case, wanted no employee-poaching deal","
Legal filings that were recently made public suggest that the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs threatened smartphone manufacturer Palm with a patent lawsuit if Palm did not agree to a contract stating the two companies could not lure each other’s employees to work for the other side. The statement quotes Palm’s ex-CEO Edward Colligan. The filings, made public last Tuesday, are part of a civil lawsuit against Apple, Google and other tech giants that argue the no employee-poaching deal drove down workers’ wages. Colligan reportedly called Jobs’ offer “wrong” and “likely illegal.” Judge Lacy Koh, residing over the case, is reportedly considering whether the lawsuit can proceed as a class action.

Recent reports and interviews given by the European Commission and its Commissioner Almunia are shaping Almunia’s reputation into an increasingly tougher, more ruthless authority, according to analysts. With his recent blocking of a major, nearly $7 billion deal for UPS and TNT to merge – on top of recent comments that Google may not escape without punishment like the search giant did in the US – introduce a difficult year for major merger activity already. According to reports, in his three years as Commissioner, Almunia has already blocked as many merger deals as his predecessor, Neelie Kroes. In a recent report, however, Almunia denies the tough-guy label, noting that he has cleared “hundreds” of mergers in his term, also pointing to statistics to show the majority of mergers that come across the European Commission’s table are cleared.

Antitrust attorney David Balto argues in the wake of the unanimous decision by the Federal Trade Commission to end its antitrust case against Google that, while controversial, the end result is “certainly good for consumers.” What’s more, Balto argues that the longstanding investigation into Google – and its outcome announced Thursday – shows the strength of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in its negotiating tactics, which he says ultimately clarified FRAND commitment enforcement by regulators. The result is, according to Balto, “a great first step to eliminate the opacity, posturing and gamesmanship present in high-tech patent litigation.”

In a statement posted by Microsoft Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Dave Heiner, the Google rival voiced its concern and dismay over the recent 5-0 decision by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to end its antitrust case against Google, which lasted about a year and a half. In the public statement, posted the same day as the settlement announcement, Heiner said the “FTC’s overall resolution of this matter is weak and – frankly – unusual,” arguing that the settlement is insufficient in addressing the concerns over Google’s business practices. Posted on Microsoft’s blog, the 1,400-word post voices concerns over what Heiner considers contradictory business practices when it comes to allowing Google’s advertisers to access their own data from advertising campaigns. Microsoft also made a pledge in the statement to make their standard essential patents available to other corporations under reasonable terms, which Heiner notes as a practice Google did not adhere to.  Heiner lastly noted that while the investigation is over in the US., the “good news” is that there are ongoing investigations overseas, most notably by the European Commission.

Pop quiz: What do antitrust cases involving the leading PC operating system, a national association’s rules about real estate listings, and a joint venture between a cable company and a movie studio have in common?
Hint: Not the statute involved. One was Sherman, one was Sherman and one was Clayton.
Answer: They were all about competition to be the “next big thing.”
Quite a lot has been written on the importance of innovation to the U.S. economy, and how, if at all, antitrust enforcement can promote or protect innovation. The aim of this short article is slightly different. Enforcement actions are where the rubber meets the road, so in some sense they tell us more than speeches and policy documents.
In this article I look at how the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) approached innovation in the National Association of Realtors and Comcast/NBC Universal cases. While it is difficult to draw conclusions from only a couple of data points, I outline the ways in which DOJ seems to have developed an internally consistent approach toward exclusionary conduct in the digital world. I do not see the same kind of consistency over at the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Google is the great unknown as I write this. But based on the FTC’s decision to close its investigation of the Universal/EMI merger, I am not overly optimistic about the prospects of a Google case. One conclusion that may be drawn is that DOJ benefitted institutionally from fully litigating the Microsoft case, while the FTC has paid a price for not fully testing an innovation theory in court. As it stands now, there seems to be something of a “digital divide” between the DOJ and FTC.

LG Electronics has announced it will fight the fine issued by the European Commission of $653 million, served after LG was found guilty of price-fixing and cartel conspiracy in its pricing of cathode ray rube monitors. The European Commission announced earlier this week it has issued nearly $2B in fines to seven companies who conspired in the price-fixing of CRTs. LG’s fine was particularly high due to the Commission’s decision to not only hold LG accountable for its anticompetitive actions, but to also hold the company accountable for its joint venture, now defunct, with Royal Philips Electronics, called LG Philips Display. LG is claiming, however, that the joint venture ran independently from LG’s managerial side.

Experts are saying that while the recent trend of internet content providers partnering with mobile operators to bundle data connection with online services may ignite antitrust complaints, the practice is not an antitrust issue as long as the agreement does not shut out other companies from doing the same. The topic of discussion arose in the context of Google launching Free Zone in the Philippines in November through a partnership with Globe Telecom. Through the partnership, Globe Telecom subscribers can also have access to Google services for free. The deal was also expanded in South Africa. An expert cited in the story did point out, however, that this issue may fall into the category of antitrust if a partnership were to form if competition is hampered in either sector, or if a dominant company in one sector enters into a partnership with intentions of entering another sector of the market.

1087,"November 29, 2012",U.S. Dispute over sale of Twitterâ€™s massive information flow leads to far-reaching antitrust concerns,"
Reports say that social analytics company PeopleBrowsr has won a temporary restraining order against Twitter to uphold a deal between the two companies for Twitter to sell its stream of personal information to PeopleBrowsr, an agreement that Twitter had been looking to end by November 30. Twitter has an agreement with several companies to sell them a “fire hose” of the personal data and information that gets uploaded onto the social networking site daily by its more than 500 million active users. The companies use the information bought from Twitter to find meaningful insights into what Twitter users are saying, and then sell that aggregation of information to another source. The conflict comes at a time when Twitter has decided to be more selective when choosing which social analytics companies can buy and have access to the flow of information. Twitter apparently has limited the number of companies who can buy the fire hose of information to 20, while other companies who would like the information can access part of it as a third party through two companies approved to re-sell the information, Gnip and Datasift.
PeopleBrowsr, however, is arguing that the move is anticompetitive on Twitter’s part, as PeopleBrowsr will no longer gain full access to the stream of information if it has to go through Datasift or Gnip to get it. In a claim filed in the superior court of California, PeopleBrowsr is also arguing that it will no longer be able to deliver on its existing contracts with the Department of Defense, among other entities, if it can no longer gain full access to Twitter’s information. Some experts are saying that this case is part of a larger picture involving concerns that Twitter dominates the market when it comes to the aggregation and selling of personal information of its users. The case also comes at a time when Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Competition Policy Joaquin Almunia recently remarked that the transference of personal information gained through social networking sites may be the latest issue to face antitrust authorities around the globe.

Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Competition Policy Joaquin Almunia has suggested that a new antitrust issue may arise concerning the use of personal data by online companies. Almunia said in a speech Monday that while the issue has never been brought to the European Commission before, companies may find themselves in violation of antitrust law if they prevent customers from moving their personal data to rival companies and websites online. Almunia said that the right to transport personal data online “goes to the heart of competition policy,” and while he did not name any specific companies in his speech, experts suspect that Google, Facebook and other social networking sites – where the uploading of personal information is key in participation of the site – may be most likely to face the predicament in the future.

1091,"November 8, 2012",What Does The Chicago School Teach About Internet Search and the Antitrust,"
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Robert H. Bork & J. Gregory Sidak (Criterion Economics) have a new paper on What Does The Chicago School Teach About Internet Search and the Antitrust
ABSTRACT: Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began investigating Google’s search practices in 2010. Google’s critics have consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized search results in general search pages and limiting access to search inputs, including “scale,” Google content, and the Android platform. Those claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate competitors’ efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality, or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teaches—and the Supreme Court has long affirmed—that antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Google’s practices as anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended to protect.

1095,"October 18, 2012","Antitrust for High-Tech and Low: Regulation, Innovation, and Risk","
Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Ron Cass, Center for the Rule of Law, Cass & Associates, PC, Boston University School of Law explores Antitrust for High-Tech and Low: Regulation, Innovation, and Risk.
ABSTRACT: Severe limitations on antitrust enforcement officials’ knowledge and the potential impact of ill-advised investigations and prosecutions on markets suggest that officials should exercise extraordinary caution in enforcement of restraints on single-firm conduct. Although it is common to depict antitrust enforcement as protecting market competition while other forms of regulation are seen as intrusions (justifiable or not) into market operation, antitrust enforcement has characteristics and risks similar to other forms of regulation. Indeed, government antitrust enforcement can be especially problematic, as it requires discretionary selection among an extraordinary range of possible targets, imposes significant burdens on companies that are under investigation or subject to suit, invites efforts by individual firms to motivate officials to deploy resources against rivals, and can seriously disrupt competition among firms. Antitrust authorities need to exercise special care in making enforcement decisions respecting conduct of individual dominant firms in high-technology industries, where antitrust enforcers’ abilities to understand and predict industry evolution are most limited and where enforcement actions are most likely to rest on debatable predicates about the effects of specific conduct.
Critically, market boundaries that so often are taken for granted as setting the proper framework for evaluating effects of a leading firm’s conduct frequently fail to capture the most important sources of competition for the firm, which in many industries (including many high-technology industries with strong network effects) are dynamic and involve potential replacement of the technology that is associated with the government’s market definition. This has led to ill-advised enforcement initiatives which have dramatically burdened the target companies (even at the formal investigation stage) and has prejudiced market development without compensating benefits to consumers. Further, while network effects can establish or sustain dominance within a narrowly defined market, network effects also can have just the opposite effect: they can be the reason that a firm’s dominance comes to an end, as the success of a dominant firm is a spur to investment in competing technologies, including technologies that can replace the currently successful product or service.
At a time when companies publicly identified as potential antitrust enforcement targets include a very large number of leading high-technology firms (among them, Facebook, Apple, Google, IBM, AT&T, Microsoft, and Intel), it is important to look critically at prior enforcement efforts predicated on similar theories. This article examines government enforcement decisions respecting four prior targets and draws lessons for enforcement going forward

According to the New York Times, Apple’s use of Apple Maps, a decision substituting its own mapping software for rival Google’s in the iPhone 5 and the new iOS 6 operating system, appears to be a textbook case of what’s known as a tying arrangement, sometimes referred to as “bundling.” In bundling, the purchase of one good or service (the iPhone) is conditioned on the purchase or use of a second (Apple maps). Such arrangements extend the control of a dominant producer, thus violating antitrust laws. The best example of which is Microsoft’s attempt to bundle its Internet Explorer browser on Windows software, to the disadvantage of Netscape.

1097,"October 1, 2012","Competition, Standards, and Patents","
Per Hellstrom, Thomas Kramler, Oct 01, 2012
The interface of competition, standards, and patents has received increased attention over the past few years, in particular in the information, communication, and technologies sector. With regard to the mobile devices sector, some even refer to an on-going “patent war” in reference to the extensive global patent litigation between technology and software companies such as Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, and others.
Antitrust authorities have recently signaled increased vigilance about the strategic use of patents. When clearing the Google/Motorola merger in February 2012, Vice-President Almunia stated, “the Commission will continue to keep a close eye on the behaviour of all market players in the sector, particularly the increasingly strategic use of patents.”
In January 2012 the European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation against Samsung Electronics to assess whether it may have abusively used certain of its essential patent rights to distort competition in the field of mobile devices in Europe. In April 2012, the Commission opened two further formal proceedings against Motorola Mobility to assess whether Motorola may have abusively used certain of its standard essential patents related to mobile, wireless, and video compression standards to distort competition.These proceedings are on-going.
The purpose of this paper is to briefly outline some of the issues raised by the use of standards and patents from an EU competition law perspective, and discuss what lessons market participants and regulators might draw from ongoing disputes.

1098,"October 1, 2012",Fines for Abuse of Dominance in “High Tech” Markets,"
Benoit Durand, Andreas Reindl, Oct 01, 2012
Blockbuster fines have become a trademark of European Commission abuse of dominance cases. Intel’s EUR 1 billion fine is currently under appeal, and just a few months ago the General Court largely upheld the EUR 800 million fine imposed on Microsoft for its failure to comply with the licensing remedy in the initial Commission decision, which “supplemented” the EUR 450 million fine imposed in 2004.
The practice of wielding the big stick in Article 102 cases involving high-tech firms has had an impact on the narrative about European competition law. Take the numerous reports in the trade press about the Commission’s ongoing Google investigation; they have little to report on substance, but almost invariably emphasize that the tough antitrust enforcers in Brussels could impose a EUR 4 billion fine if they found Google guilty of a violation. That is not small change, even for the Googles of the world. For a firm with a little less cash at hand than Google, the threat of being subject to an investigation by a competition authority with little understanding of high-tech markets and equally little hesitation to consider novel and perhaps experimental conduct to be a “very serious” infringement on par with price-fixing, and thereby impose enormous fines, might be enough reason to change its business conduct when an unhappy rival makes noises about filing a complaint.
This is a worrisome development. The current fining practices in single-firm conduct cases rest on shaky grounds and are potentially harmful. We begin with a brief discussion of core economic concepts that should inform the imposition of corporate fines, in particular in single-firm conduct cases. We then use the Commission’s Intel and Microsoft decisions to illustrate the risks associated with the current ill-designed fining practice, in particular in cases involving high-tech sectors: (i) enforcers may find it impossible to determine whether conduct was, in fact, inefficient and harmful; (ii) the risk of deterring beneficial conduct is particularly high; and (iii) market participants will typically find it impossible to understand what type of future conduct a fine is supposed to deter, given the rapidly changing market conditions and unclear substantive analytical standards. We conclude by identifying conditions that must be met if a competition authority considers imposing sanctions in single-firm conduct cases. We are not arguing here that corporate fines should never be imposed in cases involving high-tech industries, but we doubt that blockbuster fines are a suitable enforcement tool in most single-firm conduct cases.

The Google investigation inspired several blogs this month. We present different takes on whether Google should even be investigated, followed by a panel discussion with Christine Varney asking if the government is stifling innovation, and then look at a preliminary eulogy for her term. Going abroad, we consider fall-out from the News Corp. problems, evaluate the EU & industrial policy, and take a hard look at Brazil. Thom Lambert debates Einer Elhauge on bundling, and Josh Wright brings the issue full circle discussing antitrust remedies for search engine domination. We finish in a summertime zen mood contemplating Supreme Court decisions rewritten in haiku.

1100,"September 24, 2012","Search, Essential Facilities, and the Antitrust Duty to Deal","
Marina Lao (Seton Hall) explores Search, Essential Facilities, and the Antitrust Duty to Deal.
“ABSTRACT: The core of the gathering antitrust case against Google seems to be that it favors its own or its affiliates’ content over that of its competitors in ancillary markets in the unpaid search results. Seeking the competitive advantages inherent in integration, which is what preferential treatment of one’s own property is about, is usually not unlawful. This paper examines whether “essential facilities” and the duty-to-deal nonetheless provide a basis for prohibiting this practice, as some have suggested, and concludes that they do not.
On the threshold monopoly power issue, most assume, based on Google’s high percentage of general search queries, that Google has monopoly power. This paper analyzes why this assumption, though intuitively appealing, is incorrect. It also considers other problems with invoking either principle in the display of search results. For essential facilities, for example, important issues regarding which is the alleged essential facility, whether there is denial of access, and whether the facility is capable of being shared have been largely overlooked. For the duty-to-deal, it is difficult to see how the principle, rarely applicable, can be made to apply.
This paper also questions a fundamental assumption embedded in the discourse — that favoring one’s own property in search results, being good for a search engine, must be anticompetitive. Antitrust law is consumer-centric, and practices that benefit search users, while also benefiting the search engine, would not be anticompetitive even if they incidentally hurt some competing providers.
The paper ends with a discussion of some policy issues and concludes that they generally cut in favor of allowing search engines to incorporate new features and redesign their product, even if that might unfortunately adversely impact some competitors in ancillary markets.”

Lack of competition in Greece’s oil-refining industry is costing consumers here more than $1 billion a year, according to a draft internal report by the International Monetary Fund, in an indication of the deep structural problems that many economists believe are hobbling Greece’s chances of recovering its footing. Despite five years of recession, soaring unemployment and repeated efforts to open up its highly regulated economy, prices in Greece remain stubbornly high—a major obstacle to restoring its lost competitiveness and growth.

1103,"September 16, 2012",The Role of Keyword Advertising in Competition Among Rival Brands,"
David Evans, Elisa Mariscal, Sep 13, 2012
A consumer types the name of a brand into a search engine. In most cases, the search-results page shows two sets of results: “organic search results” and “sponsored links” or “ads.” The results in the middle of the page are the “organic search results” and they contain a set of links related to the brand itself as well as links to similar products that might be relevant to the consumer’s query. The search result page might also show “sponsored links,” which are advertisements that appear on the top and to the right of organic search results. These advertisements often contain links to the brand and to places where consumers can buy the brand. The sponsored links are generated through the keyword-bidding process used by search engines to sell ad space on the search-results page.
If a competitor to the brand, like the brand itself, bids on the brand-name keyword, their ads could also appear as sponsored links. The position of the competitor advertisement on the search-results page, including whether its advertisement is presented at all, depends in part on whether the ad is relevant to a user’s query, which is measured in part by the number of clicks the ad is likely to get, and on how much the advertiser bids on the brand-name keyword. As a result, when a consumer queries “Gucci handbag” in a search engine, she may end up seeing organic results and sponsored links for Kate Spade handbags in addition to Gucci-related links.
Should courts prohibit or limit this sort of keyword advertising against competitors? Similar questions are being posed around the world as a result of complaints by companies that search engines are infringing on the trademarks of brand holders and confusing consumers. For example, the Australian Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (“ACCC”) brought a case against Google in connection with the sponsored links it sells to advertisers. The case arose in part because some advertisers had bid on their competitors’ names as keywords and their competitor names appeared in the heading of the advertisers’ sponsored link. The ACCC alleged that Google was responsible for the content of these advertisements and that they were likely to mislead consumers in violation of Australian consumer protection law.
This article argues that courts and regulators should be careful about limiting advertising by competitors in this situation. There is extensive empirical evidence that consumers are harmed, as a result of higher prices and poorer products, from restrictions on the ability of firms to show consumers informative and comparative advertisements. Over the last two decades, competition authorities, courts, and legislatures have looked skeptically at efforts by firms to limit advertising by their competitors. At the same time, there is a strong presumption that consumers benefit when they obtain information on competing products in response to a query about a particular brand. Such comparative information is what consumers are often looking for and what search engines have strong financial incentives to provide.
In addition, harm from advertising restrictions is not limited to consumers. Businesses have a keen interest in identifying who their competitors are selling to and trying to persuade those customers to switch. That is the essence of competition. Using brand names as part of keyword advertising makes it easier for firms to find consumers who would be interested in learning about their product. It thereby increases the intensity of competition for customers.
Companies can abuse keyword advertising just like any other form of advertising, but there are well-developed legal and enforcement policies to deal with companies that try to mislead and deceive consumers. Regulators need to strike a proper balance between, on the one hand, encouraging competition for consumers, including allowing messages that allow consumers to compare one product with another and, on the other hand, protecting consumers from misleading and deceptive ads while protecting brands from dilution of their trademarks. In striking that balance, courts and regulators should recognize the very important contribution that informative comparative advertising makes to competition.

1104,"July 10, 2012","SGAE (Spain’s ASCAP) fined â‚¬1,766,744 for abuse of dominance","
Spain’s Comisión Nacional de la Competencia (CNC) has fined the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE) €1,766,744 for abuse of dominance in the market for IP rights management. SGAE is the main collecting society for songwriters, composers and music publishers in Spain.
Three restaurants had filed a complaint with the CNC in early 2010, alleging that SGAE was engaging in abusive practices with regard to the fees it was charging for the rights to play music in their banquet venues. The CNC’s subsequent investigation found that SGAE had abused its dominant position by applying “discriminatory and non-transparent” discounts and an “unfair and discriminatory” substitute fee for authorizations for the public broadcast of musical works at wedding, baptism, and communion dances. The CNC explains that although antitrust laws “do not prevent dominant operators from applying different treatment to their customers or suppliers,” it must be done based on “objective criteria” and transparency, and known to the parties beforehand.

Pharmaceutical companies, notably GlaxoSmithKline in 2008, argued that parallel trade calls for drug manufacturers to practice price discrimination or a system of dual pricing.

1111,"May 2, 2012",Technology Licensing: Evolving Antitrust Standards in the Smartphone and Other Sectors?,"
Paul Lugard, Apr 30, 2012
Antitrust review of business transactions involving intellectual property has never been entirely undisputed. On the one hand, there is a general belief that antitrust intervention in R&D-, intellectual property-, and innovation-intense industries should be centered on the preservation of innovation incentives. On the other hand, day-to-day practice demonstrates that even in sectors where the intellectual property landscape is relatively easily accessible, but where innovation is nonetheless important, the proper application of antitrust law is highly fact-specific and complex.
For instance, intuition tells us that grant-back clauses in technology licensing agreements may decrease licensees’ incentives to innovate unless they are properly compensated for their innovative efforts. But it also obvious that appropriate compensation schemes for future innovations may be impossible to set up, and that some licensors may not be willing to license their technology, without grant-back clauses, as a result of which the positive welfare effects associated with technology licensing may not materialize to start with. How does one distinguish the good and the bad cases?
And, to add a particularly topical example, how should one ensure that-given evidence of the ability and incentive to foreclose rivals-the acquisition of a portfolio of hundreds of Standard Essential Patents (“SEPs”) relevant to wireless devices by Apple, Microsoft, or Google will not result in post-merger exclusionary conduct as a result of those companies repudiating prior fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) commitments, or a failure to adhere to those commitments in a meaningful manner as the prior owners would have done?
Faced with fast-moving, innovative industries, antitrust enforcement agencies are up against difficult tasks. Indeed, they need to have a well-informed opinion on the nature and drivers of innovation and the durability of market power, as well as the potential of the industry at hand to correct itself, especially in light of dominance. In these settings, over-enforcement resulting in the loss of valuable dynamic efficiencies is often a real risk, while devising and implementing adequate remedies is difficult and takes time. This certainly applies to the one sector that takes a prominent place in this issue of the CPI Antitrust Chronicle, the sector of mobile devices.
This issue comes at a critical time. Only a few weeks ago, on February 13, 2012, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued its closing statement following its investigations into three cases: Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a manufacturer of smartphones and computer tables and the holder of a portfolio of approximately 17,000 issued patents and 6,800 applications; the acquisition by Rockstar Bidco (a partnership including, among others, Apple, Microsoft, and Research in Motion (“RIM”)) of approximately 6,000 Nortel patents; and the acquisition by Apple of a portfolio of Novell patents. Each of these three acquisitions involved a large number of SEPs relevant to wireless devices, many of which the pre-existing owners had committed to license through their participation in Standard Setting Organizations (“SSOs”) on FRAND terms.

The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing’s subsidies from the U.S. constitutes illegal government subsidies. Boeing had received $5.3 billion in illegal cash grants from 1989 to 2006. Airbus, Boeing’s rival, had charged that illegal aid amounted to more than $19 billion.
In May 2011, a WTO panel found that Airbus had received $18 billion in subsidies from European governments, although not all the aid was illegal.

Opinions in Europe were flying fast and furious this month, and we have five—including Joaquín Almunia on patents. Also in our lineup are two competition regulators from the Reagan Era who ask whether we’re being boldly led to where we shouldn’t go, Josh Wright & Charles Rule who debate Google, a reminder that antitrust is not just about products, and hard looks at Chile, whistle-blowing practices, and market relevance. And our friends at Chillin’ Competition have compiled their own antitrust solute to the Oscars—enjoy.

It’s a presidential election year so we’re starting with a political salvo on large corporations, antitrust, and innovation. The next political entry comes from an unusual source—the Law Librarian’s Blog. Several commentators then take on the regulators. We continue with insights on issues that will be sure to occupy antitrust attention in 2012—Google’s supposed desire to monopolize the web world, ditto Apple with eBooks, and the muddled question of class certification.

After dealing  with the collapse of the AT&T merger, we move on to two behavioral  discussions and then take a global trip, visiting France, Canada,  Israel, and South Africa. The amount of recent FTC activity is evident  by the next three articles, dealing with FTC actions on Google, ACOs,  and Section 5 usage.

1123,"November 18, 2011",Competition Law and the Regulation of Technology Markets,"
Just in the time for the holidays, we thought our readers might be interested in this book review:
Competition Law and the Regulation of Technology Markets, Kevin Coates, 448 pages, April 2011, 978-0-19-957521-3, Hardback
Review written by Timothy R.W. Cowen, Partner, Sidley Austin LLP
It is clear that this book is both up to date and has been deeply thought through. This is without doubt the work of someone who has spent many years dealing with cases and the issues that they raise at the cutting edge of the law and policy in the sector. It is welcome as a work of rare insight and expertise.  It is also a clear book addressing a number of complex subjects in the one place. The title poses the conundrum: ‘Competition law and the Regulation of Technology Markets’.  This is a conundrum because it could be argued that the book is concerned with technology law. Whether there is such a things as technology law or law that applies to technology markets is a question posed at the outset and one to which this review will return to below.
It starts by outlining the areas of law that are the most relevant for the technology sector and takes a ‘joining-the-dots’ perspective: cutting across economic policy and the theory that underlies competition law, competition law and its application to the technology cases, both in the US and the EU, and cutting across intellectual property rights and in particular the interface between intellectual property and competition law. This provides a strategic or ‘horizontal’ perspective starting with the law as it applies to the sector and illustrating the law with relevant cases. It then deals with a set of ‘vertical’ industry specific issues that arise and which are specific to the technology sector such as in the areas of standards, and interoperability and later on dealing with issues such as price squeeze and net neutrality. In the part of the book looking at access and interoperability it provides a useful outline of the controversies that have taken place in what has often been a heated debate behind the scenes.  Issues are addressed with interesting illustrations from US and EU cases, as is product design. Again, this is an industry specific area often overlooked by competition lawyers, data protection or  technology lawyers, but an area where the law is increasingly likely to focus in the future. Compliance by design may well be an area for future development  given the difficulty of tracking monitoring and enforcing the law in technology markets.
One wonderful aspect of this work is that it is so up to date. The most recent cases are referred to and placed in the context of current investigations. In particular the US and EU investigations of Microsoft, Intel and most recently of Google, are addressed in detail.
Antitrust investigations into the technology sector are some of the most high profile investigations of all, and provoke widespread argument and controversy.  Businesses seek to claim that the sector is so dynamic that it should be left alone and so competitive that the market resolve any issue. While it is recognized that it is a real challenge for the competition authorities to take on the task of ‘Trying to shoe a galloping horse’, it is a task that they have been given and one that has to be discharged. How and why they have done so in recent years is thoroughly explained in a coherent and thoughtful way.
As indicated at the outset of this review, one issue for every lawyer approaching this area, (and which is pointed out in the introduction) is whether there is any such thing as technology law; Judge Easterbrook’s famous comment that there is no law of  the internet, or for that matter any such thing as the law of ‘technology markets’, but only law that applies to technology markets  is a profound observation. As discussed throughout the book there is no more a law of the internet than there is a ‘law of the horse’. This book deals with the law as it applies to the technology markets, then looks at the issues raise, from, if you like, the perspective of the horse. Looking at the law from the point of view of the horse is very helpful in understanding the issues and vital for any business seeking to understand the law that applies to them and then to comply with the law. This is a current issue for businesses that have not sufficiently designed their businesses or taken the law into account,  and one that overly tidy minded lawyers ignore at their peril. Lawyers in particular are susceptible to the delusion that narrow definitions provide comforting specializations and that that is enough. In technology markets in particular, being an expert in one aspect of the law is insufficient to help businesses or competition authorities or the courts to resolve the issues that they have to deal with.  There are many areas that need to be mastered before an intelligent outcome can be either presented, proposed or decided.
Of course, it is also recognized that the law that applies to horses is one that requires those involved, be they the horse and the lawyer, to understand both the law and the horse.   This book is admirable in seeking to tackle so much , and is extraordinary in doing it so well and so succinctly.

1124,"November 16, 2011","Resources – Potash, the FTAIA, and Pleading Requirements","
Nov 16, 2011
Resources For NOV-11(1),  The “Potash” Case  Issue:
For our reader’s convenience, when appropriate in the Antitrust Chronicle, we’ll be presenting copies and/or links of the cases and other source materials referred to in our issues. We hope you find this resource both helpful and time-saving.
Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act (“FTAIA”)
The relevant part of 15 U.S.C. 6a reads as follows:
§ 6A. CONDUCT INVOLVING TRADE OR COMMERCE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS
Sections 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless-
(1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect-
i.     on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations; or
ii.     on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States; and
(2)  such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section.
If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then sections 1 to 7 of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States.
 

Minn-Chem Inc. v. Agrium Inc. 657 F.3d 650 (7th Cir. 2011) (“Potash”)
Summary:
This multi-district antitrust class action alleges a global conspiracy to raise the price of potash, a mineral used primarily in agricultural fertilizer. Most of the world’s potash reserves are concentrated in three countries-Canada, Russia, and Belarus-and the defendants are leading producers whose mining operations are located in those countries. The plaintiffs are direct and indirect potash purchasers in the United States. They allege that the Canadian, Russian, and Belarusian producers operated a cartel through which they fixed potash prices in Brazil, China, and India, and the inflated prices in these overseas markets in turn influenced the price of potash sold in the United States. The defendants moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing first that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act (“FTAIA”), 15 U.S.C. § 6a, and alternatively, that the complaint did not satisfy the pleading requirements of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009). The district court denied the motion but certified its order for immediate review. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). We accepted review and now reverse.
As relevant here, the FTAIA limits the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Antitrust Act to foreign anticompetitive conduct that either involves U.S. import commerce or has a “direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect” on U.S. import or domestic commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 6a. In United Phosphorus, Ltd. v. Angus Chemical Co., 322 F.3d 942 (7th Cir. 2003), we sat en banc to address whether the FTAIA’s limitations are jurisdictional or instead are elements of a Sherman Act claim that implicates offshore anticompetitive conduct. We held that the FTAIA’s requirements are jurisdictional. Id. at 950-52. A substantial minority of the court disagreed, see id. at 953-54 (Wood, J., dissenting), and the dissent’s approach has since prevailed in the Supreme Court, although in decisions involving other statutes. See Morrison v. Nat’l Austl. Bank, 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2876-77 (2010); Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 515-16 (2006). These intervening developments suggest that United Phosphorus may be ripe for reconsideration, but we need not undertake that task here. Whether it blocks jurisdiction or establishes an element of a Sherman Act claim, the FTAIA applies here to bar this antitrust suit. The defendants are entitled to dismissal under either Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6).

When we started in 2005, while we could have dispensed with a print edition and published entirely online, we didn’t think either our authors or readers were ready. Authors liked the prestige of print and many readers liked thumbing through a print journal. The spread of iPads together with drastic improvements in the technology for producing online periodicals convinced us late last year to embrace online media fully and to shed the constraints of a print edition.  As you get used to the benefits of consuming insights on competition policy in this new format we hope you’ll agree that it was the right decision.

Among the benefits of our new format, CPI can now include video and audio material in addition to traditional print. We make use of this capability to kick off this issue. Two of the most influential competition officials in the world were gracious enough to talk with me shortly before releasing this issue. In my interviews with Joaquin Almunia, the Commissioner in charge of competition policy for the European Union, and Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, we discussed their priorities, philosophies, and even touched on personal interests.
Fitting with this adventure into new media the substantive focus of much of this issue concerns digital media and communications. We begin with a symposium including contributions that highlight the interplay among these new te...

Oliver Bethell, Matthew Bye, May 17, 2011

This article considers the role of competition law and policy in shaping the news industry’s digital transition. It begins by examining the shifting landscape for traditional media companies and describing Google’s approach to news. The article then addresses arguments that exemptions from the antitrust laws are necessary to facilitate a digital transition by traditional news providers and concludes by considering some of the emerging business models that have been the subject of recent Department of Justice Business Review Letters.

1132,"March 31, 2011",The Pro-competitive Value of Closed Platforms & Walled Gardens: Some Thoughts In Response to Tim Wu,"
Amanda Reeves, Daniel Wall, Mar 30, 2011

There has been a great deal of recent discussion, both inside and outside of antitrust circles, on the merits of “open” as opposed to “closed” business structures. Much of this discussion focuses on key technology markets, in which competition among products and systems that exhibit relative degrees of “openness” is commonplace and longstanding. An increasingly vocal group of openness advocates has begun to suggest that openness is an antitrust issue in its own right, and that antitrust regulators should adopt “openness” as a kind of social norm for the interaction of players in technology markets.
 
Timothy Wu’s arrival at the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) presents a good opportunity to discuss these issues, as he has been an outspoken critic of closed systems and what he perceives to be the failure of antitrust institutions to adequately police “information monopolists.” In his recent book The Master Switch, Wu argues that antitrust law has failed to protect consumers’ interests when it comes to regulating competition in the computing and internet spheres. Underlying his critique is his explicit and forcefully stated preference for open business models (his favorite example being Google) and his deep suspicion for closed systems (his favorite current example being Apple). Wu also argues that antitrust regulators should give greater weight to effects such as whether a particular merger or practice is likely to broaden public access to information. Wu believes that antitrust law has historically failed to facilitate the optimal information output and contends that it is time to consider whether antitrust law can do more to achieve these ends. He proposes a bold “Separations Principle,” which would “mean that those who develop information, those who own the network infrastructure on which it travels, and those who control the tools or venues of access must be kept apart from one another.”
 
In this Article, we address the antitrust treatment of open and closed systems, using Wu’s proposals as a convenient (if hardly singular) reference point for the argument in favor of regulating towards openness. Our message is simple: antitrust law has dealt with the genuine competitive issues posed by closed systems adequately without any presumption or bias in favor of open systems. Antitrust’s existing doctrinal mechanisms do a sufficient job not only of capturing anticompetitive conduct but also of promoting the innovation that follows from vigorous competition, which-particularly in technology markets-often takes the form of rivalry among closed systems. We fear that the inclination exemplified by Wu to inject antitrust’s well-settled frameworks with subjective notions of what is “good” or “bad” would undermine pro-competitive behavior that in some sense is “closed,” leading to more standardization and less differentiation. This is a price that antitrust regulators should not be willing to pay.

1137,"July 27, 2010",Sponsored Search Auctions: Simple Economics and Implications for Antitrust Policy,"
Renato Gomes, Jul 27, 2010

The most valuable asset of many two-sided platforms is their user base. In a celebrated example, Internet search engines (such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing) derive most of their revenue from selling the eyeballs of millions of searchers to advertisers. For each query entered by searchers, search engines return a list of sponsored links displayed to the right of the algorithmic (also called organic) search results. The knowledge of what searchers are looking for enables search engines to create very precise matches between searchers and advertisers.
The ability to target consumers has great value to advertisers. The average price of a click on a sponsored link from Google in 2006 was $2.00 and, for certain keywords, a click may cost more than $100. On aggregate, keyword advertising has impressive figures: in 2007, the U.S. search traffic totaled more than eighty billion queries, of which 40 percent have commercial potential. The total revenue generated by keyword advertising alone amounted to more than 20 billion dollars in 2007.
Recently, the three major search engines announced plans to collaborate in search technology and advertising. In June 2008, Google and Yahoo! issued a proposal according to which Google would deliver ads next to Yahoo’s search results. In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal to share search technology and to join forces in search-generated advertising. The Department of Justice raised concerns about the anticompetitive effects of such partnerships, which were ultimately aborted. Still, the prospect of future mergers brings many new questions to the antitrust debate in online advertising. Would a merger between the leading search engines be beneficial to searchers or advertisers? How would market conditions affect the pricing and the selection of sponsored search ads?
Search engines have traditionally employed auctions to sell sponsored links to advertisers. The use of auctions in two-sided markets is a novel phenomenon, and its antitrust implications have no parallel in one-sided settings. In this short note, I review the simple economics of sponsored search auctions, and describe its main insights for antitrust policy. Surprisingly, concentrated markets can be welfare-improving when search engines are not able to subsidize (or charge) searchers for their clicking behavior.

I’m going to introduce you to the business ecosystem that has emerged in the last 15 years since the commercial internet began.  It is keeping competition authorities and communication regulators very busy.
Just last week the French Authority found that Google was dominant in search advertising and imposed interim measures.
Regulators will be getting busier because new firms are raising lots of complicated issues involving antitrust, consumer protection, and regulation: not only for themselves, but also for the traditional firms that these new ones are challenging, and for the industries that these new firms are disrupting.
Most of the firms that we’re going to talk about today are media firms that provide content to attract viewers and that sell access to these viewers to advertisers.  And we also will be talking about the communication firms that provide the internet connections that make all this possible.
But you’ll see that these categories-the 20th century labels of media and communications-don’t really do justice to the new forms of businesses that are emerging and that have become the subject of considerable controversy.
Let me introduce the ecosystem by describing three of the most significant firms today, and dazzling you with some numbers that tell us a lot about this new world.
400 million
That’s the number of active users of Facebook around the world.
On any given day, half of them log on.
500 billion
That’s the number of minutes they spend on Facebook over the course of a month.
The number of Facebook users more than doubled last year. It continues to grow like a mushroom around the world: about 5 percent a month.
So what is Facebook?
I’m going to revert to the language of the 20th century.
Facebook is a media company, plain and simple.                
It makes money by getting people to view pages just like a newspaper does. And then it sells advertisers the ability to presents ads to those people.
It is also a communications company. Just as plain and simple.
The average user on Facebook has 130 friends.  People use Facebook to interact with their friends.  Those who use social media a lot probably don’t use the phone so much anymore.  Why call a friend to chat about the great time you had last night when you can post a message and picture for all your friends?
Facebook is just one of the giant companies that have emerged in the last few year-and that provide media and communications services, in one fashion or another.
Most people, by the way, describe Facebook as a social networking company.  And that it is. It exploits our connections and the connections to our connections and so on.
Facebook is more than 7 times larger, based on unique visitors, than the next largest social networking company, which is MySpace. 
88 billion
That’s the number of Google searches each month as of the end of 2009.
Google makes most of its money from selling advertising: $23.6 billion worth in 2009.  When you search for something, Google often shows little text ads on top and to the right of the results.
In twentieth-century speak Google is sort of like the yellow pages.  But so much more because, as it says, its mission is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It has been working on digitizing all of the books in the world.  And then of course there are the roving vans that videotape the world-and perhaps more.
Google has more than an 80 percent share of searches and of advertising for searches in most countries outside of Asia.    
Almost half of online advertising spending in the United States goes to Google.  And more of advertising spending in the United States is going online.
Here’s a much smaller number for you.
34 million
That’s how many Apple iPhones that have been sold to date: a trivial fraction of the 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions around the world.
But Apple accounts for 40 percent of operating systems running on smart mobile phones.  Smart phones are basically little computers with browsers that are connected to the internet over a wireless connection. With one of them a person can get everything on the internet.
You might ask why I’m even mentioning Apple. It isn’t really a digital media company or a communications company. But it touches every company that is.  The iPhone provides a platform for digital media companies to reach viewers. Apple is also helping them sell advertising. 
Apple has made the mobile phone operators less relevant and less powerful.  It used to be that people chose a mobile operator and then selected one of the many phones they offered. Increasingly, people decide whether they want an iPhone or an Android and then choose the mobile operator that has the device they want.         
These companies wouldn’t be able to do anything without the internet.  That’s provided by a whole host of communications companies that generally operate in specific geographies.  In the United Kingdom, people get connected through telephone and cable companies such as British Telecom or through wireless providers such as Vodafone.  These firms are subject to traditional public utility regulation in most jurisdictions.
Each of the companies I’ve mentioned supports vast numbers of complementary businesses.
Facebook, Apple, and Google operate software platforms.  They encourage entrepreneurs to develop businesses that are based on applications that run on their platforms.  That was a secret to Microsoft’s success with Windows.  These new firms have ratcheted that business model up a level.
550,000+
That’s the number of active applications that are available for Facebook.  Many of them are trivial. But others like Farmville attract millions of users and make massive amounts of money mainly by selling virtual goods. Yes, you can actually make a small fortune selling a bunch of pixels that look like an artichoke to make-believe farmers.
150,000
That’s the number of applications for the iPhone. Many of these are also silly little things. There’s even an app for atheists. But others are the basis for standalone companies.  In the United States, late last year, the company Square introduced a way for small merchants to accept credit cards by attaching a small plastic device to iPhones that works with an application that installed on the phone. It is intended to be the basis for a significant payment system.
These numbers are growing quickly. In fact Apple, Facebook, and Google are propelling themselves forward through network effects. More users encourage more developers to write more applications.  More applications encourage more people to become users which encourage more applications.
We have gotten used to talking about the online world versus the physical world.  In developed economies, that will soon become like talking about places with electricity and places without electricity.  Many devices are getting connected to the internet and are relying on software in the cloud for services.  When you walk into a bricks and mortar store in the future you will be swiping your card through a device that is connected to the internet with software that resides in the cloud.
That the online world is sucking up the physical world is a very important development for media companies.  That brings me to the wars for the three screens.
There are about a billion desktop computers.  That has been where most internet content has been consumed and where most internet-based communication has taken place in most countries outside of Japan. Lots of battles for the desktop were fought over the last twenty years. We can declare some victors for the time being. Google trounced everyone else in search in the last decade. Microsoft became the standard operating system in the 1980s.
There are more than 4 billion mobile phone subscribers around the world. Many don’t have computers. Over time they will convert to smart phones. That’s where they will consume media and communicate.
Naturally there’s a fierce battle going on here.  Apple is in the lead. But Google developed the Android operating system and has gotten phone manufacturers to introduce phones for it. Already there are more than 50,000 applications for Android and Android phones outsold iPhones in the first quarter of this year. In Western Europe, Google’s Android has a 73 percent share of the operating systems running on smart mobile phones.
There are also more than 4 billion television viewers around the world.  Television accounts for about 35 percent of global advertising revenues.  A lot of effort has gone into bringing information technology to the living room. Billions were squandered in the last decade on services that people didn’t really want.
Google has just announced that it is introducing Google TV later this year. If you want to get a glimmer of the future, watch the two-minute video for Google TV on YouTube. The search giant has partnered with Sony and others to develop television sets to incorporate the same Android operating system that it has used so successfully for mobile phones.
If you look at the digital media and communications around the world today, Apple, Facebook and Google are the most significant firms: the ones who should keep each other, internet rivals, and traditional firms awake at night.
But this changes all very quickly. If I had given this talk four years I suspect I would have said that the Great War was going to be between Google and Microsoft.  Apple hadn’t launched the iPhone and the Facebook had only 18 million users. Ten years ago, when a district court found that Microsoft was a monopoly and ordered its breakup, it was hard to imagine a world that wasn’t controlled, like a puppet master, by this then young company.
Last week Microsoft pulled its new smart phone, designed for the young and hip, from the market because hardly anyone wanted to buy it.  Microsoft was leapfrogged first by Apple and just recently by Google in mobile phones. And it is nowhere after several failed attempts in television. As the New York Times reported on Monday, many young developers aren’t interested in writing for Microsoft platforms.
Today, Apple, Facebook, and Google look secure.  You could even say they are protected by an application barrier to entry. But if one thing has been demonstrated in the first fifteen years of the internet it is that nothing stays the same for long.  Who would have predicted the rise of Twitter a couple of years ago?  There were more than 75 million users the beginning of this year for this new form of digital media. And who would have forecast that MySpace, which used to own social networking, would now be a distant number two.
But these dynamics don’t mean that competition authorities should be any less vigilant here than in any other important sector of the economy.  At no time in history have we seen the emergence of firms that have become so significant on a global basis so quickly.
As these new giants strut around the world they throw off controversies for regulators like beads of sweat.
And they raise interesting issues. 
In many countries traditional communications and media firms are subject to regulation.  Does the emergence of these new media and communications firms mean that we should extend regulation to them; that we should abandon regulation of traditional firms; or something in between?
We have a lot of experience doing market definition.  But many of these new firms operate in multi-sided markets, which makes deciding on boundaries rather hard. Also, the extent to which the products of these new firms substitute for the products of traditional firms is changing very quickly.  Can standard methods cope under these circumstances and if not what should we do?
There are new issues, too, like privacy and the role of data.  Each day these and other companies take lots of data from us and use it to make lots of money for themselves. Should antitrust regulators consider changes in privacy as possible consumer harm, in evaluating mergers for example?
These are just some of the topics we’ll be touching on today and I suspect for many years to come.

We begin  this month with two posts from the high-tech world, looking at Apple’s  new iPhone launch and playing “what if”  on the 10th anniversary of the  Microsoft Decision. Our blogs go on to analyze a unique market effect  from the BP Spill, ask if the DOJ equates price-fixing with a refusal to  honor health regulations, wonder why the Korean FTC  seems to care more  about Hong Kong consumers than the HK Commission, stout-heartedly deny  that the Irish Competition Authority is full of zombies, and debate  whether antitrust theory properly deals with competition vs. cooperation  in the consumer benefit context. We finish with an introspective  question—Do AT lawyers need a shrink? 













Apple’s new iPhone is recording record  sales, but AT&T is still having trouble providing coverage. Is it  ATT’s or the FCC’s fault?

 Our eight selections from the antitrust blog world this month are from the United States, Canada, EU, and Great Britain. Posts                             include describing how Justice Stevens swung the Supreme Court to adopt the Chicago School’s approach to antitrust (to his                             regret?), concern about the U.K.’s new coalition government’s professed fondness for behavioral economics, some quick repartee                             between DOJ and FTC representatives, and other diverse posts.
