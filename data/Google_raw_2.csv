0,"April 18, 2016",EU: News Corp. files antitrust charges against Google,"
News Corp. is fighting Google at the European Commission over what it calls improper scraping of content for use in search results, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
The owner of the Times of London, the New York Post, the Journal and many other media properties around the world has filed a formal complaint with the Commission, the European Union’s executive body, the report said. The story cited an unnamed source familiar with the allegations.
News Corp. charged that Google takes news from its sites and makes it available within Google search results. If a company wants to keep that scraped content out of Google’s results, it has to give up on having even links to its stories show up in Google searches, News Corp. alleges, according to the report. The complaint said that’s an abuse of Google’s dominance in search.
When the content of articles shows up in search results, readers can consume it there without visiting the creator’s website, sometimes hurting those companies’ businesses, critics say. Web companies such as TripAdvisor and Yelp have attacked the practice.
Content scraping by Google has been the subject of complaints in the past. It was part of a European Commission antitrust investigation begun in 2010 over allegations that Google gave its own search business unfair advantages. The company pledged to stop that practice.

1,"April 17, 2016",EU: EC accelerates Google Android antitrust probe,"
Google could soon find itself facing more antitrust charges in Europe, this time over the way it runs the Android mobile platform.
The company has been under investigation for years now, on several fronts. It has already been hit with charges for allegedly boosting its own comparison-shopping services in its search results.
The European Commission has also been formally investigating Google over a range of Android allegations, namely that it forces smartphone and tablet manufacturers to preinstall a suite of Google services on their Android devices.
It also allegedly bans manufacturers that install Google services from developing alternate versions of Android.
Now, according to lawyers talking to both the Financial Times and Politico, the Commission has been sending out urgent requests for information from the complainants in the investigation.
That suggests competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is about to move to the next stage of the process by issuing formal charges—a so-called statement of objections—perhaps as early as next week.

2,"April 11, 2016",US: Google will have to deal with Mississippi AG investigation,"
An appeals court has ruled that Google will have to deal with an investigation into its business practices by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. The court also noted the search company can still challenge the investigation at a later time.
It’s a reversal of a big win by Google last year when a federal judge halted the Mississippi investigation, which sought information about how Google deals with links related to counterfeit goods, illegal drug sales, copyright violations, and other matters. Google sued to stop the investigation while litigation was underway, saying that Hood’s goal was to “punish” Google while he pursued his goal of a “pre-filtered Internet”—a power denied him by both Congress and the Constitution, Google lawyers argued.
Hood’s investigation had been egged on by lobbyists from the Motion Picture Association of America, and in some cases demand letters that came from Hood’s office were actually written by MPAA lawyers.
Today, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit overturned Google’s win on procedural grounds. In a 23-page opinion, a three-judge panel said that the district court judge had been too quick to grant relief to Google.
“This injunction covers a fuzzily defined range of enforcement actions that do not appear imminent,” the appeals judges held. “We cannot on the present record predict what conduct Hood might one day try to prosecute under Mississippi law.”
Hood’s subpoenas were a “pre-litigation investigative tool” seeking information about a wide array of topics, including copyright infringement, illegal prescription drug sales, human trafficking, false IDs, and credit card theft.

3,"April 6, 2016",US: Senator ask FTC to reopen Google antitrust suit,"
As European regulators dangle the antitrust hammer above Google’s head, the search engine’s rivals are trying feverishly to stir up similar charges in Washington, D.C.
Case in point: At a Senate Judiciary hearing on Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal pushed for the Federal Trade Commission to crack open a new case against Google for preferential treatment of its own content in search results. The senator’s primary witness was Tim Wu, the former FTC adviser (and current New York Attorney General consigliere) who rather publicly reversed his position on the case.
For certain search results, like the weather, Wu claimed it’s kosher for Google to move its own results to the top. For others, namely local search options, he claimed it’s not.
“What’s been proven is that, in certain areas, Google is manipulating its search in an anticompetitive way,” he said at the Senate hearing. “I think Google is, at this point, at a different position than it was then. There’s stronger evidence of consumer harm now than when the FTC closed its investigation.”

4,"March 24, 2016",France: Google receives fine over “right to be forgotten”,"
The French data protection authority said it has fined Google $111,720 for not scrubbing web search results widely enough in response to a European privacy ruling.
The only way for Google to uphold the privacy ruling was by delisting results popping up under name searches and linking them instead to outdated information across all its websites, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes (CNIL) said in a statement on Thursday.
The U.S. Internet giant has been at loggerheads with several European Union data protection authorities since the European Court of Justice ruled in May 2014 that people could ask search engines, such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing, to remove inadequate or irrelevant information – dubbed the “right to be forgotten”.
Google complied, but it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France on the grounds that to do otherwise would have a chilling effect on the free flow of information.
“Contrary to Google‘s statements, applying delisting to all of the extensions does not curtail freedom of expression insofar as it does not entail any deletion of content from the Internet,” the CNIL said.
A spokesman for Google, now a unit of holding company Alphabet Inc, said the company had worked hard to implement the “right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe.”
“But as a matter of principle, we disagree with the CNIL’s assertion that it has the authority to control the content that people can access outside France, and we plan to appeal their ruling,” Al Verney, Google‘s spokesman, said.
The company did try to assuage the regulator’s concerns in February by delisting search results across all its websites – including Google.com – when accessed from the country where the request came from.

5,"March 22, 2016",UK: Streetmap seeks to appeal against High Court ruling in Google case,"
A UK-based online mapping outfit has sought to overturn an earlier High Court ruling which concluded that—while Google is a dominant force—the multinational hadn’t directly harmed competition in Blighty by abusing its position in the search market.
Streetmap.EU Ltd’s commercial director, Kate Sutton, claimed to Ars that Google’s alleged anti-competitive tactics had “devastated” her business in 2007, and she added that the company’s fight against Google wasn’t over yet. The Milton Keynes-based firm, which at its height claimed five million users, and a healthy turnover, is facing hefty legal bills following last month’s ruling.
In February, Justice Roth ruled that the arrival of Google’s OneBox maps service in 2007 was “not reasonably likely appreciably to affect competition in the market for online maps,” and added that the company’s strategy could be “objectively justified.”

6,"March 14, 2016",Russia: Google fails to overturn a ruling that it broke antimonopoly laws,"
The Moscow Arbitration court on Monday rejected an appeal from Google and upheld a ruling that the US firm broke anti-monopoly laws by abusing its dominant position with its Android mobile platform, Russia’s competition watchdog said.
Federal Antimonopoly Service, Russia’s antitrust regulator, ruled last September that Google had broken the law by requiring pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices running on Android, following a complaint by Russia’s Yandex.
Yandex had claimed that Google was increasingly using its control of the Android operating system—the market leader in Russia—to shut out rivals to its other services such as streaming, maps and mail. That same complaint has featured prominently in the European Commission’s on-going investigation into Google, in which some of its competitors have called for the Mountain View, California-based company to be radically broken up.

7,"March 10, 2016",EU: Is the EC preparing to file an antitrust complaint against Google’s Android?,"
According to Bloomberg Business, the European Union may still be seeking to bring an antitrust complaint against Google regarding its Android operating system. Roughly five years ago, Microsoft and a coalition of other businesses banded together to persuade the European Union to look into possible anticompetitive practices Google may be leveraging with its search engine results.
In particular, the EU is reported to be looking into if Google has leveraged its pre-bundling agreement to deter or stop altogether, mobile manufacturers from building and marketing their apps, stores, and versions of the Android operating system. With apps such as Chrome, Google Search, and the Play Store are front and center on a device, Google’s heavy handed pre-bundling may be robbing independent developers of a legitimate chance to compete.
Similar to Apple’s approach of providing first party solutions front and center on its devices, Google can be seen increasingly encroaching on fair and competitive practices despite being the gateway to a million plus apps, by putting its apps ahead of others.
Bloomberg Business also cites an order issued by Russia’s antitrust authorities last year that had Google renegotiate its ambiguous agreement with mobile device manufacturers. After complaints from Russian search engine provider, Yandex sought to address Google’s default options set to drive traffic to its services over that of local competition.

8,"March 8, 2016",EU: Google sides with Facebook amid Data-Dominance investigation,"
Google sided with Facebook Inc. amid a brewing antitrust clash over how the social network giant may have abused its power to leverage customer data.
Fabien Curto Millet, an economist at Google, told a Paris conference that it’s wrong to meld data privacy with antitrust issues. Earlier, the head of France’s competition authority said he preferred a less confrontational approach than his German counterparts had taken on the issue.
“We shouldn’t mix things up” and should instead reinforce specific regulators rather than putting competition officials in charge, Millet said. “The protection of data privacy is part of the good results produced by good competition,” but “it wouldn’t be logical to elevate that to a different status.”
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office said earlier this month that it’s examining whether Facebook abused its possible market dominance by forcing customers to agree to terms allowing the use of their data. The German probe adds to a growing list of antitrust threats to US Internet giants in the EU — from Alphabet Inc.’s Google to Amazon.com Inc. Up to now, Menlo Park, California-based Facebook has mainly tussled with privacy watchdogs in the bloc in a clash over its revamped policy for handling personal photos and data.

The European Union’s top antitrust official doesn’t sound very happy with the information Google has so far given her after she charged the company with violating competition law.
“Google gave us a very substantial answer, and what we need to do is ask them for more data to have a comprehensive picture so they aren’t just giving us data that solely substantiates their position,” competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a New York Times interview.

10,"March 7, 2016",UE: Europa necesita un regulador de telecomunicación único – Google,"
Europa requiere de un regulador de telecomunicaciones único si los proveedores de servicios ‘over-the-top’ esperan florecer a lo ancho del continente. Así lo dijo el gerente de Políticas Públicas de EMEA para Google, Theo Bertram.
Presentando un discurso en un foro de Westminster, Bertram aseguró que la esperada reforma al Marco de Telecomunicaciones Europeas debe tomar en cuenta a los proveedores OTT, como Google. 
“Todo OTT exitoso debe ser global, no pueden ser locales. El reto para los emprendedores y desarrolladores europeos… llega si hacemos más dificil incrementar la escala, impidiendo que compitan a nivel global” dijo.
“No contamos con un regulador único en Europa… es difícil argumentar que las regulaciones hechas país por país serán mejores para la economía.” Las declaraciones siguen al llamado realizado por dos comités de la UE, en los que sugieren que la industria de telecomunicaciones de la UE sea regulada por una sola autoridad. 
Bertram agregó que, a diferencia de las empresas de telecomunicación tradicionales, Google enfrenta un reto regulatorio mayor. 
“Quiero desmentir el mito de que no tenemos regulación. Debemos enfrentar muchas regulaciones distintas”. Incluyendo el cumplimiento con las leyes de Derecho al Olvido y de privacidad de datos. Buscando nombrar el obstáculo regulatorio más grande que enfrenta la empresa, Bertram concluyó diciendo “Se trata menos sobre las reglas en Reino Unido, y más de las reglas Europeas. El marco regulatorio de telecomunicaciones es un verdadero reto.”

11,"March 3, 2016",EU: Google says EU needs a single telco regulator,"
Europe needs a single telco regulator if over-the-top providers are to flourish across the continent, Google’s public policy manager of EMEA, Theo Bertram, has said.
Speaking at a Westminster Forum event Bertram said the long awaited update to European Telecommunications Framework must take into account OTTs, of which Google is one.
“Every successful OTT needs to be global, they can’t be local. The challenge for European start-ups and developers… is if we start making it harder to scale up won’t compete globally,” he said.
“We don’t have one regulator across Europe… and it is harder to argue country-by-country regulations is going to be good for the economy.”
His remarks follow calls by two EU committees last month that that the EU’s telecoms market should be regulated by a single authority.
Bertram said that unlike traditional telcos, Google faces a greater regulatory burden.
“I want to dispel the myth that we are unregulated. We have many regulations that bear down on us.” He named compliance with right to be forgotten and obligations on privacy and data.
Asked to name the biggest regulatory hurdle facing the company he said: “It is much less about UK regulation, and increasingly about European regulations. The telecoms frameworks is a challenge.”

Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly (FAS) still sees an opportunity for signing an amicable agreement with Google regarding the lawsuit of this company demanding to declare the decision of the Russian regulator invalid aid there us, the regulator’s head Igor Artemyev told reporters on Tuesday.
“We proceed from the assumption that such a proposal may be made any time. But in order to make it certain we need one. A company which has different relations with us should say: yes, we agree that we have violated this or that provision in the law on competition,” – he said.
“If they [Google – TASS] at any stage of the legal hearing tell us that they want it we will judge by the situation of course but this is not impossible,” he added.
On September 14, 2015 the Federal Antimonopoly Service ruled that Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. had breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex. According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. The FAS said that Google’s policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court.

13,"February 28, 2016",EU: Yelp takes aim at Google ahead of antitrust meeting,"
Google’s CEO has been lampooned by Yelp’s public policy chief over a seven-year-old missive penned by Sundar Pichai, in which he told competition officials in Europe that browsers should be “powered by user choice.”
Pichai—who reportedly had his first meeting with Brussels’ competition chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday—was Google’s vice president of product management when he wrote a February 2009 blog post, which criticised Microsoft’s then-dominance in Europe’s browser market.
Yelp’s Luther Lowe couldn’t resist sticking a well-timed boot in this week, however, by posting an altered version of Pichai’s gripes, complete with strikethroughs, to emphasise concerns about Google’s alleged abuse of dominance in European search, where the multinational commands more than 90 percent of the market.
“Seven years ago today [February 24, 2009], Sundar Pichai argued for the European Commission to usher in ‘more competition… greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere’,” wrote Lowe, who posted the mischievous modified missive in Google Docs. “On the eve of Mr Pichai’s meeting with Commissioner Vestager, I draw inspiration from Mr Pichai, and write to echo his important and prescient message.”
The competition wing of the European Commission has been formally probing Google’s search business practices since late 2010. Yelp is among a list of 19 complainants in that case. In April last year, Vestager issued a Statement of Objections against the company, alleging that Google had systematically favoured its own comparison shopping product in its general search results pages, above those of its rivals in that market.

14,"February 24, 2016",France: Google CEO tells Paris it will secure a future for ‘news without fear’,"
Google CEO Sundar Pichai used a keynote speech in Paris to announce two major new media programmes, just hours before the French government announced it will seek €1.6 billion in back tax payments from the search giant.
In his keynote at Sciences Po university in Paris, Pichai said Google will finally rollout its fast-loading ‘Accelerated Mobile Pages’, or AMP project, and give preference to those stories at the top of search results.
First announced last fall, AMP will offer “a search carousel surfacing more news content, that loads four times faster and uses 10 times less data”, Pichai announced in his first European keynote, where he received a rockstar reception.
“The same code works across multiple platforms and devices, different formats and sites using paywalls,” Pichai explained. “It will help publishers crack the best content and cultivate modern readers,” he added on the feature, widely seen as a competitor to Facebook’s own Instant Articles, and Apple’s iOS app Apple News.
Pichai also said that Google’s Digital News Initiative (DNI) would invest €27 million into news organisations in 23 European countries, ranging “from automated content journalism, robot journalism, hoax-busting ads to real-time reporting”. The company has already received “a huge number of applications” to these grants, Pichai said, adding that the next round would open before the summer 2016.

Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai will meet Europe’s antitrust chief next Thursday for the first time since his appointment last August, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has accused the world’s most popular Internet search engine of favouring its shopping service over rivals’ when delivering search results, is considering whether to penalise Google.
Possible sanctions could include ordering Google to change its business practices, as well as a fine of up to 10 percent of its global turnover.
The case has dragged on for more than five years since the EU competition enforcer launched an investigation in November 2010, followed by three unsuccessful attempts by Google to settle the issue with concessions.
Vestager may also scrutinise Google’s back-tax deal with British tax authorities following a complaint from the Scottish National Party. Google agreed last month it would pay 130 million pounds to settle tax claims covering a 10-year period, but opposition parties have called the amount derisory.
The sources described Pichai’s visit as an introductory meeting. He will also meet EU telecoms chief Gunther Oettinger, a vocal critic of U.S. might in a sector where German media companies have, for example, been lobbying to protect content from online giants.

16,"February 14, 2016",UK: Streetmap loses ‘anticompetitive’ case against Google,"
UK-based digital map provider Streetmap has lost its High Court action accusing Google of abusing its search dominance to promote Google Maps over rivals.
Streetmap, which launched in 1997 as one of the first online mapping services, had claimed Google was engaging in “anticompetitive conduct” contrary to provisions of the Competition Act 1998 and that its launch of Google Maps in 2007 lead to a “dramatic loss of traffic” to Steetmap’s website.
The complaint revolved around the use of the so-called “big map” or “Maps OneBox” at the top of Google’s search results, launched in 2007, which displayed mapping results from Google Maps, not rivals. Streetmap argued that showing maps in search results, along with the launch of Google Maps for Android in 2008, saw Google promoting its own maps more favourably.
Mr Justice Roth ruled Google’s introduction of the new-style Maps OneBox in 2007 was “not reasonably likely appreciably to affect competition in the market for online maps” and that Google’s conduct was “objectively justified”.
A Google spokesperson said: “The court made clear that we’re focused on improving the quality of our search results. This decision promotes innovation.”

France has ruled out striking a deal with Google over back taxes, raising the likelihood of a bigger tax bill for the US company than the payment agreed with the UK.
The £130m settlement struck between Google and the UK government earlier this month “seems more the product of a negotiation than the application of the law,” Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said on Tuesday at a conference in Paris. “The French tax administration does not negotiate the amount of taxes owed. It applies the rules.”
As a result, the amount Google will end up paying France will be “way bigger” than the UK settlement, the French socialist minister said.
Mr Sapin’s uncompromising stance contrasts with the UK government’s desire to draw a line under a six-year tax dispute with what is now the world’s biggest company by enterprise value.

24,"December 20, 2015",EU: Google continues its lobbying efforts,"
Google may have extensively funded election campaigns for US officials as part of a coordinated campaign to defeat an EU antitrust case.
The search giant has increased efforts to fend off a potential $6 billion fine from the European Parliament for monopolistic practices, according to an investigation by the Guardian.
Among other efforts, it has been funding the election campaigns of American politicians who have placed pressure on the EU.
For example, Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the US House judiciary committee which wrote to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) criticising the antitrust case, has received extensive campaign funding from Google.
The committee as a whole received more than $200,000 in campaign funding during the 2014 election cycle.
The investigation also revealed that Google CEO Larry Page met the European Commission chief privately in 2014 and discussed the antitrust case, although he had been warned that this would be inappropriate.
Google has also increased its lobbying spending more generally, employing former EU officials as in-house lobbyists and funding research favourable to its position.
The case first opened in November 2010 when the Commission decided it would investigate Google’s dominance in the European search advertising market, as Google accounts for 90 percent of search in Europe.
Google is accused of manipulating search results to direct consumers to its own products and services rather than acting as a neutral search platform.

25,"December 17, 2015",EU: Google ramps up lobbying as antitrust charges proceed,"
Google is ramping up its lobbying in Brussels as a European Union antitrust investigation advances, The Guardian reports today.
The company’s spending on European lobbying has increased from just €600,000 in 2011 to nearly €4 million ($4.3 million) last year. That’s more than Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter and Uber combined, but less than the search giant’s arch-rival, Microsoft.
The lengthy report also details how Google has arranged 29 meetings with EU officials, more than any other private company. Google cofounder and CEO Larry Page met the then European Commission chief in California in spring 2014, bringing up the antitrust case even though EU officials warned him not to.
In April, Google was formally charged with taking advantage of its dominant position in the EU market by favoring its own shopping search services. The company could be fined more than €6 billion ($6.48 billion) if the accusations are found to have merit. Google has called the charges “wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics.”
In some European countries, Google controls 90 percent of the search market. That’s a significantly higher share than the US market, where Google is also dominant, with roughly two-thirds of the market.
In late 2014, several members of European Parliament received letters from US members of Congress expressing “concern” that the MEPs were considering a resolution that would, among other things, suggest breaking up the search company. That resolution passed in November 2014.
Google declined to comment for the Guardian story about its lobbying. “European politicians have many questions for Google and about the Internet,” the company said in an e-mailed statement to Ars. “We’re working hard to answer those questions, helping policymakers understand our business and the opportunity for European businesses to grow online.”

Google, Google Shopping and Amazon: The Importance of Competing Business Models and Two-Sided Intermediaries in Defining Relevant Markets Sébastien Broos (HEC-ULg) & Jorge Marcos Ramos (University of Liege)
Abstract: We show that the Commission has adopted a flawed definition of the relevant market in the Google Shopping case. Using two-sided intermediaries’ theory, we show that only one market linking the two sides of Google, consumers and advertisers, should be defined. Therefore, competitive constraints should be evaluated on both sides and not only on consumers’ side. Moreover, we show that, because a single market must be defined for Google, competing business models such as those of Amazon also pose significant competitive constraints to Google. In sum, it is not clear that Google enjoys a dominant position if the market is properly defined. We propose that business model competition and two-sided intermediaries’ theory should be included in the market definition toolbox in new technology and dynamic markets.

27,"November 30, 2015",Francia: Google gana caso contra Evermaps,"
Google resultó victoriosa en el caso que se presentó ante la corte de apelaciones de Francia en contra de la empresa de cartografía Bottin Cartographies (rebautizada hace tiempo como Evermaps.) La compañía había demandado a Google en 2009 citando acciones nocivas a la competencia relacionados a la oferta gratuita de Google Maps para negocios. En aquel momento, Evermaps calculó que la política de Google le costaría al menos 800,000 euros en ventas no percibidas entre 2009 y 2010.
La corte de comercio de París había ordenado a Google a pagar 500,000 euros en daños, al juzgar que Google habría intentado eliminar a su competencia, dando prioridad a su propio servicio en los resultados de búsquedas.
En 2013 la corte de apelaciones se dirigió a la Autoridad de Competencia francesa, la cual determinó que el comportamiento de Google no se ajusta a un marco de depredación. La más reciente decisión toma en cuenta esta recomendación de la autoridad.
La corte ha concluido que la desaparición de algunos negocios rivales no puede atribuirse directamente a la estrategia de Google. La corte ordenó a Evermaps pagar 20,000 euros a Google Inc y Google France, por concepto de gastos legales.

28,"November 29, 2015",France: Google wins court decision vs Evermaps,"
Google has won a court case on appeal against French mapping company Bottin Cartographies, since renamed Evermaps, which had sued it in 2009 for anti-competitive behaviour in offering Google Maps free of charge to businesses, reports Les Echos. At the time, the company claimed that Google’s policy would cost it at least EUR 800,000 in lost sales for 2009 and 2010.
The Paris Commercial Court had ordered Google to pay EUR 500,000 in damages, judging that Google sought to eliminate all competitors and put its own service forward in search results.
In 2013, the appellate court sought the advice of France’s Competition Authority, which found Google’s behaviour was not predatory. The latest decision followed the authority’s advice.
The court said that the disappearance of some businesses is not directly attributable to Google’s strategy. It ordered Evermaps to pay Google Inc and Google France EUR 20,000 each for costs.

29,"November 25, 2015","US: Google blames ‘bug’ for burying TripAdvisor, Yelp in search","
Google has blamed a coding bug for burying search results for TripAdvisor and Yelp.
Executive from the two sites, which compete with Google to offer travel and business recommendations, tweeted examples of smartphone searches over the weekend that included their company names but pointed people toward Google’s reviews and maps results.
“Gimme a break, @google. Search for ‘tripadvisor hilton’ puts the tripadvisor link so far down you can’t see it,” TripAdvisor Chief Executive Stephen Kaufer tweeted.
“Wonder if teens think this is Yelp,” Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman tweeted, posting a picture of a Google listing that popped up when he searched for Yelp and the name of a restaurant.
Google pinned the distorted results on a flaw in its code. “The issues cited were caused by a recent code push, which we’re working quickly to fix,” the company said in a statement.
Companies that rely on Google to drive traffic to their sites argue that the search engine should never manipulate listings and instead should act solely as a neutral platform. If Google uses search results to promote its own services over those of competitors, rivals argue, it destroys competition and misleads consumers.
Such complaints are the basis of a years-long investigation by European competition watchdogs.

30,"November 19, 2015",Russia: Google says sanctions are unfounded,"
Google is challenging a ruling that Russian competition laws were broken by pre-installing some Android programs on telephones.
The national antimonopoly service in Russia stated that by requiring cellular companies to install the programs that Google abused its dominant position.
Programs for maps services and YouTube and Google’s photography were at the middle of the row.
When it reached its conclusion the anti-monopoly watchdog gave Google so its programs weren’t favoured to alter its contracts with telephone companies. The company could face fees as high as 15% of its 2014 revenue if its practices didn’t alter.
Google hasn’t complied with this particular conclusion and has released opinions on its official Russian site describing why.
It included that the large numbers of rival applications as well as the ease with which apps could be set up on Android telephones meant there was plenty of rivalry in the Russian marketplace.
The Russian antimonopoly service has to react to the statement of Google.
Nevertheless, Russian search competing Yandex, which prompted antitrust authorities in the united states to inquire Google, said it might welcome an “open trial” to the matter.
“Yandex is assured in every stage of the country’s location,” it said.

Google will contest in court a ruling by Russia’s antitrust agency that it broke competition law by abusing its dominant position with its Android mobile platform, the U.S. technology company said on Tuesday.
Russia’s competition watchdog ruled in September that Google had broken the law by requiring pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices running on Android.
“We intend to contest this decision and explain in court why we consider it unfounded,” Google said in its official Russian blog.
Google has until Dec. 18 to amend its contracts with smartphone manufacturers in order to comply with the ruling in the case that was launched by local rival Yandex.
“Yandex is confident in every point of its position. We are ready for the appeal and welcome the most open trial,” Yandex said in a statement.
Yandex said on Friday that it had also asked the European Commission to investigate Google practices in relation to Android in the European Union.

European Union regulators are keeping their options open as to whether to sanction Google for abusing its market power or settle the long-running case with the company, Europe’s chief competition regulator said on Wednesday.
The comments by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager came as her officials reviewed Google’s response to EU charges laid out in April and waited for feedback from more than a dozen complainants.
The European Commission has accused the world’s most popular Internet search engine of favoring its shopping service in delivering search results at the expense of rivals.
Vestager said she had made no final decision.
“At this time it’s still open as to how it will end. It can take different routes, there is no decision yet on our side at least as to how it should end,” Vestager told reporters.
Vestager can either fine the company up to $6.6 billion euros and order it to stop its anti-competitive business practices or give it the opportunity to change its practices without any sanction or finding of wrongdoing.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Promoting Competition in Digital Markets; A Case Against the Google Case, and the Futile Search of ‘Neutrality’ in On-Line Searches Fernando Diez (Centro Universitario Villanueva)
Abstract: The technological foundations and businesses models upon which digital companies currently function, the so-called ‘platforms’, are characterized by the sort of features that attract antitrust scrutiny. They are usually conformed as multi-sided markets; they pervasively exhibit network effects; the nature and scope of entry barriers is uncertain; dominance in each market is duly granted to the successful company; foreclosure of small firms is always wandering around. Thus, it’s no surprise that digital markets champions such as Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple have received close attention from the regulators in both sides of the Atlantic. Accordingly, antitrust enforcement efforts both in Europe and the United States have recently increased in number of actions taken and the amount of fines imposed in high-tech industries. Recent decisions in this field have rekindled in-depth and largely unresolved debates concerning the appropriate role of antitrust enforcement in such markets.
Nevertheless, the Statement of Objections sent recently by the European Commission to Google, for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the internet-search market goes a step further, jeopardizing the very goals and objectives competition policy is supposed to pursue. Against this background and in light of other recent high-profile cases (Intel, Tomra, Post Danmark, and the everlasting Microsoft) this paper seeks to set an adequate legal and economic framework for the prohibition of monopolization under article 102 of the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). This sort of high tech markets are usually characterised for a heavy reliance in ICT (information and communication technologies), the importance of product design and the development of platforms. In addition, on the basis of ‘winner-takes-it-all’ paradigm, the platform on which they operate may be considered as an ‘essential facility’. As a result, any discrimination or denial of access may be considered abusive.
However, the legal treatment to be applied to ‘refusals to supply’ remains as one of the most contentious issues in contemporary EU competition law. It was at the heart of Microsoft’s misbehaviour in 2004 — and all the subsequent fines that followed — and, ten years later, if Google’s conduct regarding discrimination of competing firms in favour of its own services may walk the very same path. The four topics addressed in this paper concern three long-lasting controversies and one recent matter: i) under what circumstances a dominant firm is entitled to respond — albeit, aggressively — to its competitor’s challenges; ii) the precise scope — if there’s any — of the ‘objective justification’ defence; iii) if that sort of conduct is prohibited only when leads to anticompetitive foreclosure, without restrictive effects, is there room for a ‘by object’ interdiction of abuse of a dominant position?; iv) finally, in the specific digital industry, and given the still uncertain economics of multi-sided market and the evolving nature of prevalent businesses models, is really a ‘monopoly’ as bad and harmful as with the bricks-and-mortar or oil-well-and-pipeline predecessors? The ultimate question is, does current antitrust enforcement in these specific markets achieve its goal of fostering competition or rather the undesired effect of chilling innovation?

Google was found to be guilty of breaking Russian law after the investigation. The nation’s antitrust agency found out that their preloading of apps on Android handsets were unfair.

36,"November 4, 2015",UK: Google taken to court by Streetmap over ‘anticompetitive’ search abuse,"
Google has been accused of abusing its search dominance to promote Google Maps over rivals by UK-based Streetmap.
Streetmap, one of the first online mapping providers that launched in 1997, says Google is engaging in “anticompetitive conduct” and that its launch of GoogleMaps in 2007 lead to a “dramatic loss of traffic” to Steetmap’s website.
The lawsuit has been taken to the High Court and precedes upcoming probes by the European Union’s antitrust regulator into Google’s dominance of several sectors across shopping, travel and the company’s Android mobile operating system.
Streetmap argues that the launch of a map at the top of Google search results containing a thumbnail map generated only from Google Maps in June 2007, called the “Maps OneBox”, and later Google Maps for Android in October 2008, saw the company promoting its own maps more favourably.
Mark Hoskins representing Streetmap said: “Documents show the new-style Maps OneBox allowed Google to take advantage of its dominant position in online search to drive traffic to Google Maps in the online mapping market.”
Google denied allegations abuse, or that it has acted in an unlawfully discriminatory manner. The company’s lawyers argue that any adverse effects on Streetmap’s business are down to the “merits” of the services it is offering.

38,"November 2, 2015",EU: Google Accuses EU of antitrust about-face,"
Google owner Alphabet accused European Union regulators of making an unexplained about-face in their decision to file antitrust charges against the U.S. search giant, and warned that there was “no basis” for imposing fines, according to a redacted copy of Google’s response seen by The Wall Street Journal. The response was filed last month, but the copy was only recently leaked.
The response, which runs to almost 130 pages and leans heavily on legal opinions and case law, suggests that Google is gearing up for a protracted legal battle against the charges brought by the European Commission.
“The theory on which the [EU’s] preliminary conclusions rest is so ambiguous that the Commission itself concluded three times that the concern had been resolved,” Google’s lawyers wrote in the document. The document was recently sent to complainants in the case following heavy editing to remove commercially sensitive material.
The EU’s demands, Google argues, amount “to a demand that we sacrifice quality to subsidize competitors.”

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, she spoke about the lengthy, multiple probes into Google’s business practices, and said that each investigation was at a different stage, requiring different considerations.
Indeed, only the shopping case has so far proceeded to a statement of objections being slapped on Google, whose response to the suspected violations is currently being pored over by the antitrust wing of the European Commission.
“The shopping case may have similarities when we eventually look at maps and travel and a number of other related services, because the complaints sort of tell the same story,” Vestager told the newspaper. “But there is no such thing as you have done one, you’ve done them all. You can’t do that.”
Vestager added that other areas of investigation, such as the Android case and web-scraping allegations, continued to be a “high priority” for Brussels’ officials.
“[W]hat they have in common is that the name Google appears in each one, but apart from that they are very different. And therefore I do not think of it as one Google case but literally as different investigations and different cases,” she told the WSJ.

Unable to revive Yahoo’s revenue growth on her own, CEO Marissa Mayer is hoping for a little help from her old friends at Google.
Mayer, a top Google executive until defecting to Yahoo in 2012, announced the two companies had reached a three-year deal to work together in Internet search and advertising.
Yahoo Inc. tried to team up with Google Inc. in search during 2008 as part of its defense against a takeover attempt by Microsoft Corp. The Google alliance unraveled after the U.S. Justice Department threatened to block the partnership on the grounds that it would thwart competition.
After being rebuffed, Yahoo wound up negotiating a deal to rely on technology from Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Yahoo will still use Bing, but will also mix in results from Google.
“We see a unique moment and opportunity for Yahoo as we move into 2016 to narrow our strategy and focus on fewer products with higher quality to achieve better growth and better results,” Mayer said during a review of the third-quarter results. She promised to elaborate on her plan by the time Yahoo releases its fourth-quarter results in 2016.

Is Amazon the Next Google? Oliver Budzinski (Ilmenau University of Technology) & Karoline Henrike Köhler (Ilmenau University of Technology)
Abstract: Dominant or apparently dominant internet platform increasingly become subject to both antitrust investigations and further-reaching political calls for regulation. While Google is currently in the focus of the discussion, the next candidate is already on the horizon – the ubiquitous online trading platform Amazon. Competitors and suppliers but also famous economists like Paul Krugman unite in criticizing Amazon’s market power and alleged abuse of it. In this paper, we collect the multitude of allegations against Amazon and categorize them according to types of potential anticompetitive conduct or types of market failure. We provide an economic analysis of these allegations based upon economic theory as well as publicly available information and data. As one of our main results, we find that the most severe allegations against Amazon do not hold from an economic perspective and, consequently, do not warrant regulation or other drastic interventions (like breaking the company up). However, several areas of conduct, in particular, the use of best price clauses and the (anti-) competitive interplay of Amazon and the major publishers in the e-book market require competition policy action. The standard antitrust instruments, enriched with modern economic theory, should suffice to disincentivize the identified anticompetitive conduct for now.

The Commission’s ‘Next Big Thing’?: Why the Google Case is Not ‘Microsoft Reloaded’ Torsten Koerber (Georg-August-Universität)
Abstract: On April 15, 2015 the European Commission sent Google its statement of objections (SO) in the Google Search case with regard to Google Shopping.
On the same day, it opened investigations against Google with regard to Android. The question of whether the contractual framework of Android licensing violates competition law has been covered in another SSRN article (it does not).
The following article is aimed at assessing the Commission’s competitive analysis and comparing the Google search case to other EU decisions, in particular to the European Commission’s decisions in the Microsoft cases. This is not an easy task because neither the SO nor Google’s response of August 27, 2015 have yet been published in full.
The following remarks, therefore, only reflect preliminary thoughts about the sparse information that has been revealed to the public in the Commission’s press releases and Google’s blogs. Based upon this information, the Commission does not seem to have a particularly strong case against Google.

En caso de no cumplir con los cambios solicitados, Google podría enfrentar sanciones por hasta el 15% de sus ganancias obtenidas en el mercado de las aplicaciones móviles en Rusia.
El punto de contención se trata de parte de la política de Google, la cual exige a los fabricantes de dispositivos móviles que elijan instalar Android que también instalen la aplicación de su tienda virtual Google Play, así como varias otras aplicaciones de Google. Además, se les prohíbe a los fabricantes que instalen aplicaciones y servicios que compitan directamente con aquellos otorgados por Google.

Entre los cambios solicitados por el Servicio Federal Antimonopolio, Google tendría que permitir a diseñadores de aplicaciones como Yandex instalar sus servicios en dispositivos Android.
“Nuestro objetivo es regresar a un juego justo para el mercado – donde las aplicaciones son pre-instaladas en los dispositivos móviles con base a cuan buenos o cuan populares son, no debido a las restricciones impuestas por el creador del sistema operativo” declaró un vocero de Yandex. La empresa también buscaría que los dispositivos Android permitan al usuario elegir el buscador que desean utilizar cuando están instalando su celular inteligente o tableta.

Russia’s antimonopoly agency has given Google until November 18 to make amendments to features of its Android platform that it deemed anticompetitive. If Google fails to make the demanded changes, it could face stiff penalties of up to 15 percent of its revenue gained from mobile applications in Russia.
What’s at issue is Google’s policy that when a device maker chooses to install Android, it must also install the Google Play store app and several other Google applications. In addition, device manufacturers are restricted from installing apps and services that compete with Google’s core offerings.
The case against Google in Russia was launched by Yandex, a domestic search competitor that’s been losing market share as consumers pick up low-cost Android handsets pre-installed with Google search. If Google makes the changes laid out by the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) in Russia, it would allow third-party app developers like Yandex to get their own services installed on Android devices.
“Our goal is to return fair play to the market – when apps are pre-installed on mobile devices based on how good or how popular they are rather than due to restrictions imposed by the owner of the operating system,” Yandex said in a statement.
Yandex would also like for Android devices to present users with a choice of search provider when setting up their phone or tablet.

Google has allowed Android-phone producers to use its application store Google Play on the condition that they also pre-install services from the company, including search, and prioritize those icons on screens, the Russian regulator said Sept. 14. Yandex has said Android’s default options push mobile users to Google services, limiting consumers’ ability to choose such services from Yandex or other vendors.
“To restore competition on the market, Google should amend agreements with mobile-device producers within a month and exclude the anti-competitive clauses,” Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said in a statement on its Website on Monday.

Sin embargo, la comisión no respalda estos alegatos, no considera los beneficios para los consumidores y anunciantes, y sin proveer una teoría legal explícita que ligue sus acusaciones con el remedio propuesto.”
Walker argumenta que la UE ha ignorado la posición de Google en el mercado del comercio electrónico, en el cual se enfrenta con fuertes competidores como Amazon o Ebay.

52,"August 30, 2015",EU: Google says EU antitrust Charges are ‘Wrong’ and ‘Unfounded’,"
Google has always denied the European Union’s antitrust charges, but the search firm has finally formalized its response in a 150-page document sent to the EU and condensed into a post on the Google Europe blog.
Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel at Google, says the EU’s allegations that Google is illegally abusing its market dominance in anti-competitive practices that favor its own Google Shopping over other e-commerce aggregator websites are “wrong” and “unfounded.”
“We believe that the SO’s preliminary conclusions are wrong as a matter of fact, law and economics,” statedWalker.
“The SO says that Google’s displays of paid ads from merchants (and, previously, of specialized groups of organic search results) ‘diverted’ traffic away from shopping services. But the SO doesn’t back up that claim, doesn’t counter the significant benefits to consumers and advertisers, and doesn’t provide a clear legal theory to connect its claims with its proposed remedy.”
Walker argues that the EU has blatantly ignored the fact that Google is not the dominant player in e-commerce and is up against extremely fierce competition from other websites, including Amazon and eBay.

La comisión europea ha anunciado que ampliará sus investigaciones sobre Google por prácticas monopólicas. Actualmente la Comisión se encuentra investigando sus operaciones en vertical, y ha presentado denuncias formales, a las cuales Google deberá responder antes del 31 de agosto.
De acuerdo a una nota del Wall Street Journal, la Comisión se encuentra investigando si Google “Abusa de su posición dominante en contratos de publicidad con operadores, o si copia contenido de sitios rivales”. El primero de estos temas concierne a la práctica de Google de evitar que los sitios de internet utilicen sistemas de publicidad rivales.
Google fue investigado por esta misma razón en 2010. La investigación actual ocurre en un momento que muestra una mayor vulnerabilidad para Google.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that The European Commission (EC) is expanding its antitrust probe of Google. Currently, the EC is in the late stages of its vertical search inquiry and has filed formal charges, which Google has until August 31 to rebut. It’s at an earlier stage of investigating Google’s management of the Android operating system.
According to the Journal report, the EC is now investigating whether Google “abuses its dominance in advertising contracts with website operators and copies content from rival sites.” The first question goes to whether Google prevents online publishers from using rival advertising systems on their sites.
This was initially investigated in Europe in 2010. The issue is now being exhumed amid a growing sense of Google’s vulnerability.

56,"August 13, 2015",EU: Google gets second extension in antitrust case,"
Google, the world’s most popular Internet search engine, has been given an extra two weeks to counter European Union charges of abusing its market power in a dozen EU countries and stave off a possible billion-euro fine.
The European Commission has extended the deadline for replying to the charges to Aug. 31 from July 17, a Google spokesman said Thursday.
This is the second extension for the company, which had originally been told to respond to the commission’s charge sheet, or statement of objections, by July 7.
The commission, which in April accused Google of distorting Web search results to favor its shopping service, confirmed that it had accepted the company’s request for additional time to reply.
“In line with normal practice, the commission analyzed the reasons for the request. As a result, it has granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defense,” commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.

58,"August 11, 2015",EU: Google’s corporate rearrange won’t insulate firm against antitrust probes,"
Brussels confirmed late on Tuesday that Google’s radical corporate shape-shifting that spawned parent company Alphabet would not “insulate” Google from the EU’s competition probes.
The European Commission’s competition spokesman Ricardo Cardoso told The Register:
“We have seen press reports that Google is carrying out a corporate restructuring. Google itself explained that it’s changing its structure to better run its different businesses. As far as the Commission is aware, there is no link to our competition investigations.”
In general, the Commission will always carry out its competition enforcement duties independently of the precise corporate structure of the companies under investigation. A company does not insulate itself from a competition investigation through a change in corporate structure.
One of the most persistent questions nagging commentators since Google announced its big changes has been how the new set-up will impact on the Chocolate Factory’s EU anti-trust case.
Google was accused by the European Commission of giving preference to its own services, scraping news sites and imposing anti-competitive terms on advertisers. The latter two activities were resolved early on in the negotiations, which have rumbled on for more than five years. However the issues of search and promotion of Google’s own services have proved trickier to solve.
In essence, the new Alphabet set-up won’t affect the competition case, since the investigation stemmed from historical complaints. However many have speculated that Google may have one eye on possible sanctions.

Despídanse de Google y den la bienvenida a Alphabet.
Directivos de Google Inc. han anunciado que la compañía estará creando una nueva estructura operativa bajo una compañía matriz que han bautizado Alphabet Inc. Larry Page, co-fundador y actual CEO de la empresa se mantendrá al frente de la nueva estructura, mientras que su co-fundador Sergey Brin fungirá como Presidente.
Google pasa así a ser una de las áreas operativas de esta estructura, con un nuevo CEO: Sundar Pichai, antiguo líder de las divisiones de Android y Chrome.
El cambio va más allá del nombre de la entidad económica, significando una reorganización total de la empresa. En comentarios realizados en su blog, Page dijo que el objetivo será una versión “adelgazada” de Google, con sus otros negocios dentro de Bio-ciencias y bio-tecnología formando nuevas empresas de operación independiente. Cada unidad tendrá su propio CEO, sugirió Page.
Page ha buscado mostrar este cambio como parte de su estrategia para fomentar la innovación tecnológica que el, Brin y Google siempre han exaltado. “Hicimos muchas cosas que, en su momento, parecían locuras.” continuó Page. “Varias de estas locuras ahora tienen más de mil millones de usuarios, como Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome y Android. Y no nos detenemos ahi. Tratamos de hacer las cosas que la gente piensa que son locuras, pero que a nosotros nos emocionan mucho.”

60,"August 10, 2015",US: Google to reorganize into new company called ‘Alphabet’,"
Say goodbye to Google. Say hello to Alphabet.
Google Inc. says it is creating a new operating structure under a newly formed umbrella company it is calling Alphabet Inc. Co-founder and current CEO Larry Page will lead the new company, while Sergey Brin, the other co-founder, will serve as president.
Google itself will be an operating unit and get a new CEO: Sundar Pichai, who had been running Android and Chrome.
It’s not just a name change, but a reorganization of the company. In a blog post announcing the change, Page said they wanted a “slimmed down” version of Google, with other businesses, such as Life Sciences and the Calico biotech unit to be their own operating companies. Each unit, Page suggested, would get its own CEO.
Page sought to position the move as a further move toward the technology-driven disruption and innovation he, Brin and Google have all long espoused. “We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time,” Page wrote. “Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we haven’t stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about.”

61,"August 9, 2015",EU: Is Google Inc losing in Europe?,"
An antitrust case against the company was filed almost a year ago that is still nowhere close to settlement.
The US firm is going through intense scrutiny in Europe as the company has been accused of failures by several European companies. While it has not affected the company’s results to date, it is very likely that the company would have to pay a massive fine of up to $6 billion, and this will definitely affect its business negatively in Europe.
Google’s search and Android products dominate their respective sectors in Europe, and if it loses this market then it will come as a serious blow to the Internet firm.
The details come from a report published in Bloomberg Businessweek, which talks in detail about how Google is losing the battle in Europe.

Competition Commission will take “sometime” to decide on the case related to alleged unfair business practices of Internet major Google in India.
The fair trade regulator has already received the detailed probe report on the case from its investigation arm Director General (DG).
When asked about the status of Google case, Competition Commission of India (CCI) Chairman Ashok Chawla on Friday said it would take sometime before a final decision is taken.
“The process is fairly lengthy, it is a quasi-judicial process. We have to hear the parties involved and then decide. It will take quite sometime,” he said in New Delhi.
CCI, which first received a complaint against Google back in 2011, has been looking into allegations that the company abused its dominant position in the search engine space for well over three years.
The main allegations against Google are that it favours its own products in search results and resorts to discrimination by favouring paid searches.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
Should Google’s Secret Sauce Be Organic? Florian Wagner-von Papp (University College London)
Abstract: This commentary discusses the European antitrust investigation into Google and the international implications of the case. It focuses on Google’s alleged dominance and the allegations concerning Google’s self-preferencing of its Google Shopping results on general web search result pages, which form the subject matter of the Statement of Objections that the Commission sent on 15 April 2015.
The EU Commission’s international jurisdiction to prescribe is found to be unproblematic. However, the tendency towards overenforcement resulting from the cumulation of national and supranational investigations by competition authorities worldwide counsels caution in borderline cases. And Google is a borderline case.
While it seems possible to construct a story of dominance and consumer harm, the paper doubts Google’s ability to act to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors and customers. Ultimately, this is an empirical question, and the Commission may have sufficient evidence at its disposal. However, the publicly available evidence does not seem to support a finding of dominance despite Google’s high share of user searches.
A finding of abuse would require changing the goalposts: one would have to accept that instead of a constructive refusal to deal, it is already abusive if services are not provided to third parties on identical conditions, or that instead of requiring coercion of consumers to acquire a tied product or service, it is already abusive if consumers are merely nudged to preferring the vertically integrated firm’s products. These changes would amount to a paradigm change. Traditionally, competition is to force producers to be responsive to consumer preferences. Consumer choices are taken to reveal their preferences unless coercion can be shown. Allowing intervention already below the threshold of coercion, when consumers are merely nudged to make particular choices, risks substituting the competition authority’s assessment for consumer preferences.

65,"August 2, 2015",EU: Google urges French regulator to withdraw its threat of fines,"
Google is pushing back against France’s data privacy authority after the watchdog ordered the search engine giant to extend the so-called right to be forgotten to its websites globally.
France’s data protection authority CNIL should withdraw an ultimatum threatening Google with fines unless it delists requested links across its network, the California-based company said in a blog post Thursday.
“We respectfully disagree with the CNIL’s assertion of global authority on this issue,” Peter Fleischer, Google’s global privacy counsel, said in the post. The French regulator’s order from last month “is a troubling development that risks serious chilling effects on the Web,” he said.
The order comes just over a year after a judgment by the EU’s highest court created a right to be forgotten – allowing people to seek the deletion of links on search engines if the information was outdated or irrelevant. The ruling led to a furor, with Google appointing a special panel to advise it on implementing the law. The panel opposed applying the ruling beyond EU domains.
Failure to comply could lead to sanctions, Isabelle Falque- Pierrotin, the president of CNIL, said in June. She currently also heads the group of EU data protection commissioners who urged Google to remove links, when needed, from .com sites and not just from European sites.
The right-to-be-forgotten rules add to a growing list of challenges the company is facing in Europe.

Just as one European antitrust case against Google reached its conclusion, with a second one underway, it may be facing a third, reports the Financial Times.
The first antitrust case found that Google abused its dominant position in search to promote its own products over that of competitors. with the company told to expect large fines. A second one is underway, to determine whether Google forced smartphone manufacturers to favor its own apps over competitor ones in return for permission to use Android.
The FT now reports that a number of companies selling online advertising have asked the European Commission to consider a third case, to investigate Google’s dominance of the web advertising business.
Google had previously issued a rather weakly-worded denial, saying that it did not “require” clients to use DoubleClick Bid Manager to buy Ad Exchange advertising, and that many did not do so.

EU antitrust cops charged Google with violating the bloc’s laws in mid-April and gave the company ten weeks to respond to the allegations, escalating a five-year-old investigation.
Those ten weeks have now elapsed, but Google still has time to respond because it wasn’t immediately granted access to the EU’s case documents, Vestager said at a news conference.
Google can ask for an extension and may also request a hearing in front of regulators to better make its case.
Vestager also declined to give a new deadline for decisions in her agency’s high-profile tax investigations, which have ensnared at least four multinational companies including Apple and Amazon.com.

Getty filed an antitrust complaint over Google’s image search, which could lead to the EC expanding its investigations to include the service, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The photo agency has complained that searches for images through a standard Google search box heavily feature results from Google’s own image search service. Getty argues that this high prominence drives more traffic to Google at the detriment of Getty and other services.

That culminated in the EU competition authority levying charges against the world’s most popular Internet search engine two months ago, raising the possibility of a fine of as much as $6.6 billion, 10 percent of its global turnover.

Back in April, the EU filed two cases against Google for anticompetitive practices with its comparative shopping service and Android. Google is seven weeks into the 10 it was allotted for a formal response.
In the interview, Brittin stressed Google’s disagreement with the charges, repeating the claims from its internal response that, with the explosion of mobile devices, the search engine is not nearly as dominant as it once was or is portrayed to be. Politico reports, however, that he said Google is open to a settlement, something those that have gone through the European regulatory wringer recommend.

US tech firm Disconnect has filed a complaint to EU antitrust regulators against Google’s ban on its privacy app, accusing the Silicon Valley giant of abusing its dominant market position.
Disconnect, set up four years ago by former Google engineers, says its app protects users of the Android operating system from invisible tracking and malware distributed through advertisements.
It said Google had abused its position by blocking the app from the Google Play store last year, and had gained an unfair advantage over competitors by integrating its own privacy and security services into its own products.
“They said we interfered with the ability of third parties to serve ads. Google was not willing to engage in a dialogue,” Disconnect Chief Executive Casey Oppenheim told Reuters on Tuesday.
Google said Disconnect’s complaint was groundless.
“Our Google Play policies have long prohibited apps that interfere with other apps – such as altering their functionality, or removing their way of making money. We apply this policy uniformly and Android developers strongly support it,” spokesman Al Verney said.
The European Commission, which opened a probe into Google’s agreements with smartphone and tablet makers using its Android operating system in April, confirmed it had received the complaint on Tuesday and said it would assess it.

“How can it be that in order to have Google’s (mobile operating system) Android you need to pre-install Google Search, Google Browser, Google Mail, Google You-Tube and its app store on the device?” Gabriel said at an event in Berlin.
He welcomed a decision by the European Commission in April to launch an antitrust investigation into Google’s Android system over concerns anticompetitive constraints imposed by the company were hampering markets.
Gabriel said agreements needed to be reviewed to ensure that customers were not being barred from using competing browsers and web services and locked into “Google Internet”.

The Commission has identified four conducts that may violate Article 102 TFEU. To bring the investigation to an end, Google has offered several commitments in April 2013 to meet the identified concerns. Based on a formal Market Test, the Commission will have to decide whether the commitments suffice to settle the case or whether other measures are required (I.). This article provides an overview of the Commission’s preliminary findings (II.), explains the remedies currently proposed by Google (III.) and assesses the impact of those remedies (IV.), before drawing a conclusion as to the effectiveness of such proposals (V.).

82,"May 3, 2015",US: Fiat Chrysler boss open to merger with Google or Apple,"
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has revealed he is open to a merger or partnership with a non-automotive company such as Apple or Google.
Speaking earlier this week, Marchionne said “I’ve always been intrigued by the notion of having technology disruptors show up in the marketplace and change the paradigm.” The executive went on to say he’d be open to a “dialogue” with the tech giants but warned they could “fundamentally hurt this industry” if they successfully enter the automotive market on their own.
While the prospects of Apple or Google being interested seem slim, Marchionne has been pushing the industry to consolidate. However, he’s received a lukewarm reception as his preferred partner, General Motors, seems to have little interest in a potential merger.

83,"April 28, 2015",EU: Google rolls out a $164 million partnership with newspapers,"
Google has pledged 150 million euros to support and fund news organizations, in a new scheme likely to be seen as a charm offensive following clashes with European regulators.
Through its Digital News Initiative – a partnership with eight publishers including the Financial Times and The Guardian – the U.S. search giant has promised to help organizations with product development, support start-ups and offer training. Google said it aimed to help the media organizations “increase revenue, traffic and audience engagement.”
The move comes after European regulators filed antitrust charges against Google earlier this month, alleging that the company “abused its dominant position” in the Internet search market.

eBay has rejected a report that it is backing Google’s defense in an antitrust case brought by the EU. In an interview published Sunday, eBay’s chief executive, John Donahoe, told the Financial Times that the online auction company considers itself a “a strong commerce competitor” to Google.
EU regulators take into account the competitive landscape when examining whether a company is dominant and abusing that dominance. But eBay said Tuesday that the comments had been misconstrued. “While the specific complaint against Google has not been made public, we believe the Commission is investigating important concerns with the Internet ecosystem,” eBay said in a statement.

EBay Inc Chief Executive John Donahoe has supported arguments made by Google Inc in its defense in an antitrust case, saying the two companies are direct competitors in online shopping, the Financial Times reported.
Barriers between different areas of online commerce are breaking down, Donahoe said in an interview with FT, highlighting the challenges the European Commission faces in bringing the high-profile case.
The European Union accused Google of cheating consumers and competitors by distorting Web search results to favor its own shopping service, after a five-year investigation that could change the rules for business online.
Google said in a blog post that it strongly disagreed with the EU’s statement of objections and would make the case that its products have fostered competition and benefited consumers.

In a recently released report, Reuters has revealed that the European Union (EU)’s last-week-announced decision with regard to an antitrust case against Google is apparently a result of official complaints filed by 19 companies in Europe and the US.
The report, citing unnamed sources “familiar with the matter,” has revealed that the 19 complainants opposing Google’s antitrust practices include a number of big as well as small companies, including US software giant Microsoft. Some of the complainants reportedly do not even have any direct involvement with Google Shopping.
The complainants include French legal search engine eJustic; UK price comparison site Foundem; German business listings site VfT; and German magazine and newspaper publishers VDZ and BDZV.

87,"April 21, 2015",EU: Vestager ‘I Have No Grudge Against Google’,"
EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has been attracting attention for a while now as she is the main person responsible for hitting Google with an antitrust lawsuit.
She claims that Google has been abusing its dominant power in Europe by manipulating search engine results. Google, on the other hand, has refuted such claims, stating that users who use the search engine select their links with their own discretion and Google is not in the habit of manipulating search results.
Ms. Vestager has been under scrutiny as analysts have labeled her as an enemy of Google. So much so that the AFP called her Google’s arch nemesis.
Yesterday, she spoke at the NYU School of Law and she cleared out the misconceptions of any grudges, by stating: “Most media would like a conflict, I have no grudge against Google. We have made a statement of objection lining out our preliminary view on a certain conduct.”
She elaborated by saying that the conduct she is referring to is the fact that Google is taking advantage of its dominant position in the search engine market.

88,"April 21, 2015",Competition Buzz: Google and the Limits of Antitrust: The Case Against the Antitrust Case Against Google,"
By: Geoffrey A. Manne & Joshua D. Wright
The antitrust landscape has changed dramatically in the last decade. Within the last two years alone, the United States Department of Justice has held hearings on the appropriate scope of Section 2, issued a comprehensive Report, and then repudiated it; and the European Commission has risen as an aggressive leader in single firm conduct enforcement by bringing abuse of dominance actions and assessing heavy fines against firms including Qualcomm, Intel, and Microsoft.
In the United States, two of the most significant characteristics of the “new” antitrust approach have been a more intense focus on innovative companies in high-tech industries and a weakening of longstanding concerns that erroneous antitrust interventions will hinder economic growth. But this focus is dangerous, and these concerns should not be dismissed so lightly. In this article the authors offer a comprehensive cautionary tale in the context of a detailed factual, legal and economic analysis of the next Microsoft: the theoretical, but perhaps imminent, enforcement action against Google.

Tras varias semanas de especulación, la Comisión Europea ha formalmente presentado cargos por prácticas anticompetitivas en contra de Google. La comisión alega que el dominio de Google sobre el mercado de los buscadores en línea ha sido utilizado para favorecer sus propios servicios, dando a estos prioridad en los resultados.
Este viernes Google presentó su defensa, respondiendo a la comisión por medio de dos artículos publicados en Blogs, los cuales pueden ser consultados aquí y aquí.

90,"April 20, 2015",US/EU: American travel companies take aim at Google,"
American TripAdvisor a leading Internet travel sites has emerged as a key player in the antitrust complaint the European Commission brought against the online search titan Google Inc.
Last week, European regulators accused Google of abusing its dominant market share in Internet search by displaying results from its Google Shopping retail site ahead of similar results from competing online retailers.
The commission began its investigation in 2010, spurred by claims by several small European companies that Google was competing unfairly. But several big American companies joined the fray, including Microsoft Corp., the product review site Yelp.com, and TripAdvisor, which filed a complaint in 2012.
While the commission’s complaint deals only with Google’s shopping service, TripAdvisor and another major travel site, Expedia, say that Google uses the same tactics to promote its online travel service, Google Flights. The European regulators noted they are continuing to investigate Google’s other business practices.
“Google engages in preferencing and manipulates search results so that consumers see content that benefits Google, not the best content for consumers,” Chief executive Kaufer said in a statement Monday. “This practice harms consumers and competition, and must be ended.”
In a posting on its corporate blog, Google senior vice president Amit Singhal denied any wrongdoing. Singhal noted that while TripAdvisor said it has been harmed by Google’s tactics, it also “claims to be the Web’s largest travel brand and has nearly doubled its revenues in the last four years.”

92,"April 19, 2015",France: Google must reveal search algorithm says French Senate,"
French senators have amended a bill that would require Google to advertise three competitors on its home page, but stops short of explicitly requiring the search engine to disclose its algorithms.
The amendment, added Thursday to an economic growth, activity and equality bill, calls for any search engine likely to have a structural effect on the online economy to provide users with a way to consult at least three competing search engines from its homepage, and to ensure that it does not favor its own services over those of competitors.
The wording clearly targets Google, without naming it, and comes on the heels of the European Commission’s charge that Google favors its comparison shopping service over those of competing search engines.
The bill going through the French senate now also requires economically powerful search engines to provide information about how they classify or index websites, and forbids them from requiring software developers or device manufacturers to exclusively use their services.

94,"April 15, 2015",UK: The couple behind the Google investigation,"
A few weeks ago the European Commission stated they may be looking to re-investigate Google over antitrust violations, but the original case started long before now. According to the Wall Street Journal it all appears to start with a British couple from Berkshire, England who started their price comparison shopping website in 2005 called ‘Foundem.’
For Shivaun and Adam Raff, (Foundem’s creators) it’s been an uphill battle with keeping Foundem inside of Google’s search rankings, although Foundem has been little more than a “zombie site” for years, says Ms. Raff. According to the duo, Google had penalties set in place which seemed to affect their website and resulted in Foundem being excluded from search results.
Foundem may have initially started the series of complaints against the search company, but they’re a fairly small entity compared to the other corporations and companies that followed with their own complaints, such as Trip Advisor, Expedia, and even Microsoft.

The European Commission filed antitrust charges against Google Wednesday, alleging that the company “abused its dominant position” in the Internet search market. The tech giant hit back, however, saying it will respond to the charges in the coming weeks.
In what it called a Statement of Objections, the European Union’s executive arm said Google had “systematically” favored its own comparison shopping product in its general search results pages.Responding to the commission’s announcement, Google said in blog post that it “strongly” disagreed with the EU’s statement of objections and would make its case in the coming weeks.
“While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways — and allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark,” Google said.
“If you look at shopping — an area where we have seen a lot of complaints and where we understand the European Commission will focus its Statement of Objections — it’s clear that (a) there’s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay, two of the biggest shopping sites in the world) and (b) Google’s shopping results have not the harmed the competition,” it added.
Google faces fines of as much as $6.6 billion if antitrust charges are proven, and could be forced to reshape its business in Europe.

96,"April 14, 2015",EU: Google to face antitrust charges,"
The European Union is set to file formal charges against Google Inc. for allegedly violating the bloc’s antitrust laws, according to people familiar with the charges.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s competition commissioner, made the decision on Tuesday to file charges against Google that could result in up to $6 billion in fines, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Google is being charged with violating antitrust laws by allegedly siphoning traffics from its competitors to its own search-engine services. Many in the European technology industry claim that Google’s practices have stunted the growth of smaller, home-grown tech companies.
If Google is found guilty it could be forced to make massive changes to the way it conducts business in Europe, in addition to the possibility of fines.
The antitrust charges are the culmination of a five-year EU investigation into the business practices of the internet behemoth. Google nearly succeeding in settling the case without such charges last year, but a settlement fell apart after objections from some EU ministers and the European technology industry.

100,"April 8, 2015",India:  Final report on alleged unfair business ways of Google submitted,"
Competition Commission of India’s investigation arm has submitted its final report on alleged unfair business ways of Internet major Google in India.
The fair trade watchdog, which first received a complaint against Google back in 2011, has been looking into allegations that the company abused its dominant position in the search engine space for well over three years.
The main allegations against Google are that it favours its own products in search results and resorts to discrimination by favouring paid searches. Other allegations include denial of access to content and imposing of unfair and discriminatory conditions on “AdWords” customers.
Under competition regulations, an entity found violating the norms could be slapped with penalty of up to 10% of its three-year annual average turnover. The average revenue of Google, which is one of the world’s most valued companies, in the last three years is about $55.85 billion and 10% of that would translate to nearly $6 billion.

Three U.S. Federal Trade Commission members said on Wednesday they regretted the inadvertent release of part of an agency report about its probe of Google as the company continues to face antitrust scrutiny from European authorities.
The document, which was at the centre of a report by The Wall Street Journal, indicated that key staff members at the FTC were in favour of suing Google for allegedly breaking antitrust law. The agency settled with the search and advertising company in early 2013, with all five commissioners ultimately deciding not to sue.
In a statement, three of the commissioners — Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, Julie Brill and Maureen Ohlhausen — defended the final outcome.
“Contrary to recent press reports, the commission’s decision on the search allegations was in accord with the recommendations of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics, and Office of General Counsel,” the commissioners said. The commissioners considered that Google has abided by their commitments, outlined in a letter by then Chairman of Google,Jon Leibovitz.
The agency said that it regretted the release of the documents, which were confidential and should not have been included in a response to a Freedom of Information Act request.

The MEPs welcomed further investigations by the Commission into Google’s practices in the mobile sector and in the digital market in general. But the report blasts the Commission, saying that despite a four-year investigation and three sets of commitment proposals, it “has achieved no demonstrable results” in its main concern: probing whether Google gives its own services preferential treatment in search results.

“I can confirm that Commissioner Vestager met Schmidt and other Google representatives” yesterday, her spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.
“I cannot comment further on the contents of the meeting as they relate to an ongoing competition investigation,” Mr Cardoso told reporters.
Google has offered three packages to resolve the issues that the EU has raised but all were rejected.
Ms Vestager called for a review of the probe and asked for fresh information from all parties when she took office in November.

115,"March 2, 2015",EU: Renewed momentum in the Google antitrust investigation expected,"
Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,European parliament’s rapporteur, has has been applying this knowledge to his work on the Google antitrust investigation on parliament’s behalf, reporting on it and keenly observing negotiations between the European commission and Google.
With the changeover in commission, Ramon Tremosa I Balcells believes that there is renewed momentum in the case, and the new European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager will be able to “finish the job soon”. He also hopes that “this spring the commission will have a new approach to this case”.
The case began five years ago, after the commission received complaints that the US tech giant was exploiting its monopoly of the search engine market. The previous European competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia failed to agree a solution with Google.

Google has announced it will unify all of its European, Middle-Eastern and African teams into one EMEA division, headed by Google UK’s Matt Brittin on Thursday.
It follows several investigations into breaking up the search giant in Europe, including a request from the European Parliament to have Google split its search business from other services, in order to remove competitive advantage the search giant might gain by bumping search results.
Google is also facing troubles in Russia, after search provider Yandex opened an anti-monopoly case against Google, due to preloading its own services on Android and blocking competitors.
Google will address the growing tensions between the search giant and Europe in the next few months, pushing for a single digital market to make decisions and legislation for the company The Business Insider reported.

118,"February 25, 2015","The Politics of Commoditization in Global ICT Industries: A Political Economy Explanation of the Rise of Apple, Google, and Industry Disruptors","
Posted by Social Science Research Network
 The Politics of Commoditization in Global ICT Industries: A Political Economy Explanation of the Rise of Apple, Google, and Industry Disruptors –  Kenji E. Kushida (Stanford University)
Abstract: The global Information and Communications Technologies industry has experienced a rapid, radical reorganization of industry leaders and business models — most recently in mobile. New players Apple and Google abruptly redefined the industry, bringing a wave of commoditization to carriers and equipment manufacturers. Technologies, corporate strategies, and industry structures are usually the first places to look when explaining these industry disruptions, but this paper argues that it was actually a set of political bargains during initial phases of telecommunications liberalization, which differed across countries, that set the trajectories of development in motion. This paper shows how different sets of winners and losers of domestic and regional commoditization battles emerged in various ICT industries around the world. Carriers won in Japan, equipment manufacturers in Europe, and eventually, computer services industry actors rather than communications firms emerged as winners in the US. These differences in industry winner outcomes was shaped by the relative political strength of incumbent communications monopolies and their will to remain industry leaders, given the political system and political dynamics they faced during initial liberalization. The US computer services industry, which developed independently of its telecommunications sector due to antitrust and government policy, eventually commoditized all others, both domestically and abroad. This paper contends that a political economy approach, tracing how politics and regulatory processes shaped industry structures, allows for a better understanding of the underlying path dependent processes that shape rapidly changing global technological and industry outcomes, with implications beyond ICT.

Google Chairman Eric Schmidt will meet European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager next week to discuss a four-year-old probe into the company’s search engine after efforts to settle the case stalled, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday.
It’s Vestager’s first meeting in the case with Google executives since she took office in November, said the people, who asked not to be identified because details of the Brussels talks aren’t public.
The world’s biggest search engine has come under mounting pressure in Europe over competition and privacy issues in recent months. EU lawmakers last year called for regulators to consider splitting up the company if they can’t wrap up the antitrust probe.

120,"February 23, 2015",Russia: Competition watchdog officially opens case against Google,"
Russia’s competition watchdog said on Friday it had opened a case against Google Inc over alleged violation of anti-monopoly law, following a complaint from Russia’s biggest search site Yandex over Google’s mobile platform.
“We have studied the complaint and decided to open proceedings regarding the violation of anti-monopoly regulation,” a spokeswoman for the FAS competition watchdog said without elaborating.
The Russian investigation comes after European regulators were said last July to be preparing a possible challenge to Google’s mobile software business.
They said the European Commission had sent handset makers questionnaires asking whether there was a requirement set by Google that they should not pre-install apps, products or services on mobile devices that compete with Google software such as its search engine, app store and maps.

A federal judge for the Northern District of California on Friday dismissed a class action suit against Google for allegedly monopolizing search engines in Android phones.
The plaintiffs in the case were two customers who purchased Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and sought to represent a class of Android purchasers. According to the claim, neither plaintiff knew that Google would be the default search engine on their phone or how to modify the search engine.
Judge Freeman ruled that the complainants failed to establish a link between software requirements and phone pricing, also noting that “there are no facts alleged to indicate that defendant’s conduct has prevented consumers from freely choosing among search products or prevented competitors from innovating.”

Yandex, Russia’s largest search provider, has filed a complaint against Google for what it believes are anti-competitive practices. The complaint specifically relates Google’s bundling of its search engine and apps into Android, which is, by far, the most popular mobile OS in Russia.
According to Yandex, Google is actively preventing local smartphone vendors from pre-loading competing services onto devices running Android. It claims the belief that Android is an open platform is merely an illusion, as, in order to put the Google Play store on their devices.
The case mirrors a probe in Europe centred on whether Google takes unfair advantage of the 80 percent market share of the Android platform to promote services from maps to search.
The watchdog, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service, said it had received Yandex’s complaint. A spokeswoman said it could take up to 30 days to review it.

127,"January 29, 2015",Economic Considerations Raised by the Federal Trade Commission’s Investigation of Google’s Search Practices,"
Robert Levinson, Michael Salinger, Jan 30, 2015
In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission closed its nineteen-month antitrust investigation into Google’s search practices. The primary issue in that investigation was Google’s use of Universal Search results. The argument that Google’s display of Universals violated the antitrust laws appeared to rest on a theory of vertical foreclosure. Under the vertical foreclosure theory, Google’s thematic results compete with third-party thematic search sites, and the “proper” role for Google’s general search engine was to act as an honest broker among the alternatives. The FTC’s investigation and its resolution raised interesting antitrust issues, some of which were novel, and some of which were fundamental to sound antitrust enforcement. Among these are several that we consider in this article: (1) What is the nature of the economic relationship between Google and third parties that receive (and perhaps rely on) traffic referred to them by Google’s general search engine?; (2) Is “general search” a relevant antitrust market, and is general search a distinct product or service, inherently separate from thematic search?; and (3) Should innovations by Google that expand the scope of what its general search engine can do—and place it in competition with other websites—be viewed as “monopoly leveraging” or, alternatively, as “innovation competition”?

After a four year antitrust investigation into Google, European Union (EU) commissioner of for the digital economy Günther Oettinger is asking for the competition commission to provide a resolution by mid 2015. The investigation is looking into allegations that Google’s search engine favors Google products over competitors’ services. Oettinger also invited Google to discuss possible changes to the EU’s copyright rules. Several EU based publishers have criticized how Google dominates how people find content online and some countries have responded by requiring news aggregators like Google News to pay to show publishers’ content on their websites. After Spain passed the copyright law, Google News shut down for the country. Policy makers in Europe are considering overhauling copyright laws for the entire EU, though internet companies are strongly opposed to this move. Oettinger was asked in an interview on Tuesday if the EU has taken an antagonistic stance towards American tech companies, to which he responded, “It’s not a battle, but a competition and cooperation.”

Posted by Social Science Research Network
In Google We Trust – Burguet, Roberto and Caminal, Ramon and Ellman, Matthew, In Google We Trust? (December 23, 2014).
Abstract:     We examine the incentives of a monopolistic search engine, funded by advertising, to provide reliable search results. We distinguish two types of search result: sponsored and organic (not-paid-for). Organic results are most important in searches for online content, while sponsored results are more important in product searches. By modeling the underlying markets for online content and offline products, we can identify the sources of distortions for each type of result, and their interaction. This explicit treatment proves crucial for understanding, not only spillovers across markets, but also fundamental policy issues, such as the welfare effects of integration. In particular, integration of the engine with a small fraction of content providers is welfare-enhancing when incentives to distort are stronger for sponsored than organic search, but welfare-reducing in the opposite case.

130,"December 18, 2014",US: Google makes its case to nix Android suit,"
Google made its case to a US federal judge Thursday in efforts to have a lawsuit that alleges anticompetitive business practices regarding the Android operating system dismissed.
Two smartphone customers filed their lawsuit against Google accusing the company of unfairly forcing device makers like Samsung Electronics to pre-load their phones with Google-owned applications instead of rival products. The claims say Google is unfairly tying Android smartphones to Google products like Google Maps and Chrome.
But on Thursday, the company argued that the lawsuit has no merit because consumers are still free to use other rival apps; the plaintiffs, however, argue that most consumers do not know how to switch the settings on their phone that make Google products their default apps, or will not go through the trouble to do so.
US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman is now weighing whether to allow the class action to move forward. If she does, reports say the case could publicize loads of internal Google documents.
Similar allegations were lodged against Google in the EU earlier this year.

European competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced at a press conference that competitors of search giant Google have been questioned by authorities as the European Commission mulls whether to ramp up its investigation into the company.
Rivals involved in Internet maps and travel were consulted “in order to get fresh information because it was quite a while” since the EU authority had obtained information in the case, Vestager said. She added that she had not yet decided whether to abandon settlement talks and send an official statement of objections to the firm.
Experts say Vestager brings a fresh look at the case after four years of the investigation, which nearly landed a settlement earlier this year by former EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia.
But a settlement appears further away since Vestager took the reins. Just weeks ago the European Parliament voted in favor of calling on the Commission to force Google to unbundle its search operations from the rest of the company.

Australian lawmakers have launched their own plans for a so-called “Google tax” aimed at preventing foreign companies from relocating their offices to the country in search of lower tax deals.
The legislation mirrors similar proposals in the UK. Experts have deemed the bills as “Google taxes” as regulators across the globe crack down on the company’s market dominance and allegedly anticompetitive conduct. But the regulation would not apply to just Google, and several jurisdictions, including the EU, are examining whether foreign companies benefitting from domestic tax breaks are given an anticompetitive advantage.
The Australian Tax Office is reportedly “embedded in the office” of 10 major corporations, according to Treasurer Joe Hockey, in part of a probe of whether the firms pay a fair amount of taxes in Australia.
Reports say Google is among the 10 companies under investigation, though Hockey declined to confirm those rumors.

The head of Russia’s largest search engine publicly supported the European Commission’s reported inquiry into Google’s practice of tying Google products with Android devices.
Yandex Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh said that he supports the Commission’s scrutiny of Google, adding that the EU’s probes have helped the Russian firm gain market share away from Google.
Reports emerged earlier this week that the Commission was looking into yet more allegations of anticompetitive conduct by the world’s largest search engine, this time regarding Google’s practice of having Android devices come pre-loaded with Google products like Google Maps and Chrome.
”This is very similar to what Microsoft Corp was doing a decade ago,” Volozh said. “They were trying to use dominance in operating systems to promote their Internet Explorer browser and were finally band from doing this. The same is now happening with Android – Google dominates in it and runs practices incompatible with fair competition.”
The Commission is looking into a complaint against Google’s tying practices filed by a group representing technology giants including Microsoft and Nokia Oyj. Reports say the Commission is likely to launch a formal investigation of the matter in the near future.

134,"December 4, 2014",UK: ‘Google tax’ proposed to hike rates for foreign firms,"
As the European Commission investigates claims of anticompetitive effects of tax breaks offered to international companies, a UK official has proposed new tax rules that would aim to level the playing field between international firms and domestic competition.
UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has proposed a 25 percent tax on local profits of foreign companies. The proposal would curb companies’ practice of using tax structures in Ireland, Luxembourg and other EU member states that allow companies to pay less than domestic rivals.
”That’s not fair to other British firms,” Osborne said. “It’s not fair to the British people, either. Today we’re putting a stop to it.”
The proposal, revealed Wednesday, would raise about $1.6 billion over the next five years in extra UK tax revenue, the policymaker said. Experts are calling the plan the Google Tax as other member states including France and Germany have proposed similar tax rules aimed at curbing Google’s tax breaks, enjoyed by the company despite large operations in those nations.
Google declined to comment on Wednesday’s announcement, but Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt had previously commented on similar proposals, decrying the plan as one that would lead to “less innovation, less growth and less job creation.”

135,"December 3, 2014",US: Google’s antitrust woes could return back home,"
Google has seen a tsunami of antitrust conflict in recent years. In the past few months alone the company has faced significant problems in the EU – just days ago the European Parliament voted to call on the European Commission to force Google to unbundle its search services from other products. Soon after, reports emerged that the company could face an entirely new competition probe over the company’s practice of having Android-operating phones come pre-loaded with Google products like Google Maps and Chrome. And that’s on top of the four-year-long competition investigation that continues with the Commission.
Back home in the US, however, things have quieted down since federal officials wrapped up their investigation into Google’s search practices without fines or significant sanctions.
That all may be about to change, however.
Reports have revealed that the Federal Trade Commission is probing complaints made by advertisers that Google is pressuring them to use Google’s ad-buying software DoubleClick Ad Exchange over competing products.
The ad display platform was acquired by Google in 2007 for $3.1 billion and allows advertisers to find openings for ad space offered by web publishers.
The company was soon expanded with Google’s acquisition of Invite Media’s ad management software for $81 million in 2009
Now, some advertisers say Google is pressuring them to use that software over others when they have open ad space.
Google has denied the allegations, and similar claims against the company have not convinced the FTC to take action.
While federal officials have highlighted the potential anticompetitive effects of such product tying, the agency has not brought a similar tying case against a corporation since 1994, according to antitrust expert David Balto.

137,"November 30, 2014",EU: Why Google rivals shouldn’t rejoice over Parliament vote,"
Rivals of Internet giant Google shouldn’t be too quick to celebrate the European Parliament’s vote last week to call for a breakup of the company. As EU politicians step up pressure against Google, reports say a widespread crackdown on all tech giants is looming over the industry.
A joint letter by France and Germany was sent to the Commission last Thursday, say reports, calling for a reform of antitrust law to more adequately reign in the dominance of tech companies.
”We need a review of our antitrust law because the classical antitrust law is no longer adequate for what is taking place in society by virtue of digitalization,” Germany’s deputy economy minister Mathias Machnig said during a press conference in Brussels.
Germany and France’s letter was sent the same day EU Parliament voted to call on the Commission to unbundle tech giants’ search services from the rest of their operations. While the motion did not name Google specifically, it is widely considered a push to crack down on Google as the Commission continues its four-year investigation into the company’s market dominance and alleged anticompetitive conduct.
MEPs overwhelmingly voted in favor of the motion.
The vote not only highlights the urgency lawmakers may feel to limit Google’s market dominance, but also the mounting pressure faced by all technology conglomerates.

Members of the European Parliament voted Thursday to call on the European Commission to force an unbundling of Google operations to lessen the company’s market dominance, but reports say a materialization of such a plan is unlikely.
Parliament voted 384-174 in favor of calling on the Commission to consider “unbundling search engines from other commercial services.” While the motion did not mention Google by name, it is widely accepted that the effort aims to crack down on the US conglomerate as it continues with a four-year investigation for alleged anticompetitive practices in the way it displays search results.
Google holds more than 90 percent of the online search market in several EU member states, say reports.
The vote sends a powerful message about the reputation Google has in the EU, but experts note that it is unlikely the Commission will act on Parliament’s vote. EU digital economy commissioner Guenther Oettinger said a Google breakup is not “what we can expect” in response to Thursday’s vote.

As backlash and debate continue to grow following reports that the European Parliament is set to vote on whether it should call for a breakup of Google to reign in its dominance, reports say the US is warning against such action against the technology company.
Reports say the US Mission to the European Union sent an email that highlighted its “concern” for the MEPs proposed motion that, if approved, would have Parliament call on competition authorities to exercise their power to force an unbundling of Google’s search operations from the rest of the company.
”It is important that the process of identifying competitive harms and potential remedies be based on objective and impartial findings and not be politicized,” the email said.
The authors of the motion presented to MEPs – Germany’s Andreas Schwab and Spain’s Ramon Tremosa – were quick to downplay reports, assuring that a Google breakup is just one of several possible proposals. The EU is in the midst of a four-year investigation into Google for alleged anticompetitive behavior in how it displays its search results. The case is currently being handled by the Commission’s new competition chief Margrethe Vestager.

140,"November 25, 2014",EU: Lawmakers rush to downplay Google breakup plans,"
The technology industry was shaken up last week as reports emerged that Members of the European Parliament are preparing a vote – perhaps this week – on whether to call for a breakup of Google to reign in its market dominance. But since the news first broke, the authors of the draft proposal are downplaying calls for such drastic measures.
According to reports, lawmakers spoke out Monday to emphasize that their proposal will merely suggest a Google breakup among one of several options.
Germany’s Andreas Schwab and Spain’s Ramon Tremosa issued a joint statement this week stating: “Tremosa and Schqab are not ideological against Google! We are against monopolies.”
Parliament is said to be gearing up to vote on the draft resolution that calls for the unbundling of Google’s search services from the rest of its businesses. But lawmakers are urging calm amid the outcry since those proposals were first made public.
The European Commission’s commissioner in charge of digital markets also urged calm amid the breakup reports.
The Commission’s Vice President Andrus Ansip told reporters Monday that investigations into Google must not be hasty. When commenting on the matter, Ansip declined to single out Google directly, but stated that some technology companies in general may be abusing their market powers.
”We have some doubts about misuse of gatekeeper positions and also leading positions in the market,” he said. “I’m not ready to say that they [the technology companies] will have to be broken up, talking about vertically integrated structures. We have to investigate very carefully where these problems are … and then find possible solutions.”
Ansip added that those solutions will only be implemented after a public debate on the matter.

141,"November 23, 2014",EU: MEPs aim to tear Google apart,"
Google’s antitrust saga in Europe could reach a new, dramatic climax next week as Parliament reportedly readies to propose a breakup of the company.
The Financial Times reportedly obtained a copy of a draft motion to separate Google’s search operations from the rest of its businesses, calling for the “unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services” to reign in the company’s dominance.
It would be a drastic measure to solve a years-long investigation into Google’s search practices as companies accuse Google of abusing its market dominance by, among other allegations, displaying its own services in search results ahead of rivals’. The case, taken up by former European Commission competition chief Joaquin Almunia, gained significant controversy earlier this year when Almunia seemed poised to accept Google’s third round of concessions to settle the deal as consumer advocates and competitors decried the deal as insufficient.
Now, new competition chief Margrethe Vestager has inherited the case.
She has also inherited the complexities of the investigation, which has seen EU member states including Germany and France calling for a Google breakup and EU lawmakers debating about how the case should end.
Since taking her position, Vestager has said she would like to receive more input from interested parties in the case and would not rush towards a resolution.
Now, reports say Parliament is set to approve of the draft motion to vote on whether Google should break off its search operations from the rest of the company. Parliament, however, does not have the authority to force such a breakup, and reports note that calls for such action would face stiff opposition from many sides of the debate.

142,"November 19, 2014",EU: Tech law may take down Google if antitrust can’t,"
As Google continues to fight against possible sanctions from the European Commission’s competition arm, reports say lawmakers are calling on technology rules to take on Google if antitrust law doesn’t do the trick.
Some members of the European Parliament released a statement that if antitrust laws cannot sufficiently reign in Google’s dominance, “regulation of the dominant online Web search should be envisaged,” and the EU should draft legislation to do so.
Andreas Schwab, a German member of Parliament, told reporters Wednesday that the Google search engine is a “critical infrastructure” that should offer a level playing field to all businesses, according to reports. But Schwab added that he would prefer the European Commission to resolve dominance issues with its ongoing probe into the way Google displays its search results.
Schwab, along with Spain’s Ramon Tremosa, are urging the Commission’s antitrust arm to order Google to display rival search results through a “rotation mechanism,” allowing searchers greater choice.
But if the Commission cannot do so, lawmakers must take action, they said. And if the European Union does not consider draft legislation, European Commissioner Andrus Ansip, who oversees technology and digital issues, should consider another investigation into Google to promote a level playing field for companies.
Calls for new legislation to curb Google’s dominance come soon after competition chief Margrethe Vestager said that she would focus solely on competition matters in the ongoing Google case, and that it is not her jurisdiction to investigate other matters, like that of privacy, that concern Google rivals and consumer advocates.

143,"November 19, 2014",US: Freedom of speech saves Google from antitrust suit,"
An antitrust lawsuit challenging Google’s search results was tossed late last week as a ruled that those results are protected by the First Amendment.
Reports say a San Francisco dismissed the claims against Google filed by tourism website CoastNews. The site, which launched the legal attack in June, argued that Google violated antitrust laws by not ranking CoastNews as high in its search results as Yahoo and Bing did.
The company sought $5 million in damages.
But California Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith ruled that Google’s search results are protected by the First Amendment and are considered free speech.
According to reports, the case is likely to discourage future lawsuits challenging low search result placements by Google.
But across the Atlantic, cases could meet a different fate. As Google continues to fight possible sanctions by the European Commission for allegedly unfair methods of displaying search results, experts note that because the EU does not have the equivalent to the US First Amendment right, similar lawsuits may prove more successful in Europe.

144,"November 11, 2014",EU: Vestager takes her time on Google,"
The European Commission’s new competition chief Margrethe Vestager said she needs more time to resolve the four-year-long investigation into Google’s practices.
Reports say Vestager spoke Tuesday and said she would like to hear more comments from Google rivals and concerned parties before she makes the next step in the investigation. Vestager inherited the case from her predecessor Joaquin Almunia, who failed to resolve the issue despite pressing for a settlement earlier this year.
”To decide how to take our investigations forward, I need to know what those most directly affected by the practices in question have to say,” Vestager said of the current status of the case. “I need to have a representative sample of views of those concerned.”
She added that the dispute is “multifaceted and complex.”
The Commissioner additionally noted that despite calls for the Commission to protect consumer privacy through concessions, the regulator will focus only on competition issues.

145,"October 23, 2014",Germany: Publishers bow to Google’s market dominance,"
As Germany’s antitrust authority investigates the market power of Google, reports say publishers are – for the time being – bowing down to the corporation’s strength and allowing the technology firm to publish news snippets for free.
Reports say the publishers had been fighting for compensation from Google for publishing these snippets. But Google recently decided to stop using these snippets from some major news sites in the nation to avoid legal risks.
Now, however, the publishers, represented by copyright body VG Media, said they are being forced to offer Google their “revocable” right to publish their content in search results due to Google’s “overwhelming market power.”
VG Media accuses Google of violating its market power by denying compensation for publishing those snippets, which the publishers say are necessary for traffic.
Germany’s Bundeskartellamt is investigating allegations of market dominance abuse by Google. According to reports, the company controls about 90 percent of Germany’s online search market.

146,"October 16, 2014",India: Google challenges CCI’s jurisdiction over AdWords dispute,"
Google has reportedly appealed a decision by the Competition Commission of India to launch an investigation into the company’s decision to terminate a company’s AdWords account.
According to reports, Google filed an appeal to the Delhi High Court questioning the CCI’s jurisdiction over the matter. Audney.com had filed a complaint with the CCI after Google terminated its account for advertising program AdWords. Google argues that the CCI cannot get involved as the dispute only pertains to the US-based incorporated company Audney, Inc., and to advertisements shown only on Google.com and Google.ca.
The CCI had also fined Google in the dispute, but reports say Google has not appealed that decision. But media accounts clarify that the company did, in fact, appeal a separate fine issued to the tech conglomerate for abusing its market power in the online search and advertising industry following several complaints issued in 2009 and 2012.

147,"October 16, 2014",EU: Almunia slams ‘irrational’ political pressure on Google case,"
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia defended his work at the regulator and his investigation into allegations of anticompetitive conduct by Google, responding to criticism aimed at Almunia for his handling of the case.
Reports say Almunia slammed EU politicians’’ response to the Google investigation as “defensive” and “irrational,” leading the regulator to reopen the matter for a fourth time – an unprecedented action, he said.
Almunia faced significant backlash from politicians, Google rivals and consumer advocates for his plans to approve of Google’s third round of concessions earlier this year. That political pressure, he says, caused him to reject that deal for a fourth time.
”I don’t remember any case … that triggered … this kind of reaction, even of [a] smaller size,” Almunia said. “I don’t think antitrust investigations should be part of the conventional political debates.”
Almunia was speaking Tuesday at the Commission’s headquarters, say reports. The watchdog added that the response to the case likely reflects Europe’s growing fears that EU technology firms have fallen behind US rivals.
Almunia is set to leave his position at the end of the month, when his successor, Margrethe Vestager, will inherit the ongoing cases, including the investigation into Google.

149,"October 12, 2014",EU: Google lets rivals sell software to curb pro-Google search results,"
The consortium of Google rivals, known as Focus on the User, which continues to champion against the search giant as the European Commission ponders the fate of its investigation into the company, has just released software that uses Google’s Chrome browser to curb Google-promoted search results.
According to reports, Focus on the User, made up of companies including Yelp and TripAdvisor, have just released the software, which works on Google’s browser, that uses Google’s algorithms to ensure more third-party competitors are included in top Google search results.
Of particular interest, say reports, is the fact that the software is available for download from Google’s Chrome store – something that could not happen unless Google approves of it.
In other words, Google could be helping its rivals make their case against the company.
Focus on the User has repeatedly appealed to the European Commission to impose stricter concessions on Google before it closes its investigation into the company. Google has been under probe for several years following allegations the company unfairly promotes its own services in its search results.
The Commission’s competition chief Joaquin Almunia recently revealed that the authorities will not accept Google’s latest settlement offer, a turnaround from Almunia’s earlier decision to accept the deal and close the case. Almunia’s predecessor, Margrethe Vestager, will now inherit the case when she comes into office November 1.

Yelp and TripAdvisor are reportedly launching a new front against Google’s dominance in the EU as the European Commission continues its investigation into claims that the leader of Internet searches is abusing its market position.
According to reports, the two US companies are launching the “Focus on the user” campaign Tuesday to highlight how Google links to its own services in its search results.

Google has made a rare public statement defending its business practices following reports that the European Commission would demand more concessions from the company to end an antitrust probe, say reports.
Rachel Whetstone, a Google spokesperson, wrote a blog post this week addressing News Corp’s recent complaint filed to the EU against Google. News Corp accused the search giant of being “willing to exploit its dominant market position to stifle competition.”
But in the blog post, addressed to Rupert – in reference to News Corp controller Rupert Murdoch – Google said it is “not the gatekeeper to the web, as some claim,” adding that companies like Amazon, Yelp, Kayak and TripAdvisor all provide significant competition against Google’s search services. Further, Whetstone wrote, those companies see growing profits thanks to Google’s search traffic to the sites.
The Commission’s competition chief recently announced that he would order further concessions from Google, backtracking from earlier agreements to accept a settlement from the company. The case will now continue and be handed down to Almunia’s successor, Margrethe Vestager. Google is reportedly working on a revised offer to settle the matter.

152,"September 23, 2014",EU: Commission may launch new monster of a Google probe,"
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Tuesday that Google could be facing a monumental competition investigation that would probe the company’s actions in more than just the search market.
As reports emerged that the Commission would not yet settle its years-long investigation into Google for alleged anticompetitive conduct in the way it displays rival search results, Almunia spoke Tuesday to announce that a new case could soon open following several complaints that Google is diverting Internet traffic towards its own services.
Almunia said the case could be bigger than the monster investigation against Microsoft, which lasted 10 years and lead to a $2.8 billion fine.
”We have received complaints on the possible diversion of Internet traffic towards Google services which are not search services, so this is a possible third investigation concerning Google,” the competition chief said at a European Parliament hearing.
Almunia declined to elaborate on the issues, but earlier this year he noted that complaints had been filed against Google accusing the company of leveraging its market dominance to promote Google+ and YouTube, which it owns.
The commissioner is set to leave office at the end of next month, so any new probe will be spearheaded by his successor, Margrethe Vestager.

As news emerged last week that the European Commission would not likely close its competition case into Google before European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia left his post later this year, reports say Google has responded by rethinking its concessions.
Google is said to be working on a revised offer to settle the case after ongoing criticism forced Almunia to reconsider accepting an offer. The company is under investigation for the way it displays its rivals’ search results, among other reasons.
Almunia said Friday that Google is working on a new round of settlement offers to close the case. But he added that there is still a chance the Commission will send Google a formal statement of objections if they cannot reach an agreement.
”I have now asked Google to improve the last commitments that were put forward at the end of January,” Almunia said Friday.
Reports said earlier this year that Almunia was likely looking to settle the Google case before he leaves his post at the end of October. But the latest developments confirm that his successor, Margrethe Vestager, will take over the case.
Almunia faced significant criticism for his earlier plans to accept Google’s concessions, reports said. He had attempted to quell any concerns earlier this year by hinting that Google would likely face new competition investigations in the near future.

South Korea is set to enact legislation aimed at reigning in Google’s dominance and what some consider to be monopolistic behavior, say reports.
Google currently enjoys tax exemptions in the nation, a fact that has caused legislators to consider whether domestic competitors are faced with reverse discrimination. Reports say the legislation will also address Google’s monopoly in the nation’s operating system and search market.
The bill, named The Act to Prevent a Monopoly and Reverse Discrimination, would include a measure to require Google to explain to authorities where they pay taxes and where they make sales.
Reports say the legislation would also aim to prevent “tax switching” by US firms to reduce taxes.
The legislation comes just weeks after the Ministry of Strategy and Finance would impose value-added taxes on foreign companies beginning next year, according to reports.

Defendants named in the suit include two former MySpace board members, Geoff Yang and David Carlick, as well as IAC/InterActiveCorp, which now owns Ask.com. News Corp was also named as a defendant.
News Corp ultimately acquired MySpace in 2005.
The lawsuit is filed as a class action, reports say, and Greenspan is now seeking damages for what he believes are millions lost through the sale of the company thanks to a complex series of agreements between the companies that surround the search engine contract for MySpace.

Posted by Social Science Research Network
 Does Google Hold a Dominant Market Position? – Addressing the (Minor) Significance of High Online User Shares – Christian Kersting (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf – Faculty of Law) and Sebastian Dworschak (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf – Faculty of Law)
ABSTRACT: In Germany many observers argue that Google is a dominant undertaking under the competition laws and is therefore potentially able to hinder, discriminate or exploit other market participants. This assumption is mainly based on Google’s high share of users in online searches. Closer examination, however, casts doubt on this assumption. It grossly overestimates the significance of Google’s user share and ignores many additional factors that are relevant to the assessment of Google’s market position: as users may use Google’s service free of charge, it is already questionable if there is a market for online searches for competition law purposes. Even presuming the existence of such a free market, regulatory precedent to-date has held that high shares of users in “markets” for free products or services only have little significance in the assessment of an undertaking’s market position. Furthermore, Google’s high user share in general search is only ephemeral and subject to constant change. As users can switch to a wide range of competitors in the market, such as Microsoft Bing, Yahoo! or specialized search engines like Amazon or eBay, with ease, Google is forced to re-invent itself on a daily basis in order to maintain its user share. Taking also into account the absence of direct network effects and the enormous pressure to innovate in this market, the authors finally conclude that Google is not dominant under the competition laws.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia denied allegations that his recent decision to postpone a settlement with Google was to appease lobbyists.
According to reports, media quickly pounced on the EU’s competition chief for agreeing to delay a resolution to the case, which has dragged on for years. While the decision was applauded by consumer advocates and Google rivals – which had repeatedly challenged Almunia’s earlier agreement to settle – media suggested the decision to delay a deal was simply due to political lobbying.
But speaking at a conference Friday, Almunia insisted that the decision was made to force Google to offer stronger concessions if it wishes to avoid a fine.
Further, reports say the competition chief denied having ever set a deadline to close the case before his term ends later this year.
His successor, recently announced to be former Danish economy minister Margrethe Vestager, will take the position in November and inherit a slew of complex competition cases, including the conflict with Google.

The European Commission announced over the weekend that it would attempt to “extract” further concessions from Internet search giant Google following criticism against the current settlement deal.

Almunia was reportedly steadfast on Google’s latest settlement offer despite criticism from consumer advocates, competing companies and even some fellow Commissioners; reports suggested that the Commissioner was looking to close the case before he leaves office later this year.
But the heavy criticism seems to have succeeded in delaying an offer. “Some complaints have introduced new arguments, new data, new considerations,” the watchdog chief said in the interview, adding that the Commission found some of the latest complaints “justified.”

Various print and online publishers throughout the EU are calling on the European Commission to reject Google’s settlement proposal that would end a longstanding dispute over the way Google displays search results.
In a public letter published Thursday, the group of publishers argued that “accepting these commitments would inflict additional harm to competition, innovation and consumer choice as they are based on an ineffective and harmful concept. They will secure Google dominance in any market it whishes to enter and legalize its anticompetitive conduct.”

The questionnaire this time around includes a prompt asking companies if there was a formal or informal agreement made with Google to pre-load smartphones with certain apps, or to not pre-load competing apps.
Respondents, which have until September to file their answers, have also been asked to provide documents including letters, faxes, and notes from phone calls and meetings to the Commission dating as far back as 2007, reports say.

Price comparison website Foundem has reportedly published an open letter to the European Commission asking the regulator to review its complaint against Google as reports suggest that authorities will be taking another look at a proposed settlement with the search conglomerate.
According to reports, Foundem asked European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia to take another look at a July 11 letter the company sent to the Commission that criticizes the Commission’s decision to settle with Google after years of investigating its market dominance. In an open letter published Wednesday, Foundem highlights what it considers major errors and inconsistencies in the Commission’s reasoning for reaching a settlement with Google.
”Whatever sequence of events led you to accept Google’s misleading arguments without displaying any of the healthy skepticism that would normally be applied to ‘evidence’ from a defendant in a competition case, we trust that the attached comprehensive rebuttal of those arguments will persuade you to think again and change course,” Foundem’s letter says.
Foundem was directly responding to the Commission’s own letter sent out last month to Google complainants explaining why the Commission decided to accept proposed concessions from Google.

Despite reports that European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia was steadfast on having a proposed settlement with Google approved within the Commission, assuring critics of the deal that Google would continue to face fresh competition probes, the latest reports suggest that the Commission may require additional concessions from Google after all.
According to a source, the settlement proposal with Google – which would end a longstanding investigation against the search giant – is being considered for revision as the Commission could require new agreements from the company. The source said those revisions may involve how Google-owned YouTube content is presented in search results and how rival data are displayed.
The original settlement was approved by Almunia, though not without controversy. Google rivals, consumer advocates and even some European Commissioners had criticized the settlement as being too lenient; some even said it would make Google’s abusive tactics worse.
In recent weeks several companies filed complaints with the Commission against the proposed settlement deal. Most recently, online review service Yelp filed its own complaint against Google.
According to the anonymous source, the Commission will need to decide whether to move forward with the current settlement as it stands or amend the deal in September.
Almunia had championed the current settlement by assuring critics that Google would continue to case competition probes within the EU; Deutsche Telekom and publishers from France and Germany have filed their own complaints with EU authorities against the tech conglomerate.
Almunia was reported to be seeking closure to the case before he leaves his position as Commissioner later this year.

Ancillary Copyright for News Publishers: Would Google Really Have to Pay? – A Competition Law Analysis – Christian Kersting and Sebastian Dworschak (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf – Faculty of Law)
ABSTRACT: At the time the first paper was published, the ancillary copyright for news publishers had not yet been adopted by the German legislator. However, the conclusions drawn in both papers are still valid.
The introduction of an ancillary copyright for news publishers was intended to allow news publishers to prohibit search engines to display snippets of their content, which until then did not enjoy copyright protection. Even though the ancillary copyright for news publishers was adopted in 2013, it is uncertain whether the snippets displayed by search engines enjoy copyright protection. A well-founded opinion argues that snippets still do not enjoy copyright protection. If, however, snippets enjoyed copyright protection, search engines would need to either stop displaying such snippets or license them from the publishers. Using Google as an example, this article discusses the plausibility of a potential competition law obligation to index publishers’ content and pay publishers if snippets appear on a search results page. We conclude this is not the case: Google can avoid paying for snippets by refraining from indexing and displaying this content.

170,"July 21, 2014",EU: Germany offers surprising support for Google deal,"
While Google continues to face intense scrutiny within Germany, the latest reports say Germany’s competition authorities actually support the European Commission’s highly criticized settlement with the conglomerate.
According to reports, Germany’s Federal Cartel Office created a 42-page review of the EU settlement and found that the Commission has reached the limits of competition law in the case. According to the Office, the settlement is a “suitable approach to counter the barriers to competitors,” the report says, adding that the Commission used the full extent of antitrust law to crack down on Google as harshly as legally possible.
But as Google faces intense scrutiny by German politicians, including some calls to break up the company, the Office’s report recommends possible changes to EU competition law that would allow authorities to further address the expanding competition concerns felt by consumer advocates and Google rivals in Germany and across the EU. The Office, however, stopped short of suggesting a breakup of Google, warning that steps towards such an action would be misguided.
Germany is not alone in criticizing the EU’s handling of the Google case, which accused Google of abusing its market dominance to highlight its own products in services in search results ahead of rivals’. Most recently, online review site Yelp filed a notice with the Commission against Google; other rivals and consumer advocates have also called on European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia to alter the settlement with Google and intensify its regulation over the company.
Almunia, however, appears steadfast on proceeding with the settlement before he leaves his position at the Commission later this year. In efforts to quell concerns over the agreement, Almunia assured that Google would continue to face a slew of new complaints and competition probes.

171,"July 17, 2014",EU: Commission eyes Google Android contracts,"
The European Commission has reportedly contacted phone manufacturers to inquire about their contracts with Google-owned Android in efforts to determine whether any of those contracts may be restrictive or anticompetitive.
According to unnamed sources, the Commission has not yet opened an investigation into the matter but has sent letters to phone makers one month ago. Reports note that similar letters were sent last year, a matter that did not escalate into a full-scale competition probe.
While Almunia confirmed in June that the Commission’s investigation into Android contracts was the most advanced out of all Google probes, the latest reports shed more light on the matter. Unnamed sources said that the Commission is particularly concerned with “lockout” clauses in Google’s Mobile Application distribution Agreement. Such clauses would bar phone makers from making phones that run on software that competes with the Android OS.
Android holds a market share of about 70-80 percent across Europe, Almunia said last month.

173,"July 14, 2014",Germany: Google could be labeled a utility,"
Germany could soon label Google a utility and regulate the company as such, according to reports.
The nation’s Federal Cartel Office has reportedly drawn up a proposal to handle the growing dominance of Google and other  tech leaders and, among the draft, includes plans to label Google a utility. The classification, reports say, would allow regulators to more easily monitor service pricing.
The idea of regulating Google as a utility is not new; according to reports, talk of such regulation over Google appeared as early as July 1, though was described as an “emergency” measure to reign-in the company’s dominance.
Germany has been an outspoken opponent to Google’s dominance, which has been the subject of a lengthy investigation by the European Commission. The Commission is headed towards an official settlement with the company, but several German officials, including Minister of Justice Heiko Maas, have called for a Google breakup.
Experts say such a move is unlikely.

174,"July 10, 2014",EU: Leaked docs shed light on Yelpâ€™s Google fight,"
TechCrunch has reportedly received leaked documents that shed light on the specific grievances Yelp claims against Google, first revealed earlier this week when reports emerged that Yelp had filed an official complaint against the search conglomerate with the European Commission in efforts to prevent a settlement from moving forward.
Reports say Yelp claims Google is manipulating its search results to favor Google+ content over Yelp content. Documents reportedly show that Google favors its own products in the US but not the EU in order for Google to appease EU regulators as the Commission looks to settle and antitrust probe into the company regarding its search practices.
According to reports, sources say screen shots of Yelp’s study are being passed around within the company that demonstrate Google’s alleged anticompetitive tactics.
Reports emerged Wednesday that Yelp had filed a formal complaint with EU officials against the proposed settlement with Google that would end more than four years of an antitrust case; Yelp joins other Google rivals in fighting the closure of the case, which critics say could actually worsen Google’s unfair practices.

175,"July 9, 2014",EU: Yelp joins the anti-Google battle,"
Online review service Yelp has reportedly filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the EU, compounding troubles for the search giant as authorities ready to end a years-long case against the firm.
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has repeatedly expressed that he is looking to settle an antitrust case against Google that has so far lasted for about four years, first beginning when Google rivals complained of its anticompetitive practices when displaying search results. But those rivals continue to fight against a proposed settlement; Microsoft and the European Consumer Organization have already challenged the settlement deal.
Now, reports say, Yelp has joined in that challenge. Those displeased with the settlement offer say that the concessions, which include a paid box spot at the top of Google search results to display rivals’ products, is in a dead spot on the page, and could actually worsen Google’s anticompetitive hold against competitors.
According to an unnamed source, Yelp suggests that instead of Google’s proposal to include a box with rival search results, the company should entirely overhaul its algorithms to not favor Google-owned products when displaying results.
The European Commission’s suggested closure of the case has earned significant backlash, even within the Commission itself, reports say.
Almunia is reported to have made efforts to convince the Commissioners to approve of the settlement, and sent a letter last month arguing that this particular case should be close because Google is sure to face no shortage of additional competition probes in the future.
Almunia is set to exit his post as head of competition policy in the EU later this year.

South Korean antitrust officials announced Sunday that they have ordered conglomerates Google and Apple to alter certain terms of their mobile application stores that authorities have found to be anticompetitive.
According to reports, the Korea Fair Trade Commission is forcing changes on the Google Play and Apple iTunes app stores; among those changes includes a requirement of allowing customer refunds and notifying customers if their contractual terms have changed.

According to reports, this marks the first time South Korea has regulated international app store operators.
The move followed complaints y the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice, which requested that authorities crack down on unfair foreign mobile app terms last March.

178,"June 24, 2014",EU: Tech chief Kroes backs Google compromise,"
The head of the EU’s Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, is speaking out in support of competition chief Joaquin Almunia and his proposed settlement with Google, an offer highly criticized by consumer advocates and Google rivals for inadequately addressing the company’s market dominance.
In a letter sent by Almunia to his fellow Commissioners, which was leaked on Monday, the regulator urged the approval of the settlement with Google, which ahs been under investigation by the Commission since 2010, because additional complaints over other Google practices will likely lead to more competition crackdowns on the company.
Now, Digital Agenda Commissioner Kroes issued a statement Tuesday to support Almunia. A spokesperson for Kroes said “the longer the case remains open, the harder it is to have a wider discussion about the effects of the tech destruction on all policy and economy – the new Commission has a big job to get the digital disruption into a proper, wider frame.”
Earlier reports speculated that Almunia is looking to close the case with Google before he steps down from the position later this year; elections next year will bring a new round of authority to the European Commission.
Google was under investigation by the EU watchdog for complaints alleging the company unfairly displays links to its own services before rivals’ links. Among other concessions, Google has offered to display three competing links for every result that leads to a Google service.

179,"June 23, 2014",EU: Almunia assures more Google probes on the way,"
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has reportedly sent a letter to other EU commissioners in efforts to convince his colleagues that the controversial settlement planned with Google should be approved because further competition scrutiny awaits for the company.
The letter, revealed by an unnamed source, suggests that Google’s antitrust troubles across the pond won’t let up anytime soon, even as it is expected to wrap up a years-long competition probe with the EU regarding a dispute over how Google displays rival search results. Almunia first announced last February that a preliminary settlement had been reached.
The commissioner revealed in the letter, dated June 11, that the proposed settlement with Google would not mean the company will be let off easy in the EU. “It can be safely predicted that Google’s compliance with EU competition law will be closely monitored for a long while,” the letter reads.
While the settlement proposal can still be modified, Almunia has been steadfast on getting the agreement cleared by the Commission, a settlement that would end a case that has dragged on since 2009. But consumer advocates, Google rivals and even some Commissioners expressed skepticism against the settlement, claiming it insufficiently addresses Google’s market dominance across the EU.
But Almunia had begun the process of dismissing complaints against the settlement proposal last week, a standard process. Now, he appears to be promoting the settlement based on the fact that further competition probes await the technology firm.
More Investigations to Come?
Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke out last month to call for a more aggressive competition crackdown on Google, while some have called for the company to be broken up. Just last week a Portuguese startup filed an antitrust complaint against Google regarding its Android smartphone apps.
In the letter, Almunia reportedly pointed to the “most advanced investigation” that is ongoing against Google, besides the current matter, as the case opened following complaints surrounding the Android operating system and its promotion. Google holds up to 80 percent of the EU smartphone market, report say.
Almunia also reportedly confirmed complaints regarding Google’s YouTube dominance, and advertising operations regarding Google operations known as AdWords and AdSense.

181,"June 18, 2014",EU: Google complainants lose again,"
The European Commission has reportedly sent letters to various companies that have filed complaints against the proposed settlement between Google and competition regulators, revealing that part of the agreement is to establish an external antitrust monitor to oversee Google’s operations – a process Google itself will be a part of.
According to reports,  the Commission sent a letter to Hot Maps, based in Germany, which was one of 19 complainants against the proposed settlement; in that letter, the Commission said the company failed to show how Google’s involvement in the process of choosing the monitor would “affect the adequacy of the proposed commitments.
”The proposed commitments provide that the Commission will have the discretion to approve or reject the proposed trustee candidates that will be preselected by Google,” the letter states. “It will therefore be the Commission, and not Google, that will ultimately decide on who will be appointed as monitoring trustee.”
The letter was reportedly penned by Director General Alexander Italianer on behalf of the Commission.
The external monitor, a concept similar to the court-appointed monitor chosen to oversee Apple’s operations in the US following eBook price-fixing, will be tasked with reporting any breaches of the settlement agreement made by Google. The monitor is set to serve the position for five years.
The settlement, announced by European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia to a flurry of opposition, even from some other Commissioners. But reports say Almunia is set on the agreement and is expected to officiate the settlement later this year.

188,"May 28, 2014","Apps, Ads, and Antitrust: A Retrospective on Google’s Purchase of AdMob","
This article is part of a Chronicle. See more from this Chronicle
Justin Bernick, Logan Breed, May 28, 2014
Google announced its acquisition of AdMob in November 2009 when the “mobile revolution” had just begun. Since then mobile device use has exploded. One in five people worldwide now own a smartphone, and more people worldwide now own a smartphone than a personal computer. The number of software applications developed for mobile devices has also skyrocketed, increasing from about 100,000 in 2009 to about one million today in the Apple App Store alone. Over 50 billion apps have been downloaded from the Apple App Store, and another 50 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play.
App developers “monetize” their apps in many ways, one of which is advertising. AdMob was one of several startup mobile advertising networks. After Google announced its acquisition of AdMob, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation to assess whether the transaction would eliminate competition between the companies, resulting in too much market concentration. But the mobile industry shifted even as the FTC’s investigation was pending. In January 2010 Apple announced its $275 million acquisition of Quattro Wireless, another startup in-app advertising network that Apple subsequently rebranded iAd. The FTC closed its investigation in May 2010, noting that Apple’s entry and other developments made AdMob’s historical success an “[in]accurate predictor of AdMob’s competitive significance going forward.” Google and AdMob then closed the acquisition.
This article explains why the FTC made the right decision. Pre-merger review under Section 7 of the Clayton Act is inherently prospective, requiring the FTC to predict whether an acquisition “may” reduce competition. However, it can be difficult to predict the effects of acquisitions in industries characterized by rapid change and innovation. That is perhaps more true of mobile advertising than any other industry, and the FTC’s regulatory restraint in the AdMob transaction was clearly justified in light of the rapid innovation and fierce competition that has occurred in the ensuing years.
Disruptive new competitors and new technologies have changed the way advertisers and publishers approach mobile advertising-and monetizing mobile content more generally-since 2009. Moreover, large publishers like Facebook have bypassed entirely, and now dwarf, their ad network competitors. Finally, while iAd may not have been exactly what the FTC predicted, competition between AdMob and iAd-and between the iPhone and Android platforms-is robust.
The FTC was correct that predicting AdMob’s future competitive significance in 2010 was nearly impossible. But even more importantly, subsequent industry developments discussed below show that the acquisition did not reduce competition or stifle innovation.

190,"May 21, 2014",EU: Germany calls for Google breakup show limits of competition law,"
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia responded to remarks made only days ago by Germany Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who argued that a forced breakup of Google should be “seriously considered” due to its overwhelming market power.
Such a breakup could not be imposed upon the company because competition law is not powerful enough, Almunia said, noting that the legislation would need a complete overhaul to impose such action of the search giant.
Germany’s competition authority released a statement Wednesday in support of Gabriel’s remarks, arguing he “captured exactly” what competition head Andreas Mundt believes regarding the market power of Google.
”We have nothing against a company using it strength in search to expand into other business areas,” he said. “But if there is an undue concentration of market share of an abuse of market dominance, the new rules for agencies like outs are called for if we are to do anything about it.”
Almunia’s comments in response to Gabriel were made earlier this week when he also discussed a recent complaint filed with the Commission by the Open Internet Project, which represents hundreds of European companies, against Google.
Deutsche Telekom has also sent a letter to the Commission criticizing Almunia’s settlement with Google. The Commissioner noted that the authority is now examining whether the letter should be considered a formal complaint and, if so, whether to open a formal investigation into the matter.
Almunia has held strong to the settlement agreement reached with Google after years of investigating claims of Google’s abuse of dominance in the online search market. While he said earlier this week that he would closely examine these criticisms and has not ruled out another look at the settlement, reports say regulators are set on closing the matter by the end of the summer.

Just days after European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia remarked that he was “pretty sure” about his settlement with Google, reports say the competition chief could be reconsidering the case.
Google and Almunia reached a tentative settlement last February to the criticism of Google rivals, consumer advocates, and even other European Commissioners. Regulators had been investigating Google for several years regarding allegations the company abused its market dominance in the way it displays rivals’ links and other matters.
The February deal reportedly included an agreement that Google would alter the way it displays those links. The company was facing fines as high as $5 billion.
Critics said the deal was insufficient at addressing competition concerns, but Almunia seemed steadfast at preserving the settlement and ending the case, likely looking to close the matter before his term at the Commission ends later this year.
Now, however, Almunia has reportedly said he may take a closer look at the settlement and possible take a tougher stance against the company, though reports say it was uncertain whether he would actually reconsider the settlement deal.
The Commissioner indicated that he would still like to settle with Google, reports say, though continues to face increasing skepticism over the deal as German and French officials vocalize their opposition to the company’s market dominance, which is as high as 90 percent of the online search market in some jurisdictions.
But Almunia did recognize the criticism Tuesday, telling reporters that “if, because of the arguments of the complaints, we consider that the proposals that we have on the table are not enough, we will need to decide on the next steps.”
He added that he would decide after the summer break whether to send formal charges to Google.

Leveraging Market Power Through Tying and Bundling: Does Google Behave Anti-Competitively? – Benjamin G. Edelman (Harvard University – HBS Negotiations, Organizations and Markets Unit)
ABSTRACT: I examine Google’s pattern and practice of tying and bundling to leverage its dominance into new sectors under antitrust law principles. In particular, I show how Google used these tactics to enter numerous markets, to compel usage of its services, and often to dominate competing offerings. I explore the technical and commercial implementations of these practices, and I identify their effects on competition. I conclude that Google’s tying and bundling tactics are suspect under antitrust law.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia was on the defense this week following a new wave of criticism over his decision to settle with Google, which ahd been probed for years by the Commission for allegations of abuse of dominance.
According to reports, Almunia said the case will be concluded in the “weeks after the summer break” and that, despite skepticism over the action taken to prevent Google from abusing its market position, “I’m pretty sure of my arguments,” he said.
The investigation was first launched in 2010 over claims Google unfairly prioritized its own services and advertisements in search results. A similar case was also settled in the US without any fines issued upon Google.
Almunia announced a settlement with Google last February and immediately was hit with criticism from top Google rivals like Microsoft. Even other European Commissioners voiced concern that he had announced plans to settle without first consulting with the rest of the regulatory body; the Commissioners also need to agree to settle before the deal becomes official.
Earlier this week, reports from France emerged that said various media companies throughout Europe plan to file a lawsuit against Google because they also found Almunia’s settlement deal to in insufficient at addressing Google’s market power.
The Commission confirmed Thursday that the companies that reportedly threatened a lawsuit, all part of the Open Internet Project, have filed a formal complaint against Google with the Commission.

Two years since the Competition Commission of India first launched an investigation into Google, the regulator ordered yet another probe into the US Internet search conglomerate Tuesday, according to reports.
Google’s advertisement service AdWords has been under the CCI’s radar since 2012, but time a new investigation has been launched following a complaint filed over allegations Google blocked a company’s advertisements from appearing in search results because the company was a competitor of a Google business.
Reports say the complaint was filed by Vishal Gupta, who owns a tech support company. In his complaint the business owner says he paid $310,000 for the advertisements, which were subsequently blocked by Google under the search giant’s “user safety policy.”
That policy is vague and aids Google to abuse its market dominance, the filing said. Gupta suggests Google blocked ads for his tech support service because his company competes with Google Helpouts, a similar operation owned by Google.

197,"May 8, 2014","US: Facebook, Google lead opposition against net neutrality proposals","
More than 100 companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, have reportedly sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission warning the regulator against its proposed rules regarding net neutrality, to be revealed next week.
After earlier proposals to protect the open Internet were struck down, the FCC is reportedly planning on a watered-down version of net neutrality that critics say will allow the largest companies to pay Internet service providers for priority streaming of their content, creating a two-tier system that works against smaller content providers.
Now, some of the largest companies have joined the opposition, warning the FCC of “grave consequences” should its reported rules come into effect.
The letter, addressed to FCC head Tom Wheeler, was also signed by eBay, LinkedIn and other conglomerates that warned the rules would “enable phone and cable Internet service providers to discriminate both technically and financially against the Internet companies and impose new tolls on the them,” the letter said.
The FCC is not expected to reveal its revised net neutrality proposals until next week, but its reported plans were leaked weeks ago.

198,"May 5, 2014",US/EU: Is Google+ headed for an antitrust probe?,"
As reports continue to track the plummeting popularity of search giant Google’s attempt at social networking, Google+, some experts are questioning whether the network is headed for an antitrust investigation.
The speculation follows just days after Google social media vice president Vic Gundotra announced he plans to leave the firm amid criticism of Google+.
While the social network has attracted 540 million users, according to reports, that figure does not reflect the network’s popularity because anyone who uses Google’s email service, Gmail, are all but forced to sign up for Google+. Further, reports say, a decision was made last year that bars anyone without a Google+ account to post a comment on Google-owned YouTube.
What’s more, Google bars any add-ons for the social network that are not officially sanctioned, a move reports say harms innovation. Add-ons that are accepted are most often connected to other Google products.
These features not only made Google+ user-unfriendly, but reports say the network could risk antitrust probes both in the US and EU thanks to lock-ins of Google products with the network and concerns over user privacy. No investigations have been launched, however.

199,"May 4, 2014",US: Latest antitrust attack on Google slams pre-loaded Android apps,"
Antitrust problems for Google only seems to keep getting bigger.
Reports emerged late last week that a new class action lawsuit has been filed in the US against the conglomerate on allegations the firm “illegally monopolized” the mobile search market by pre-loading certain apps on its Android smartphones.
Applications including the YouTube and Google Play apps that automatically come on Android phones are accused of allowing Google to hamper competition by forcing phone manufacturers, including Samsung and HTC, to include certain apps on prime smartphone screen real estate.
”It’s clear that Google has not achieved this monopoly though offering a better search engine,” an attorney representing the class said, “but through its strategic, anticompetitive placement, and it doesn’t’ take a forensic economist to see that this is evidence of market manipulation.”
The suit claims Google forced smartphone makers to sign Mobile Application Distribution Agreements in secret to maintain its search engine monopoly; it has lead to an 87 percent market share for the company, the filing claims.
Consumer rights firm Hagens Berman filed the lawsuit.

200,"April 29, 2014",Dominating Search: Google Before the Law,"
Posted by Social Science Research Network
Dominating Search: Google Before the Law – Angela Daly (European University Institute – Department of Law (LAW) ; Swinburne University of Technology)
ABSTRACT: For many, particularly in the Anglophone world and Western Europe, it may be obvious that Google has a monopoly over online search and advertising and that this is an undesirable state of affairs, due to Google’s ability to mediate information flows online. The baffling question may be why governments and regulators are doing little to nothing about this situation, given the increasingly pivotal importance of the internet and free flowing communications in our lives. However, the law concerning monopolies, namely antitrust or competition law, works in what may be seen as a less intuitive way by the general public. Monopolies themselves are not illegal. Conduct that is unlawful, i.e. abuses of that market power, is defined by a complex set of rules and revolves principally around economic harm suffered due to anticompetitive behavior. However the effect of information monopolies over search, such as Google’s, is more than just economic, yet competition law does not address this. Furthermore, Google’s collection and analysis of user data and its portfolio of related services make it difficult for others to compete. Such a situation may also explain why Google’s established search rivals, Bing and Yahoo, have not managed to provide services that are as effective or popular as Google’s own (on this issue see also the texts by Dirk Lewandowski and Astrid Mager in this reader). Users, however, are not entirely powerless. Google’s business model rests, at least partially, on them – especially the data collected about them. If they stop using Google, then Google is nothing.

201,"April 20, 2014",EU: YouTube rival blasts EC inaction to reign in Google,"
One rival of Google-owned YouTube in Europe is slamming the search engine for alleged anticompetitive behavior, calling on the European Commission to finally crack down on Google’s dominance to level the playing field with smaller competitors.
According to reports, YouTube competitor Dailymotion claims that users searching for videos through Google may not see Dailymotion videos in the search results, but alternative video streams hosted by YouTube will appear. Google denies the allegations, but according to Dailymotion head Giuseppe de Martino, “Europe should be aware that the US is ruling the digital world and Europe should react.
De Martino reportedly slammed the Commission for its inaction against Google despite an eight year probe into the company, one that appears to be headed for a settlement – an ending many competitors are unhappy with.
”Nothing has been done for companies like us who are challenging Google’s subsidiaries,” de Martino said.
Dailymotion first launched in 2005 and is owned by telco Orange.

The head of Europe’s largest newspaper publisher, Axel Springer, has sent a letter to Google’s Eric Schmidt, published in Germany Wednesday, slamming the company as a monopoly looking to abuse its dominance to become a “superstate.”
Reports say Axel Springer chief executive Mathias Doepfner accused Google of discriminating against rivals in its search rankings and operating a business model that “in less reputable circles would be called a protection racket.”
He also said Google’s mottle is “if you don’t want us to finish you off, you better pay.”
The executive questioned the future of the European Commission’s case with Google after probing the company for allegations of anticompetitive behavior yet seemingly set on settling with the firm.
”Will European politicians fold or wake up?” Doepfner asked. “Institutions in Brussels have never been as important as they are now.”

A planned complaint to be filed to the European Commission against Google by a Czech website owner is set to add to the EU’s ongoing case with Google, months after European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia agreed to settle with the company, suggesting regulators were on path to close the case.
Reports say Allegro group, which operates websites in the e-commerce industry, is set to issue a complaint to the Commission and says that other large Internet companies in the nation will also join the complaint.
News of the anticipated complaint follows Google’s plans to launch a price comparison site in the country; several of the websites owned by Allegro are price comparison companies.
Google has been under watch at the Commission for allegations of dominance abuse in the way it displays rival search results. According to Allegro, 90 percent of its users access price comparison website through search engines.
Allegro could soon be joined by the Czech Internet Advertising Association and the Electronic Commerce Association, say reports.

204,"April 3, 2014",US: Google enters unlikely braces patent case,"
Google and the Motion Picture Association of America are reportedly using a current patent infringement lawsuit regarding invisible teeth straightening technology to argue their own sides as to whether the International Trade Commission should have the power to block imports of virtual products found to have infringed on patents in the US, just as they can block physical product imports.
According to reports, both Google and the film group have filed comments to the ITC on the ongoing braces lawsuit, in which Align Technology argues that rival ClearCorrect Operations is infringing on its patents. Align Technology, which makes Invisalign, wants the ITC to block ClearCorrect from transmitting computerized dental plans from Pakistan into a 3-D printer in the US on grounds it violates Align’s intellectual property, reports say.
A judge last year found that ClearCorrect was in violation of six of Align’s patents, reports say, but the ITC has yet to issue a ruling on whether to block the dental plan transmissions as they represent a virtual product, not a physical one.
The stakes have been raised in the invisible braces case now that Google and the film group have gotten involved.
The MPAA argues that virtual products should be included in the law, hoping to curb movie and music bootleggers that have moved to digital copies of products instead of physical ones.
But Google argues that the law should remain as-is, and that the law that gives the ability to block patent-infringing product imports did not include digital products even when the legislation was revised in the 1980s.
The rivaling groups have now weighed-in with their opinions in the teeth straightening case, which already has major implications for Align, as 93 percent of its revenue last year depended on that Invisalign product.

205,"March 31, 2014",EU: Not so fast â€“ Almunia may not close Google case before term ends,"
While European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has considered the longstanding case against Google as a closed matter ahead of the end of his term later this year, reports say the antitrust case may be far from over as a major consumer group has applied to be an official complainant against the search giant.
According to reports, the European Consumer Organizations, known as BEUC, is looking to prevent Almunia’s settlement with Google from becoming an official end to the case. BEUC, already an official observer of the case, released a statement Monday arguing that “adequate answers have not been found to the problem of Google stacking its search results against itself.”
BEUC’s announcement throws a wrench in Almunia’s plans of concluding the case before his term ends as the Commission may now have to review the complaint filed by the consumer group. Additional reports say the Commission declined to comment on whether the new complaint will delay the settlement.
Almunia’s decision to settle with Google, under investigation for allegations of anticompetitive practices in how it displays rival search results and advertisements, was met with heavy backlash by Google rivals, consumer groups and even Commissioners who claimed the agreement would be insufficient to tackle concerns over the company’s business practices.

A federal judge on Friday reportedly rejected Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe’s request to avoid a trial in a major class action filed against the firms that alleges the companies colluded to not hire each others’ employees to keep wages down.
The companies sought a judgment of the lawsuit to avoid a trial as thousands of Silicon Valley employees claim the firms made non-poaching agreements in violation of antitrust law. In her rejection of the companies’ request, US District Judge Lucy Koh wrote, “that the agreements were entered into and enforced by a small group of intertwining high level executives bolsters the inference that the agreements were not independent,” suggesting possible illegal collusion between the competing companies.
The lawsuit first began when five software engineers sued various tech companies over the allegations. Among the defendants were Pixar, Lucasfilm and Intuit, which decided to settle for millions.
Judge Koh’s ruling follows recent reports that Google is close to reaching a settlement with the plaintiffs.

As Indian officials continue to probe Google over allegations the company abuses its dominant position in the online search market, the Competition Commission of India has slapped a fine of $165,810 onto the company for its lack of cooperation in the case, say reports.
Google said it was “disappointed” by the sanction and plans to review the decision; a spokesperson for the firm said the company continues “to cooperate fully with the Competition Commission of India’s extensive and ongoing investigation.”
The CCI has been probing Google for abuse of dominance complaints since 2012 regarding its advertising services AdWords. Similar investigations in the US and EU controversially ended with settlements, an outcome experts say cannot happen in India as law does not allow Google to settle such a matter.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia continued to defend his decision to settle with Google and end a three-year investigation into the company’s search practices as he shot down critics’ claims about the settlement at the European Parliament’s economic affairs committee.
According to reports, Almunia promised that Google will not profit from the agreement made with the Commission. “I do not agree with those saying that Google will earn more” from the settlement, he told MEPs.
Among the offered concessions by the US search giant includes space to promote rivals’ search results, in addition to its own promoted content. But critics argue that that space for competitors is simply another revenue source for the company.
One study found that Google would make $330 million more a year from just the hotel and flight industries with the new promotional spots, say reports.
But Almunia has downplayed criticism despite backlash. His decision to settle with Google has sparked a fury of backlash in recent weeks as some say the sanctions do not go far enough to reign-in Google’s market dominance.

Following China’s e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba’s IPO, reports say some analysts are eying how rivals will respond to the changing market landscape, with one industry expert suggesting that Google and eBay, which are both facing their own challenges, should merge.
Reports say Baird Equity Research’s Colin Sebastian suggested this week that Google should acquire eBay as Google struggles in the e-commerce realm and while eBay is faced with pressure to spin off its PayPal unit. A merger, Sebastian said, could be the only way for the two to compete with Alibaba.
Citing Google’s struggling Google Wallet mobile payments operations, the analyst said that “acquiring eBay/PayPal would be one way for Google to secure quickly a strong leadership position in commerce and payments, and likewise, could represent a better strategic option than alternatives proposed for eBay.”
Alibaba announced Sunday it would launch an IPO in the US; Google rival Yahoo owns 24 percent of Alibaba, according to reports, and will likely profit from the offering.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia shot down hopes of Google rivals and consumer advocates Tuesday when he told a committee the Commission is unlikely to revisit Almunia’s decision to settle with the search giant, ending a three-year investigation into the company.
While “the case is still open,” Almunia confirmed, the competition chief spoke at a European Parliament committee to counter criticism to the settlement. The Commission is preparing letters to send to Google complainants, according to reports.
Critics of the settlement claim the deal will actually worsen the business practices that brought Google under fire in the first place. The company is accused of abusing its market dominance in how it displays rivals’ search results. Google has offered to alter how those results are displayed, among other concessions.
Almunia said that there is “no doubt” that the case will conclude by the time he leaves the Commission in October.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia was on the defensive to MEPs this week as he justified his decision to settle with Google after a three-year investigation into the company’s search practices, say reports.
Almunia does not appear to be backing down from the settlement, despite receiving heavy criticism from fellow Commissioners, consumer groups and Google rivals over the deal.
Seven months after Almunia signaled an end to the case, reports say the competition watchdog has sent a note to MEPs that told lawmakers “Google has made far-reaching concessions as to the presentation of rivals on its page.”
Reports also say that the Commission is set to send pre-rejection letters to companies that filed complaints against Google with authorities; 18 companies filed such complaints, including Microsoft.
Google has been under watch by EU regulators and competition watchdogs throughout the globe for the way the company displays rivals’ search results, among other practices, with concern raised over allegations the company is abusing its dominant online search market position. A similar case also lead to a settlement between US authorities and Google; the company is now under scrutiny from the Competition Commission of India and is facing a fine of up to $5 billion as reports note that Google does not have the option to settle under Indian law in this case.

Even as European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has approved of Google’s concessions to end a three-year-long competition investigation, reports say Google still faces a slew of other antitrust concerns from the Commission.
European Commissioners have voiced opposition and skepticism over Almunia’s decision to accept Google’s third offer, after the previous two were rejected following market tests. The concessions look to appease competition concerns over the way Google displays rivals’ search results.
As that case drags on in its final stages, Google also has another competition case on its hands stemming from Motorola Mobility, a former Google subsidiary.
Reports say Motorola Mobility as been under watch by the Commission since April 2012 for its patents, many of which Google still owns. Motorola is accused of anti-competitively suing rival Apple over patent infringement for essential mobile technology.
Almunia said a decision in the case will be made in the next month or two.
What’s more, Google faces the threat of yet another investigation into its Android mobile system, the market dominator in the EU.
Rivals have reportedly filed complaints with the Commission accusing Google of abusing its dominant position by imposing anticompetitive business practices on smartphone manufacturers to pin them against rivals.

In response to a flurry of criticism over European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s decision to accept concessions offered by Google to end a three-year investigation into the company, reports say Almunia is going on the defensive.
In a statement late last week, Almunia said that he has “heard people say that the Commission has entered a gentlemen’s agreement with Google which would lead to a way of dropping the charges or closing the file. Not at all.”
The competition chief defended his decision with the agreement that a third-party monitor would be watching Google to ensure compliance with the settlement.

220,"February 13, 2014",EU: Googleâ€™s â€˜openâ€™ Android system seems suspiciously restricted,"
Google may have dodged a major bullet with its recent settlement with the European Commission over its policy of displaying rival search results, but recent reports say the conglomerate may be in hot water again over its Android smartphone operating system.
Reports say Google promotes the system as “open,” but newly revealed documents reportedly reveal that Google enforces strict guidelines for smartphone makers that look to access apps in Google’s Play Store. Specifically, reports say manufacturers are forced to feature Google apps and set Google’s search engine as the default engine for users in order to access the apps.
The agreement, which Google forces smartphone makers like Samsung to sign, is known as the “Mobile Application Distribution Agreement.”
The European Commission is looking into these conditions as it decides whether to formally accept Google’s third round of concessions, which European Commissioner has approved.
EU Settlement
That settlement is generating its own controversy, however, as reports are emerging that EU officials are criticizing Almunia over accepting the offer without a market test.
Now, reports say that nine European Commissioners voiced their opposition to the decision to accept Google’s third settlement offer without market testing the concessions. The opposition was reportedly vocalized during the regulator’s weekly meeting, held last Wednesday.
While nine commissioners’ disapproval is not enough to reverse competition commissioner Almunia’s decision, reports say it is rare for such strong opposition to a decision.
According to Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger, the European Commission will take a definitive vote on the ruling later this year.
Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier similarly expressed disapproval for the outcome, telling reporters that the regulators “had a very long debate which shows that there are a lot of concerns and questions.”
Almunia’s decision to accept Google’s offer regarding how it displays rival search results in the EU means Google avoids a fine as high as $5 billion. Officials and consumer advocates alike have criticized the settlement, often against Almunia’s decision not to market test the offers even after the Commission rejected Google’s first two proposals due to unfavorable market test results.

In the same week US consumer watchdogs sent a letter to the European Commission slamming its decision to settle with Google after a three-year competition probe, reports say European Commissioner Joaquin ALmunia’s peers aren’t much more impressed.
Two sources said two EU officials criticized Almunia’s decision to settle the case at a meeting on Wednesday. EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding and financial-services policy leader Michel Barnier were said to have voiced opposition to the result of the case.
Almunia announced the Commission had reached an agreement with Google after the company submitted its third round of concessions to ease concerns over the way it displays rivals’ search results. While the first two settlement offers were market tested and ultimately rejected, the third offer apparently appeased authorities and will not be market tested.
Sources say the EU officials criticized Almunia’s decision not to send the concessions out for testing, as well as for failing to approach commissioners ahead of approving the offer.
A statement for the European Commission said that Almunia had provided a detailed update and explanation regarding the Google settlement to the other commissioners, though reports did not say whether it was specified when that occurred.

Reports say Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project commended the Commission’s efforts to maintain a strong stance in its probe, “unlike regulatory authorities in the United States.” However, the group said it “cannot understand what prompted this recent change in attitude,” alluding to the Commission’s decision to settle with Google after rejecting two earlier concession offers from the company.

Now, Consumer Watchdog is joining the vocalized opposition to the settlement after US regulators similarly settled with Google without sanctions.
”For the third proposal to be remotely viable, it must be a substantial change from the earlier iterations,” the consumer group’s letter said. “If it is such a significant change, then – by your own procedures – you must market test it.”

224,"February 5, 2014",EU: What the Google settlement means for online searches,"
As news emerged this week that the European Commission has approved of Google’s third round of concessions offered to quell competition concerns, details are being reported about what the end of the three-year probe will mean for online searches in the EU.
Organic search
According to reports, the settlement offered by Google means the company will have to give equal weight to at least three of its rivals when displaying search results on services such as travel and restaurants.
For example, when displaying restaurant reviews from its Zagat rating service, it will also have to promote restaurant reviews from rival review websites.
The agreement was approved by Commission in efforts to level the online search playing firled for rivals like Yelp, Microsoft, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor when consumers search for flights, hotels and other services.
Advertising
Reports also note that Google has made concessions in the agreements it makes with advertisers whose campaigns appear on search result lists.
Rivals had complained to EU regulators that Google makes exclusive agreements with publishers and that it restricts advertisers’’ ability to switch to Google’s rivals.
Reports say Google has removed those restrictions as part of its offer.
Rivals react
Despite European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s assurance that the concessions are a vast improvement upon Google’s last two offers, rivals criticize the settlement and the EU’s acceptance of it as the Commission decided not to market test the concessions or consult with complainants before clearing the deal.
Following Google’s offer, FairSearch Europe, which represents Expedia, Microsoft and other Google rivals, slammed the concessions as “worse than doing nothing.”
”These proposed commitments have not been subjected to any form of consultation, although it was thanks to market testing of industry participants that the Commission had condemned two previous packages of proposed commitments as fatally flawed,” the group said.
FairSearch said it needs to review the offer in full, but its concerned for several aspects of the settlement, including Google’s policy of requiring rivals to bid for having their search results displayed.

225,"February 5, 2014",EU: Commission unveils Google progress,"
Confirming earlier reports, European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia released a statement early Wednesday confirming progress made with Google and the antitrust case regarding how Google displays rival search results.
According to reports, Google’s third round of concessions to settle the matter are considered a vast improvement by the Commission in addressing competition concerns, effectively settling the dispute. Almunia announced Wednesday he would accept the proposals.
In a statement, Almunia said he believes “the new proposal obtained from Google after long and difficult talks can now address the Commission’s concerns.”
With the acceptance of the settlement offer – Google’s third attempt to settle competition concerns – Google will avoid fines that could have reached up to $5 billion.
The offer
The search giant’s offer reportedly includes displaying rivals’ logos and URL links in a prominent display when search results show up. Further, say reports, Internet content providers will be able to choose which Google material to use for its services.
Google is also said to be planning to end restrictions on advertisers’ ability to move campaigns to rival search engines.
Google holds a 75 percent share of the search engine market in Europe, consultancy firm comScore reports.
Rival input
Update: The most recent reports say Almunia has confirmed he will accept Google’s third proposal without third-party input. But the Commission’s decision not to consult rivals who lodged original complaints sparked fury among critics.
A representative for Microsoft-backed lobbyist ICOMP responded to the news by saying accepting the offer without consulting competitors is like “having the wool pulled over [Almunia’s] eyes.”
A second probe
While Google may be able to avoid a fine and end this investigation with the European Commission, the company is facing yet another probe by EU authorities regarding its Android smartphone operating system. The Commission launched an investigation regarding allegations Google anticompetitively diverts smartphone Internet traffic to its search engine.
Microsoft-backed lobbyist group FairSearch is among the complainants.

As reports emerge that Google is inching ever closer to settling its antitrust dispute with the European Commission, having submitted yet another round of concessions to authorities, reports say Microsoft is demanding a market test of those concessions before they are approved.
Microsoft-funded lobby group ICOMP has reportedly sent a letter to European Commission Joaquin Almunia requesting that the regulator conduct a market test of the offer, as it “will bring the transparency and inclusion necessary to support a solution,” the group said.
Despite reports, the Commission has not confirmed Google has sent its third settlement proposal in, though sources say Almunia is pleased with the alleged offer.

Google is inching closer towards a resolution of a three-year investigation by the European Commission as sources say the company has offered yet another round of concessions.
According to two sources, the “much better” settlement offer may mean Commissioner Almunia could soon approve of the deal, allowing Google to potentially avoid fines of up to $5 billion.
The anonymous sources said a deal could be reached in the coming weeks or even in a few days; one of those sources is a senior European Union official, according to reports.
Both the European Commission and Google declined to comment on the speculation.
Almunia has twice rejected Google’s offer to end a probe into the company’s practices and dominance in the search market as rivals content the company abuses its power in how it displays search results.
Google rivals weighed in on the offers, slamming the concessions as inadequate or even ones that will make the situation worse. According to sources, the Commission will not have competitors weigh-in on the latest settlement proposal.

229,"January 26, 2014",US: Google takes bipartisan approach to antitrust,"
While many major corporations employ the use of lobbying on Capitol Hill, reports suggest Google – a majority Democratic firm – is now pursuing Republicans with the specific intention of avoiding antitrust feuds.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Google, like many other Silicon Valley firms, has developed as company made up of Democrats. The company made headlines in 2012 with high-profile support of Barack Obama for presidency; but now, reports say, Google is equally donating to Republicans and Democrats, and the reason involves competition regulation.
Reports say Google is looking to increase its influence to block future mergers it would find threatening or harmful, and to increase its chances of avoiding antitrust feuds.
According to reports, the tech giant – which remains under investigation by EU competition authorities – has recently hired Republican operatives to strengthen ties with the political party, and has been increasing its financial support of Republican operatives.

Following the announcement that Google will need to strengthen its offer to settle concerns over the way the company presents its search results, the European Commission is reportedly intensifying its scrutiny of the search giant. Reports say the Commission is circulating a new questionnaire to Google’s rivals regarding whether lower rankings in the search engine sector are negatively affecting traffic to their sites. The document was obtained by Reuters. Google’s earlier offer included an agreement to label which search results were owned by Google and to provide users with at least three search results from rival sites; Commissioner Almunia said the offer would not suffice, however, following the submission of comments on the concessions by Google competitors. Reports say companies responding to the most recent questionnaire have until August 16 to do so.

Tech rivals Apple and Google have reportedly decided to drop all patent-related litigation against each other.
According to reports, the two had more than 20 lawsuits regarding allegations of patent infringement. The two were major players in the so-called “patent wars,” still raging between other tech rivals. Companies across the globe are suing each other over alleged patent infringement, claims of unfair licensing fees, and other anticompetitive behavior that has forced antitrust authorities to examine how this patent litigation could be affecting competition and innovation.
But for the time being, Apple and Google have reportedly made nice and instead have decided to work together on patent reform.
In a joint statement, the companies announced, “Apple and Google have agreed to dismiss all the current lawsuits that exist directly between the two companies. Apple and Google have also agreed to work together in some areas of patent reform. This agreement does not include a cross license.”
The majority of these patent feuds focused on Apple’s iPhone and iPad and Google’s Android smartphone OS.

Just days after Google announced a deal to acquire home appliance conglomerate Nest for $3.2 billion, experts are now looking at whether federal officials will approve of the acquisition.
The deal marks Google’s second-largest buyout in the company’s history, say repots, and will expand Google’s portfolio into the so-called “smart home” industry, which uses innovative technology to run households.
According to Nathan Newman of the NYU Information Law Institute, the deal should be blocked by antitrust regulators, arguing the acquisition will place more data in the hands of Google, therefore strengthen its already dominant position in the search market.
Google is currently under investigation by EU authorities for such dominance.

After two concession proposals offered by Google to European competition regulators were deemed inadequate, repots say the European Commission is heating up the pressure against the search giant accused of abusing its dominant position in the search market.
European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia announced Wednesday that if Google does not improve its settlement offer, authorities will be forced to initiate formal procedures against the company, a move that would be lengthy, but one that could lead to billions in fines, reports say.
In a statement in Brussels, Almunia said he is willing to “see if Google can improve their proposal,” or else authorities will “go to the traditional route.”
”We need more, not during the next year but during the next weeks,” he said.
The Commission said it is looking to resolve the issue by this spring after nearly four years of antitrust investigation efforts into the company and allegations by its rivals that Google is anticompetitively displaying its own, sponsored links in search results.

Reports coming from South Korea say longtime smartphone rivals Samsung and Apple may soon make peace and reach a deal regarding patent royalties.
As the two companies engage in legal battles regarding smartphone patent licensing, sources say the companies my look to reach a joint settlement on the feuds as soon as early January.
The two companies initiated a similar process last year, but 17 hours of discussion failed to lead to an agreement.
Now reports say the companies are willing to try again as they look to settle disputes over royalties paid to each other for use of their smartphone patents. Samsung is reportedly looking to ink a cross-licensing deal to continue using Apple’s standard-essential and commercial patents; but Apple, reports say, is looking for $30 for each Samsung device that uses Apple patents.
According to reports, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, as well as US and EU authorities, are all working with the firms to work out a potential deal.
Google sues Rockstar group
As Samsung and Apple are rumored to be making peace in the patent wars, Google is reportedly taking a different route.
Reports say Google has filed a lawsuit against patent group Rockstar, which is run by Microsoft, Apple, Blackberry and other smartphone makers, as Google looks to get legal clearance to use seven Rockstar patents.
Google filed the case in California late last month in efforts to have a judge declare non-infringement on the patents, which Rockstar claims are in licensing violation by Google’s smartphone Android operating system.
The Rockstar group, also owned by EMC, Ericsson and Sony, has risen concerns before; the American Antitrust Institute recently sent a letter to the US Department of Justice regarding the group, questioning the validity of such “horizontal collaboration” between the firms.

Google has offered to promote rivals’ results to quell dominance abuse concerns that the search giant’s results are not transparent, leading viewers to believe their sponsored results are neutral.

237,"December 4, 2013",US: Watchdog pans Google Shopping monopoly as holiday spending kicks off,"
A report released this week by Consumer Watchdog is calling Google out for an “abuse of its monopoly position” with Google Shopping ahead of the holiday spending spree.
The report claims users spend up to 67 percent more when finding products to purchase through Google Shopping compared with a rival Comparison Shopping Engine. Eight out of 14 products, the findings say, push higher prices on buyers than if those products were found through a different search engine.
According to Consumer Watchdog, it’s Google’s dominant position in the industry that allows the search engine to up revenue and push higher costs on buyers. The report was released just as the holiday shopping season gets into full swing.
Google initially launched Google Product Search, which provided product search results without charging merchants to appear in those results, thus allowing the company to product lowest-price items. But in 2012 the company launched Google Shopping, a paid-only model where merchants pay to have products listed in the results.

238,"December 2, 2013",US: Googleâ€™s patent grab exponentially ballooned in last decade,"
Google has been vocal in recent years regarding the acquisition of patents, a practice the conglomerate deems as one riddled with low-quality tech patents mainly acquired to harm innovation and used as a weapon against tech firms in court.
But according to data compiled by the US Patent & Trademark office, Google is stockpiling patents at an alarming rate – about 10 patents every day, according to the numbers.
That’s compared with 2003, a year in which Google was awarded just four patents in total.
Reports say the company is set to have gained 1,800 patents to its portfolio this year. The move is likely part of a strategic defense for its smartphone operating system Android as it faces legal challenges in court over patent infringement. Both Google and Samsung, for example, were sued last month by a company representing Microsoft and Apple for patent infringement.
But while Google continues to nab up technology patents, the company publically slams patent litigation as a legal technique that ends up inflating prices on tech gadgets for consumers. Top Google layer David Drummond described many smartphone patents as “largely questionable” and “dubious” on the company’s official blog.
The practice of patent trolling has come under fire as of late within the antitrust community as regulators, lawyers and experts debate how to handle such excess litigation in which companies acquire such technology patents for the sole purpose of suing others that use them, as they are often necessary to build a device.

239,"November 28, 2013",EU: Latest delay hits Google case,"
The European Commission reportedly plans to extend its investigation into Google for alleged anticompetitive behavior, a move that will allow some Google rivals more time to comment on the company’s proposed concessions.
According to a source, the regulator will extend the timeline for companies that need to “conduct experimental tests” to analyze Google’s offer, its second since the case began nearly two years ago. The extension gives the companies until December 9 to respond to the offer, which says Google is willing to display search results from rival search engines, though would still require competitors to pay to have their results featured.
The deadline extension comes just days after Google posted commentary by senior vice president Kent Walker arguing that Google has “gone the extra mile to come up with a settlement that will resolve the Commission’s expressed concerns.”

According to Foundem, Google’s offer to label search results as either its own or its rivals’ is similarly insufficient; further, the company said, Google’s offer of a bidding process for so-called Paid Rival Links to appear in Google’s search results “simply increases the efficiency with which Google would extract revenues from its competitors.”
The company also slammed the European Commission’s decision to mandate Google’s concessions remain confidential and ban the interested parties asked to comment on the offer from publically discussing the offer.

In fighting criticism from some of Google’s biggest rivals, European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia offered an interview this week to assure that he is investigating the search giant and its second round of concessions, responding to companies accusing Almunia of a lenient dealing of the case.
Almunia gave an exclusive interview with UK paper The Guardian to offer an update of the investigation, which began in 2010 to probe allegations that Google is abusing its dominance in the way it displays search results.
Since the start of that investigation, Google has offered two rounds of concessions; the first was rejected by the Commission, but both were slammed by Google rivals as inadequate.
Now, critics claim the investigation has gone on too long, and that Almunia is too lenient with Google, allowing the company – which escaped major sanctions by US authorities in a similar case earlier this year – to dictate the advancement of the probe.
In an interview, Almunia told a reporter “sharply” that he is “investigating” Google, “not defending them.”
The Commissioner offered an updated timeline of the potential completion of the case, saying a decision may not be reached until the “first part” of 2014, though did not declare a more definitive deadline.

Judge Chin rejected a settlement offer of $125 million in 2011, ruling that it would give Google a “de facto monopoly” on scanning and displaying books. Chin eventually ruled that the publishers and authors could sue as a class, but earlier this year the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals said the judge did not adequately review the fair use defense before giving class action status.

246,"November 10, 2013",US/EU: Apple scores double win against Google,"
Apple received two favorable court decisions, one in Germany and one at the US International Trade Commission, last Friday in its longstanding battle with rival Google and the use of standard essential patents.
Reports say Apple was granted a stay in Germany that suspends a current lawsuit in which Google is seeking royalty claims against Apple and Microsoft for use of patents Google acquired. Apple requested a stay, now granted by Judge Andreas Voss, pending the outcome of a current probe by the European Commission into the matter.
The Commission is examining Google’s use of SEPs to earn royalties from its rivals; in this particular case, Google is leveraging patents acquired through its buyout of Motorola Mobility against both Apple and Microsoft.
The defendants argue that Google’s demands for its rivals to use such patents do not fall under the fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory rule.
In the same day, Apple heard favorable news by the International Trade Commission, which denied Friday Motorola Mobility’s request to rehear a previous decision in favor of Apple regarding SEPs.
Both Motorola Mobility and Apple had filed counter claims against each other seeking ITC import bans on products that violated each other’s essential patents; both cases were dismissed by Judge Richard Posner in June of last year.
Apple, however, won an appeal last August that reversed the ITC’s decision on two of the three patents regarding Apple’s touchscreen. Google had requested a rehearing of that decision, which was denied.
Further, this week will mark the continuation of ongoing litigation between Apple and rival smartphone maker Samsung over patents; Apple previously won a $1 billion settlement related to SEP infringement, say reports.

News outlets are reporting they have received a leaked version of Google’s second round of proposed concessions given to the European Commission as part of efforts to end the EU’s investigation into Google’s alleged anticompetitive business practices.
According to reports, an unnamed source has leaked European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia’s request for comment regarding Google’s offer, which includes 15 questions sent to various competitors of the conglomerate as well as a copy of Google’s proposal.

Among Google’s previous offers was the proposal to eliminate advertisers’ exclusivity clauses in contracts, among others. In its revised concessions, reports say Google has offered to include three links to rival search engine sites amid its results to quell competition concerns that Google abuses its dominance.
While the source remains anonymous, reports say the documents were leaked because their confidentiality was considered, by the source, as a “muzzle” on the public and an “unlawful abuse of process.”

Before the European Commission accepts Google’s second round of concessions and ends its antitrust probe into the search giant over allegations of dominance abuse, the regulator is now seeking the opinions of Google’s toughest critics.

This time around, Google has reportedly offered to display rivals’ logos in search results, and make rivals’ links more prominent. Further, the company has offered to let advertisers to use their campaigns on other platforms.
Google also offered to hire an external monitor to oversee the process, similar to the watchdog appointed to oversee Apple Inc’s business practices in the US following a ruling that found Apple guilty of fixing eBooks prices.
According to the Commission, information from “all those who responded to the initial market test of Google’s proposals” will be considered particularly important for the watchdog.

Competitors that filed the complaint are not only slamming Google’s second try at resolving the matter, but a lawyer for one of the complainants reportedly suggested that Almunia may simply be looking to resolve the case before his term is up.
More than one year of discussions and negotiations have accumulated to Google offering to show more of its rivals’ links in search results. While the exact details of the concessions have not been revealed, and while competitors admit they have not seen the complete offer, reports say complainants like Microsoft and Oracle are condemning the offer as one that is unlikely to resolve all concerns that Google abuses its dominance in the search engine market.
A lawyer for an unspecified complainant equated the settlement offer to “putting lipstick on a pig.”
Further, the lawyer said the situation now suggests Almunia “just wants to get a deal before his term as Commissioner is up next year.”

253,"October 13, 2013",Brazil: Microsoft complaint kicks-off latest Google dominance abuse probe,"
Brazil’s antitrust regulator CADE announced Friday it was investigating Google for allegations of anticompetitive behavior in the way the company reveals search results, following a complaint lodged by Microsoft in the nation.
A spokesperson for Google confirmed the probe, which is similar to a case launched by the European Commission.
According to reports, Microsoft, as well as other rivals in Brazil, are accusing Google of favoring its own product listings over  rivals’ in its search results, among other claims. Microsoft’s complaint alleged Google of giving an unfair advantage over competitors to its AdWords advertising service by blocking ad campaigns across rival search engines.
Reports say the advertising makes up 95 percent of Google’s revenue.
Other complaints were lodged with CADE by price comparison sites Buscapé and Bondfardo.
The investigation marks the next development in a trend of intensifying scrutiny of major US internet firms by Brazilian regulators, say reports.

One year after Microsoft first aired its commercial promoting search engine Bing – with claims that users prefer Bing to Google nearly 2:1 – Yale professor Ian Ayres decided to replicate the study on his own, with interesting results.
In a blog post, Ayres explains that Microsoft’s study was based on a sample of only 1,000 participants; since, the company offers the study online through website BingItOn.com, but refuses to release the results – despite nearly five million participants having voted between Bing and rival Google.

While the US Federal Trade Commission is reportedly planning to clear Google’s recent buyout of mapping application Waze, the deal may not meet the same fate in Israel, say reports.
The Israel Antitrust Authority launched a probe into the search giant’s acquisition of the Israel-based company Wednesday, reportedly to determine whether the buyout should have been notified to regulators beforehand.
The probe will also look into whether the deal leads to a monopoly within Israel.
Google completed its nearly $1 billion buyout of Waze last May, though Waze operations have largely remained within Israel.
Local reports say authorities are now requesting information from both Google’s Israel manager as well as Waze Israel’s CEO.

Almunia spoke before the European Parliament to offer his opinion on Google’s offer, suggesting the concessions could resolve concerns that the search giant is abusing its dominance in how it displays search results.

While one cannot predict how Almunia will rule, he did say that the decision will not be identical to the one made by the US’s Federal Trade Commission when it settled with Google earlier this year without issuing major sanctions against the company.
Almunia says the decision will be different because the company’s market share is larger in Europe.
The investigation, which has lasted for three years, reached a new development when earlier concessions offered by Google were rejected by the European Commission; Google then submitted new concessions.

Google Inc. has reportedly submitted new concessions to the European Commission in hopes to end the watchdog’s investigation into the company over allegations of abuse of dominance in the way it presents its search engine results.
The Commission announced the new proposal submission Monday, two months after the original offer by Google was rejected by regulators. A spokesperson for the Commission said they are “analyzing it carefully,” and that the body would “move toward a solution in the coming months” should the proposal suffice to end the investigation
According to reports, Google’s concessions have centered on changing the way its search results are displayed, a topic of controversy for the Commission, which is looking into Google for reportedly favoring its own services in top search results.
Google settled similar complaints with US watchdogs last January, though the US Federal Trade Commission did not require major overhauls to the way Google presents its search results.

In an unrelated case, the Commission ordered Korea-based tech firm Samsung to revise its offered concessions to end the Commission’s probe into the company’s use of standard-essential patent lawsuits against rival Apple Inc.
Samsung has sued Apple in several countries in 2011 regarding Apple’s use of Samsung patents, deemed “standard-essential” as the patents are necessary to the device.
The particular patents involved interoperability between different mobile devices. The Commission is scrutinizing Samsung over the lawsuits’ anticompetitiveness to the market.

The rivalry between tech giants Google and Microsoft hit a new high last week as Google reportedly blocked Windows smartphones from running the Google-owned YouTube app. The dispute has carried on for months, beginning with Google’s cease and desist letter sent to Microsoft over the app alleging the use of the application is in violation of three of Google’s terms of services. In response, Microsoft vowed to work with Google to resolve the issue in efforts to have the application run on Windows smartphones with the same ease as Android or iPhone. The application was re-released by Microsoft last week, only to be blocked again by Google.
Both companies have issued statements on the issue, with Google insisting that Microsoft’s re-released YouTube app “violates our Terms of Service.”
But Microsoft’s vice president David Howard slammed the app blockage, claiming “The roadblocks Google has set up are impossible to overcome, and they know it” Further, Microsoft says Google is requiring its rival to transition the app to the HTML5 coding language, despite the requirement not pertaining to either Android or iPhone devices.
No antitrust complaint has been filed as of yet regarding the matter.

Thus far, Google offered to identify which search results were Google’s own, and to offer searchers links to competing websites. The company faces up to a $5 billion fine if the firm and the Commission cannot reach an agreement, though Almunia did not specify a deadline for Google to revise its offer.

Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Albert A. Foer and Sandeep Vaheesan (AAI) present Google: The Unique Case of the Monopolistic Search Engine
ABSTRACT: In early January, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) closed its nearly two-year investigation into Google’s conduct. Unanimously, the Commissioners stated that Google’s alleged favouring of its own vertical search features in search results was not an antitrust violation. They found that changes to Google’s search algorithm were intended to offer more informative search results. The FTC acknowledged that modifications of Google’s algorithm deprived some vertical search sites of traffic, but stated that harm to competitors is a ‘common byproduct of “competition on the merits”’. Responding to other allegations, Google agreed voluntarily to stop appropriating content from vertical search engines and allow online advertisers greater flexibility to manage concurrent ad campaigns on multiple search engines. Investigations into Google’s practices continue in other jurisdictions, including the European Commission (EC) and the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). Given the high level of cooperation between these authorities in the Google matter, it seems unlikely that the pending investigations will reach significantly different results. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the EC will legally require Google to label its own vertical features and display rival vertical sites in search results, which would go further but still not be dramatically different from Google’s voluntary pledges to the FTC.

Rivals of the company recently called for the watchdog to reject a settlement offer made by Google, labeling the concessions inadequate and potentially opening the door for future abuses. Earlier this week EU deputy director-general for antitrust Cecilio Madero confirmed the regulator has received “very negative” feedback from competitors concerning Google’s offer.

Commissioner Joaquin Almunia reportedly told the European Parliament that Google will “almost 100 percent” be asked to offer more to settle the probe as reviews of the concessions have been extended by a month. The EU has been eyeing Google since 2010 for the ways it displays search results; the company currently holds more than 90 percent dominance in the search engine market within Europe.

As Facebook is known to be looking to buy mapping phone application Waze, an Israel-based start-up company, sources are now saying that Google may be entering the race to acquire the business. While reports note that discussions with Waze are “fluid” and no decision have been made, Google’s buyout of the app would deal a blow to Facebook as the social media giant looks to up its presence in the mobile telecommunications market. Facebook is reportedly looking to pay $1 million for the company, a crowed-sourced mapping service. According to one mobile technology expert, author Brian Proffitt, the owner of Waze will become “a hot commodity,” whoever it may be, as more companies look to mobile mapping to grow business.

Is the Federal Trade Commission planning another investigation into Google? Yes, says one source to reporters. Google, which is’]ons the company abused its dominance in ways it displays search results, wrapped up a case with the Federal Trade Commission only last January after the regulator unanimously voted to end a probe into the complaints that Google was hurting rivals. But an entirely new case may soon be launched into the conglomerate as an unidentified source says the FTC is looking into whether Google broke antitrust law in how it sells advertising space. Google is currently the number-one online platform for ads. Further details of exactly how Google may have breached antitrust law were not disclosed. While the source says regulators are in the most initial stages of a probe, the FTC is unlikely to have already sent out civil investigative demands, which would have been the sign of a more serious investigation.

Despite an outcry of disapproval from rivals, Google’s proposed settlement with the European Commission over allegations of anticompetitive behavior are likely to see approval from regulators with few –if any – changes, say reports. The news comes soon after reports that competitors will get more time to market-test Google’s proposed concessions in addition to the standard month timeline; sources say companies will now have time into June to review the effects of Google’s offer. According to one expert, De Gaulle Fleurance and Associes’ Bruno Lebrun, the fact that the offer is being test marketed suggests a likely approval. Google is currently under watch from the European Commission for allegations the search giant displays search results beneficial to Google and hides results beneficial to rivals, among other claims.

According to a source, Google’s main rivals will now be allowed more time to review the search giant’s proposed concessions to the European Commission, submitted to end an investigation into allegations of abuse of dominance. The original deadline of May 26 for rivals to mull Google’s offer has reportedly been extended until June 27, according to a source. The Commission declined to comment on the news, however. The extended review may mean Google’s rivals will be able to pull even more concessions from the company; some conglomerates have already expressed disapproval of the deal, including price comparison website Foundem, which said Google’s offer would only reinforce its dominant position.

Concessions offered by Google to the European Commission are too weak and will only reinforce the search giant’s dominance unless the regulator demands further concessions, say the company’s rivals. Last month, Google looked to end a more than two-year investigation by the Commission through a settlement proposal that sees the company presenting search results with links to competing search engines and to clarify which results were Google-owned. As the regulator tests the efficacy of the proposal, rivals are now arguing that the settlement does not adequately address competition concerns, one company – Foundem – argued it could actually make the situation worse. Foundem is a UK-based price comparison site. In an official statement, Foundem argues that the proposal could “legitimize [Google’s] existing abusive practices. German mapping website Hotmaps went on to argue that the settlement was “unacceptable.” The Commission has until the end of May to decide whether to accept the offer; Google risks fines up to $5 billion if a settlement is not reached.

As part of a tribe of 17 firms taking on Google with the European Commission, Nokia has reportedly emerged as the leader to address the group’s concerns head-on.

294,"May 6, 2013",EU: Googleâ€™s Motorola sent formal abuse of dominance complaint,"
The European Commission has officially issued a complaint against Motorola Mobility Holdings unit concerning the company’s practice of preventing its rivals from using essential technology patents through court injunctions. According to reports, the company, which was acquired by Google for $12.4 billion in 2012, has imposed “unjustified licensing terms on patent licenses” and abused its dominant position, a result from owning the standard essential patents. The statement from the European Commission was issued Monday. The move by the Commission is the latest development in an international debate concerning those patents and how ownership affects market competition. The statement has implications for companies other than Motorola as it argued dominant owners of SEPs should not be able to use court injunctions to prohibit a rivals’ use of a patent. The deal may soon add to the debate concerning “patent trolls” as well, which are companies that buy patents – often without manufacturing a product at all – to levy that ownership against other companies who are then forced to pay for use of that patent.

Motorola, owned by Google, has been dealt a blow by a US district judge concerning its ongoing rivalry with Microsoft concerning the use of patents. US District Judge James Robart has ruled that Motorola cannot require $4 billion a year in payments from Microsoft for the use of patented wireless technology, noting that the licenses for the technology are worse less than half of that $4 billion sum. The ruling is the latest development in the rivalry, in which both companies sued each other for use of those patents; Motorola accused Microsoft of patent infringement, while Microsoft accused Motorola of excessive licensing fees. It’s part of a larger issue concerning patents within antitrust, as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as well as the International Telecommunication Union requires both conglomerates to license essential patents on a RANT basis – reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Judge Robart had previously chastised both companies for being “arrogant” in their cases, arguing that the companies are part of a larger ploy in the fight for “commercial advantage.” The judge’s earlier decision ruled that Microsoft is entitled to a license from Motorola; soon after, a judge in Germany ruled that Microsoft had breached its licensing agreement with Motorola.

As reports emerged last week that Google has submitted concessions to the European Commission to settle allegations of abusing its market dominance in the way it presents search results, the latest updates are reporting that sources confirmed the Commission has approved of the proposed settlement. Two anonymous sources who were briefed on the situation have told reporters that the settlement will be accepted by the Commission – Google will not be required to change its algorithm that determines search results, but the results will now be clearly distinguished as either Google-owned or not. Additionally, some links from competing search engines will also be presented.
As rivals will weigh-in on the changes, any noticeable alterations will not be seen by consumers for at least one month during market testing. The Commission’s approval of the settlement will officially end the saga of a two-year long investigation into Google that began in 2010. The settlement would be legally binding for five years, according to the sources.
While this particular case may lead to a happy ending for Google, the conglomerate continues to face a new wave of allegations accusing the company of deceptively gaining an advantage over rivals concerning its applications in various smartphones using the Android software. The latest case was first revealed earlier this month.

Jose Gonzalez-Magaz, William Gordon, Mar 28, 2013
Parties seeking dual settlements with the European Commission and the U.S. antitrust agencies are challenged by their differing frameworks. Part of the complexity stems from their separate approaches to competition law enforcement, while other components of the problem relate to their respective settlement processes. Since Microsoft settled its Windows case in the United States in 2001, but was unable to achieve that result with the EC, parties seeking resolution of anticompetitive allegations by means of concessions must take into account the risk of diverging settlement opportunities across the Atlantic. A decade later, the stress of that concern is intensified by Google’s recent settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the prospect of the EC again not following suit.

Posted by D. Daniel Sokol
Estelle Malavolti and Toulouse School of Economics /ENAC-LEEA and Frederic Marty, OFCE-Sciences-Po describe Exclusionary pricing in a two-sided platform : some insights from the industrial organization theory in the Google case
ABSTRACT: Firms operating in two-sided markets have to integrate in their optimal pricing structure the existence of indirect externalities across groups of consumers. Beyond direct externalities (network effects), such markets are characterized by the increasing value of the platform for the users on one side with the number on the other side. As for Internet search platforms such as Google, their value for advertisers depends on the number of users and especially of precisely targeted ones. As a consequence, the optimal price structure in a two-sided market cannot be symmetrical. In other words, the price structure is not neutral and has to take into account such linkages between these two groups of users. From an economic point of view, it may make sense to impose no charge for the group that generates the most valuable externalities. With antitrust inquiries, such specificity imposes to consider simultaneously both sides of the markets. Otherwise, the risk of false negative decisions may arise. On one side the pricing strategy might be interpreted as a predatory practice and on the other side as an exploitative abuse. As the number and the loyalty of users on one side is an essential input to competition between platforms on the other side, it might be rational to subsidize them by acquiring exclusive rights on some valuable contents and to implement bundling and tying strategies. The main risk lies in some market foreclosure. The market might evolve towards vertically integrated ecosystems, e.g. a silos model of competition. Furthermore, competition authorities have to define a sound economics-based theory of harm to disentangle practices that reduce consumer welfare (by increasing switching costs) from ones that might be finally welfare-enhancing. The issue of remedies arises inexorably from this point. Our paper sheds light on these industrial economics and competition law issues.

ABSTRACT: This paper discusses the general characteristics of online markets from a competition theory perspective and the implications for competition policy. Three important Internet markets are analyzed in more detail: search engines, online auction platforms, and social networks. Given the high level of market concentration and the development of competition over time, we use our theoretical insights to examine whether leading Internet platforms have non-temporary market power. Based on this analysis we answer the question whether any specific market regulation beyond general competition law rules is warranted in these three online markets.

The Financial Times and other media outlets are reporting that the $733 million fine issued to Microsoft by the European Commission earlier this week was the result of a tip-off from longtime rival Google. Microsoft, fined for breaching its previous settlement agreement with authorities to offer its customers a choice in Internet browsers, apparently neglected to include its “choice screen” – which the company promised to offer until 2014 – on products between February 2011 until July 2012. It’s an oversight that was only revealed when a third party complained about the issue; that third party, reports the Financial Times, was Google, which was working with Opera, a browser company in Norway. Google’s decision to call-out Microsoft, however, may bring difficulties to the search giant as it remains in the midst of its own case with the Commission for abuse of dominance claims. According to reports, the result of Microsoft’s fine may cause the Commission to develop stricter monitoring conditions on the companies with which it settles.

After six years of battling with the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, Google has come out victorious. The ACCC had alleged that Google misled its consumers by publishing advertisements that came up with search results, breaching the Trace Practices Act. Specifically, the ACCC claimed the deception was caused by the ads suggesting links between companies that did not exist. But the High Court ruled that Google’s conduct was not misleading or deceptive, and the ACCC has been ordered to pay the search giant’s legal costs from the fight. The suit first began in 2007 when the ACCC filed in the Federal Court, which also ruled in Google’s favor. While the antitrust authority filed an appeal, the High Court again ruled in Google’s favor.

Just days after Google reportedly handed in last-minute concessions requested by the European Commission regarding their longstanding investigation into the company, new reports are emerging that Google is facing yet another complaint over its business practices. The ICOMP coalition has announced it has submitted a new dossier to the Commission on January 20th. ICOMP includes Microsoft Corp, one of Google’s main rivals. The dossier is said to contain accusations that Google obtained its dominant position in the market through “unfair agreements” with companies in the Internet and advertising industries. In a statement, ICOMP calls those agreements “an illegal network of exclusive relationships.”

In what was later picked up by news outlets, lobbying group ICOMP tweeted Thursday morning that it has received reports that Google has, in fact, submitted remedy proposals to the European Commission. Google’s deadline to do so was at midnight. The reports come a day after reports that Almunia joked about Google potentially missing its deadline to submit the proposals during a press conference. Google is under investigation by the European Commission for alleged abuse of dominance over the methods the search giant uses to display search results. A spokesperson for the Commission did not confirm or deny these reports, though reiterated that Google had until midnight to submit their proposals. Google similarly declined to comment on the matter.

323,"January 31, 2013",EU: Almunia jokes about Googleâ€™s probable missed deadline for settlement proposal,"
Despite a recent meeting between Google CEO and European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia that reportedly ended in an agreement for Google to propose a settlement agreement with the Commission by the end of January, Almunia has said that “talks were continuing” between the two parties. Google has been under investigation by the Commission since November of 2011 after allegations accused the search giant of abuse of dominance in the way it displays its search results. Almunia seemed to joke about the further delay in a press briefing on Wednesday, though there is no legal deadline for Google to propose its settlement. In the press briefing, Almunia acknowledged that, since it’s the end of the month, he “can’t imagine the proposals are flying in. Possibly by express post.” His lighthearted nature about the situation seems to counter previous reports that Almunia and the Commission would not go as easy on Google as the US had, as the Federal Trade Commission decided to end its investigation into Google late last year.

Reports are emerging that Google nearly doubled its lobbying budget to $16.48 million in 2012 in the midst of its antitrust case with the US Federal Trade Commission, as well as an ongoing case in the EU. Google reportedly spent just $9.68 million on lobbying the previous year. According to Google, the money was spent on influencing policy makers in efforts to “preserve Internet freedom” during discussions over an international telecommunications treaty in 2012. Immigration, education, cloud computing and taxes were reportedly other issues lobbied by the search giant.

While experts generally agree that Facebook’s new search engine app – announced earlier this week – will not pose significant competition to Google, one analyst says that Facebook’s new product could actually help Google in antitrust cases. Specifically, says a report, the European Commission, currently investigating Google, now has to consider Facebook’s new search product as additional competition. Facebook could be especially important in Google’s favor, says the report, because Google dominates about 90 percent of the search market in Europe, Facebook similarly dominates its own social media market. Additionally, according  to an analyst, Facebook’s new search product will offer results other than web pages, which “lends credence to Google’s defense that modern search is about answer to questions, not simple links to Web pages.”

Yandex’s shares reportedly fell .2 percent on the Nasdaq Composit Index as Google’s rose 2 percent, creating the widest price gap between the two competitors since last October. Analysts are attributing the hit to a loss of investor confidence in Yandex, some of whom expect to see Yandex sell off some of its share to Google. Yandex holds more than twice the market share of Google in Russia, according to reports, and will now face mounting pressure from Google as it looks to extend international business.

Patent lawyers are suggesting that despite the Federal Trade Commission’s recent decision to end its investigation into Google without legal action, lawsuits from Microsoft and Apple are not likely to go away. The FTC agreed to end its probe into Google after the search giant offered voluntary concessions concerning various complaints that Google unfairly restricted access to its patents that are widely used in various mobile devices by various companies. But according to experts, despite Google’s agreements to offer its rivals access to those patents, those “fair and reasonable” terms are not likely to settle disputes between the tech giants.

A US congressman is reportedly demanding an investigation into the Federal Trade Commission’s alleged leaking of private information of the FTC’s investigation into Google, according to reports. Representative Darrell Issa (R-California), who is also Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called for the investigation in a letter to FTC investigator General Scott Wilson on January 3. Media outlets somehow obtained information of the outcome of the FTC’s investigation into Google before the FTC officially announced its decision last Thursday, despite that information being confidential. The FTC is prohibited by law to release information of an ongoing investigation before that investigation has concluded. A spokesperson for the FTC would only comment that the Commission has received Rep. Issa’s letter.

331,"January 7, 2013",A few reflections on the FTC’s decision on Google,"
David Evans, Jan 08, 2013
 
The FTC’s 5-0 decision to drop its investigation into Google’s search-related practices is breathtaking. A number of companies had charged that Google was engaging in unfair competition by cooking its search results. Yet the Commission staff concluded that there was no significant evidence to support allegations that the “company biased its search to hurt competition” or that consumers, rather than competitors, were harmed. Three Democratic and two Republican FTC Commissioners, none of whom have been particularly bashful about pursuing companies they believe have violated the antitrust laws, supported that conclusion. For those who know the FTC Commissioners and staff, it is a bit hard to give credence to the hysterical complaints by some of Google’s antagonists that the FTC fumbled the investigation.
There’s not much more to say at least on the search case in the US for now. We’ll have to wait to see what the EU concludes. So I’d like to reflect at bit on some of the broader questions this decision raises.
Should antitrust give the information-technology sector a rest?
Antitrust enforcers in the US, EU, and other parts of the world have invested a great deal of effort at going after a succession of information-technology companies beginning with IBM, continuing with Microsoft, and most recently with Google. Maybe some day the information-technology revolution will settle down; the pace of innovation will slow; and we’ll really n...

A landmark, longstanding case against Google brought on by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has ended with a settlement and a finding by the FTC that antitrust statues have not been violated by the search giant in the way it structures search results.
The Commission, however, did find Google in violation of mishandling its use of broad patents on cellphone technology, a victorious decision for Google’s rivals who will now be able to use that patented technology for their devices.
A 4-1 vote by the Commission settled the patent charges, and a unanimous vote closed the investigation.
In the settlement, Google has agreed to modify some of its business practices that have been under scrutiny, most specifically concerning its “search in search advertising;” several companies had complained that Google favored its own sites instead of others to appear in search results.

337,"January 4, 2013",Press Release: FTC confident Google concessions good for competition,"
In an official press release the Federal Trade Commission has announced a 5-0 agreement to end its longstanding case against Google after the search giant agreed to alter its business practices to remedy concerns that initiated the investigation. In a statement, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said that the result of the investigation “is a strong and enforceable set of agreements.” Leibowitz emphasized the FTC’s pleasure over Google’s commitment to allow access to its standard-essential patents; part of the FTC’s investigation centered around whether Google was abusing its dominance by preventing competitors access to those patents, which are commonly used in various devices, especially in smartphones. The Commission emphasized two main points in its statement as justifications for the settlement: “Google will not seek injunctions to block rivals from using patents essential to key technologies,” and “Google will remove restrictions hampering advertisers’ management of their ad campaigns across competing ad platforms.”
The complete statement can be read below:
 
Landmark Agreements Will Give Competitors Access to Standard-Essential Patents; Advertisers Will Get More Flexibility to Use Rival Search Engines Google Inc. has agreed to change some of its business practices to resolve Federal Trade Commission concerns that those practices could stifle competition in the markets for popular devices such as smart phones, tablets and gaming consoles, as well as the market for online search advertising.
Under a settlement reached with the FTC, Google will meet its prior commitments to allow competitors access – on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms – to patents on critical standardized technologies needed to make popular devices such as smart phones, laptop and tablet computers, and gaming consoles. In a separate letter of commitment to the Commission, Google has agreed to give online advertisers more flexibility to simultaneously manage ad campaigns on Google’s AdWords platform and on rival ad platforms; and to refrain from misappropriating online content from so-called “vertical” websites that focus on specific categories such as shopping or travel for use in its own vertical offerings.
“The changes Google has agreed to make will ensure that consumers continue to reap the benefits of competition in the online marketplace and in the market for innovative wireless devices they enjoy,” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. “This was an incredibly thorough and careful investigation by the Commission, and the outcome is a strong and enforceable set of agreements.”
“We are especially glad to see that Google will live up to its commitments to license its standard-essential patents, which will ensure that companies willing to license these patents can compete in the market for wireless devices,” Leibowitz added. “This decision strengthens the standard-setting process that is at the heart of innovation in today’s technology markets.” Google is a global technology company with more than 32,000 employees and annual revenues of nearly $38 billion. The FTC also conducted an extensive investigation into allegations that Google biased its search results to disadvantage certain vertical websites; and that Google entered into anticompetitive exclusive agreements for the distribution of Google Search on both desktop and in the mobile arena. The agency decided not to take action in connection with these allegations.
“The evidence the FTC uncovered through this intensive investigation prompted us to require significant changes in Google’s business practices. However, regarding the specific allegations that the company biased its search results to hurt competition, the evidence collected to date did not justify legal action by the Commission,” said Beth Wilkinson, outside counsel to the Commission. “Undoubtedly, Google took aggressive actions to gain advantage over rival search providers. However, the FTC’s mission is to protect competition, and not individual competitors. The evidence did not demonstrate that Google’s actions in this area stifled competition in violation of U.S. law.”
In response to the agency’s concerns about several of its business practices, Google has agreed to take the following steps:
Google will not seek injunctions to block rivals from using patents essential to key technologies
In 2012, Google paid about $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility (MMI), including MMI’s patent portfolio of over 24,000 patents and patent applications. These patents have been a significant source of revenue for at least a decade, and hundreds of MMI’s patents are essential to industry standards used to provide wireless connectivity and for internet-related technologies. These standards are essential for smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, operating systems, and the increasing number of devices offering wireless connectivity or high definition video.
Development and use of these types of standards is a cornerstone for many high-tech markets, and encourages innovation and investment in high-tech products, according to the FTC’s complaint. By agreeing to standards, companies can ensure that the numerous components of a device or a technology network can work together seamlessly, often called “interoperability.”
Setting a standard, however, can have the effect of giving market power to the owner of a patent that is deemed essential to the standard, according to the agency. That patent – even if it is only on a small component of a much larger and more complex device – can be used to “hold up” a licensee for an excessive royalty. To avoid this problem, technology companies involved in setting a standard commit to license standard-essential patents on “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms – known as FRAND terms.
The Commission’s complaint alleges that Google reneged on its FRAND commitments and pursued – or threatened to pursue – injunctions against companies that need to use MMI’s standard-essential patents in their devices and were willing to license them on FRAND terms. Specifically the company pursued injunctions in federal district court and at the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) to block competing technology companies from using MMI standard-essential patents.
The FTC alleged that this type of patent hold-up is what the standard setting organizations sought to prevent by instituting FRAND licensing requirements. According to the FTC, if left unchecked, this type of patent hold-up can lead to higher prices, as companies may pay higher royalties for the use of Google’s patents because of the threat of an injunction, and then pass those higher prices on to consumers. This may cause companies in technology industries to abandon the standard-setting process and limit or forgo investment in new technologies, according to the agency.
To remedy this concern, Google has agreed to a Consent Order that prohibits it from seeking injunctions against a willing licensee, either in federal court or at the ITC, to block the use of any standard-essential patents that the company has previously committed to license on FRAND terms.
Google will remove restrictions hampering advertisers’ management of their ad campaigns across competing ad platforms
Under a separate commitment, Google has agreed to remove restrictions on the use of its online search advertising platform, AdWords, that may make it more difficult for advertisers to coordinate online advertising campaigns across multiple platforms.
Advertisers who wish to use a search advertising platform spend considerable time, effort, and resources preparing extensive bids, including keywords, price information, and targeting information. Once an advertiser has entered the information necessary to create a search advertising campaign, the advertising platform sends critical data back to the advertisers that they need to evaluate the effectiveness of, and to further manage, their campaign. Advertising platforms use application programming interfaces, known as APIs, to give advertisers direct access to these advertising platforms so they can develop their own software programs to automatically manage and optimize their advertising campaigns.
Some FTC Commissioners were concerned that Google’s contractual conditions governing the use of its API made it more difficult for an advertiser to simultaneously manage a campaign on AdWords and on competing ad platforms, and that these restrictions might impair competition in search advertising.
Google will give websites the ability to “opt out” of display on Google vertical properties
Under the same commitment, Google also has promised to provide all websites the option to keep their content out of Google’s vertical search offerings, while still having them appear in Google’s general, or “organic,” web search results. The FTC investigated allegations that Google misappropriated content, such as user reviews and star ratings, from competing websites in order to improve its own vertical offerings, such as Google Local and Google Shopping. Some FTC Commissioners were concerned that this conduct might chill firms’ incentives to innovate on the Internet.
FTC’s investigation into allegations of search bias
The FTC conducted an extensive investigation into allegations that Google had manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties, a practice commonly known as “search bias.” In particular, the FTC evaluated Google’s introduction of “Universal Search” – a product that prominently displays targeted Google properties in response to specific categories of searches, such as shopping and local – to determine whether Google used that product to reduce or eliminate a nascent competitive threat. Similarly, the investigation focused on the allegation that Google altered its search algorithms to demote certain vertical websites in an effort to reduce or eliminate a nascent competitive threat. According to the Commission statement, however, the FTC concluded that the introduction of Universal Search, as well as additional changes made to Google’s search algorithms – even those that may have had the effect of harming individual competitors – could be plausibly justified as innovations that improved Google’s product and the experience of its users. It therefore has chosen to close the investigation.
The Commission would like to acknowledge the close cooperation in this matter with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition, and with the state Attorneys General of Texas, New York, Ohio, California, and Oklahoma.
The Commission vote to accept the consent agreement package containing the proposed consent order relating to standard-essential patents (SEPs) for public comment was 4-1, with Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen voting no. The vote to issue the Commission statement in the SEP matter was 3-0-2, with Commissioners Rosch and Ohlhausen abstaining. Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch issued a separate statement regarding the SEP matter; Commissioner Ohlhausen issued a dissenting statement regarding the SEP matter. The Commission vote to close the investigation related to Google’s search-related practices was 5-0. The vote to issue the Commission statement relating to the search investigation was 4-0-1, with Commissioner Rosch abstaining. Commissioner Rosch issued a statement concurring and dissenting with regard to the search investigation; and Commissioner Ohlhausen issued a concurring statement regarding the search investigation.
The FTC will publish a description of the consent agreement package in the Federal Register shortly. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days, beginning today and continuing through February 4, 2013, after which the Commission will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final. Interested parties can submit written comments electronically or in paper form by following the instructions in the “Invitation To Comment” part of the “Supplementary Information” section. Comments in electronic form should be submitted using the following Web link: https://ftcpublic.commentworks.com/ftc/motorolagoogleconsent and following the instructions on the web-based form. Comments in paper form should be mailed or delivered to: Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Secretary, Room H-113 (Annex D), 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20580. The FTC is requesting that any comment filed in paper form near the end of the public comment period be sent by courier or overnight service, if possible, because U.S. postal mail in the Washington area and at the Commission is subject to delay due to heightened security precautions.
NOTE: The Commission issues an administrative complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the respondent has actually violated the law. A consent order is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the respondent that the law has been violated. When the Commission issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $16,000.
The FTC’s Bureau of Competition works with the Bureau of Economics to investigate alleged anticompetitive business practices and, when appropriate, recommends that the Commission take law enforcement action. To inform the Bureau about particular business practices, call 202-326-3300, send an e-mail to antitrust{at}ftc{dot}gov, or write to the Office of Policy and Coordination, Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, 601 New Jersey Ave., Room 7117, Washington, DC 20580.

338,"January 4, 2013","Google Official Blog: Google â€œpleasedâ€ with FTC settlement, says company is good for users and competition","
In a statement on its official blog by Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, Google has announced it is “pleased” with the outcome of its longstanding case brought against the search giant by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which unanimously voted on January 3 to end the investigation without legal action. In its statement Google says, “The conclusions is clear: Google’s services are good for users and good for competition.” The two voluntary changes Google has presented to the Federal Trade Commission include “More choice for websites” and “More ad campaign control,” adding that the company will work to resolve issues surrounding standard-essential patent disputes through “a neutral third party.” Among one of the issues investigated by the FTC was whether Google was abusing its dominance by preventing rivals access to standard-essential patents – patents widely used in various electronic devices, namely smartphones. Google also noted that along with the FTC’s recent findings, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. courts and Brazilian courts have similarly concluded that Google’s business practices were legal.
The complete statement can be read below:
 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission today announced it has closed its investigation into Google after an exhaustive 19-month review that covered millions of pages of documents and involved many hours of testimony. The conclusion is clear: Google’s services are good for users and good for competition.
Larry and Sergey founded Google because they believed that building a great search experience would improve people’s lives. And in the decade-plus that’s followed, Google has worked hard to make it quicker and easier for users to find what they need. In the early days you would type in a query, we’d return 10 blue links and you’d have to click on them individually to find what you wanted. Today we can save you the hassle by providing direct answers to your questions, as well as links to other sites. So if you type in [weather san francisco], or [tom hanks movies], we now give you the answer right from the results page—because truly great search is all about turning your needs into actions in the blink of an eye.
As we made clear when the FTC started its investigation, we’ve always been open to improvements that would create a better experience. And today we’ve written (PDF) to the FTC making two voluntary product changes:

More choice for websites: Websites can already opt out of Google Search, and they can now remove content (for example reviews) from specialized search results pages, such as local, travel and shopping;
More ad campaign control: Advertisers can already export their ad campaigns from Google AdWords. They will now be able to mix and copy ad campaign data within third-party services that use our AdWords API.  In addition, we’ve agreed with the FTC (PDF) that we will seek to resolve standard-essential patent disputes through a neutral third party before seeking injunctions. This agreement establishes clear rules of the road for standards essential patents going forward.

We’ve always accepted that with success comes regulatory scrutiny. But we’re pleased that the FTC and the other authorities that have looked at Google’s business practices—including the U.S. Department of Justice (in its ITA Software review), the U.S. courts (in the SearchKing and Kinderstart cases), and the Brazilian courts (in a case last year)—have concluded that we should be free to combine direct answers with web results. So we head into 2013 excited about our ability to innovate for the benefit of users everywhere.

As rumors swirl that Google may be let off the hook by the Federal Trade Commission with merely a promise to change certain policies, some analysts are saying that the search giant may not be let off so easily in a simultaneously ongoing investigation by the European Commission. David Wood, speaking on behalf of persons involved in the Commission’s investigation, says that because the case in Europe involves third parties, if Commissioner Joaquin Almunia were to make a similar quick agreement with Google that is rumored to be in the works in the U.S., the case would be taken to the General Court by those third parties. Wood also argues that a quick settlement with Google without repercussions would send the wrong message, as many have criticized the Federal Trade Commission as doing in the rumored upcoming settlement in the U.S.

342,"December 17, 2012","U.S.: Sources say Google to offer concessions,  could walk away without repercussions from FTC","
According to reports, Google is in a position to end a longstanding antitrust suit with the Federal Trade Commission thanks to an alleged letter offering voluntary concessions that would alter how the search giant reprints rivals’ content as well as how Google allows its advertisers to compare ad data to its competitors. Two sources have said that the letter offering concessions would potentially end the investigation without any legal enforcement being taken up against Google. If the case were to end without any repercussions for Google, analysts say it would be a disappointing result for major competitors like Microsoft who claim Google abuses its dominance.

The agreement would not bar Google from seeking those injunctions altogether, however.

As a professor at George Mason University, Wright has been a part of research indirectly funded by Google. Some experts are concerned because Wright has previously defended the search giant over the FTC’s ongoing antitrust investigation. The recusal was recommended by the FTC general counsel’s office, citing President Obama’s ethics policy, which specifically recommends two years of recusal if there is found to be a conflict of interest within a case. Wright’s announcement comes at the same time as reports that E.U. and U.S. antitrust representatives will soon converge in Europe over their individual investigations into Google.

Google has been under investigation by the FTC for over a year but it is only recently that the concerns focused on Google’s alleged misuse of Motorola patents.

353,"October 17, 2012",E.U.: Regulators pressure Google to change privacy policy,"
In a letter to the CEO of Google Larry Page, 27 European data-protection agencies have asked Google to modify its global privacy policy that governs dozens of Google’s online services- including Google’s search engine, Android mobile phone apps, and YouTube videos – so that users have a clearer understanding of what personal data is being collected and shared with advertisers.
In its new privacy policy last winter, Google said it was collecting personal data, like the sex and age of users and their web browsing histories, only if users “opted in.” Google claims that the new policy respects European Union law, and is commitment to protecting users’ information. However, Policy regulators claim that Google provides users with incomplete disclosure, and makes it cumbersome for users to block the collection of these data. If Google accepts the regulators recommendations, then customers will have the option to ‘opt out’ from sharing their personal information, which may hinder Google’s advertising revenue.
In addition to the letter to Mr. Page, Antitrust officials at the European Commission are investigating whether Google has used its search engine to favor its own services and through preferential rankings to put competitors at a disadvantage.

355,"October 16, 2012",How the FTC Could Beat Google,"
Robert Lande, Jonathan Rubin, Oct 16, 2012
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is rumored to be deciding whether to bring a “pure Section 5” case against Google as a result of complaints that the company unfairly favors its own offerings over those of its rivals in its search results. If successful, the case could do more than improve competition in the crucial multi-billion dollar online marketplace. It also could revitalize Section 5 of the FTC Act and solidify the agency’s authority to prevent the  “unfair methods of competition” or “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” that do not violate the other Antitrust or Consumer Protection statutes. But the case will fail miserably at the hands of a reviewing court and the agency will be confined to relatively non-controversial enforcement violations if the FTC fails to impose upon itself a tightly bounded and constrained legal framework that contains clear limiting principles.
As former FTC Chairman Bill Kovacic recently warned, an unbounded Section 5 case will never be sustained by a reviewing court. He is correct. The FTC’s 2008 N-Data settlement, for example, would have been overturned if it had reached the appellate court because its Section 5 formulation was without constraining principles. There is clear Supreme Court precedent holding that the FTC Act is broader than the other antitrust laws and covers incipient violations and conduct violating even the “spirit” of, or policies underlying, the other antitrust laws. Nevertheless, the only way a court will allow the FTC to pursue a pure Section 5 theory against Google would be if the agency constrains itself with a coherent principle of competitive harm: the consumer choice framework.

Recently, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating Google’s conduct in its Internet search and search advertising businesses. According to the New York Times, this focus now revolves around smartphone patents, especially technology patents, and the conduct of Google’s Motorola Mobility subsidiary. Google currently owns patents covering communications and data-handling technologies that are crucial for the basic operation of smartphones and tablets. However, it has gained an unfair advantage when it agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion and picked up 17,000 patents, including large important ones relating to wireless devices. In June, the FTC sought information from Google and smartphone rivals including Apple and Microsoft, through questioning representatives of the companies. The F.T.C. investigation shows that it is keeping an eye on the patent buildup up by Google and other high-tech companies.

Without a settlement structure, Google would leave itself open to being fined as much as 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue – which reached nearly $38 billion USD last year – and conform to any E.U. law it was found to violate before being allowed to appeal to the General Court of the European Union. Instead of proceeding with formal charges, Mr. Almunia offered Google a chance to reach an amicable solution. It was the most significant sign yet that E.U. regulators were seeking to avoid a battle that would drag out for a decade or more, as happened in previous cases involving two U.S. technology giants, Microsoft and Intel.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is at its final stags in the Google investigations and the defining Google as a monopolist in the market for internet based searching is maybe not as clear as it seems at first sight. On the one hand, for the second straight month Bing saw its U.S. search engine market share on the rise. Meanwhile, Google held steady, duplicating its record share of the search market, while Yahoo held steady after 10 months of declines – maybe the recent decline is a Google strategy?. On the other hand, the growing percentage with more sustainable consumer-focused eCommerce initiatives, centered around local availability, might dilute the market definition and puts pressure on Google to be innovative – the Google Wallet, Google Shopping, and Google Trusted Stores.
Maybe the definition of the market here is a bit trickier and the FTC has a difficult role. Google might indeed be competing against Bing, Yahoo and now Apple, Amazon and also Facebook. The market might be broader than general internet search engines. Many are awaiting the FTC decision and their definition, but for now lets “wait and read”. To read more…

The holding of the patents by Mosaid may thus discourage smartphone manufacturers from using the Android OS.

Korea’s Fair Trade Commission has raided Google’s Korea offices this week, making it the fourth investigation of the search company since September 2011. The raid concerns two issues. The first is the complaint lodged by NHN and Daum Communications, which alleges that Google Korea has entered into agreements with smartphone manufacturers to exclude apps provided by competing Korean search engines. The second issue is whether Google Korea has been obstructing the FTC’s on-site investigations with acts such as concealing documents.

Stephen Houck, May 14, 2012
In the wake of the U.S. government’s unsuccessful prosecution of IBM (begun in 1969 and dropped in 1982), many knowledgeable observers believed that of the Sherman Act was no longer relevant and was too cumbersome to apply to fast-moving high-tech companies. The government’s prosecution of Microsoft, settled in 2001, proved them wrong.
Government antitrust enforcement agencies are now considering the applicability of to certain of Google’s practices, like its display of thematic search results. It is crucial that the government get it right. For one thing, an unsuccessful enforcement action is an enormous drain on resources that means significant lost opportunity costs for the government agency. An erroneous enforcement decision also risks undermining hard-won, infrequent government victories like Microsoft by creating precedents that will make future enforcement even more difficult than it already is today. And, most importantly, an ill-conceived enforcement action, especially in a rapidly evolving business like search, may actually impair consumer welfare by deterring and distorting innovation. This is a particular concern where the objective of those who encourage government action is to protect less efficient competitors rather than consumers.

The important competitive role played by information providers like credit-rating agencies is not matched by a well-developed competition analysis for the informational problems they pose. To be sure, competition law has developed approaches to some informational issues, such as collective suppression of information and misleading statements directed at competing products. But it has not focused on allegations of anticompetitive manipulation of information by firms whose business is the provision of product ratings. This essay suggests that a requirement imposed on credit-rating agencies in the recent Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation is also well-suited to address competition issues.

The Full Federal Court has upheld the ACCC’s appeal against Google in a misleading advertisement case. The advertisements at issue were designed to look like search results. The results took the form of a business name, product name, or web address of a competitor’s business. That business was unrelated to the advertiser, yet when a user clicked on what appeared to be a link to the competitor, they were taken to the advertiser’s website.
In October 2011, the ACCC appealed from the decision of Federal Court Justice Nicholas, on the basis that he erred in finding that Google did not “make” the representations in the four advertisements at issue. Justice Nicholas had found that Google had only “communicated” what the advertiser made.
The Full Federal Court found that Google’s role in publishing the advertisements amounted to misleading or deceptive conduct, in violation of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Court explains, “It is Google’s technology which creates that which is displayed. Google  did not merely repeat or pass on a statement by the advertiser.”

Isabel Davies, Holly Strube, Jun 22, 2011

In the first article on this topic, we discussed the position following the first draft settlement agreement in the Google Books dispute, presenting it in a broader European policy context. However, for those who don’t recall the article, the background to this case is as follows. In the autumn of 2005 the Author’s Guild and the Association of American Publishers brought a class action lawsuit against Google challenging the scanning in of in-copyright books. Under U.S. law, court approval is required for the settlement of a class action. The judge presiding over the case is required to determine whether any settlement reached is fair, reasonable, and adequate to the class on whose behalf it was negotiated.
The parties produced a first draft settlement agreement.  However, this was amended due to the number of objections lodged, in particular by the U.S. Department of Justice. The fairness hearing in relation to this Google Books settlement agreement was held on February 18, 2010. Judge Chin, presiding, took into consideration strong opposition from the Department of Justice, governments of France and Germany, Google’s most prominent competitors, public interest organizations, and hundreds of authors and publishers and turned it down. The amended settlement agreement was presented to Judge Chin; his judgment on this amended agreement was handed down in March 2011.
This article will first look at this Amended Settlement Agreement (“ASA), which was before Judge Chin for his consideration, and then Judge Chin’s decision. It will look at potential changes to copyright law and, finally, it will look at the European Commission’s current position on mass digitization.

409,"June 22, 2011",After Google Book Search: Rebooting the Digital Library,"
Randal Picker, Jun 22, 2011

After more than a year of silence, on March 22, 2011, Judge Denny Chin rejected the proposed settlement in the Google book search (“GBS”) case. In the court’s view, the innovative settlement asked more than U.S. class-action rules could deliver and would, in Judge Chin’s words “simply go too far.” The settlement not only resolved possible liability issues for past acts by Google but would also have put in place an extensive forward-looking business arrangement. In the court’s view, Congress was the better forum for establishing the new regime set forth in the settlement agreement. The court did suggest a path forward but one that would undermine many of the potential benefits of GBS.
The rejection of the settlement (known formally as the Amended Settlement Agreement or “ASA’) means that we are at a point of rebooting how we design our digital library future. There were many criticisms of GBS and the settlement but perhaps chief among those was the risk that approval of the settlement would have locked in a single approach to digital libraries. Google would have received unique access to the so-called orphan works and that would have provided it what may have been a decisive advantage against digital library competitors, both private and public. As we move forward on the orphan works, we need to do so with two principles in mind. First, we need to enable broad competing uses of the orphan works while, to the greatest extent possible, respecting the rights of the orphan works holders. Second, we should not repeat the mistake of the GBS settlement by somehow tilting the table in favor of digital library monopoly, either public or private.
We should want to foster a rich digital library ecosystem. GBS makes clear that we can have large-scale private digital libraries. That is an important development and one that we should seek to enable. If we create use rights for copyrighted works for digital libraries, we should be sure to make those privileges available to both public digital libraries and private digital libraries such as GBS and its successors. Our existing statutory safe harbors for libraries favor noncommercial libraries and archives. The emergence of GBS suggests that that is too narrow a conception of what libraries can be in the digital age and we need a statutory scheme that supports that.

Much of the discussion surrounding the ASA considers the economic power that Google would have if it was approved and the impact on Google’s book selling competitors. However, the point that seems secondary in this analysis, the actual content of the scanned books, is, from a librarian’s perspective, very important. Having online access to the contents of the book collection from a library such as the University of Michigan would be remarkable in and of itself. Adding collections from other great academic library systems such as the Universities of Texas, California, and more would create a unique resource with unparalleled research opportunities.

There is no doubt that the grand idea of scanning millions of books and making them available to the world’s readers is spectacular. There is no doubt that public good can flow from it. However, the current settlement conferred a too immense private good, and annoyed too many ordinary people who had eloquent voices. Since the copying is far advanced, it seems unlikely that the project will be abandoned, so a more cautious, better balanced regime seems the most likely outcome. Again, there may be a broader message for Google’s aspirations as to other activities-searches, maps, private addresses, and privacy generally. The message may be “Prune the exuberant aspirations and go more cautiously.”

413,"January 28, 2011","Google, IBM, SAP, and The Others: Is the European Commission Targeting Technology Firms?","
Lorenzo Coppi, Jan 27, 2011

The European Commission has recently opened an antitrust investigation in connection to Google’s commercial practices. This is just the last of a number of recent investigations in the high-tech sector, which have involved Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Rambus, Apple, and SAP.
After reviewing the scope of the European Commission’s investigation of Google (on the basis of the available public information), this article focuses on the question of whether there are characteristics of the high tech sector which make it particularly prone to monopolization or anticompetitive foreclosure, and which justify the European Commission’s apparent focus on the sector.
First the article discusses the reasons militating in favor of close scrutiny of the technology sector, namely the tendency of high tech markets to be significantly concentrated, and the fact that high tech products tend to have significant complementarity and interoperability relationships which make exclusion of competitors a tangible possibility.
Then the article reviews the argument against close scrutiny of the technology sector, namely the fact that it is characterized by dynamic, fast-changing, platform competition, and that the legitimate by-product of innovative behavior is a transitory monopoly, the curbing of which may chill innovation incentives.
The article concludes that, on balance, high tech markets are a reasonable target for antitrust scrutiny because they have a propensity to “tip to monopoly;” exclusion of competitors is fairly easy and often profitable; the effects of market power on incentives to innovate are uncertain; and the sector is very important to the economy.  Obviously this does not mean that all the cases the European Commission is investigating have merit-only time will tell if that is the case.

414,"January 27, 2011","Keywords: Google, European Commission. Anyone Feeling Lucky?","
Lia Vitzilaiou, Jan 27, 2011

On November 30, 2010, the European Commission issued a press release which many were worried about, others looking forward to, but almost everyone anticipated: Google is under formal antitrust investigation with regard to an alleged abuse of dominance in the online search market.
The Commission will investigate three main issues. The first is whether Google has manipulated its unpaid or “algorithmic” search results by giving preferential placement to its own results while lowering the ranking of those offered by competitors, i.e. vertical search engines. The second issue is whether Google has imposed exclusivity contracts on its advertising partners, preventing them from placing ads on competitive websites. Finally, the Commission will look into whether Google has restricted the portability of online advertising campaign data to competing online advertising platforms.
This development was expected by most, not only because Google has recently been the center of attention for many national competition authorities (the latest being the Italian antitrust investigation in the Google News Service which ended by compromise) but also because the Commission seems to have lately targeted powerful technology companies. Since 2004, when Microsoft was fined EUR 497 million for abuse of dominance, to 2008 when a further EUR 899 million penalty was imposed for failure to comply with the 2004 ruling, up to 2009 when Intel was fined a historic EUR 1.1 billion, also for abuse of dominance, the Commission has shown a strong interest in the high-tech industry, apparently feeling confident it has the sophistication to tackle the complex issues arising in such innovative markets.
This Commission investigation targets the core of the Google business, i.e. its search engine, and naturally has attracted a lot of controversy. For example, there is speculation that this is an attack partly assisted by Microsoft, which recently merged its search business with Yahoo’s in order to challenge Google’s market lead.This assertion is based on the fact that Microsoft owns one of the plaintiffs (Ciao!) as well as a price comparison service in Germany, and it sponsors a trade grouping called ICOM, a member of which is another plaintiff called Fodem, a British price comparison service.If this is the case, then there might be more competition in the search engine market than initially appears.
Also controversially, Benjamin Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, recently published the results of a study conducted of Google’s search engine, which allegedly show that there exists what he calls a “hard coded bias” that overrides the normal algorithmic results in order to put a Google answer first. In another study, he suggests that this “distortion” is identified with almost all leading search engines, including Yahoo!, but supposedly Google promotes its own services significantly more than others.
Google can be expected to bring forth evidence to contest such arguments. As we are not yet in a position to reach solid conclusions on such complex technical issues to answer the core question of whether Google tampers with its search results or not, it is safer to look at the available facts and pose some other questions also relevant to the competition analysis.
The first question is whether Google has a motive to tamper with its search results, in view of the two-sided platform market it operates. The second question is whether it is Google or the Commission who should “be feeling lucky” in the present dispute. And finally, if the “holy grail” of a neutral search engine is behind the Commission investigation, is this a realistic pursuit?

This month saw the development of two new issues in the Google Book Settlement Case. The Department of Justice in effect, said “nice try” but continued to reject Google’s revised approach to how to deal with copyright and orphan book issues. Stanford University, on the other hand, gave Google a big pat on the back and opened up all of their book archives to google (they had previously scanned over 1.7 million books  owned by Stanford, and now plan to scan millions more.
There has been much written about this and there will be much more. On this site, our latest entry in the debate is James Grimmelmann’s article: The Amended Google Books Settlement Is Still Exclusive.
Wherever you choose to research the topic, we urge you to do so. The issues raised in the Google Book Settlement are complex and  have aroused strong debate among legal, business, academic, and other  scholars and         experts. Much of the discussion is technical, legal, and  esoteric. However, the end result will not only govern how a student,  scholar, or casual         reader will be able to browse, read, and reference books in the  future. The agreement will also have a wide-ranging impact on how access  to all         information on a global scale will be protected, controlled,  disseminated, and priced. Everyone who reads a book, researches anything  online, uses         copyright protection for an original work, or uses the internet  will be impacted and should understand the debate and its eventual  conclusion.

416,"February 2, 2010",The Amended Google Books Settlement Is Still Exclusive,"
James Grimmelmann, Jan 26, 2010

The deal that Google would get under the proposed amended settlement in the Authors Guild case is exclusive in one very important sense. Many out-of-print books are so-called “orphan works”: they’re in copyright, but their copyright owners can’t be found. If you or I start printing new copies of these books, we’d be copyright infringers, subject to statutory damages of up to $150,000 a book—or even jail time. Google, on the other hand, will be authorized to sell online copies of these books. That’s exclusivity: permission to do what is forbidden to others.
Some pro-settlement commentators have challenged this view. They believe that the market for electronic editions of orphan books is open to Google’s competitors.They make three principal claims: first, that the settlement creates no new entry barriers; second, that it explicitly enables the new Book Rights Registry to issue licenses to competitors; and third, that competitors could reasonably expect to obtain class-action settlements substantially identical to Google’s. All three of these propositions are wrong. In this essay, I will explain why.

Randal Picker, Oct 29, 2009
In this brief note, I address three points. First, I do a quick status update on competition issues in the case. Second, I turn to a key issue that has emerged in the commentary on the competition issues; namely, what is the right way to frame the competition policy baseline for assessing whether a new arrangement such as GBS is pro-competitive? That question is of general interest to the intersection of antitrust and innovation policy and given the importance of both to the health of the economy, it is critical that we get the baseline question right. We will be misled if we simply track expansions in output. Clever cartelists will want to cartelize new industries in their infancy, as they know that a new product innovation will inevitably raise output, even if it does so by much less than we would see in the face of full competition. And innovators will want to bundle anticompetitive features with competitive ones if they know that they are simply being judged against the pre-innovation baseline. Third, as applied to the Google Book Search settlement itself, antitrust enforcers need to disentangle the genuine benefits of the project from anticompetitive features. Obviously, that is a conventional problem in antitrust but it means here that product innovation can’t be used as a general shield against standard antitrust analysis. A single infrastructure such as the digitized book scans can be used to offer many products simultaneously and competitive benefits from one product cannot insulate anticompetitive steps in a second product using that same infrastructure.

Ian Forrester, Oct 29, 2009
If we are not abolishing copyright law, the proposed project raises several concerns. Some may say that copyright laws are too slow and do not adapt to developments in technology, the demands of teenagers, and the promises of novel technology. True, from the beginning of the twentieth century, content providers have fretted over the encroachment on their interests by new technology. Movie makers and artists worry that peer-to-peer sharing takes a lot of money away from the artists, and the music industry estimates that there has been an immense loss to due to unauthorized reproduction. On the other hand, the success of the Apple iPod and YouTube prove that new techniques can make music and movies more easily accessible, can increase demand, and can bring extra revenues to the creators or extra levels of audience awareness. There is no obviously correct answer. I am content to observe that opinions are sharply divided, both as to music and moving images. However, creating an equivalent to You Tube for the book industry is a bit startling. One author might be pleased that five thousand enthusiasts had studied his work on-line whereas another author might prefer to see fifty works sold in hard copy: it is easy to understand the two points of view.

Einer Elhauge, Oct 29, 2009
Proper analysis of the Google books settlement requires framing the issues correctly in two important respects. First, it requires understanding that sound antitrust analysis turns on likely effects on consumer welfare, not on debatable spins of arid formalisms. Second, it requires measuring those effects compared to the but-for baseline of what the world would look like but for the settlement. Given the proper framing, the right question to ask is: Does the settlement lower consumer welfare from what it would be without a settlement? It is not an antitrust violation to enter into an agreement that benefits consumer welfare on the theory that another agreement could have benefited consumer welfare even more. Otherwise every joint venture could be stricken on the grounds that it would benefit consumer welfare even more if the joint venture offered its product for free.

At first blush, the Google Books Settlement does not have effect in Europe. Google has stated that it does not currently plan to launch Google Books outside the United States. In addition, readers outside the United States will not benefit from the service even if Google does reach a settlement because the service will not be available outside the United States. But what about the European (or for that reason any other non-U.S. national) authors who previously published copyright-protected but now out-of-print publications in the United States that Google now wishes to scan and make available to the public through the Google Books facility? Critics have suggested that Google Books will effectively create a de facto monopoly on digital access to a huge number of works, including those belonging to Europeans.

Google’s actions in this matter, and perhaps others (e.g., interlocking directorates), are taking place against a backdrop of the promise from the Obama administration’s antitrust authorities to give single-firm conduct the attention they believe it deserved but did not get during the prior administration. The leading indicator of this changed attitude is Antitrust Division’s decision to withdraw, as too lax, the Department of Justice’s report on how to assess the competitive effects of single-firm conduct. If that was not enough, the Google Books matter also brings to mind the increasing importance in an information-based economy of intellectual property in this case copyright and the tension many perceive between the exclusivity of IP and the openness of competition. Closely related to that point is the substitution of digital content delivery for traditional hard-copy based methods; a development affecting not just books but audio recordings, newspapers, and films.

On March 11, 2008, the European Commission unconditionally cleared Google Inc.’s acquisition of DoubleClick Inc. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) previously closed its investigation on December 20, 2007, also without imposing any conditions on the transaction. Both the Commission and the FTC conducted extraordinarily thorough reviews, investigating a wide range of theories of harm raised by various complainants. The majority of these complainants were Google’s competitors. Their theories ranged from the economically unsound to the truly bizarre. No coherent theme emerged from the complainants’ hodgepodge of theories, and indeed many theories were both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with other complainants’ assertions. Nonetheless, the agencies carefully considered and rejected each of these theories. Review of the Google/DoubleClick transaction was the agencies’ first extensive investigation of the online advertising industry; accordingly, they addressed at length (and expended agency resources analyzing) even some of the more frivolous theories complainants raised.

Stephen Kinsella, David Went, Mar 17, 2008
Last week, following an investigation that lasted almost six months but that did not result in a statement of objections, the European Commission cleared Google’s acquisition of ad serving company DoubleClick. While this result had been widely anticipated for a number of weeks, not many transactions cleared unconditionally have stirred up such hot debate on both sides of the Atlantic and attracted the level of press coverage afforded to this transaction. Perhaps one of the most controversial aspects of the transaction relates to the reams of information acquired and routinely stored by Google and DoubleClick through their Internet activities. Certainly much of the debate in the press has focused on data protection and privacy issues and the fact that the transaction would merge the parties’ two vast databases on consumers’ online habits. Although the Commission was no doubt right in its final decision to exclude data protection and privacy issues from its merger control review, the Google/DoubleClick transaction highlights how antitrust concerns in vertical mergers can arise from access to information and the market power that information can confer.

Google’s proposed acquisition of DoubleClick generated significant controversy when it was announced in early 2007. Complainants (many of whom were competitors of Google) raised a number of superficially plausible but inaccurate claims. One of the most prominent was that the two firms were “horizontal competitors” in online advertising. The combined company, critics claimed, would end up dominating the industry. However, what these critics failed to recognize, and what the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission correctly concluded, was that the two firms were at best potential competitors in each other’s markets, and that those markets were already robustly competitive and becoming more so each day.

The big three cloud service providers, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, account for nearly three-quarters of the European cloud market, according to data published by Synergy Research Group.
And although all three companies have been subject to various EU antitrust investigations over the years, their respective cloud businesses have not yet felt the full force of European competition law.
Related: EU Telecom Regulators Are Against US Big Tech Paying For Infrastructure
That said, the European Commission (EC) has been investigating Microsoft for anticompetitive practices after complaints were filed by rival cloud providers, including Germany’s Nextcloud and France’s OVHcloud, last year.
No formal probe has been launched since, but the implementation of changes to Microsoft’s outsourcing and hosting terms in October has been widely perceived as an attempt to appease the EU’s antitrust concerns.
The revised terms are intended to make it easier for users of Microsoft’s software products to deploy them on non-Azure cloud servers and form part of the Big Tech firm’s previous commitments to support European cloud providers.
Yet the recent amendments weren’t enough to stop the trade association Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) from filing another complaint with the European Commission earlier this month, alleging that the new terms not only fail to address Microsoft’s market abuse, but add new unfair practices to its contractual requirements.
“Microsoft’s ongoing position and behaviors are irreparably damaging the European cloud ecosystem and depriving European customers of choice in their cloud deployments,” CISPE stated, urging the EC to launch a formal inquiry.

The FTC’s four commissioners haven’t taken the time to vote out a complaint or even meet with the lawyers from Microsoft and Activision, but the FTC staff reviewing the deal are “skeptical of the companies’ arguments.”

As for where the deal stands, much of the “heavy lifting” has been completed, including depositions of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick. This means a decision on a potential antitrust lawsuit could arrive as soon as December.
The main crux of the problem, according to the FTC, is some worry this deal will give “Microsoft an unfair boost in the video game market.”
Sony has, obviously, been one of the biggest opponents against the deal, and the question of where Call of Duty will appear has been one of the hottest topics. Despite Xbox head Phil Spencer stating Call of Duty will continue to ship on PlayStation “as long as there’s a PlayStation to ship to,” there are still concerns with what other issues this deal may create.
Sony has previously said that Microsoft is a “Tech Titan buying up irreplaceable content at incontestable prices ($68.7 billion) to tip competition to itself.”
There are concerns beyond Call of Duty, however, as there is worry about what future mega-hit titles will do to tip the scales if they are locked behind one platform.
Google is also said to be against the deal, claiming Microsoft has “purposely degraded the quality of its Game Pass subscription service when used with Google’s Chrome operating system.” If the deal were to go through, it believes it would “further [Microsoft’s] incentive to do so.”

452,"November 21, 2022",Too Many Economists Are Using a Flawed Theory To Defend Dominant Platforms’ Self-Preferencing Practices,"
By: David J. Balan (ProMarket/Econ One)
Congress is currently considering two bills whose purpose is to address dominant tech platforms’ potentially anti-competitive practices. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) prohibits “self-preferencing,” such as when Google favors Google-affiliated search results over unaffiliated ones, or when Amazon favors its own products sold on the Amazon platform over those of its rivals. The Open App Markets Act (OAMA) prohibits self-preferencing in app marketplaces (Apple’s “App Store” and Google’s “Google Play”) and requires that consumers be allowed to “side-load” third-party apps onto their phones rather than have to purchase them through the app marketplaces.
AICOA and OAMA respond to the concern that these practices might be a way for a dominant platform owner to leverage its existing market power to gain additional market power over goods and services advertised or sold on its platform. A related concern is that the practices might be a way for a platform owner to thwart the entry of potential rivals that may have eventually displaced it from its dominant position. In what follows, I refer to these possible anti-competitive outcomes as “expanding” and “extending” market power.
These concerns seem intuitive. If a firm owns a platform and also operates on that platform, and if its current or potential future rivals need to operate on that platform (which they likely will if the platform is dominant), then it seems obvious that the platform owner has the ability and the incentive to engage in self-preferencing and related practices to disadvantage those rivals. To use a well-worn metaphor, it would seem straightforwardly problematic to allow the platform owner to be both a player and the referee in the same game.
However, the “Single Monopoly Profit” (SMP) theory–famously associated with the Chicago School of economics and developed during the second half of the 20th century–purports to demonstrate that no such problem exists. In its strongest, most orthodox form, the key result of SMP theory is that a firm with market power in one market (such as a dominant platform owner) can do no better than to simply enjoy, for as long as it lasts, the “single monopoly profit” associated with that market power. Any attempt to use practices such as self-preferencing to expand or extend that market power must backfire, reducing profits rather than increasing them.
The logic behind SMP theory—as it applies to self-preferencing conduct—can be described as having two prongs (see here for a more detailed discussion). The first prong observes that any practices chosen by a platform owner that deviate from those that a neutral owner (i.e., an owner who does not also operate on the platform) would have chosen must decrease the platform’s profits. The reason is that the neutral owner chooses practices that maximize profits, which means that any different practices must result in lower profits. Self-preferencing is by definition such a deviation, so self-preferencing must reduce the platform’s profits. This prong is really just a version of the “no free lunch” idea (rightly) beloved of economists, and it is valid…

A lawsuit filed on behalf of YouTube TV subscribers across four states accuses Disney of using its market power to unfairly jack up prices on their virtual pay TV service, Yahoo reported. 
Disney allegedly used ESPN and its controlling stake in Hulu to set price floors in the streaming market, according to the proposed class action filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, filed Nov. 18.
Proposed class action suit correctly notes that YouTube TV’s price has doubled since ESPN’s corporate overlord took control of Hulu.
Related: Walmart Talks Streaming Deal With Disney, Comcast & Paramount
The subscribers blame Disney for the “near doubling of their subscription prices.” The base package for YouTube TV, which is controlled by Google, has increased from $35/month when it debuted five years ago to $65/month. The subscribers also note that when Google and Disney were unable to reach a new contract in late 2021, Google briefly dropped Disney channels (including ABC, FX, Freeform, Nat Geo, History and ESPN among others) and lowered the price to a more affordable $50.
Disney controls Hulu + Live TV, the second-largest competitor in the SLPTV market after YouTube TV. It also owns 80% of ESPN, which is said to be the most expensive channel on basic cable and streaming plans; some estimates price it at $9 or more per month.
According to the complaint, Disney’s carriage agreements mandate that if an SLPTV provider carries ESPN, it must be included in the lowest-priced bundles. Market-leading SLPTV services (YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream) include ESPN. Consumers who don’t want to pay for ESPN, the complaint charges, have no option to opt out. This generates a so-called “ESPN tax” that forces subscribers who don’t watch ESPN to pay for it nonetheless. That, in turn, benefits Disney as well as subscribers who watch ESPN but don’t need to pay more for it in a premium package.

Those bills, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act, would prevent the big tech companies from using their platforms to freeze out competitors.

During the Thursday meeting, one senior White House official said they believed the bills have enough votes to pass, according to Garry Tan, the incoming CEO of startup fund Y Combinator, who attended the gathering.
“They believe that there are 60 votes,” Tan told Bloomberg News. He declined to name the White House official.

Interoperability is being put forward as a structural remedy to resolve issues of market power in networks — particularly, social media. When network effects are present, this means that it is possible that having one or a few operators is not only what arises but also efficient at any given point in time. Regulators can only be assured that a situation is efficient if there is potential competition that can bolster innovation by incumbents. A degree of interoperability to make any centralised outcomes contestable even if it does not lead to lower concentration per se. For social media networks, it is suggested that the principle of allowing the portability of identity (similar to interconnection in telecommunications) would be an appropriate goal with respect to the practical implementation of interoperability.

I. INTRODUCTION
Social media was built for network effects. Launch a social media platform, and its entire success is built upon whether people use it to interact with other people (regardless of knowing them personally or not). From a media perspective, the content is (mostly) provided by users, but the attention garnered and a platform’s ability to monetize it through advertising rivals all forms of old media where the content was created by skilled practitioners. The difference is that user-generated content has the potential to be ‘two-way.’ That is, I provide content intending that others will interact with it and vice vers...

457,"November 17, 2022",Tearing Down Walled Gardens: Encouraging Adversarial Interoperability to Promote Competition,"
The concentration of the Internet economy behind the walled gardens of a select few companies has led policymakers across the political spectrum to call for congressional action. However, most legislation proposed thus far takes an overly punitive approach to Big Tech that is unlikely to create the conditions necessary for a truly competitive digital environment. A better way to promote competition in digital markets is by encouraging upstart companies to adversarially interoperate with dominant platforms. Large online platforms have weaponized the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other laws to ward off nascent competitors, making adversarial interoperability difficult. To open up the digital economy, lawmakers should turn their attention to reforming portions of the CFAA to prevent its abuse. By doing so, Congress would take a significant step toward reopening the Internet.

I. INTRODUCTION
As it emerged from its embryonic phase of government-supported experimentation, the Internet was open and protocol-driven. Looking at new commercial frontiers, upstart companies built radical new technologies and iterated on each other’s successes. This adversarial environment was hyper-competitive in a way that few markets have ever been, and it matured through boom-and-bust cycles. But today, the concentration of the Internet’s tech stack among a few large companies has created a closed ecosystem of walled gardens and points of control, causing ...

458,"November 17, 2022",Interoperability as a Remedy in Antitrust Cases,"
Interoperability between the products and services of different firms promotes competition by lowering switching costs. Requiring dominant firms to make their products interoperable, or reducing barriers to interoperability, are important components of competition policy for the digital age. This article makes the case for interoperability remedies in antitrust enforcement actions against Internet services. It explains the problem of “gatekeeper” firms in Internet-related markets, and describes the ways that Internet services can interoperate with one another, including through “competitive compatibility” achieved without permission from an incumbent firm. The article then lays out a spectrum of remedies that antitrust enforcers or private litigants can pursue to promote interoperability, from mandates on an incumbent firm to bans on interfering with a bona fide interoperator. Finally, the article explains how interoperability can be reconciled with the protection of users’ privacy.

Interoperability has always been a powerful pro-competitive tool in high-tech markets. The ability to build new products and services that are compatible with established products gives consumers more choices and helps competitors avoid entry barriers. That’s why so many iconic exercises of competition policy can be seen as interoperability remedies, from the Federal Communications Commission’s 1965 Carterfone order, to the conditions imposed on Microsoft...

After a long study period, Australia’s anti-trust body has proposed a series of new laws, regulations, and penalties intended to constrain Apple, Google, and others.
Apple and Google have both previously protested against the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) antitrust investigations, and most recently Google was fined $40 million by the regulator for location tracking. Now the ACCC has published what it calls an interim report, and which calls for extensive regulatory reform.

“Our analysis has identified significant consumer and competition harms across a range of digital platform services,” writes the ACCC in the full report. “These include financial losses to scams and unresolved disputes, reduced choice and an inability to make informed choices, reduced innovation and quality, and higher (monetary and non-monetary) prices.”
“The conduct causing these harms is widespread, entrenched, and systemic,” it continues. “The ACCC has observed high levels of concentration and entrenched market power in relation to app store (Google and Apple), search (Google), ad tech (Google) and social media (Meta) services.”

Neo-Brandeisian policies that would chill acquisitions by highly capitalized companies, or companies with 30%+ market share in some related market, would remove from the competitive race the companies that often have the best prospects for de-consolidating many markets, including digital markets that are prone to tipping.

By Maureen K. Ohlhausen & Taylor M. Owings[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Neo-Brandeisians are in control at the White House, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”). Raising barriers to mergers is in; concern about the impact of overenforcement is out. The classic Borkian antitrust “paradox” (that certain misguided forms of antitrust enforcement can be counterproductive to the goal of increasing competition) is out of vogue and maligned in public discourse. A little over a year since the Biden Executive Order on competition,[2] it’s helpful to take stock of the Administration’s policy on mergers and whether it risks falling into the original paradox of counterproductive overenforcement.
 
II. THE POLICY
Public statements from President Biden, FTC Chair Lina Khan, and Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter have all sounded the call that antitrust enforcers should be discouraging or blocking more mergers.[3] The Biden Executive Order on competition prompted a joint FTC/DOJ statement expressing skepticism that the merger guidelines accurately reflect current economic rea...

Contemporary merger guidelines are heavily dependent on empirical observations of past and present markets. This feature makes the guidelines inadequate for addressing market power in the dynamic high-tech industries. Competition regulators should redirect merger policies towards focusing on industry features that do or that will create market power – i.e. protect firms from competitive pressure – and then adopt policies that challenge mergers that would extend the reach of such monopoly-inducing features. Antitrust strategies for diminishing the presence of such features to the extent practicable would also be in order.

By Mark A. Jamison[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Companies engage in mergers for many reasons, including to respond to deregulation or to technology change, or because of a desire to achieve scale or acquire resources.[2] Another reason is to eliminate existing or potential competition in specific markets.[3] Because of this potential of lessening competition, antitrust regulators scrutinize and potentially stop mergers that, in their opinions, have a high likelihood of decreasing competition to the harm of consumers.[4]
Merger analysis is generally a two-step process where, first, the competition authority defines the markets where the merger might increase power – i.e. the ability to avoid competitive pressure – and second, whether the merger does indeed result in greater market power to the harm of consumers.[5] The first step is data intensive ...

In a major policy switch, federal antitrust agencies recently announced increased hostility to vertical mergers. Stated reasons include skepticism of their benefits and of remedies traditionally used to control their competitive risks. Based on the long enforcement history involving vertical mergers, the agencies’ concerns are materially overstated. Since February 2022, agency litigation threats led to voluntary termination of several deals, but the agencies lost both of the other cases that were tried. While subject to further appeal, the meticulous reasoning of each seems persuasive. When mergers do not involve competitors and the parties offer plausible business justifications, it takes sophisticated analysis, strong factual support and effective advocacy to explain to an objective decision maker why they pose antitrust concerns sufficient to justify prohibition. The agencies should consider the lessons of their recent defeats. Any new vertical merger policy should be based on a balanced, thorough and realistic assessment of the key relevant considerations: the competitive risks of vertical transactions, their potential competitive benefits, and the availability of limited conduct remedies to address the second-order competitive issues present in some transactions.

New Zealand competition regulator The Commerce Commission has granted authorisation to allow industry association the News Publishers’ Association of New Zealand (NPA) to collectively negotiate with Meta and Google regarding the terms and conditions on which participating news media companies’ content is displayed on digital platforms operated by Meta and Google, for a 10 year period.
The Commission notes that it may authorise an arrangement such as collective bargaining if, despite any potential detriment from the arrangement, the arrangement will nonetheless likely result in a benefit to the public.
After consulting on its draft determination, the Commission says it reached the view that the benefits of collective bargaining in this case are likely to outweigh any possible harms.

“The benefits of collective bargaining include enabling participating news media companies to pool their resources and reduce the transaction costs of negotiations. Collective negotiation may also put smaller media companies in a better position to negotiate with Google and Meta than might otherwise be the case, which may lead to more and better news content,” the Commission notes in a statement released today.
Chair Anna Rawlings says, “The NPA’s collective bargaining arrangement is likely to allow the news media companies to pool their resources, improve their bargaining power when they are negotiating with Google and Meta, such that they obtain better contract terms, and ultimately improve the production of news content”.

In the letter that was shared by Vox, Warren says that Google, Apple, and Amazon are leveraging their market power in digital app markets, mobile operating systems, and data infrastructure to become “the dominant players in the automotive sphere,” which Warren says has “alarming implications for developers, workers, and consumers.”

Warren highlights Apple’s June 2022 CarPlay announcements, where the company debuted the next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ platform that will “reinvent the car experience” and integrate more deeply with in-vehicle hardware. She also points out that Google has entered into a partnership with Ford that will see Ford using the Android Automotive Operating System, and Amazon is developing autonomous driving systems.
The senator claims that Apple and Google’s expansion into cars threatens to spread “anticompetitive mobile app markets practices” to automobiles, citing in-app purchase requirements and the fact that ‌CarPlay‌ and Android Auto apps must be approved by Apple and Google, respectively, before being allowed into vehicles.
Allowing Big Tech into the automotive industry could “stifle a nascent industry” and price developers out of the market.
For these developers, allowing Google and Apple to take control of car operating systems could mean an end to their ability to compete outside Google’s and Apple’s restrictive platforms. Automotive applications have significant potential to provide drivers and passengers with information, enhance safety, and provide entertainment. But allowing Big Tech companies to cement their exclusive control over the terms of auto app competition could stifle a nascent industry.
Warren is asking the FTC and the DOJ to use their authority to address concerns as they emerge and “prevent further overreach by Big Tech companies.” She says that without “proactive and rigorous oversight,” Google, Apple, and Amazon will “bring their anticompetitive, anti-consumer, and anti-labor practices to the automotive sector.”

466,"October 31, 2022","Behavioral Insights in the DMA: A Good Start, But How Will the Story End?","
The EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) contains several provisions which reflect important behavioral insights, and in particular the importance of choice architecture for end user decision-making. This article discusses three roles played by such insights. First, several DMA obligations address conduct whose anticompetitive effects arise from the interlinkage between choice architecture and end user behavior. Second, certain DMA obligations more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing users. Third, the heavy emphasis on effectiveness within the DMA creates a potential role for behavioral insights. If gatekeepers are to be effective in promoting fairness and contestability, to comply with the DMA, then they may need to do more to address behavioral biases than the provisions state explicitly “on their face.” But does the DMA go far enough in considering the implications of behavioral economics? Arguably not. This article also describes some residual questions and challenges arising where more clarity could be given or more could usefully be done.
By Amelia Fletcher[1]
  
The way in which options are presented to people – the so-called “Choice Architecture” they face – can have a dramatic impact on their choices. This key behavioral insight is increasingly well understood and is having ramifications across many policy areas. The UK Competition and Markets Authority recently published a report discussing the implications of online choice architecture for consumer protection and competition policy (CMA, 2022),[2] and we can also see its impact in the new EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”).
This heightened focus on choice architecture reflects the growing recognition that individuals exhibit behavioral biases, which in turn arise from their cognitive limitations. We are not super-calculating fact-based machines. Rather, we think about things subjectively, have limited attention, and utilize rules of thumb.
This toolkit serves us reasonably well most of the time. It can be perfectly sensible to accept default options, choose the highest ranked or more prominent recommendations, or stick with the status quo. However, our tendency to do so can also lead us astray.  Because our behavior tends to exhibit systematic biases, knowledge of these can be exploited by others. As a simple example, if a firm knows I have a strong predilection for accepting the default option, this can potentially be used to sell me products I don’t need, or to discourage me from searching even when I do. The US Federal Trade Commission recently found that such so-called “dark patterns” are on the increase online (FTC, 2022).[3]
The EU Digital Markets Act imposes new rules on a small set of the largest “gatekeeper” platforms. Recognizing the limited attention of their end users, these platforms have worked hard to make the consumer journey as smooth as possible. This can be beneficial. The use of defaults, for example, can be helpful in reducing the number of active decisions end users have to make, and so ease the adoption of innovative new services. However, it can also be harmful. The EU’s 2018 Google Android decision[4] (recently upheld by The General Court)[5] found that the use of such defaults in the presence of end user “status quo bias” can enable leverage of market power from one service into another.
During the final stages of negotiations on the DMA, A variety of changes were made which more firmly embedded behavioral insights within the regulation. These changes are broadly positive. This short article discusses three key ways in which insights relating to choice architecture and behavioral biases underpin the final version of the DMA:

Several DMA obligations seek to address conduct whose anticompetitive effects arise from the interlinkage between choice architecture and user behavioral biases.
Certain DMA obligations more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing users.
The heavy emphasis on effectiveness within the DMA also creates a potential role for behavioral insights. If gatekeepers are to be effective in promoting fairness and contestability, to comply with the DMA, then they may need to do more to address behavioral biases than the provisions state explicitly “on their face.”

But does the DMA go far enough in considering the implications of behavioral economics? Arguably not. This article describes some residual questions and challenges arising where more clarity could be given or more could usefully be done.
 
I. DMA OBLIGATIONS TO ADDRESS ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECTS ARISING FROM CHOICE ARCHITECTURE
Certain DMA requirements are designed to address conduct, the anti-competitive effects of which are underpinned by the interlinkage between choice architecture and behavioral biases.
For example, a key behavioral insight is that individuals can be highly – and unduly – influenced by ranking and salience. This was important in the 2017 Google Shopping decision,[6] which sets out how Google was able to leverage its position in general search by demoting rival shopping sites down its search rankings (exploiting “ranking bias”) and making its own Shopping Box highly prominent (exploiting “saliency bias”). Likewise, the ongoing Amazon Buy Box case[7] has its (alleged) anticompetitive effect because consumers have a strong tendency to use the salient offer in Amazon’s Buy Box and are far less likely to scroll down or click through to find alternative offers.
Recognizing this vital importance of ranking for end user decision-making, Article 6(5) of the DMA requires that “the gatekeeper shall not treat more favourably, in ranking and related indexing and crawling, services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself than similar services or products of a third party. The gatekeeper shall apply transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions to such ranking and related indexing and crawling.” Recital (52) clarifies that this also covers “instances where a core platform service presents or communicates only one result to the end user.”
Similarly, the EU’s ongoing Apple App Store case[8] partly relates to Apple’s “anti-steering provisions,” which limit the ability of app developers to inform end users of alternative purchasing possibilities outside of apps. Such restrictions restrict competition to the app store by creating both informational and behavioral barriers – they both limit end users’ awareness of alternative purchasing possibilities and make it harder for them to access them.
Again, this concern is addressed by the DMA. Article 5(4) prohibits such provisions, while Article 5(5) ensures that purchases made outside of apps can be used smoothly.
 
II. DMA OBLIGATIONS THAT MORE EXPLICITLY COVER THE CHOICE ARCHITECTURE FACING END USERS
The role of behavioral insights within the DMA provisions described above is somewhat implicit. However, there are certain DMA obligations which more explicitly cover the choice architecture facing end users.
These essentially take two forms. First, and most prevalent, are a set of provisions that require the gatekeeper to enable end users to switch services. While these are primarily about reducing switching costs, additional wording was added to the DMA at a late stage that has a more behavioral bent. It is no longer simply required that switching is possible, but also that it is easy. For example:

Articles 6(3) requires that the gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable end users to easily change default settings” in relation to search engines, web browsers and virtual assistants, while Article 6(4) imposes a similar requirement in respect of third party software apps or app stores.
Article 6(3) requires that end users should be able “to easily uninstall” any apps.
Article 6(13) requires them to ensure that conditions of termination provision “can be exercised without undue difficulty.”
The wording in Articles 6(6) takes slightly different form, but arguably comes to the same thing. Gatekeepers are required not to “restrict technically or otherwise the ability of end users to switch between, and subscribe to, different software applications and services.” (All underlining added).

While they may seem innocuous, the terms “easily,” “without undue difficulty” and “or otherwise” are important. We know that real end users are unlikely to act in the way that the regulation intends if it is in any way difficult to do so. There is also ample evidence that gatekeepers are well positioned to tweak the choice environment, sometimes subtly, to make such actions harder, rather than easier. This final terminology should help to prevent this.
The second set of obligations go further. They recognize that it may not be sufficient to enable end users to make choices, or even to make them easily. End users may exhibit such strong “status quo bias” that they still fail to act. And if they fail to act, then the interventions will not have their desired impact on fairness and contestability.
This issue is addressed by facilitating the use of prompts and requiring some use of choice screens, which force end users to make an active choice. Specifically:

Under Article 6(4), gatekeepers must allow third party providers of apps and app stores to prompt end users to decide if they wish to make that app or app store their default. Such prompts are expected to help to overcome “status quo bias” and really shift end user choices.
Under Article 6(3), gatekeepers must require end users to choose – from a list of the main available service providers ­– their online search engine, virtual assistant, or web browser, at the time of their initial use. Such a choice screen is designed to prevent gatekeepers from benefitting from “default bias” by setting their own services as defaults.

  
III. BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS AND THE “EFFECTIVENESS” PROVISIONS OF THE DMA
A third potential linkage between behavioral economics and the DMA lies in the DMA’s heavy emphasis on “effectiveness.” Under the DMA, effectiveness does not simply relate to whether an obligation is formally achieved in itself. For an obligation to be met, it must also be effective in achieving the DMA’s overall objectives of fairness and contestability.
This is seen in the overarching compliance framework, as set out in Article 8.

Article 8(1) states that: “The gatekeeper shall ensure and be able to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 of this Regulation. The measures implemented by the gatekeeper to ensure compliance with those Articles shall be effective in achieving the objectives of this Regulation and of the relevant obligation.”
Article 8(2) enables the Commission to specify “the measures that the gatekeeper concerned is to implement in order to effectively comply with the obligations,” and Article 8(7) states that in doing so, “the Commission shall ensure that the measures are effective in achieving the objectives of this Regulation and the relevant obligation.”

It is noteworthy that in both underlined sections in the previous bullets, the wording “of this Regulation and” was added in the final wording of the Regulation, presumably to make absolutely clear that effectiveness was to be viewed in the context of the overall objectives of fairness and contestability.
The focus on effectiveness is also seen within individual obligations. Specifically:

Article 6(4) requires gatekeepers to “allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of” third party apps and app stores.
Article 6(7) requires gatekeepers to allow “effective interoperability”
Article 6(9) requires gatekeepers to provide “effective portability of data,” including “tools to facilitate the effective exercise of such data portability.”
Article 6(10) requires data access for business users that is “effective, high-quality, continuous and real-time.”

This focus on effectiveness within the DMA does not make explicit reference to behavioral considerations. However, they seem likely to be critical in practice.
Indeed, choice architecture is explicitly addressed in Article 13 which relates to anti-circumvention measures. Here, gatekeeper platforms are specifically prohibited from using behavioral techniques or interface design to undermine effective compliance. This includes a prohibition on making the exercise of end user choice unduly difficult by “offering choices in a non-neutral manner,” or “by subverting end users or business users’ decision making via the structure or design of a user interface.”
How might this emphasis on effectiveness play out in practice?
To consider this, consider the end user data portability requirement under Article 6(9). As is discussed in Recital 59, data portability will be “effective” in promoting contestability if it genuinely enables end user switching and/or multi-homing, and thereby incentivizes gatekeepers and business users to innovate.
This in turn requires that there are no barriers to end users making use of data portability. It seems reasonable to assume that the requirements around effectiveness will prevent gatekeepers from creating behavioral barriers to data portability, such as making end users click through excessive warning screens before porting their data. It should also prevent gatekeepers putting in place rules that restrict third party services encouraging or prompting the use of data portability.
But even if gatekeepers do nothing to inhibit take up, that may not be enough. Experience from multiple other markets tells us that enabling users to switch need not lead to them actually switching or multi-homing. In the face of inactive and cautious consumers, even more proactive stimulation may be needed. For example, despite the UK Current Account Switching Service (“CASS”) being successful in eliminating most of the difficulties that consumers faced in switching bank, consumers were insufficiently aware of this and switching rates remained stubbornly low. As a result, CASS has now been additionally required to engage in the active promotion of its services.
Looking forward, it will be interesting to see whether the Commission seeks to use the requirement of effectiveness to drive similar proactive interventions in an online context – interventions that may even go beyond what the DMS sets out “on its face.”
  
IV. DOES THE DMA GO FAR ENOUGH IN INCORPORATING BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS?
While these various DMA provisions reflect a far better understanding of behavioral science than might have been expected from the DMA’s initial drafting, there nonetheless remain a number of residual questions and additional challenges.
First, the DMA’s emphasis on users being able to take certain actions “easily” or “without undue difficulty” is clearly helpful. If end users find it hard to take actions, then they will not do so. But how should these terms be interpreted in practice?
For example, it is required under Article 6(3) that end users should be able to able to change their default search engine easily. But there are typically multiple access points to search engines on a device. Users can go to a search app, they can go to a particular browser and use its default search engine, they can search via the voice assistant and use its default search engine, they can use text search (or “look-up”) from within another app, or they can use a search widget. Should it be presumed that being able to switch search engine “easily” means that end users should be able to switch the default setting for all of these at once? Or – arguably even better – that they should have access to a single screen where they can simply tick which access points they wish to switch?
It is also not clear that sufficient thinking has been done in relation to the different way in which end users interact with voice assistants versus screens. For the former, users are less likely to be able to deal effectively with long lists of options. It is one thing to enable a user to say “Siri, I wish to change my default browser,” it is quite another to think about how the available options can then be presented in a neutral way.
Also, what will firms be expected to do in order to demonstrate compliance with these provisions? This will presumably involve needing to show how easily users can switch default. But this raises the question of how to “audit” choice architecture.
There are established methods for testing the impact of choice architecture, such as A/B testing. A natural way of demonstrating compliance, therefore, would be for gatekeepers to share with the Commission evidence derived from such experimental work. But will this be enough? It may well be that the Commission will need to require additional targeted testing. There may also be merit to its finding a way of systematizing such testing and its reporting, so that all gatekeepers use a common framework.
Second, it is not clear that the regulations take a fully consistent or appropriate approach to the repeating of prompts. Under Article 5(2), which restricts the collection, combination, and cross-use of personal data across services without active end user consent, the CMA states specifically that where consent “has been refused or withdrawn by the end user, the gatekeeper shall not repeat its request for consent for the same purpose more than once within a period of one year.”
This wording seems to be partly motivated by concerns around “consent fatigue.” This seems sensible. However, there is no equivalent wording in Article 6(4) that would similarly limit the frequency of prompts from third parties, or allow gatekeepers to do so. As such, there is a serious risk that end users become overwhelmed by prompts from third parties seeking to become their default. This is in turn likely to generate “choice fatigue,” creating a risk either that end users either ignore the prompts, thus dampening their potential impact on contestability, or (even more worryingly) that end users actually make mistakes.
There must also be a risk of such prompts being misleading. In telecoms markets, when it was made too easy for third parties to switch consumers to their own services, we saw the emergence of “slamming” whereby consumers would find they had switched provider without fully realizing it.  This would not be a good outcome here, but the risk is not addressed by the DMA, and nor is it clear that the DMA would allow gatekeepers to step in and ameliorate it.  
Third, there can be important tensions in designing choice architecture, and it is not clear that these have been considered fully. For example, in relation to the right to termination (as addressed under Article 6(13)), the associated Recital (63) proposes that “closing an account or un-subscribing should not be made be (sic) more complicated than opening an account or subscribing to the same service.” 
Whilst this would seem a desirable objective in principle, it may be difficult to achieve in all cases without creating unintended consequences. For example, when end users are setting up a new device, they value being led through the process of signing up to a series of services in a well ordered and straightforward fashion. It is not clear how it would be possible to make it as easy to unsubscribe to these services as to sign up to them without giving the end user regular prompts to consider doing so. But this could easily annoy end users and could even lead to them making mistakes as discussed previously. In practice, it is to be hoped that the Commission would accept a proportionate solution, such as the introduction of easy-to-find cancellation buttons. But this could usefully be clarified.
Likewise, the requirement under Article 5(2) not to repeat consent requests more than annually might seem sensible, but what if a user has switched off location services and then wishes to use a proprietary mapping app. Is the gatekeeper really prohibited from advising the user that they will need to switch on location services to do so?
Fourth, while the DMA is designed to open up end user choice, we would expect end users to have a tendency to choose brand names they already know, and risk averse in terms of tying out new options. This has two important implications.
First, it means that the design of the default choice screens required under Article 6(3) really matters. The precise choice architecture adopted will be critical to their success. There are many different aspects that could become relevant here, from the number of options provided and their ordering, to whether there should be brief descriptions of each option. These options will need to be tested to ensure that the choice screens have their desired impact. Another element that is almost certain to be helpful would be clear reassurance that users can easily reverse their choice later if they wish to do so.
Second, it means that opening up choice for some services could backfire, by enhancing the market position of the biggest players yet further. Take Microsoft Bing for instance. Currently this is the default search engine on Microsoft devices. Despite Bing only having around 5 percent of the EU search market, it seems plausible that Microsoft will be required to offer users an upfront choice of search engine. This in turn may well lead to a further loss of Bing’s market share to Google; presumably not the result the Commission was seeking.
 
V. CONCLUSION
Overall, the DMA already exhibits a strong understanding of the importance of choice architecture and end user behavioral biases. However, it is not clear that the DMA has in fact gone far enough in considering the implications of behavioral science. Some challenges and unanswered questions remain. How “easy” do actions need to be to satisfy the obligations, and how will compliance be demonstrated? Is there a risk of end users being overwhelmed or misled by third party prompts, and how can this be addressed? Are there unintended effects of some of the proposals around choice architecture? And is there a risk that greater end user choice could in fact embed market positions even more strongly?
It is to be hoped that many of these questions will be considered and addressed by the Commission during the process of DMA implementation. This is not a simple matter and would require serious resources and expertise. If it can be done, the DMA stands to be the most advanced regulation to date in terms of its embedding of behavioral insights. But if not, its effectiveness may be seriously compromised.

467,"October 31, 2022",Digital Nudging: Potential and Pitfalls,"
Digital nudges — that is, significantly behavioral interventions that use software and its user-interface design elements — are an increasingly pervasive feature of online environments that can shape people’s behavior both online (e.g. changing website cookie settings) and offline (e.g. taking a flu vaccine due to a text message reminder). While sharing many characteristics of offline behavioral interventions, digital nudges merit specific attention and analysis due to their growing ubiquity and potential potency, the opacity of their technological and behavioral mechanisms, and the central role of private actors in their implementation. 

By Avishalom Tor[1]
 
To advance their policy goals, governments and other organizations have been employing behavioral instruments — also known as nudges — for some time now,[2] but the advent of digital nudges is more recent. Digital behavioral interventions are distinct from their offline counterparts in their deployment of software and its user-interface design elements and are an increasingly pervasive feature of online environments. These instruments can shape behavior online — e.g. when they encourage consumers to change their website privacy settings or to donate to a charity — as well as offline, as when people decide to take a flu vaccine at their annual medical checkup following a text message reminder from their health insurer.
Digital nudges share many features of offline behavioral interventions, yet ...

468,"October 31, 2022","Online Choice Architecture: The Good, the Bad, and the Complicated","
Online choice architecture (“OCA”) encompasses the set of design features that impact choice in digital environments. From default settings and notifications to personalization and recommender systems, OCA features are present in almost every interaction with technology. Existing evidence on the effects of OCA on human behavior have often been one-sided, focusing either on positive or negative outcomes. In online settings, the effect of OCA practices on consumer welfare is often complicated. In this paper, we describe the design process and practices of OCA, analyze applications of OCA for good and for bad, and discuss future direction for research and practice of OCA design. We recommend that designers and researchers measure and capture a wider range of outcomes, beyond user engagement and satisfaction. We also highlight the interplay between data, algorithms and OCA design since many OCA practices are embedded in the design of interfaces and are often data-driven. Therefore, advancing good and preventing bad OCA design might require an approach that goes beyond the individual user or designer, and looks at structural changes across the market.

469,"October 31, 2022",A General Critique of Potential “Behavioral Economics” Rationales for Regulating Big Tech: and Specific Possibilities,"
While most regulatory scrutiny of the big tech sector is couched in terms of competition or lack thereof, behavioral economics may provide rationales outside that framework.  Behavioral economics is generally problematic as a policy guide, as it undercuts the basis for benefit cost analysis and invites policy makers to substitute their preferences for those of the public they presumably serve.  However, it suggests some potential rationales based on thinking being costly and weakness of will.  Beyond behavioral economics, the psychology of preference formation could motivate policy — consider public education — but its application to big tech is amorphous.  The potentially most severe concern, that a tiny but violent minority enabled by big tech to organize destructive actions, likely lies outside both behavioral economics and the ability of any regulator or legislature to prevent.
By Timothy Brennan[1]
 
Across the globe, many see the “big tech” sector of the economy as a bad actor. Much of that criticism is expressed in terms of insufficient competition in platform markets allegedly dominated by a handful of familiar names — Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple. In some of these sectors, one-sided network externalities — people want to use a common service — can lead to most users signing up for the same service, Facebook being a leading example. In others, multi-sided externalities, where for example buyers want to be where most sel...

470,"October 31, 2022",Advances in Behavioral Economics and Responsible Competition Leadership: Tackling Searchplace Discrimination,"
The digital millennium leveraged the World Wide Web into a powerful information source. Online internet searchplaces guide human everyday decisions. The strategic placement of information in search engine results has become increasingly important in corporate and political settings. Virtual competition derails in negative search engine de-optimization and unethical strategic searchplace manipulation that degrades the perception of a search term by pushing out competitors’ quality content from search engine results. This article discusses technicalities of searchplace discrimination in erasing useful information about competition for negative, unrelated, spamming, or harmful contents. In light of the negative implications of searchplace discrimination, cyberbullying and online inequalities, behavioral economics and responsible competition leadership can aid in creating inclusive digital worlds. Behavioral insights should draw attention to self-determined internet user empowerment to correct abuse of algorithmic loopholes. Legal advancements, regulatory oversight, economic incentives, technical support and industry rescue funds work towards discrimination-free online searchplaces in favor for quality content over unethical competition. Ethics of online inclusion, law and economics analyses of searchplaces and interdisciplinary dialogue building on searchplace ethics but also human-artificial intelligence algorithm compatibility and cyber-checks-and-balances to tackle searchp...

471,"October 30, 2022",WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy – Update 2.0 from India,"

By G.R. Bhatia and Manav Gupta1
 
Despite several significant developments in the past few months, there seems to be no end in sight in the WhatsApp privacy policy saga in India.
The uncertainty surrounding the policy was recently compounded as the long-awaited Personal Data Protection Bill (“PDP Bill”) was unexpectedly withdrawn on 3rd August 2022, before it could be tabled before the Parliament. The Parliament was informed that certain amendments suggested by the Joint Parliamentary Committee in its report on the Bill were being considered and a new Bill having a comprehensive legal framework will be soon introduced.2
In 2021, WhatsApp undertook that it will not compel users to agree to its updated Privacy Policy and Terms of Service 2021 (“2021 Privacy Policy”) until the proposed PDP Act comes into force. WhatsApp’s Counsel had submitted before the Delhi High Court (“DHC”) – “Commitment is that I will do nothing till the Parliament’s law comes in. If Parliament allows it, I will have it. If it doesn’t, bad luck… I’ve taken it off till the Parliament makes a law. Either we fit in or we don’t“.3
The PDP Bill, had it turned into an Act, would have addressed several issues pertaining to the 2021 Privacy Policy. For instance, Section 11 of the Bill would have required WhatsApp to obtain “free, informed, specific and clear” consent (with liberty to withdraw consent subsequently by the user) as a condition precedent to  sharing any personal data obtained from the users. The Bill would have also restricted the transfer of “critical personal data” outside India and would have made it mandatory for companies such as WhatsApp to store all personal data in servers located in India. However, the Bill reportedly suffered from several infirmities and inconsistencies, and therefore the government in its wisdom decided to withdraw the Bill.
The significance of enacting a Data Protection legislation has become all the more apparent in current scenario as WhatsApp had to introduce a separate privacy policy for the European Economic Area4 (“EEA”) in order to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). As per the policy in EEA countries, “WhatsApp does not share user data with Facebook” which is in clear contrast with the policy introduced elsewhere, including in India.5
Interestingly, despite tailoring a separate privacy policy for EEA, WhatsApp received warnings by data protection agencies in several EU countries, including Germany6 and Italy7 after it introduced the new policy. In September 2021, WhatsApp Ireland (the sole establishment of WhatsApp in EU) also handed down a massive €225 million fine8 by the Irish Data Protection Commission (“DPC”) for breach of the GDPR. The DPC found that WhatsApp’s data sharing policy was in breach of several provisions of the GDPR since 25 May 2018.9
In India, various legal challenges were instituted when the 2016 privacy policy was released by WhatsApp in 2016; most notably before the Delhi High Court (“DHC”) in Karmanya Singh Sareen v. Union Of India10 (“Karmanya Singh Sareen”) and before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) in Vinod Kumar Gupta v. CCI.11
In Karmanya Singh Sareen case, the DHC noted in its judgment dated 23.09.2016 that a petition challenging the WhatsApp terms of service was not amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution (especially since the Right to Privacy had not been affirmed by the Supreme Court of India at that time). In August 2017, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”), vide a landmark judgment in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India12 clarified that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
Consequently, DHC’s judgment in Karmanya Singh Sareen was appealed before the Hon’ble SC. The challenge against 2021 Privacy Policy was also clubbed along with Karmanya Singh Sareen and it is pending adjudication before a Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble SC. On 29th September, after noting that the Central Government plans to table a fresh Data Protection Bill in the upcoming Winter Session of the Parliament, the SC adjourned the matter to 17th January 2023 for final hearing.13
The CCI, on the other hand, had originally refused to delve into privacy related issues under the 2016 Privacy Policy and had dismissed allegations of abuse of dominance.14 However, as regards the 2021 Privacy Policy, the CCI initiated suo-moto proceedings and formed a prima facie opinion that WhatsApp abused its dominance by forcing users to compulsorily agree to share their data with Facebook companies if they wanted to continue using the app.15 Consequently, CCI issues a direction to the Director General (an investigation arm of CCI) to investigate the conduct of Whatsapp/Facebook and submit a report to the CCI for its consideration.
WhatsApp and Facebook challenged the said order of the CCI before the DHC but the Single Judge bench as well as a Division Bench dismissed the appeals and upheld the CCI’s jurisdiction to investigate possible anti-trust concerns emanating from the 2021 privacy policy. A further appeal was filed before the Hon’ble SC but on 14.10.2022, even the Hon’ble SC dismissed the appeal and refused to interfere with the CCI’s order.16
The issue, therefore, remains embroiled in litigation before numerous forums and thus, it is often argued that a more appropriate approach to deal with such issues concerning data-sharing and user’s online privacy would be to set up a “Data Protection Authority” by enactment of a law.
Nevertheless, the role of anti-trust authorities in privacy related cases and for regulating such data sharing practices of the big-tech companies remains utmost important. For instance, it is pertinent to note that mere initiation of enquiry by the CCI has sent a positive signal and WhatsApp has undertaken to defer its 2021 Privacy Policy till a Data Protection law comes into force. Further, the concerns flagged by the CCI pertaining to use of data by WhatsApp/Facebook to leverage their position to enter related/ non-related markets and deny market access to smaller competitors may genuinely warrant anti-trust scrutiny. This is highlighted by the fact that anti-trust authorities in several countries such as Germany,17 Turkey,18 South Africa,19 have acted against WhatsApp’s data sharing policies despite there being a comprehensive law on Data Protection in place in all these countries.
While CCI’s decision to analyse the issue from a “Competition Lens” is a welcome step, it is also important for the DG and later the CCI to take a holistic view of the case and not get swayed by the negative perception surrounding the policy. It must be kept in mind that most of the “big-tech” companies such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Google etc. which offer “free services” to users without discrimination, rely upon such data sharing to generate revenue and improve their services. The user-friendly services and continuous/ constant effort to innovate and improve the standard of services needs to be given due recognition. A balanced approach must be taken as discouraging innovation in any way and manner would have a chilling effect on Competition. Therefore, the DG and the CCI, ought to bear in mind the potential far-reaching implications of this case before making any conclusions.
The only thing which can be said with certainty, for now, is that this saga is far from over and a long-drawn battle before the CCI and the Appellate tribunal/ SC awaits. Thus, prudence suggests that a fresh Data Protection Bill be introduced, enacted and brought in force as soon as possible.

472,"October 27, 2022",EU To Create Antitrust Team To Enforce New Tech Regulations,"


EU antitrust officials are looking to establish a 40-man team and hire a technology expert to enforce tough new rules aimed at reining in the powers of Big Tech, reported Reuters.
The rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of do’s and don’ts for Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and other gatekeepers which control access to their sites and the data there.

CPI reported in July that the European Commission was considering creating a new directorate to allay concerns that it may struggle to get deep-pocketed and well-advised tech companies to comply with the new rules.
A 12-man unit headed by antitrust veteran Thomas Kramler who is currently handling the Apple and Amazon antitrust investigations and a 9-person strong task-force will move to the new directorate, the official said.
The EU competition enforcer aims to hire 19 more people for the directorate and a chief technology officer to focus on data, the official said.
The new unit will need the green light from the college of commissioners from the 27 EU countries in the coming weeks before it can be set up.
Enforcement of the DMA will be done jointly with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology which has also set up a new unit for the task.

473,"October 26, 2022",Fighting New Antitrust Rules Is a Bad Move for Big Tech,"
By: Brooke Fox, Fiona Scott Morton & Gene Kimmelman (ProMarket)
Sen. Amy Klobuchar recently invoked David and Goliath when discussing her fight to pass antitrust legislation to rein in dominant tech firms. “I have two lawyers. They have 2,800 lawyers and lobbyists,” she said at this year’s Code Conference in September. But executives at those dominant tech firms would do well to remember that Goliath ultimately lost to David.
Whether or not Klobuchar’s legislation makes it to a vote this term, we’ve crossed a Rubicon. Whatever legitimate (or illegitimate) concerns may be raised about the precise wording of the bill, the fact is that Europe has already prohibited dominant tech platforms from thwarting competitors in search services, operating systems, app stores, online retail and numerous other digital markets.
It would be irresponsible for U.S. policymakers to sit on the sidelines and let others set the rules—a fact perhaps recognized by the 242 members of the House of Representatives who voted in favor of the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, designed to strengthen antitrust enforcement. While that bill did not single out big tech companies, it passed in spite of significant opposition from the likes of Google and Amazon, a sign that lawmakers are no longer afraid to move against the industry’s wishes.
European lawmakers have levied ever-increasing fines on tech platforms over the years, but not before bad behavior became entrenched, and little has changed in terms of market outcomes. Each time the EU issues a decision against a platform, the platform must design a remedy and present it to the regulator, which usually deems the proposal inadequate and orders the whole process to restart, according to Cristina Caffarra, who leads European economic analysis at Keystone Strategy. “There’s no end to this game, which is played in a situation of significant asymmetry of information,” she said. “So you end up in a situation in which the remedies are completely failing to do anything.”
Not content to let the status quo persist, the European Commission this year passed sweeping new legislation to oversee digital gatekeepers in the form of the Digital Markets Act. The DMA requires digital platforms doing business in the EU to comply with nearly two dozen rules, which prohibit practices such as pre-installing certain apps on devices, obligating standards such as interoperability and constraining the ability of users to move their data between apps…

474,"October 25, 2022",FCA Exploring Implications of Big Tech Entry Into Financial Services,"


As the likes of Google and Apple have diversified their offering to include payments and other financial services, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is looking to understand the consequences of this trend for competition.
“The potential competition impacts of Big Tech entry and expansion in retail financial services,” a discussion paper the regulator published Tuesday (Oct. 25), explores the impact of Big Tech firms’ arrival in payments, deposit taking, consumer credit and insurance markets.
Related: UK Financial Watchdog’s Plan Includes Crypto & Big Tech
The paper lists Google, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Microsoft as global Big Tech Firms. It adds Alibaba, Tencent and Mercado Libre as regional ones.
The regulator observes that in the U.K., the global Big Tech firms listed have some FCA permissions to offer retail financial services. Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple have some payment permissions, and Google and Meta also have some e‑money permissions. Apple and Amazon have some consumer credit and insurance permissions.
The initial paper will be followed by an expert panel discussion in November and sector-specific workshops in December. The FCA has also requested comments from interested parties, who have until Jan. 15 to respond.
“In recent years, Big Tech’s entry into financial services, in the UK and elsewhere, has demonstrated their potential to disrupt established markets, drive innovation and reduce costs for consumers,” FCA Executive Director of Consumers and Competition Sheldon Mills said in a press release. “Across the world, we’ve seen the capability of Big Tech to offer transformative new products in areas such as payments, deposits and consumer credit … The discussion we are starting today will inform the FCA’s pro-competitive approach to digital markets, and I encourage consumers, firms and fellow regulators to join the conversation.”
Hinting at potential antitrust concerns, the release states that “in the longer term, Big Tech firms could pose competition risks if they rapidly gain market share, and they are able to exploit market power.” For each of the financial services it discusses, the paper lists potential competition benefits and harms presented by Big Tech.
At present, no regulatory changes are being proposed and the FCA’s paper aims only to stimulate discussion on the topic.
Should the FCA ever deem that Big Tech moves in the financial services space are uncompetitive, it would likely work with the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) in any resulting investigation.
The discussion paper references multiple CMA Big Tech probes including the case of Meta’s Giphy acquisition. As PYMNTS reported recently, Meta is set to sell Giphy following an order from the CMA.

Officials from the European Union’s antitrust authority said metaverse companies could limit users’ choice and raise prices if they grow to dominate the market. CoinDesk Regulatory Reporter Jack Schickler explains why the officials worry that tech giants like Meta could choke metaverse competition.
The EU is preparing its own strategy for virtual online worlds in which people can interact, socialize or trade via avatars – and the metaverse could be the latest front in a long-running antitrust campaign against tech giants that threaten consumer welfare.
Related: Can A “European Metaverse” Outperform US & China?
With Facebook renaming itself Meta Platforms (META) as it seeks to reorient itself around the technology, policymakers are worried the company may seek to create a “walled garden” that users can’t easily leave.
A big company that forms a closed ecosystem “may constrain its consumers, business partners and competitors in numerous ways,” forcing them to buy products from that company, charging exorbitant prices or misusing people’s personal information, said Friedrich Wenzel Bulst and Sophie De Vinck of the European Commission’s antitrust unit. The European Commission is the EU’s governing body.
The EU has long complained about anticompetitive behavior by tech giants. Last month, it imposed a fine worth over 4 billion euros ($4 billion) on Google for how the company authorized phones running the Android operating system. And in May, it passed legislation called the Digital Markets Act, which could see companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) fined 20% of their annual revenue.
“There are good reasons for competition law enforcers on both sides of the Atlantic to be actively accompanying technological and market evolutions in this area” to keep the metaverse innovative and open, said Bulst and De Vinck, who both work on the media sector unit of the commission’s antitrust division. They called for more discussions with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in the US on the issue.

477,"October 24, 2022",Abuse of Superior Bargaining Position in Digital Markets: A Way forward for India,"

By Priyanshi1
  
The digital economy has transformed the way economic activities were conducted and its distinctive features have prompted major legislative and regulatory initiatives throughout the globe. The growth of such markets has created countless opportunities, fostered competition, and enhanced consumer’ welfare. However, the uniqueness of the technology-driven markets has also brought in multiple regulatory challenges.
In the last few years, India has continued to deal with the issues surrounding the regulation of digital markets, contributing immensely to the development of competition law jurisprudence in the country.
The Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) is currently investigating the allegations of abuse of dominance, leveled against Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent company), in a case filed by the Digital News Publishers Association. The observations made in the prima facie opinion2 of the Commission, might prove to be yet another addition to the existing jurisprudence.
The complaint contends the following:

Google imposes unfair, arbitrary, and unilaterally decided terms and conditions over news publishers while it makes publishers’ content visible to the users;
the publishers are not being made aware of the actual revenue generated by the search engine through the advertisements shown on the publishers’ news websites; and
Google fails to adequately compensate the publishers while it continues to use the content from the publishers’ websites for its services such as Google News, News Showcases, Snippets, etc.

In its prima facie opinion, the Commission noted that the case highlights the issue of imbalances in the bargaining power between the digital platforms and the publishers who offer their services through such platforms. The observation is in consonance with similar developments taking place in other prominent jurisdictions. The CCI opined that the issue of abuse of superior bargaining power (“ASBP”) requires a detailed investigation.
 
I. Abuse of Superior Bargaining Power – Exploring the Concept in the Context of the Digital Economy
India’s consumer digital economy is expected to touch a mark of 800 billion in US Dollars by 2030,3 creating a plethora of opportunities for its user bases by the virtue of its distinct multi-sided nature. The gradual shift of users from the brick-and-mortar market to the online platform markets has increased businesses’ reliance on such platforms for their operations and prospective growth. Such markets have emerged as crucial facilitators and necessary trading partners for business entities in securing reach to a wider audience.
The issues of imbalanced bargaining power and its subsequent abuse stem from the increased reliance of business entities on such platform markets. ASBP refers to a situation wherein one party to the agreement, being placed at a relatively superior position in a commercial relationship, imposes unfair and unjustified terms and conditions on, the other party that has no option but to accept due to the latter’s dependence on the former’s business superiority for its business prospects.
A superior bargaining position may arise due to the following factors among others:

the high degree of dependence of other firms on such entity;
the market power of the entity; and
the availability of other alternatives to both the contracting parties.

In the recent past, nations throughout the globe have taken progressive steps regulating the ASBP in the news media market to ensure that publishers are adequately compensated for the use of their content and that any imbalance in bargaining power is stabilized, including Australia, Germany, France, Romania, Canada, and; most recently The United States.
The principal legislation in India, the Competition Act, 2002, does not expressly deal with ASBP. However, recently, the Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology stated that the government is deliberating upon enacting a law addressing the abuse, similar to the enactments in other regimes.
The article aims to reflect upon CCI’s observations in cases where a practice involving ASBP was alleged and discussed. It also aims to contemplate the considerations attached to the idea of regulating ASBP under the existing legal framework in India and explore plausible regulatory measures.
 
II. Bargaining Power Imbalance – Trends in the Digital Economy and CCI’s Approach
A. Allegations of Abuse of dominance against MakeMyTrip.Com 
[Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and Anr. v. MakeMyTrip India Pvt. Ltd. (MMT) and Ors. 
with 
Rubtub Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. MakeMyTrip India Pvt. Ltd. (MMT) and Ors.]4
A complaint alleging abuse of dominance was filed against online travel aggregators (Opposite Parties – hereinafter referred as “OP”) – MakeMyTrip (“OP-1”), its subsidiary Go-Ibibo (“OP-2”), and hospitality chain Oravel Stays Private Limited (“OP-3”). The informants – Fab Hotels and Treebo initiated the information after they were delisted by the aggregators from OP’s platform. In addition, informants’ franchisee service providers and other budget hotels availing some logistic support from them, were also delisted by OP-1 and OP-2.
The Commission found that OP-1 holds a dominant position in the ‘market for online intermediation services for booking of hotels in India’. Further, OP-3 was found to be one of the significant players in the ‘market for franchising services for budget hotels in India’. The informants also sought interim relief to get relisted on the aggregators’ platform citing their increased dependence on such platforms. The Commission noted that OP-1 entered into a commercial agreement with OP-3 pursuant to which the closest competitors of OP-3 were delisted by OP-1 from its platform.
The informant hotels relied on OP-1’s position as a necessary trading partner to ensure their visibility to prospective consumers. The informants contended that the delisting led to a denial of market access to online intermediation, hampering informants’ business operations and further distorting the level playing field amongst the competitors in the downstream market where the informants are active. On the other hand, OP-1 contended that it was in its commercial interest to partner with OP-3 given the latter’s market access throughout the country. Other alleged conducts included – charging exorbitant commissions, predatory pricing and maintaining price parity.
The CCI, granting interim relief and directing the Director General to initiate an investigation into the matter under Section 3(4) and Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002, noted that the digital economy and the existence of unique characteristics such as processing of data, strong direct and indirect network effects, etc., have increased business entities’ dependency over the platform markets, leading to asymmetrical bargaining power.
B. Allegations of Abuse of Dominance against WhatsApp
[In Re: Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Users]5
A suo-moto case was initiated by the CCI against WhatsApp after the messaging application, in January 2021, updated its privacy policy, imposing a “take it or leave it” condition upon its users. The updated terms made it mandatory for all the users to accept the new terms and conditions, or else they would no longer be able to use the app’s services. The policy imposed a condition wherein users’ data (both individual and business accounts) was to be shared by WhatsApp, with its parent company Facebook (now Meta) and other Meta companies.
The Commission had on previous occasions and in its note to the OECD, observed that data serves as a major competitive advantage and is being used by companies for targeted advertisements and undertaking other marketing strategies.
The CCI took note of WhatsApp’s position in the market as the second largest player after “Messenger”, the latter also being a “Meta” Company. Even though there exist multiple competitors of WhatsApp in the relevant market and the competitors have witnessed an increase in downloads as well, the growth of other competing apps has hardly affected the user base of WhatsApp. Hence, it holds an influential position in the market which is further reinforced by network effects and high switching costs in terms of the accumulated consumer data on WhatsApp. CCI further emphasized that users in such cases have no bargaining power and ordered an investigation over the plausible anti-competitive effects emerging out of such unilaterally imposed terms and conditions.
C. Allegations of Abuse of dominance against Google
[Matrimony.com Limited v. Google LLC and Ors. 
with 
Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS) v. Google and Ors.]6
The case is one of the foremost decisions of the Commission pertaining to the regulation of enterprises’ conduct in digital markets. It was alleged that Google, being a dominant player in both the markets of the online general web search services and online search advertising in India, has abused its dominant position.
The complaint alleged:

Google unfairly determines the search results instead of results being algorithmically driven,
Google uses one-boxes to favor publishers based on its commercial agreements, integrating specialized search results with its commercial units to generate revenue through sponsored content and advertisements; and
Google favors its own verticals like – YouTube, Google News, Google Maps, and other partners by placing them prominently on its search engine results page (“SERP”).

Further, relevant to our discussion, the intermediation agreements negotiated between Google and the business entities revealed unfair and discriminatory terms being imposed on the business entities primarily including – preventing publishers from implementing search services on their websites similar to that of Google search services and prohibiting them from using the services of other competing search engines.
The Commission found Google abusing its dominant position and further opined that Google is an unavoidable trading partner for business entities given its position of strength in the relevant market and that Google’s conduct leads to an uneven playing field between the competing entities.
D. Allegations of Abuse of Dominance against Alphabet Inc.
[XYZ v. Alphabet Inc. and Ors.]7
Allegations of abuse of dominant position were leveled against Google in relation to its payment offering – Google Pay (G-Pay).
The complaint contended the following:

Google exercises exclusivity by imposing a mandate over the Apps to use Playstore’s payment system and In-App billing (for purchase of Apps and for other in-app purchases) which prefers G-Pay;
Google levies a 30% commission on App developers in addition to the payment for getting listed on the Playstore’s platform;
Google encourages pre-installation of G-Pay by setting it as a default payment app on new android mobile devices (given its control over Android Ecosystem) and exercises self-preferencing by placing G-Pay as the first result whenever the word ‘Pay’ is searched by any user on the Play Store;
Google displays G-Pay’s advertisement prominently on the top of the search results on the Playstore even in cases where users search for other competing UPI payment Apps.

While ordering an investigation into the matter, CCI in its prima facie opinion observed that the alleged conduct has the potential to impede competition. The Commission noted that placing G-pay prominently on the Play store, and attempting to facilitate the use of G-Pay to the detriment of other competitors may distort the level playing field and can yield negative welfare effects given that users and other parties have negligible countervailing power.
E. Allegations of Anti-Competitive Practices against Zomato and Swiggy
[National Restaurant Association of India v. Zomato Limited (Zomato) and Bundl Technologies Private Limited (Swiggy)]8
A complaint was filed against the two most prominent online food aggregators – Zomato (“OP-1”) and Swiggy (“OP-2”) by their restaurant partners (“RPs”) contending violation of Section 3 of the Act.
The complaints primarily alleged the following:

OPs bundle the food delivery services with the food ordering services on their platform by restricting the RPs from operating their own self-delivery services;
OPs operate their own cloud kitchens parallelly to the RPs and giving preferential treatments to such kitchens and imposing unfair conditions on RPs through one-sided contracts including –

reserving the sole right to terminate the contractual agreement with or without cause at any point in time or in the cases of non-compliance by the RPs;
restricting RPs from availing the services of any third-party aggregator for a period of 12 months (Synergy terms);
charging commissions retrospectively, as high as 25% of the net sales in cases of non-compliance/breach;
imposing price parity clauses on the RPs restricting them from charging lower prices or providing better terms on their RP’s own websites/offline shops/other sales channels.



The Commission in its prima facie opinion noted that neither OP-1 nor OP-2 holds a dominant position in India and thus a case under Section 4 is not warranted. However, it noted that the alleged conduct of imposing unfair conditions on the restaurants appeared to be highly restrictive and arbitrary, adversely affecting the business interest of the RPs, and prohibiting restaurants from competing on fair terms. The Commission ordered DG to investigate the conduct as a possible violation of Section 3.
From the study of the aforementioned decided and ongoing cases, it can be inferred that the Commission has acknowledged the presence of an imbalance in bargaining power with few market players emerging as superior entities in terms of the negotiating power they possess in any agreement with the counterparty. It has also been observed that the unique characteristics of digital markets make them more conducive to imbalances in bargaining power. Further, it is evident from the cases that an imbalance in bargaining powers may stem from enterprises holding a dominant position. It also reveals that it is important to appreciate that the scope of ASBP is wider than abuse of dominant position and that ASBP can even occur in situations where the market structure is oligopolistic/duopolistic in nature.
 
III. ASBP – An Analysis of the Existing Legal Framework in India 
As evident from the cases, the Commission has been dealing with cases involving issues related to ASBP under the existing framework of Section 3 and Section 4 of the Act.
Evidence from nations where ASBP has been incorporated within the antitrust framework, primarily South Korea and Japan show that an ASBP is considered an unfair trade practice (UTP). Contrastingly, in India, CCI has held that UTPs do not form part of the Competition Act per se. In Sh. Ravi Beriwala v. Lexus Motors Limited, and M/s Indiacan Education Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Aldine Venture Pvt. Ltd. and Others, the CCI opined that the Act covers UTP only if such a practice violates Section 3 or Section 4, resulting in an appreciable adverse effect on competition (“AAEC”).
Further, assessing the possibility of dealing with a situation like ASBP under the existing provisions also reveals a few limitations. ASBP essentially is understood to occur in a vertical relationship where the contracting parties are operating in different markets. Under the Act, Section 3(4) governs the anti-competitive agreements between enterprises operating at different levels of the production chain (vertical agreements) that cause an AAEC.
It must be assessed that in regulating the vertical restraints, the assessment focuses on the impact of any agreement between upstream and downstream players, on the competition and ultimately on the consumers. Moreover, since vertical agreements are necessary to keep a robust production chain active and efficient, a rule of reason analysis has been prescribed in place of the per se rule which requires regulators to weigh the pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects of any act in question.
The cases discussed show that OPs have argued that their alleged conducts are justified on the ground of efficiency gains and are meant to benefit the end-users. It is evident that the inclusion of an assessment of ASBP under the existing provision would widen the scope of scrutiny as it would also pertain to the impact of an unfair agreement on one of the contracting parties. Whether the same negatively affects competition would be a separate question.
Such an assessment would require the commission to ascertain the following queries:

What constitutes a superior bargaining position,
The parameters to decide that the position has been abused; and
The remedies to rectify the imbalance

Such an assessment would also require drawing a connection between the protection of an inferior market player and the goals which the Act aims to accomplish.
In other words, connecting the harm caused to a counter-party’s growth and development with the widely accepted consumer welfare standard appears too far-fetched. Such an assessment would require greater scrutiny of vertical agreements and imposition of greater restrictions on vertical agreements. Additionally, making all commercial contracts contestable does not seem to be a favorable idea considering its possible impact on the ease of doing business and the possibility of over-enforcement.
For Section 4 to be applicable, establishing the dominance of the opposite party in the relevant market is a prerequisite. The ongoing case pertaining to the news media market can be squarely covered within Section 4 of the Act given Google’s dominant position in the relevant market. However, it is clear that the scope of ASBP is not restricted to a dominant entity only. It is evident that it may occur in cases where the market is oligopolistic/duopolistic in nature and could also emanate from the intrinsic nature of the market given the growing dependence of other market participants on such multi-sided markets possessing significant market power. Recently, Romanian Competition Council (“RCC”) introduced its ‘Draft Government Emergency Ordinance’ and amended ‘Law No. 11/1991 on the Repression of Unfair Competition’ incorporating ASBP in the law, making it applicable to any entity possessing at least 30 percent market share.
With an aim of regulating ASBP, several measures have been adopted by nations primarily including the introduction of bargaining codes, requiring the market players to offer voluntary measures and other commitments aimed at maintaining a level playing field amongst the market participants. However, being relatively recent, the long-term effectiveness of such measures and their compatibility with the Indian regime is yet to be assessed.
 
IV. The Way Forward
In the backdrop of the discussion and as India continues its investigation pertaining to the news media market, the following suggestions appear relevant:

The issue of ASBP would fit uncomfortably within the existing scheme of Section 3 and Section 4. Analysis of the cases discussed reveals that a situation involving ASBP has been alleged against dominant entities in most of the cases. However, it must also be noted that applicability of Section 4 is limited only to the dominant entities whereas a situation like ASBP may also exist where a superior entity does not possess a dominant position in the relevant market. Further, accommodating ASBP under Section 3(4) would require the commission to consider a change in its assessment since it may distort the rule of reason analysis by tilting the analysis towards the protection of an inferior market player.
Regulating ASBP would require the commission to govern the commercial relations between contracting entities more closely. While moving ahead in this direction, the regulations must be structured in a way that the independence of the contracting parties is not compromised. Any rampant attempt to control and guide the terms of the contracts between the parties, without any guidelines and boundaries, can result in over-enforcement, unwanted interference in commercial relations, and huge compliance costs for the intermediaries, which in the long run may affect business efficiency.
Proceeding in the direction of regulating the ASBP and, following safeguards appear relevant – narrowing the vagueness of any standards adopted to eliminate the chances of making every commercial agreement open to the scrutiny of the agencies; defining as clearly as possible the degree of dependency of other market players on the superior entity; what level of coercion exercised by such a superior entity is challengeable; and designing procedures that are relatively quick and inexpensive since it has the potential to directly affect the day-to-day operations of the parties involved.
It is evident that the laws around ASBP are still evolving and new elements are being introduced across jurisdictions to ensure greater accountability of the parties and transparency in commercial dealings. The initiatives undertaken by other regimes and the evolving mechanisms can serve as a reference for India. However, for the time being, undertaking voluntary measures and commitments appears to offer a convenient middle ground ensuring adequate compensation for the contributors.

It must also be considered that instances of alleged ASBP are not limited to the news media market. Even though India would be deliberating upon enacting a bargaining code for the news media market, it is also equally relevant to acknowledge that ASBP can be equally problematic in other relevant markets.

State attorneys general are investigating how employers collude to prohibit workers from switching jobs through unlawful “no-poach” agreements, reported Bloomberg. 
California is leading the way, with investigations in the works after some big actions against the fast food industry and Silicon Valley. “We approach this as a core economic justice issue,” said Eleanor Blume, California Department of Justice special assistant attorney general.
“This is one where we have workers’ rights and market manipulation all wrapped up in one, which makes it really important for us,” she said in an interview. “More will be coming.”
Read Again: Jimmy John’s Beats Class Action Bid In “No Poach” Suit
No-poach agreements are arrangements among employers not to recruit each other’s workers or to fix wages or other terms of employment among a pool of workers. Antitrust regulators argue they can reduce worker mobility, depress worker wages, and stifle competition.
States can buttress federal antitrust laws with additional unfair labor practice rules such as detailing what constitutes employer coercion, interference, or retaliation. Many states have recently gone further than federal law, enacting stricter standards for corporations operating in their jurisdictions.
One of the first major no-poach cases occurred in 2010 in California when the Justice Department settled with Adobe Systems Inc., Apple Inc., Google Inc., Intel Corp., Intuit Inc., and Pixar to prevent the companies from entering into no-solicitation agreements for employees.

By: Halefor Abraha, Michael Silberman & Jeremias Adams-Prassl (European Law Blog)
It has long been recognised that personal data processing in the employment context has distinct challenges that require special regulatory treatment. As early as 1999, Spiros Simitis and Mark Freedland, writing independently, reached the same conclusion (see here and here): that the omnibus rules of the now repealed Directive 95/46/EC were not fit for the particular requirements of the employment sector. A specific European directive on the protection of employees’ data was needed. Two decades on, little meaningful progress has been achieved at the policy level. Multiple attempts to introduce employment-specific data protection law at the Union level failed due to a combination of legal, political, and constitutional reasons.
While its fundamental objective is to harmonise data protection rules throughout the EU, the GDPR has a less than stellar reputation when it comes to the employment context: the GDPR is too generic adequately to cover the specificities of the employment relationship; it does not counter the informational and power asymmetry inherent in the employment relationship; and it fails to address the collective rights and interests of employees. Instead, the GDPR leaves these issues to be addressed at the Member State level. Through the opening clause under Article 88 GDPR, Member States can provide ‘more specific rules’ for data protection in the workplace through their regulatory choice (whether through legislation, collective bargaining agreements or a combination of both)…

The European Union is bracing for an onslaught of lawsuits from the largest tech companies, Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple over incoming rules that will change how the industry operates, said the head of the region’s new San Francisco outpost.
“We’re not naïve,” Gerard de Graaf, a top EUofficial focused on regulations for digital platforms, told Bloomberg News in his first interview with a US media outlet since opening the EU’s office in the heart of Silicon Valley last month. “There will be litigation.”
The new West Coast office is the latest initiative to improve the trans-Atlantic relationship after the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council was created last year to work out differences over trade and technology policy.
The new office will be headed up by Gerard de Graaf, a senior EU diplomat who has been involved in two landmark pieces of legislation passed this year.
The first of those, the Digital Services Act, has wide-reaching implications for the digital services sector, especially social media companies. Among other things, the act will ban targeted advertising aimed at children and will allow European governments to tell social media companies to take down illegal content and specify their ability to fine companies that fail to do so.
The second new regulation, the Digital Markets Act, deals with anti-competitive behavior, a concern that has been behind a string of EU antitrust cases against Big Tech in recent years.

US chipmaker Broadcom will seek early European Union antitrust approval of its proposed $61 billion (A$98 billion) acquisition of cloud computing company VMware by pointing to competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Google, people familiar with the matter said.
Announced in May, the deal is the second biggest globally so far this year and marks Broadcom’s attempt to diversify its business into enterprise software.
Tech deals have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world concerned about power concentration in a few players and the possibility of bigger companies acquiring start-ups only to shut them down.
“This (deal) is creating more competition in the cloud market where there are very big players now. This doesn’t have to go to phase two at all,” one of the people said, referring to the European Commission’s four-month long second phase investigation.
“For the Commission to go to phase two, there has to be a real competition problem – horizontal, vertical, foreclosure risk – and I think we can show those risks don’t really exist in this case,” the person said.
“We continue to make progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, with that work moving ahead as expected,” the company said.

482,"October 12, 2022",Fighting New Antitrust Rules Is a Bad Move for Big Tech,"


By Brooke Fox, Gene Kimmelman and Fiona M. Scott Morton (The Information)
Sen. Amy Klobuchar recently invoked David and Goliath when discussing her fight to pass antitrust legislation to rein in dominant tech firms. “I have two lawyers. They have 2,800 lawyers and lobbyists,” she said at this year’s Code Conference in September. But executives at those dominant tech firms would do well to remember that Goliath ultimately lost to David.
Whether or not Klobuchar’s legislation makes it to a vote this term, we’ve crossed a Rubicon. Whatever legitimate (or illegitimate) concerns may be raised about the precise wording of the bill, the fact is that Europe has already prohibited dominant tech platforms from thwarting competitors in search services, operating systems, app stores, online retail and numerous other digital markets.
It would be irresponsible for U.S. policymakers to sit on the sidelines and let others set the rules—a fact perhaps recognized by the 242 members of the House of Representatives who voted in favor of the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act, designed to strengthen antitrust enforcement. While that bill did not single out big tech companies, it passed in spite of significant opposition from the likes of Google and Amazon, a sign that lawmakers are no longer afraid to move against the industry’s wishes.

International cooperation on competition issues among agencies and governments can be great for consumers and companies alike, avoiding a host of inefficient and potentially conflicting outcomes.  But while cooperation in competition enforcement has a lengthy and venerated history, the prospect of such cooperation in competition policy design and legal implementation is a newer concept that presents a host of new risks and questions that are worth examining.  One such risk is an overlapping web of not-quite-aligned approaches by competition cooks that each add their local flavors to the stew and create the very pitfalls that international cooperation is supposed to avoid, i.e. inefficiency and conflict.  What can we learn from our collective experience with international cooperation, and where are the potential pitfalls on the road ahead?

484,"October 12, 2022",Cooperation on Digital Competition: From Cooperation to Enhanced Cooperation,"
Cooperation agreements establishing the possibility of an exchange of information between competition authorities are in general based on two hypotheses. First, they assume that the cooperating competition authorities will independently decide which cases they will investigate. Second, with respect to the cases on which cooperation is actually going to take place, it is assumed that the requested competition authority might help the requesting competition authority through the transmission of information, which the latter would not have been able to gather given the limited territorial reach of its investigatory powers and which is relevant to its investigation of the case, for which it gets the cooperation of the requested competition authority. The digital sector is one where coordination of cases between the competition authorities (as opposed to cooperation on uncoordinated cases) would be most useful. Indeed, digital platforms frequently operate simultaneously in most jurisdictions and apply the same governance rules with the same effects on their complementors or users. Yet many competition authorities have, independently of one another, opened investigations of the same practices by the same platforms (such as, for example, the compulsory use of in-app payment systems for transactions). Furthermore, the scope for helpful exchange of information concerning such cases is relatively limited as the practices are public. Enhanced co-operation mechanisms such as cross-appoi...

I. INTRODUCTION
Some countries have called for several years for international cooperation for competition in digital markets. However, there are not yet concrete proposals to achieve it. The clock is ticking. Countries worldwide are investigating and enacting new competition rules against the same firms and the same practices globally. Yet, there are no concrete cooperation mechanisms that would lead to a common solution. Instruments are vital. Competition authorities and legislators are duplicating investigations and legislation, increasing compliance and enforcement costs with a risk of inconsistency — all the ingredients for ineffective and costly enforcement. International cooperation would minimize costs and ensure effective enforcement thanks to a common approach. But how to achieve it? Thi...

Competition agencies should build on the existing and successful case-by-case cooperation framework used in assessing mergers that are notified in multiple jurisdictions and develop similar working practices when regulating competition in digital markets. In merger control we see an example of cooperation, coordination, and convergence that serves to streamline individual enforcement efforts and the mutual trust that is thereby generated can spill-over into discussions about the shape of competition law enforcement. This system also serves as a platform for learning about shared competition concerns and innovative methods for assessing competition concerns. Ex post review of regulatory solutions can serve to identify superior practices which each agency can then adopt.

487,"October 11, 2022",Regulators Move To Rein In Big Tech Dominance In Africa,"


From the $1.7 billion AdSense antitrust fine levied against Google in 2019 and the nearly $887 million privacy fine Amazon was issued last July, to the recent $405 million fine levied against Meta last month, Big Tech firms have been slapped with some of the largest corporate fines on record in the European Union.
But it’s not just Europe that is being hard on tech tycoons.
Courts and regulators in other regions have launched their own probes against these Silicon Valley giants to curb their market dominance and protect users’ data and privacy.
For example, Nigeria’s advertising regulator recently sued Meta for 30 billion naira ($70 million), alleging that the firm’s Facebook and Instagram platforms publish ads that haven’t been vetted and approved by the authorities.
In another antitrust case that could see the firm pay out up to 10% of its local earnings, South Africa’s Competition Tribunal has said it is currently reviewing Meta’s attempts to block the government’s digital engagement platform, GovChat, from accessing the WhatsApp Business API.

What’s more, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by competition watchdogs in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Mauritius and Egypt earlier this year, the stage is set for African countries to present a more united front on enforcing antitrust laws.
The MoU is behind the creation of the Africa Heads of Competition Dialogue (AHCD), an umbrella organization that intends to collaborate on market regulation and share resources to address the challenges presented by a fully international digital services sector.
The participant authorities have also committed to collectively researching obstacles to the emergence and expansion of African digital platforms and businesses to enhance competition and inclusion in the digital economy.
Africa’s Digital Sovereignty
Although still a far cry from the regulatory might of the European Commission, the integrated approach to Big Tech regulation signaled by the AHCD charts a path toward more effective, cross-border regulatory instruments.
And the AHDC’s interest in barriers to the emergence of homegrown African digital platforms in a market dominated by a handful of American tech firms echoes the EU’s focus on digital sovereignty.

That said, debates over digital sovereignty take on a different flavor in the African context, where the presence of Chinese technology and investment is as important, if not more so, than the dominance of U.S. platforms.
Yet, as Google recently announced that it is opening a cloud region in South Africa, Big Tech companies can be part of the solution too.

488,"October 11, 2022",EU Telecom Regulators Are Against US Big Tech Paying For Infrastructure,"


A group of European telecom regulators does not support the idea of having big tech firms such as Google and Netflix paying for telecommunications infrastructure, it said in initial findings published on Tuesday.
The findings by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) come as the European Commission is debating whether internet platforms should be obliged to fund digital infrastructure such as 5G telecoms networks, given they make heavy use of it.
The telecommunications industry has argued Google, Netflix, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple should pay for a “fair share” of telecom infrastructure as their services make up more than half of internet traffic.
However, digital rights groups fear that if the big tech firms fund infrastructure, they will also strike deals with telecom firms to give their own traffic preferential treatment, undermining the principle of net neutrality.
In a reaction to the BEREC findings, telecom lobby group ETNO – the European Telecommunications Network Operators, which represents Deutsche Telekom, Orange Group, Telefonica and others – rejected the BEREC findings as outdated and said it would submit new evidence to the Commission to support its position.
BEREC’s findings said the internet had proved resilient to changing traffic patterns in the past and following ETNO’s proposals “could be of significant harm”.

President Joe Biden has signed an executive order aimed at protecting data transfers between the United States and European Union.
The order, announced Friday (Oct. 7) by the White House and US Commerce Department, is designed to close out several months of uncertainty faced by countless companies following a European Court ruling that quashed earlier deals over worries about American surveillance.
According to an announcement from the White House, the executive order adds new safeguards for U.S. intelligence activity, “including requiring that such activities be conducted only in pursuit of defined national security objectives” and takes “into consideration the privacy and civil liberties of all persons, regardless of nationality or country of residence.”
The order also creates handling requirements for personal information collected during intelligence activity, and “extends the responsibilities of legal, oversight, and compliance officials to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to remediate incidents of non-compliance,” the White House announcement stated.
As PYMNYS reported in September, the EU’s relationship with American Big Tech companies, most notably Meta and Google, has grown tenser in the wake of a landmark ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
In July 2020, the CJEU struck down a transatlantic data-sharing agreement called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which was created by the Commerce Department and the European Commission (EC) to make sure that the requirements of the EU’s General Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) were adhered to when transmitting personal data from the EU to the U.S.
In March, Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), which is a preliminary agreement permitting data transfers between the two regions.

The Activision Blizzard acquisition by Microsoft is one that has caught many eyes on both the gaming industry and community. 
The deal, if approved, would see Microsoft owning the Call of Duty IP as well as other IPs in the Activision Blizzard repertoire. The deal is currently going through heavy scrutiny by several organizations. One of which is the European Commission.
As of now, Microsoft will have to wait until November 8 to hear more about whether the European Commission will permit the deal to go into its next phase. The acquisition is scrutinized by global regulators amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry, after all, so every bit of scrutiny is justified.
Now, several antitrust regulators from the EU are asking game developers whether Microsoft will be incentivized to block access to Call of Duty from rivals. According to the document that Reuters first spotted, these regulators also want to know if Activision’s trove of user data would give Microsoft a competitive advantage in developing, publishing, and distributing computer and console games.
The regulators also want to know if there would be sufficient alternative suppliers in the market following the deal and also in the event Microsoft decides to make Activision’s games exclusively available on its Xbox, Xbox Game Pass and its cloud game streaming services. Another one of the questions asked if rivals such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW, PlayStation, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Facebook Gaming would be considered attractive following the deal’s closure. All of these questions have to be answered by October 10, 2022.

491,"October 9, 2022",Antitrust Unchained: The EU’s Case Against Self-Preferencing,"


By Giuseppe Colangelo (University of Basilicata)
Whether self-preferencing is inherently anticompetitive has emerged as perhaps the core question in competition policy for digital markets. Large online platforms who act as gatekeepers of their ecosystems and engage in dual-mode intermediation have been accused of taking advantage of these hybrid business models to grant preferential treatment to their own products and services. In Europe, courts and competition authorities have advanced new antitrust theories of harm that target such practices, as have various legislative initiatives around the world. In the aftermath of the European General Court’s decision in Google Shopping, however, it is important to weigh the risk that labeling self-preferencing as per se anticompetitive may merely allow antitrust enforcers to bypass the legal standards and evidentiary burdens typically required to prove anticompetitive behavior. This paper investigates whether and to what extent self-preferencing should be considered a new standalone offense under European competition law.

492,"October 5, 2022",FTC To Rule On Microsoft’s Activision Deal By November,"


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could reportedly rule on Microsoft‘s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by late November.
That’s according to Seeking Alpha, which claims the US regulator’s inquiry is still at the staff level, but that it’s expected to progress through the Bureau of Competition and onto the commissioners over the coming weeks.
The publication’s sources claim FTC staff have significant concerns about the $68.7 billion merger, and that the regulator has been engaging with a number of competitors opposed to the transaction, including Sony and Google.
The Information reported in April that the FTC’s investigation into the deal was likely to focus on the consumer data that both companies hold as well as its potential impact on the labour market.
It also said the FTC would review the deal’s potential impact on workers who have accused Activision of harassment and discrimination, as well its potential impact on the competitive metaverse.
The acquisition is currently being scrutinised by regulators around the world amid antitrust concerns during a time of increasing consolidation in the gaming industry.
The UK competition regulator announced on Tuesday that it has set a deadline of March 1, 2023 to publish the findings of its inquiry into the deal.

493,"October 3, 2022",The EU is Crafting Liability Laws For A.I. Products That Cause Injuries—Here’s Why The Whole World Better Pay Attention,"
By: Jeremy Kahn (Fortune)
We are all eagerly awaiting Tesla’s “A.I. Day” on Friday, where Elon Musk is expected to unveil a protoype of the humanoid Optimus robot that the company has been working on for the past year. My colleague Christiaan Hetzner and I interviewed robotics experts and Tesla-watchers to get a sense of what Musk may debut tomorrow—and how close it may come to the much-hyped vision of a robot butler that the billionaire entrepreneur has spun. (Spoiler alert: probably not very close.) You can check out our story here. And of course, I am sure we’ll cover whatever it is Musk unveils in next week’s regular edition of this newsletter.
In the meantime, there was a bit of news this week that has received none of the media attention lavished on Tesla’s “A.I. Day” but may nonetheless ultimately prove more significant for how businesses use A.I. On Wednesday, the European Union, which has led the way globally in creating regulation around technology, issued a new set of proposed civil liability laws for those deploying A.I. systems. The rules try to update and harmonize existing liability rules across the 27-nation bloc to take into account the fact that with many A.I. systems, it might be difficult for someone who has been harmed by A.I. software to figure out how exactly the A.I. software works and where it went wrong.
Remember, the EU already has a new A.I. Act working its way through the legislative process. That act establishes different requirements for the use of A.I. in high-risk use cases—those that affect a person’s health, basic freedom, and financial well-being—and lower-risk use cases, such as marketing or personalization of retail offerings. Companies or organizations using A.I. for high-risk uses are required to do a lot more testing of the software, have to try to make sure the A.I.’s output can be “interpreted” by the person using the software, and must maintain an audit trail.
The new proposed rules in the EU’s A.I. Liability Directive introduce several important concepts. For one thing, the rules note that data loss is a potential harm for which someone can seek civil liability damages. For another, the proposed rules make clear that software counts as a kind of “product” under the EU’s liability laws. Consumer rights and data protection advocates cheered both of these provisions.
Then the proposal says that a court can now order a company using a high-risk A.I. system to turn over evidence of how the software works. (It does say that the disclosure must be “necessary and proportionate” to the nature of the claim, a balancing test that the EU says will help ensure that trade secrets and other confidential information is not needlessly disclosed. But, as always, it will be up to the courts to figure out how this applies in any specific case.) The EU warns that if a company or organization fails to comply with a court-ordered disclosure, the courts will be free to presume the entity using the A.I. software is liable…

By: Alden Abbott (Truth On The Market)
A White House administration typically announces major new antitrust initiatives in the fall and spring, and this year is no exception. Senior Biden administration officials kicked off the fall season at Fordham Law School (more on that below) by shedding additional light on their plans to expand the accepted scope of antitrust enforcement.
Their aggressive enforcement statements draw headlines, but will the administration’s neo-Brandeisians actually notch enforcement successes? The prospects are cloudy, to say the least.
The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) has lost some cartel cases in court this year (what was the last time that happened?) and, on Sept. 19, a federal judge rejected the DOJ’s attempt to enjoin United Health’s $13.8 billion bid for Change Healthcare. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently lost two merger challenges before its in-house administrative law judge. It now faces a challenge to its administrative-enforcement processes before the U.S. Supreme Court (the Axon case, to be argued in November).
(Incidentally, on the other side of the Atlantic, the European Commission has faced some obstacles itself. Despite its recent Google victory, the Commission has effectively lost two abuse of dominance cases this year—the Intel and Qualcomm matters—before the European General Court.)
So, are the U.S. antitrust agencies chastened? Will they now go back to basics? Far from it…

Late Wednesday the House of Representatives voted to advance a bill that would update the fees companies pay for merger reviews and strengthen state attorneys general in antitrust issues, reported Reuters.
The bill combines measures introduced by Representative Joe Neguse, a Democrat, and Representative Ken Buck, a Republican. Federal government agencies, including DOJ and FTC officials have also worked on revamping the US’s decades-old Vertical and Horizontal Merger guidelines, in efforts to adjust the rules to the rapidly changing realities of modern digital economies.

The bipartisan bill allows state attorneys general to choose which court they want to hear antitrust cases. It also states that defendants would not be allowed to request a change of venue.
Texas, along with other states, brought an antitrust action against Google in 2020 that the search and advertising giant succeeded in moving from Texas to a New York court, angering conservatives.
Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, joined with at least four other California Democrats to urge that the bill be defeated because of the venue measure. California is home to some of the biggest tech companies, including Google and Meta Platforms’ Facebook.

By Roger Paul Alford (University of Notre Dame)
This Article contends that there is an emergent bipartisan consensus that Big Tech has grown too powerful and that action must be taken to address its abuse of power. That action takes the form of a variety of legislative proposals to enhance government enforcement powers, reform the merger laws, and address self-preferencing, data portability, and interoperability. Litigation efforts focus on Facebook and Google’s abuse of monopoly power, particularly with respect to Facebook’s elimination of competition through acquisitions and Google’s abuse of monopoly power in search and display advertising. While we are in the midst of one of the most divisive and polarizing periods in our nation’s history, there is a strong bipartisan consensus on the perils of Big Tech and a desperate need to do something about it.

It was a reminder of the power Vestager wields over US tech companies. In 2014, she left her position as Denmark’s deputy prime minister to become competition chief at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. In Brussels, she took on Apple for evading paying corporate taxes in Ireland, fined Google millions for favoring its own shopping services in search, and called out Facebook’s lack of transparency in its WhatsApp acquisition—leading to her name being floated as a future president of the European Commission. In 2019, she rose to her current role as the Commission’s executive vice president for competition and technology, taking on broad enforcement power over regulating data collection and monopoly-busting within the European Union.

Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) struck a deal struck to advanced a bill out of a Senate committee that would let most news outlets collectively negotiate with dominant tech platforms for compensation to distribute their content.
The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act now specifically carves out any negotiations over content moderation, according to an amendment circulated Wednesday afternoon by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) that was obtained by POLITICO. 
Thursday’s vote to advance the bill followed two weeks of negotiations between Klobuchar and Cruz after the Democrat pulled a vote on her bill at a markup earlier this month. No negotiations or pricing agreements “may address whether or how the covered platform or any such eligible digital journalism provider displays, ranks, distributes, suppresses, promotes, throttles, labels, filters, or curates the content,” according to the amendment.
The bill was pulled after an amendment from Cruz about content moderation was adopted when Democrats were down a member with Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) isolating in India with COVID-19.
“Platforms like Facebook and Google are counting on Republicans and Democrats being unable to put aside their differences to agree on meaningful legislation in the tech sector. This is our moment to prove them wrong,” Klobuchar said at Thursday’s vote, The Hill reported. 
The bill advanced in a 15-7 vote, with seven Republicans voting against the bipartisan amendment. 
The bill provides a limited safe harbor from federal and state antitrust laws for eligible digital journalism providers, including most newsrooms that employ fewer than 1,500 full-time employees, that would allow them to participate in joint negotiations. The employee cap is largely aimed at excluding the country’s three largest newspapers and national broadcasters.

500,"September 20, 2022",Attack on Antitrust: Preventing A Grim Future for Anime Streaming,"


By Michael L. Cederblom (Brooklyn Law School)
Antitrust policy and enforcement in the United States since the 1960s has been a story of apathy and neglect. As competition concerns started to reclaim the spotlight in the legal world, the discussion became squarely focused on big tech (Amazon’s domination of digital retail markets, Google’s domination of online search, and Facebook’s domination of social media). However, numerous other markets are suffering due to our torpid policies. The visionaries of the Biden administration are faced with a pressing question: how do we unwind the damage already caused by the last few decades of detrimental concentration? After all, the best way to stop the damage of Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram would have been to block the merger in the first place.
For rising industries, it is not too late to prevent harm to competition. The anime streaming industry in the United States is growing rapidly in size and importance but faces a grim future marred by consolidation. This trend is exemplified by Funimation Global Group’s (a Sony Pictures Entertainment subsidiary) recent $1 billion acquisition of Crunchyroll. Repeated warnings of the dangers of concentrated markets have largely fallen on deaf ears. This essay acts as a renewed carrion call and a call to action for antitrust authorities: merger challenges must not be neglected in the anime streaming industry like it was in social media and online search. As anime continues to grow exponentially into a mainstream form of entertainment, accurately defining product markets and structuring markets through proper enforcement to promote fair competition can protect the competitive integrity of future markets to the benefit of both consumers and labor.

According to statements from EU Antitrust Chief Vestager, Amazon may have to change its proposals to end two investigations into its business practices. This is following feedback from the agency.
During the summer Amazon said it would set up a data silo, preventing its retail arm from using data from its marketplace to make competing private label products.
It will also end preferential treatment for itself and treat sellers equally when ranking their offers for the “buy box” on its website that generates the bulk of its sales.
Vestager had given third parties until Sept. 9 to provide feedback before deciding whether to accept the proposals.
A group of 11 non-governmental bodies and pan-European consumers’ organisation BEUC have criticised Amazon’s offer, urging the European Commission to demand adjustments to it.
“We are now in the process of assessing that feedback, some of which pointed to potential improvements on several points,” Vestager told a conference in New York.
Vestager also addressed the European Commission’s investigation of Alphabet Google’s digital advertising business, saying she was cooperating with her U.S. counterpart on the issue.
“We are also in close contact with the DOJ (Department of Justice) in the context of our investigation of Google ad tech,” she said.

By: Courtney C. Radsch (Tech Tank/Brookings)
Big Tech has enabled unparalleled reach, engagement, and innovation in the news media even as the decoupling of advertising and journalism has threatened the very foundation of a commercial news model and ushered in the era of disinformation. Lawmakers in the U.S. now appear poised to join in efforts around the world aimed at rebalancing the codependent relationship between Big Tech and news publishers with the release of an updated Senate bill enabling small news organizations to negotiate compensation from tech giants like Meta and Google that appears to have bi-partisan and bi-cameral support.
More than a year after Australia adopted a pioneering new media bargaining code and the EU Copyright Directive went into effect, the idea of getting Big Tech to pay for the news they use is gaining greater support around the world, with lawmakers in Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Sweden, the U.S., and the U.K. exploring interventions that they hope will support an industry facing an extinction event yet recognized as essential to democratic governance. Governments are also considering whether competition policy should be deployed to claw back revenue from tech behemoths and the AdTech infrastructure they control or to enable news media to collectively bargain with aggregators and other platforms that use their content.
THREE POLICY ARENAS
These legal regulatory efforts have coalesced around three dominant types of interventions: taxation, competition/antitrust, and intellectual property. The building blocks include:
Allowing publishers to collectively bargain without violating antitrust lawsRequiring platforms negotiate with publishers for the use of news snippetsRequiring platforms to pay licensing fees to publishersTaxing digital advertising and using the resulting revenues to subsidize news outlets
Australia’s 2021 news media bargaining code compels platforms to negotiate payment to media outlets for using their content, and despite criticism that it amounted to a Big Tech subsidy to Big Media given extensive lobbying by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the law has also rejuvenated  the country’s journalism sector. Australian media outlets large and small have benefitted and new journalism jobs are being created in a sector that lost thousands of opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic – though the lack of transparency into the commercial deals negotiated between publishers and platforms remains problematic…

More than a dozen tech companies whose products offer alternatives to those produced by technology giants have come out in favor of federal regulation that would rein in the largest companies.
DuckDuckGo, which offers a privacy-focused search engine that competes with Google, and Mozilla, the longtime purveyor of a browser that competes with Microsoft’s, both stated their support for the proposed legislation in a letter to members of the U.S. House and Senate.
Proton, a Switzerland-based email service that encrypts communication, also added its support alongside firms like Tutanota and Efani Secure Mobile, according to a Tuesday (Sept. 13) Reuters report.
The letter states, in part: “Massive tech platforms can exert influence over society and the digital economy because they ultimately have the power to collect, analyze, and monetize exorbitant amounts of personal information.
“This is not by accident, as some of the tech giants have intentionally abused their gatekeeper positions to lock users into perpetual surveillance while simultaneously making it difficult to switch to privacy-protective alternatives.”
Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are the lead sponsors of the “American Innovation and Choice Online Act,” which would rein in companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and Meta. According to Reuters, the likelihood the bill will become law in 2022 is declining.
“While more and more Americans are embracing privacy-first technologies, some dominant firms still use their gatekeeper power to limit competition and restrict user choice,” the alternative tech firms wrote in their letter. “We implore you to pass AICOA as it would remove barriers for consumers to freely select privacy protective services.”
Klobuchar said last week that significant opposition from Big Tech companies that don’t want new regulations may prevent the bill from becoming law.

The Justice Department’s antitrust division is ramping up hiring of trial attorneys from Big Law firms as the Biden administration heightens its focus on competition amid a surge in mergers.
The division, led by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, has brought on at least five partners from large firms—including Andrew Forman, now deputy assistant attorney general—since Kanter was nominated in July 2021, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis and data provided by the law firm and attorney analytics company Firm Prospects. At least a dozen lower-ranking attorneys from such firms were also hired during the period. 
The recent arrivals were hired from Big Law mainstays such as Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Davis Polk & Wardwell, and Winston & Strawn, along with plaintiffs firms Hausfeld and Robins Kaplan. Four attorneys—three former associates and one partner, Forman—came from Kanter’s longtime firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. 
The hiring push reflects Kanter’s focus on going to trial on tough cases rather than settling or accepting plea deals. The approach aligns with the department’s ongoing lawsuits against Big Tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Biden’s order to federal agencies to redouble enforcement of competition law. 
“It’s unprecedented for the division to hire so many senior-level litigators from outside, and the hiring surge may corroborate the rumors that DOJ is ramping up to file major new cases,” said Andre Geverola, a partner at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer and a former director of criminal litigation for the division, in an email.

In the saga of Big Tech companies and their seemingly never-ending confrontations with EU legislators, issues surrounding what the EU calls “digital sovereignty” are among the most intractable.
The European Parliament has defined digital sovereignty as “Europe’s ability to act independently in the digital world” adding that the concept should be understood in terms of both “protective mechanisms and offensive tools to foster digital innovation (including in cooperation with non-EU companies).”
The European Parliament has also at times mobilized the related concept of data sovereignty, which exists at both the individual level and at a larger scale.
For the individual, data sovereignty refers to people’s ability to control who does what with their data. But at another level, data sovereignty can refer to independence from what the EU perceives as the oversized influence of a handful of Big Tech firms in the global data economy.
Since last year, EU’s relationship with American Big Tech companies, most notably Google and Meta, has become increasingly fraught following a landmark ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The case that led to the invalidation of the Privacy Shield was initially filed by an Austrian privacy advocate, Max Schrems.

Apple may face yet another competition probe from regulators in Mexico, after a former telecommunications chief filed a complaint against tech giants on Friday.

The complaint, seen by Reuters, claims the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store charge between 15% and 20% commission, which in turn forces price inflation.Addati was previously the head of the telecommunications federation that existed before being replaced by the IFT.
He claims Mexico’s competition regulator declined to open an investigation into the matter, therefore prompting a turn toward the IFT over the matter.

In this edition of CPI Talks, we have the pleasure of presenting an interview with Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.




Is there a new drive to redefine antitrust rules for the contemporary digital economy? What in your view should the thrust of these rules be? Do you foresee further legislative reform in the U.S., along the lines of developments in Europe and elsewhere?



A central problem, as I have explained previously (including in this congressional testimony),[1] is that the courts have put too much emphasis on the risks of over-enforcement, while neglecting the risks of under-enforcement. Because the courts have undermined effective antitrust enforcement, with cases like Amex and Qualcomm elevating theoretical justifications for business conduct over rigorous empirical analysis, both legislators and enforcers need to respond. With respect to the digital economy, there are unique challenges when dominant Internet platforms acquire substantial market power and maintain it through anticompetitive means. In addition to enforcement actions, I also believe that legislative action is justified to oversee the conduct of such platforms and to require non-discriminatory access arrangements, as I explain in this letter to Congress.[2]
 



Technological innovation appears to be accelerating, particularly in certain spaces such as mobile, search, and social media. How can enforcers keep pace? Last year you launched (another) high-profile antitrust suit against Go...

In many cases, challenges to those platforms have struggled to adapt the antitrust laws to new technological and economic realities. Two main solutions have arisen: writing new laws and re-invigorating existing ones. First, new legislation provides laws that specifically address issues arising in technology platforms. Second, existing law, such as California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”), provide effective ways to curb anticompetitive and unfair practices.

511,"September 7, 2022",Trustbusters,"
History shows that individuals stop limiting their free will and begin acting for themselves when governments fail to maintain safe and functioning societies that provide public benefits.  The people of the United States founded their chosen system of government to provide checks and balances on all types of power. The resulting social contract between them requires state and federal “trustbusters” to provide those checks and balances on both each other and all those who seek to become totalitarians of trade so that society can enjoy the innovation and choices that competition creates. As we look at current conditions in the vaccine, baby formula, and other industry marketplaces, are they efficiently and effectively innovating and providing society with choices? State enforcers’ more than a century of experience demonstrates that such public benefits can be achieved by serving as champions of competition, proactive preventers and healers of harm, and deputies of deterrence.

I. INTRODUCTION
A silver lining to the ongoing pandemic is that it showcases how competitive markets can efficiently and effectively drive innovation that benefits society as a whole. According to reporting from CNBC, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies were aware of a mysterious and dangerous new pathogen spread in Wuhan, China from at least the earliest months of 2020. Yet, they contented themselves with nicely “playing in a sandbox”[2] to minimi...

Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company planning to take former President Donald Trump’s media firm public, scheduled a shareholder meeting Tuesday as it seeks to extend the deadline for the merger for as much as a year.
Trump Media and Technology Group and the SPAC have faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. A federal probe was launched into possible securities violations over the deal. Fox Business reported that Truth Social was in financial trouble and had failed to pay a vendor over $1 million in contractually obligated payments, an allegation which the company denied.
DWAC itself warned shareholders that a decline in the ex-president’s popularity could hurt the deal. Indeed, the vote comes amid a Justice Department criminal probe into whether Trump illegally removed thousands of White House documents, including those marked “Top Secret” and “Classified,” to his Mar-a-Lago private home after he left the presidency.
Truth Social has faced its own scrutiny. The app was barred from the Google Play store for violating the store’s policies regarding the moderation of user-generated content. The platform remains accessible online and on the Apple App Store.
DWAC and Trump Media face a Thursday deadline to complete the merger, and the SPAC is eagerly seeking an extension.

515,"September 4, 2022",Misuse of Market Power in Australia: Early Assessment of the Amended Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act,"

By Mel Marquis & Rhonda Smith1
 
I. Introduction
In the nearly 50-year saga of modern Australian competition law, the section relating to the misuse of market power has recently been substantially revised. The revisions include removal of the requirement to establish a nexus between substantial market power and the alleged anti-competitive conduct and the introduction of an effects test as an alternative to proving and anti-competitive purpose. Significant uncertainty now looms large in this area of the law, and authoritative judicial interpretations are needed so that businesses can better gauge how far the most recent amendments in 2017 have augmented the legal risks that shape their conduct.
Our early assessment is that there seems to be cause for concern. Unless future jurisprudence proves us wrong, it appears that the former defects in Section 46 (“s.46”) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (“CCA”) (i.e. the prohibition against “misuse of market power”) that provoked the 2017 amendments were less troubling than the new problems caused by those revisions. Whereas the previous form of the prohibition was criticized by some for allowing false acquittals as the price of avoiding false convictions, the scales may now have been tipped too far to the other side. In this paper we explain why we are cautiously pessimistic.
Section II discusses the former version of s.46 of the CCA. Section III recalls the impact of the so-called Harper review, which led to a complete re-write of s.46 in 2017. Section IV tentatively assesses how the 2017 reform may affect outcomes, and comments on what appears to be a new period of uncertainty that may dampen investment and desirable competitive conduct.
  
II. The Vintage Section 46
After a false dawn for competition law in Australia in 1906, and another in 1965, a modern competition statute with meaningful prohibitions was finally adopted in 1974.2 Since then, s.46(1) has been revised periodically, most recently in 2017. The pre-2017 version provided:
A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of:





eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation …
preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or
deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.





Two features are worth highlighting. First, the phrase ‘shall not take advantage of that power’ was understood to require a causal link between the firm’s market power and the impugned behavior.3 The requirement of the causal link was relaxed when the High Court suggested that it would suffice to show that market power “materially facilitated” the conduct at issue.4 Yet it remained the case that no contravention was established if the factor that enabled the conduct was not a defendant’s market power but rather its financial power, or “material and organisational assets.”5
Second, while the above “proscribed purposes” may be relevant to the issue of foreclosure, the provision appears to neglect the interests of consumers, other than an oblique reference in s.46(c). Later judgments had to clarify that exclusionary conduct only contravenes s.46 if the foreclosure is meaningful to the “competitive process,” that is to say if it would serve to weaken competitive constraints or keep competitive pressure at bay.6 Consumer interests are thus protected indirectly. Nevertheless, the wording of s.46 may have overemphasized the “proscribed purposes” and the impact on particular competitors.7 In the 2003 Boral case, where the High Court rejected allegations of predatory pricing, Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Callinan felt obliged to warn that it was “dangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power. Indeed, in such a case, a process of reasoning that commences with a finding of purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor and then draws the inference that a firm with the objective must have and be exercising a substantial degree of power in a market is expected to be flawed.”
The High Court also offered the following observations with regard to the “take advantage” element: “[I]f the impugned conduct has a business rationale, that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment, it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of that power.” The latter statement became a basic litmus test, with courts focusing on counterfactual market comparisons and, where relevant, whether the firm had already implemented a practice prior to acquiring substantial market power.8 However, uncertainty emerged again when some cases used the phrase could engage instead of would engage, or combined or conflated the two,9 which may have further restricted the scope of application of s.46.10 Considering the confusion caused by would versus could,11 the Australian Parliament in 2008 clarified that the operative word was would, thus removing any doubt as to the implicit condition that the hypothetical benchmark firm active on this imagined market should be assumed to be a rational profit-maximiser. The relevant provision added at that time, s.46(6A)(c), became moot in 2017 when the legal test for misuse of market power was overhauled.
It is worth noting briefly that both prior to 2017 and still today, some forms of potentially exclusionary behavior can also trigger the prohibition against exclusive dealing (including tying conditions).12 At least in unusual circumstances, a firm that does not have a substantial degree of market power could still cause a substantial lessening of competition, in particular if the market is at the crease between competitive conditions and overly rigid barriers due to a thicket of vertical contracts.13
There was little doubt that the pre-2017 requirement of a causal link between market power and alleged misconduct played a significant role in the formative s.46 jurisprudence, though it was softened somewhat by the above-mentioned Section 46(6A).14 Having remodeled s.46, the Parliament has unambiguously deleted that requirement.
 
III. The Harper Review and the 2017 Reconstruction of Section 46
The “root and branch” expert review of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, i.e. the Harper Review,15 drew much attention. With regard to s.46, and controversially,16 the expert panel endorsed a near-total recast of the prohibition. The revised formulation, which survived vigorous lobbying by big business17 and was ultimately enshrined in the Act in November 2017, reads in pertinent part:
A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in (a) that market; or (b) any other market in which that corporation, or a body corporate that is related to that corporation: [supplies or acquires goods or services, or is likely to do so].18
Gone are two trademark elements of the old version of this provision: the “take advantage” test, and with it the requirement of a causal link between the firm’s market power and the allegedly unlawful conduct; and the need to match the conduct with one of the “proscribed purposes.” While the amendment is a striking departure from the previous version of Section 46, the “substantial lessening of competition” standard had already long been embedded within the other provisions of the Act governing mergers, exclusive dealing and (non-cartel) restrictive agreements.
  
IV. The Effect of the Changes to Section 46: An Early Assessment
It has been nearly five years since the revised s.46 came into force, yet the effect of these changes remains uncertain. Only one matter — TasPorts19 — has reached the court, and it is of limited precedential value as it was not fully litigated. In this case, Engage Marine (“Engage”) won a contract to provide towage and pilotage services to Grange Resources (“Grange”) at Port Latta in Northwest Tasmania; the contract had previously been held by the incumbent, TasPorts. After Grange notified TasPorts that it was going to switch to Engage, TasPorts imposed a new port access charge on Grange, potentially making use of Engage’s services uneconomic. The ACCC alleged that the incumbent’s conduct prevented Engage from servicing the contract and expanding its operations in the relevant market. TasPorts imposed new charges on Engage’s tugboats, thus making it uneconomic for Engage to use TasPorts’ temporary berths, while failing to provide long term berths as well. This forced Engage to deploy a temporary offshore mooring outside of another port, and prevented deployment of the second tug required under its Grange contract. TasPorts also failed or refused to provide marine pilot training to Engage. As TasPorts admitted these breaches, the Federal Court did not adopt a fully considered decision but issued a Declaration giving effect to those admissions on May 5, 2021. Under the circumstances, this matter provides no insights as to how the Australian courts will interpret the revised s.46.
The lack of a fully litigated case is particularly significant given the nature of the CCA. Compared to statutes such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 1890,20 which identifies two general forms of conduct and relies on judges to give them meaning, the Australian CCA is far more prescriptive. However, the revised s.46 is an exception: the provision is now more open-textured, and somewhat ambiguous. What is clear, as explained above, is that s.46 can only apply if a firm possesses substantial market power. The conduct must then be shown to have the purpose and/or effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. A firm with substantial market power is entitled to defend its market position from aggressive competitors by adding value — improving its product and/or reducing its costs — but not by engaging in exclusionary conduct that harms the competitive process.
As we have also seen, under the revised s.46, it is no longer necessary to show that the conduct involves the use (i.e. the “taking advantage”) of the firm’s market power. This is significant because, previously, whether a firm had taken advantage of its market power was generally assessed by whether the relevant conduct would be economically rational absent the firm’s market power.21 For example, a firm with substantial market power might refuse to supply because it would facilitate competition but would not refuse if the market were competitive and the buyer could obtain supply elsewhere. However, if the supplier was concerned about the buyer’s creditworthiness, or concerned about the buyer producing low quality products which would tarnish the supplier’s reputation, it would presumably refuse supply even in a competitive market. In the latter circumstance, there would have been no contravention under the “old” s.46.
Removal of the “take advantage” requirement from s.46 means that differentiating between anti-competitive conduct and possibly aggressive “competition on the merits” now falls to the substantial lessening of competition test. As Kemp points out, the provision “does not expressly permit the dominant firm to raise an efficiency defence or justification for its conduct.”22 Under the old s.46, conduct that did no more than increase efficiency would likely have been pursued by a firm in a competitive market and it would not have been a taking advantage of market power. That same line of reasoning does not mesh easily with s.46 in its current form.23 Nevertheless, as Kemp24 and Williams25 have argued, increased efficiency — productive, allocative and dynamic — fuels competition. Consequently, if conduct is being assessed to determine whether it substantially lessens competition, the extent to which it increases efficiency should be a relevant consideration. On the other hand, it is not yet clear how demanding Australian courts will be with regard to efficiency claims under s.46 following the 2017 reform.26
One of the problems with the substantial lessening of competition test that has been highlighted by the concerns about the effectiveness of the mergers provision of the CCA (s.50) is the requirement of evidence regarding the effect of future conduct which satisfies the Evidence Act 1995. In the context of unilateral conduct, the challenged practice in some cases may already have occurred, and sufficient time may have elapsed to identify its effect. Frequently, however, this will not be the case: sufficient time will not have passed before the conduct ceases in response to an inquiry by the ACCC and/or because there is the potential for litigation.
Enforcement of competition law involves trade-offs between the risk that pro-competitive conduct will mistakenly be found anticompetitive (Type I error) and the risk that anticompetitive behavior will mistakenly be found not to be so (Type II error). Traditionally, the view has been that Type I errors have more adverse effects than Type II errors and so (all else being equal) the priority should be to minimize Type I errors.27 The amendments to s.46 tend toward the opposite view. They broaden the catchment for finding a misuse of market power. Is the provision now too broad? Will it over-reach? In part, this depends on the effectiveness of the substantial lessening of competition test in distinguishing pro-competitive conduct from anticompetitive conduct, as noted above. However, leaving that to one side, it also depends on the wording of the section. Consider the following example. Assume that a company with substantial market power seeks to increase its purchases of a necessary input to meet increased demand for its product. It enters into contracts with suppliers, including some that supply its competitors. Consequently, some competitors may no longer be able to acquire sufficient inputs to continue to operate, or they may be uncompetitive because they face increased input costs. Under the old s.46 it might be argued that the company is simply seeking to produce more and maximize its profits: it has not used its market power to engage in exclusionary conduct, and it has no anticompetitive purpose. Under the revised s.46, the outcome is less clear. Irrespective of its purpose, if the effect of the conduct is to foreclose existing competitors (and likely raise entry barriers), it may well contravene s.46. Such a scenario illustrates a degree of uncertainty for business following the 2017 reform. Much will depend on how the ACCC and ultimately the courts consider that s.46 should be applied.
One way of testing the effect of the changes to s.46 is to assess whether cases that were unsuccessful under the former s.46 would be likely to succeed under the revised s.46. In Rural Press28 the ACCC was successful in proving that a non-compete agreement between two publishers of local subscription newspapers in South Australia would substantially lessen competition in contravention of s.45, the prohibition of anticompetitive agreements. However, it was unsuccessful in establishing that a threat by one of the publishers to enter the other’s territory with a free newspaper would contravene s.46 even though fear that this would occur at the least contributed to entry into the non-compete agreement. The reasoning of the High Court on appeal in relation to the failure under s.46 was that Rural Press could engage in such a threat even in a competitive market, that is, it did not need market power to do so. With respect, perhaps the relevant question was whether Rural Press would have achieved its objective by its threat, and whether the conduct would have been profitable had the market been competitive. Under the revised s.46, to succeed in its claim the ACCC would need to establish that the purpose of the threat was to force Waikerie Printing into the non-compete agreement and/or that the threat had that effect which in turn, as established in relation to s.45, had the effect of substantially lessening competition.
Pegg carries out a similar assessment in relation to Cement Australia.29 In that case, the ACCC was successful in establishing that Cement Australia had engaged in conduct that substantially lessened competition under s.45. The trial judge found that:
[T]he scope of the rights provision was included for a substantial purpose of preventing or discouraging a rival from obtaining access to Tarong and Tarong North raw flyash for processing … and to prevent a rival entering the SEQ [South East Queensland] concrete grade flyash market with processed Tarong or Tarong North flyash. Thus, a substantial purpose of the formulation and inclusion of [the relevant clauses] was a substantial purpose of substantially lessening competition in each market.30
However, the ACCC was unsuccessful in its claim that the conduct — entering into contracts to purchase more flyash than it reasonably required — was a misuse of market power intended to prevent or deter competition. Pegg sums up the trial judge’s findings as follows:
While Cement Australia had a substantial degree of power within the cement market and the conduct undertaken by Cement Australia was for the prescribed purposes of locking out competitors, the conduct did not involve Cement Australia taking advantage of their market power… [because] a firm sans market power could have entered into these agreements and therefore… [His Honour] did not conclude that Cement Australia had taken advantage of its market power.31
As in Rural Press, arguably the problem is the way in which the counterfactual is expressed. Leaving that aside, considering the court’s finding that the effect of the contracts was to substantially lessen competition contrary to s.45, it seems likely that, if there had been no “take advantage” criterion under s.46 at that time, Cement Australia’s conduct would have breached the latter provision as well.32
A survey by Gilbert & Tobin (2021) of applications and settlements since November 2017 when the revisions to s.46 took effect suggests that the reform may have encouraged private litigation.33 They found that “over the last 18 months, while no final judgments have been made, there have been interim remedies ordered (injunctions against both Facebook and Google) and evidence of at least two commercial settlements.”34 However, various problems still face private litigants, particularly as “[p]rivate litigation almost always turns, ultimately, on price.”35 Past experience indicates that courts are not well equipped to make orders concerning pricing, given the complexity of arriving at an effective form of injunctive relief in this context.36 As the authors conclude: “for private litigants, the attractiveness of section 46 as a legal claim will depend to a substantial degree on whether Courts can develop a set of remedies that adequately respond to anti-competitive pricing practices.”37
 
V. Conclusion
In this paper we have questioned whether the perceived flaws in the drafting of the “old” abuse of dominance provision in Australia have been overcorrected, resulting in a perverse “cure” for an exaggerated disease. If the Australian courts do nothing to allay these concerns, in particular by interpreting the reformulated s.46 in a supple way that allows for socially beneficial aggressive competition even where it has incidental foreclosure effects, yet another redesign may be required. As noted above, the public authority has brought only one case so far under the revised s.46, and the matter was not litigated but rather was resolved through judicial approval of an admission of contravention and penalty. The future approach of the Courts in this area of the law thus remains unknown.

3 This contrasts with Article 102 TFEU, for example, in respect of which there is no formal need to show that an imaginary non-dominant firm would not have engaged in the same conduct. See Case 6-72, Europemballage and Continental Can v. Commission, EU:C:1973:22, para 27. On the other hand, it is likely (in an exclusionary conduct case) that there must be a logical link between the dominant position and the harm, i.e. between the dominant position and effect of the conduct on an otherwise “effective competition structure.” See Ekaterina Rousseva, Rethinking Exclusionary Abuses in EU Competition Law (Hart 2010) 73-79; Renato Nazzini, The Foundations of European Union Competition Law and the Objectives and Principles of Article 102 (OUP 2011) 176-178. In other words, the (seldom articulated) issue is not on whether a hypothetical non-dominant firm would have engaged in the conduct, but whether the same conduct by a non-dominant firm would have had the same anti-competitive effect.

8 To dispel doubts, the High Court had to clarify that the relevant counterfactual did not call for the heroic assumption of a perfectly competitive market, but only a (workably competitive) market where no firm has substantial market power. See Melway, supra note 4, paragraph 52.

12 Given the partial overlap between the scope of s.46 and that of s.47, claims of misuse of market power have commonly been accompanied by parallel allegations of unlawful exclusive dealing under s.47. See, e.g. ACCC v. Safeway Stores (No 2) (2003) 119 FCR 339; ACCC v. Baxter Healthcare (2008) 170 FCR 16; ACCC v. Pfizer Australia [2018] FCAFC 78.

14 Opinions differed regarding the extent to which s.46(6A) broadened the scope of the “take advantage” test. See Luke Woodward & Matt Rubinstein, The use and abuse of section 46 (2016), p.10, https://cdn.brandfolder.io/3RTTK3BV/as/pev81q-9t241k-dovisy/Luke_Woodward-Theuseandmisuseofsection46.pdf. Commenting on the Cement Australia and Pfizer cases, the authors emphasize the impact of s.46(6A), stating for example with regard to Pfizer that the Federal Court “did not immunise conduct on the basis that a firm without market power could or would have engaged in similar conduct.”
15 See Harper et al., supra note 13.

23 Prior to November 2017, authorization, that is, an exemption granted on the basis that the conduct would result in a net public benefit, was not available for behavior constituting a misuse of market power. As this mechanism is now available for s.46 conduct, efficiency gains could, at least in theory, justify such an authorization (provided the conduct has not yet been implemented). However, since an application for authorization amounts to an invitation to the regulator, by a firm with substantial market power, to test claims that the ‘public benefit’ would outweigh the ‘public detriment’, such applications might prove rare. The incentive to apply may be particularly weak if a firm fears its submission would later be turned against it as an admission of substantial market power. See Kemp, supra note 10, at 180.

By: Stijn Huijts (The Platform Law Blog)
Last week, I spoke at the Video Games Bar Association’s annual summit which took place at devcom in Cologne, Germany. The event confirmed to me that gaming is where the innovative technologies of the future are in many ways already a reality today.
It was my contention at the conference that competition law is turning its eye to gaming. Why?
Why gaming is moving into the spotlight
First, many of the most eye-catching recent cases have centred around Big Tech. We have seen competition cases, including billion Euro penalties, involving Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta recently. As we have discussed in previous blog posts, these have covered widely diverging practices, from the App Store and Play Store rules to how Google self-preferences in Search, and from Amazon giving itself a better deal than independent sellers to Meta’s use of data. Some mergers have seen deeper scrutiny and some deals have been blocked.
When a sector comes under such intense scrutiny, competition authorities and policy makers acquire a deeper understanding of the companies involved. With respect to gaming, the idea has taken hold – not completely unjustified – that gaming is both a major revenue generator and an important area for innovation for these Big Tech firms…

The record lobbying spending puts Apple on pace to exceed the $6.5 million paid during all of 2021. The company spent nearly $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2022 – the most it has ever spent – and dropped $1.9 million during the second quarter.
But after years-long investigations by the Department of Justice, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission into alleged anticompetitive behavior by Apple and other Silicon Valley tech giants including Amazon, Google and Meta, POLITICO reported last week that lawyers at the DOJ are drafting an antitrust complaint against Apple.
Apple’s troubles have not been limited to the US. The company found itself in the European Commission’s crosshairs after Spotify complained that Apple unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.
 Likewise, Apple and a number of other large digital firms have been criticized and scrutinized recently in Asia, with their representatives being invited to India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance for hearings on alleged anti-competitive practices of big tech firms.

The European Commission has opened a San Francisco office to help ease the flow of communication between the European Union’s executive branch and California-based Big Tech firms.
Over the years, the relationship between the EU and Silicon Valley technology companies like Google and Meta has been turbulent, to say the least, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. The most contentious issues revolve around data protection and antitrust laws, with the EU often taking a hardline stance on the business practices of United States tech firms.
The new West Coast office is the latest initiative to improve the trans-Atlantic relationship after the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council was created last year to work out differences over trade and technology policy.
“It is a concrete step to further reinforce the EU’s work on issues such as cyber and countering hybrid threats, and foreign information manipulation and interference,” said EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice President of the European Commission Josep Borrell in a Thursday (Sept. 1) press release.
The new office will be headed up by Gerard de Graaf, a senior EU diplomat who has been involved in two landmark pieces of legislation passed this year.
The first of those, the Digital Services Act, has wide-reaching implications for the digital services sector, especially social media companies. Among other things, the act will ban targeted advertising aimed at children and will allow European governments to tell social media companies to take down illegal content and specify their ability to fine companies that fail to do so.
The second new regulation, the Digital Markets Act, deals with anti-competitive behavior, a concern that has been behind a string of EU antitrust cases against Big Tech in recent years.

Stanford University was subpoenaed by Elon Musk as part of his legal fight with Twitter over his plan to walk away from a $44 billion takeover offer.
Lawyers for Musk want all records of all “conversations, conferences, discussions, interviews, meetings, negotiations and agreements” between Twitter and Stanford as well as anyone related to the university about the proposed deal, according to a subpoena issued Wednesday in Delaware.  
At the age of 24, Musk started a doctoral program in physics at Stanford in 1995 but dropped out after two days. Earlier this month, the Tesla founder tweeted about a letter he received from a Stanford professor telling him about the cutting-edge research he missed out on. 
It’s not clear what connection Musk thinks Stanford has to the deal, but the university has links to much of what goes on in Silicon Valley. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has a Stanford Ph.D. in computer science, and Fei Fei Li, a computer science professor at the university, serves on the company’s board. Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were also Stanford computer science grad students.

In this edition of CPI TechREG Talks, we have the pleasure of presenting a summary of a discussion with Philip Marsden and Allens partner Jacqueline Downes, moderated by Katharine Kemp. This discussion was hosted by the UNSW Allens Hub for Technology Law and Innovation in Sydney, Australia on August 10, 2022. We thank all the participants for contributing to this discussion for CPI.




We see abuse allegations before regulators and courts against various tech companies, both exclusionary (notably Amazon in respect of its competition with merchants on its marketplace, Google allegedly giving itself advantages over other ad tech providers; Apple preventing app developers from using other in-app payment systems, and so on), and exploitative (e.g. Meta’s alleged excessive accumulation of consumer data as a condition of using their platform). In spite of all this activity, there is great dissatisfaction with competition litigation as a means of solving these issues. 



Philip, by way of background, can you talk about what’s going on globally in response to that dissatisfaction, especially in proposals for ex ante or upfront regulation, particularly in the EU and the U.S.?
Philip Marsden
As regards the U.S. and the EU, the substantive rationale for ex ante regulation tends to be structural problems relating to network effects and data accumulation. These can give firms an opportunity to exert market power and use it in some way, to exclude or to exploit. And that...

521,"August 31, 2022",“A Rose by any Other Unique Identifier”: Regulating Consumer Data Tracking and Anonymisation Claims,"
Representations in online privacy policies that certain data is anonymous or “not information that personally identifies you” can have significant consequences. They may indicate that the firm considers the data to be outside the scope of data protection regulation, and/or give consumers the impression that this is data which cannot have an impact on the individual; for example, that it will not add to the individual consumer’s profile. However, there are a growing range of data practices and services offered by adtech and data analytics providers that do affect individuals’ privacy while claiming not to use personal information, including persistent unique identifiers, data matching using hashed emails and other “identity resolution” services – practices which are not within most consumers’ knowledge or understanding. Obfuscation about such activities may not only mislead consumers, but hinder competition on privacy quality by firms that seek to compete on the basis of genuinely privacy-enhancing features. This article argues that claims of anonymization and pseudonymization require tighter regulation under data protection law and should also be rigorously scrutinized under consumer protection law for potential misleading conduct.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the greatest engine for economic growth in the recent history, digital platforms have transformed people’s ways of lives, and brought convenience as a standard. With innovated ways of doing businesses, platforms with the help of technology advances are now able to substantially bring down, if not to eliminate, transaction costs, by bypassing middleman and expanding business reach nation-wide or even world-wide. Consumers are now able to enjoy a wider range of products with reduced prices. More jobs are created as platforms increase opportunities and ways of doing businesses. Competitors in the traditional non-digital world certainly have different thoughts, however, as innovations and the fast expansion of their digital counterparts are threatening the very existence of their livelihood. Users, in particular business ones, are highly dependent upon those platforms, and hence have concerns over the influence exerted by platforms on their businesses.

523,"August 31, 2022",Why Regulation of Dark Patterns Is Here to Stay,"
Consumer protection regulators across a variety of jurisdictions are taking on the challenge of combating online “dark patterns” through targeted enforcement actions and new rulemaking initiatives. Broadly speaking, dark patterns are user interface techniques that benefit an online service by leading users into making decisions they might not otherwise make. Some dark patterns deceive users, while others exploit cognitive biases or shortcuts to manipulate their actions. But businesses complain that authorities’ newly found attention to the issue of dark patterns risks targeting legitimate persuasion techniques that have been long used in the marketplace. Alternatively, they complain that dark patterns are a squishy or amorphous concept and that the lack of standards creates an unacceptable degree of regulatory uncertainty. This article examines the future of dark patterns regulation for the tech industry and explains why the issue is not a passing fad. I argue that businesses should prepare for continued scrutiny of their practices and should develop proactive mechanisms to address regulatory risk.

Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan has appointed RPC’s head of competition, Lambros Kilaniotis, to boost its antitrust offering.
Kilaniotis, who has been with RPC since 2013, is a solicitor-advocate with a dual contentious and non-contentious competition practice. On the disputes side, Kilaniotis has represented claimants on competition damages claims relating to the interchange fees cartel and acted for Google in its defence of consumer collective opt-out proceedings in the Competition Appeals Tribunal.
He will co-head Quinn Emanuel’s UK competition practice alongside partner Kate Vernon, who said of his arrival: ‘Lambros is an outstanding lawyer with the technical and tactical skills required to win the most demanding cases. We are building a compelling competition litigation brand here in London and Lambros will be integral to that process.’
Richard East, senior partner at Quinn’s London office, added: ‘Lambros is a great addition to our existing competition practice, which has gone from strength to strength this year. He has an impressive track record for both winning complex competition disputes and achieving very favourable out-of-court settlements. As a higher-rights advocate, he has the legal and technical skills our clients demand and we are sure he will flourish at Quinn Emanuel.’

EU antitrust regulators will not appeal a court ruling scrapping its 997-million-euro ($991 million) fine against Qualcomm, people familiar with the matter said, in a major win for the US chipmaker that ends a long-running saga.

Judges also invalidated the Commission’s analysis that payments made by Qualcomm to Apple (AAPL.O) were anti-competitive because the regulator had not taken into account all the relevant facts.

This was an important step for the claim as it allows for a faster first hearing on the merits.

529,"August 24, 2022",Some Reflections of a Former Competition Agency Head,"
After 11 years as Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in this article Rod Sims reflects on a range of antitrust issues, emphasising their importance to our economy more broadly. There is much here to promote reflection and discussion within the antitrust community. He takes a broad look at the objective of antitrust, wonders why antitrust takes so little account of corporate strategy logic and experience, and argues competition agencies should bias towards over enforcement if they are to be effective. He then argues that merger laws around the world need to change towards greater focus on the industry concentration flowing from the merger and less on predicting future conduct. He discusses the role of economists in antitrust, what to do about the significant limitations of court processes in antitrust and looks at the different approaches being considered to the regulation of large digital platforms. Finally, he asks why competition law practitioners apparently interested in consumer welfare have such disdain for consumer law, and he argues that competition agencies need to be the champions of competition across all its dimensions.

A bipartisan group of US lawmakers released a revised version of a bill aimed at making it easier for news organizations to negotiate collectively with platforms like Google and Facebook.
The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act “removes legal obstacles to news organizations’ ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value,” according to a news release from the lawmakers.
The group includes Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy, both members of the Judiciary Committee, and House Judiciary Committee members David Cicilline, a Democrat, and Ken Buck, a Republican.
A previous version of the bill, introduced in March 2021, was opposed by two technology industry trade groups that Meta Platforms’ Facebook, and Alphabet’s Google belong to – the Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice.
The updated bill would cover news publishers with fewer than 1,500 full-time employees and non-network news broadcasters. It would allow them to work together to win better deals from Facebook, Google and other large platforms, according to the news release.
The 2021 legislation would have applied to any print, broadcast or digital news organization with a dedicated editorial staff that published at least on a weekly basis.

531,"August 23, 2022",The Digital Markets Act and the Illusion of ‘Future-Proof’ Tech Regulation,"


By Yunsieg Kim (University of Missouri)
On July 5, 2022, the European Parliament passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), intended to curb anticompetitive behavior and other unfair practices by platforms such as Apple and Google. For example, Apple’s App Store is currently the only means of distributing apps for iOS. Apple has been accused of exploiting such gatekeeping powers to engage in self-preferencing—such as ranking Apple apps above third-party apps in the Apple App Store’s most-popular-apps charts.Whereas conventional antitrust law targets conduct that harms efficiency, like price-fixing, the DMA prohibits acts deemed to be “unfair” independent of whether they affect efficiency. For example, a gatekeeper “shall not treat more favo[]rably[] in ranking . . . products offered by the gatekeeper itself than similar services or products of a third party” and “shall apply transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions to such ranking,” “independent from the actual . . . effects of the conduct of a given gatekeeper . . . on competition.” European authorities also stress their goal of “future-proofing” the DMA. To that end, the European Commission can “supplement” the DMA’s various provisions, including the self-preferencing ban, without legislative amendment.

Europe’s regulators are preparing for legal challenges to landmark legislation designed to tackle Big Tech, as member states have become increasingly concerned over how the new rules will be enforced.
EU politicians hailed the passing of the Digital Markets Act, a law that comes into force next year and is expected to set the global standard for how large online platforms such as Google, Amazon and Facebook must operate.
But a series of doubts have emerged since the act was passed earlier this year, according to EU officials and company executives who have been scrutinising the legislation.
The concerns include big tech groups seeking to undermine the provisions through litigation, member states seeking the spotlight with their national cases outside the remit of the new rules, and the European Commission not hiring enough staff to meet the enormous task of enforcing the laws.
Some of the new obligations in the DMA include a ban on companies ranking their own products on their internet platforms ahead of rivals and a promotion of sharing data with smaller competitors.
Gerard de Graaf, a senior EU official who next month will become the head of the bloc’s new office in Silicon Valley, is among those who expect a legal fight over the measures.
“There will be litigation [from tech companies], no doubt,” de Graaf told reporters recently. “We are prepared for litigation but we would like a constructive discussion with the platforms rather than an adversarial discussion.”

German regulators are reportedly considering whether Microsoft should fall within the scope of new competition rules, as they have determined several other big tech companies do.

Apple also is being considered for examination. 
Under the act, which went into effect in January 2021, Germany can move fast to prohibit conduct that is anti-competitive, such as self-preferencing and pre-installation of services, per the report. 
To be subject to the rules, companies must be found to have “paramount significance for competition across markets,” according to the report. 
Elsewhere in Europe, Microsoft’s deal to buy Activision Blizzard is being looked into by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, Reuters reported in July. 
“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” said Lisa Tanzi, corporate vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, according to the Reuters report. 
In addition, Italian cloud provider Aruba SpA and several Denmark-based cloud providers filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Union’s antitrust watchdog in April, charging Microsoft with undermining its competition and limiting consumers’ computing services choices, Bloomberg reported April 13.

The bipartisan antitrust bill targeting Big Tech companies like Amazon, Apple and Google is being kicked to the fall election season as Congress readies for its overdue five-week recess after staying late and hustling to pass several pieces of legislation, including the long-awaited climate, tax and healthcare package.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is planning a vote in the fall but the busy election season means there won’t be an abundance of days to schedule a session, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Monday (Aug. 8).
If Congress neglects to make a move and vote, it will end up being a victory for tech companies, which have already thrown billions into lobbying efforts to defeat the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
The legislation would make it illegal for Big Tech firms to give preferential treatment to their own products and services. Companies would not be allowed to steer consumers to their own in-house products instead of competitors’ offerings in any manner that could be seen as harming competition, PYMNTS reported in June.
The bill sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has some Republican support, but many conservatives are adamantly opposed to it.
“If the bill had the support its supporters contended, it wouldn’t be a bill, it would be a law,” Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), told the WSJ. The group’s members include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Meta.

The Indian government unexpectedly withdrew a proposed bill on data protection that a panel of lawmakers had been laboring over for more than two years, saying it was working on a new law.
The abandoned legislation, Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, would have required internet companies like Meta and Google to get specific permission for most uses of a person’s data, and would have eased the process of asking for such personal data to be erased. Countries worldwide have been adopting such steps, including in Europe with the General Data Protection Regulation.
But privacy advocates and some lawmakers complained that the bill would have given the government excessively broad powers over personal data, while exempting law enforcement agencies and public entities from the law’s provisions, ostensibly for national security reasons.
Salman Waris, a lawyer at TechLegis in New Delhi who specializes in international technology law, said the bill was “a bad draft from the inception,” because it would have given the government broad powers to store, use and control the large amounts of data it gathered on its citizens, including fingerprints and iris scans.
In a note to the parliamentary panel last year, Manish Tewari, an opposition politician from the Indian National Congress party, said the bill created “two parallel universes — one for the private sector, where it would apply with full rigor, and one for the government, where it is riddled with exempti...

India’s government on Wednesday withdrew a data protection and privacy bill which was first proposed in 2019 and had alarmed big technology companies such as Facebook and Google, reported Reuters. 
The 2019 law had proposed stringent regulations on cross-border data flows and proposed giving the Indian government powers to seek user data from companies, seen as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stricter regulation of tech giants.
A government notice said the decision came as a parliamentary panel’s review of the 2019 bill suggested many amendments, leading to the need for a new “comprehensive legal framework”. The government will now “present a new bill”, the notice added.
IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Reuters the government has started drafting the new bill, “which is in good advanced stages”, with a public release “very close”.
The government aims to get the new bill approved and made into law by early 2023 in the parliament’s budget session which typically runs January-February, he said.

Millions of European businesses are poised to be affected by the banning of Google Analytics, resulting in several possible scenarios. The first is a total ban of Google Analytics in Europe, leaving American companies unable to operate in the EU. Another possibility is United States-based tech companies switch to storing and consolidating data in Europe to ensure they’re compliant with GDPR.
But that goes against the CLOUD Act that requires American service providers be able to provide U.S. authorities with any domestic or international data, when asked, that is stored in their servers. A third option is EU businesses find an alternative to Google Analytics, while a final possibility is enforcement of the Innovation and Choice Online Act that targets big tech companies for potential antitrust and consumer choice violations.

Major news organizations like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post are among the media outlets that will be affected by Meta’s recent decision to phase out exclusive deals with news publishers.
The planned axing of paid deals with American publishers — worth more than $100 million — is part of Mata’s goal to restructure and shift focus from its news tab strategy to the creator economy.
“A lot has changed since we signed deals three years ago to test bringing additional news links to Facebook News in the US,” a Facebook spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal. “Most people do not come to Facebook for news, and as a business, it doesn’t make sense to overinvest in areas that don’t align with user preferences.”
It is worth noting that deals the firm has in other regions, particularly Europe, will not be affected by the changes. Facebook News will continue to maintain partnerships with outlets in the UK, France and Germany.
In fact, under regulatory pressure to remunerate content creators for news distributed on Big Tech platforms, paid Facebook News deals in Europe seem to be solidly in place for the time being.
Google, another Big Tech firm, has also come under intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs in Europe, and last year, the US tech giant was forced to sign a deal to settle a copyright dispute with French news publishers.

Judd Smith, a senior Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee who was instrumental in drafting legislation to rein in tech giants, is leaving to take a job as a lobbyist for Amazon Web Services, according to two people briefed on the matter.
Smith’s move is particularly notable because the legislation he was working on — the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — is losing steam. Its sponsors are pushing for a floor vote, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has so far resisted their pleas.
The bill would ban Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta from favoring their own services in an anticompetitive way, similar to a House bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a marathon markup last summer.
Read On: Proposed Antitrust Reforms in Big Tech: What Do They Imply for Competition and Innovation?
Smith was one of the main Republican staffers working to draft the bipartisan legislation led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to curtail the power of Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.
The legislation — the most serious attempt at tightening oversight of the tech industry in years — would bar those companies from prioritizing their products over their competitors who rely on those companies to reach customers. Amazon, for example, would be barred from promoting its own private-label products over rival items on its e-commerce platform.
Legislation aimed at reining in the power of giant technology companies appears to have hit a wall after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told a group of donors he doesn’t believe there are enough votes to pass the measure.

The trial is over the proposed $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster. The DOJ has sued to block it on antitrust grounds, arguing that the deal would not only raise book prices for consumers, it would also disadvantage authors by reducing their bargaining power for advances of more than $250,000.

545,"August 1, 2022",Klobuchar Says Big Tech Bills Will Have To Wait Till After Summer Recess,"


The most promising tech antitrust bill to move through Congress won’t get a vote before the summer recess, its lead sponsor Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., admitted in a recent interview on MSNBC’s “Symone.”
Klobuchar said on Saturday she talked with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last week about having a vote on the American Innovation and Choice Online Act in the fall, according to Axios.
“We’re not going to be able to do it this week, obviously, with the major vote we’re having on the Inflation Reduction Act,” she said, according to Axios’ transcription.
Klobuchar’s bill, co-sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would prohibit dominant tech platforms from advantaging their own products over rivals’ that rely on their services. That could have a significant impact on how companies like Amazon, Apple and Google display search results on their marketplaces, for example.
The bill’s champions say the reform is necessary to rebalance the power in digital markets and allow newer innovators to thrive. But critics, including the tech companies, have argued the bill would worsen the consumer experience by potentially weakening security standards and the platforms’ ability to kick harmful products off of their marketplaces. Klobuchar and other backers of the bill have denied that’s the case.
Schumer previously said he aimed to put the bill to a vote by early summer, Axios was first to report in May. But while Klobuchar and others have expressed confidence the bill would receive a filibuster-proof majority if brought to the Senate floor, Schumer had yet to schedule the vote by the Senate’s final week in session before the August recess.

Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan overruled staff advice to intervene in a Meta virtual reality studio acquisition, Bloomberg reports.
Sources reportedly told Bloomberg that staff had been “recommending against” suing to block Meta’s acquisition of Within, which makes the popular VR fitness app Supernatural. The FTC voted 3 to 2 in favor of the suit earlier this week, splitting respectively along Democratic and Republican party lines.
Bloomberg’s article doesn’t detail the substance of the disagreement over Meta’s Supernatural acquisition, although it does note that “each of the commissioners had the opportunity to test out Meta’s Oculus product, Within’s Supernatural, and Meta’s Beat Saber.” But the report would emphasize that Khan is making an unusually aggressive push to limit the power of companies like Meta, particularly compared to earlier interventions against major tech players. In 2013, for instance, the FTC overruled input from staff who recommended bringing an antitrust suit against Google, ending the investigation despite concerns about its business practices.
The FTC’s latest suit targets the specific category of VR fitness apps. But a key claim is that buying Within has a larger purpose for Meta: “building, and ultimately controlling, a VR ‘metaverse.’” It asserts that by buying the fitness studio, Meta is removing competition that could spur it to keep improving its own software offerings, including the fitness-adjacent rhythm game Beat Saber.

548,"July 27, 2022","Confusion Can Make for Good Politics, but Bad Economics","
By: Brian Albrecht (Inside Sources)
With the clock ticking down on Congress’ legislative calendar before the midterm election season begins, sponsors of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) are left with a problem. As leadership seeks to wrangle the needed 60 votes in the Senate, even the measure’s putative backers appear confused about precisely what it would, or would not, do.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says he supports the legislation because it will limit Big Tech’s ability to censor, or deplatform, Republican-friendly users. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has expressed reservations about the bill for precisely the same reason. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the bill’s primary sponsor, insists that it will do no such thing. But she’s also been reluctant to add explicit language that would either affirm Cruz’s interpretation or assuage Wyden’s fears.
Vague and equivocal language can sometimes make for good politics, although it remains unclear whether that is the case here. It is clear that legislation with such fundamental uncertainties will make it harder for companies to operate and innovate, making their services worse for consumers.
The bill would make it illegal for large technology firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook to “self-preference.” Self-preferencing is when a company gives some kind of advantage to one of its own products. When you search “nearby restaurants” on Google and see a Google Maps box at the top, that is self-preferencing. Under AICOA, this behavior would likely be illegal and subject Google to massive fines of 10 percent of its U.S. revenues.
I say likely because no one knows what will be illegal if the bill becomes law. As the American Bar Association’s Antitrust Law Section put it in a recent letter to Congress, the bill’s prohibitions “are vague and fact-specific, preventing advance prediction of what conduct is protected and what conduct is prohibited.” The uncertainty here runs deeper than usual, so supporters can have different readings of what it would do, specifically around content moderation…

549,"July 27, 2022",Value in Digital Platforms: The Choice of Tradeoffs in the Digital Markets Act,"
The Digital Markets Act makes clear choices about important tradeoffs in value to constrain the arbitrary power and dominance of gatekeepers over digital markets and guarantee a more equitable distribution of value with business users. We argue that the extent those objectives will be realized depend largely on the nature of competition, both the type of competition (within vs. across platforms) and the competition dynamics (Winner-Take-All vs. differentiation). We anticipate that the choices about the tradeoffs in value taken in the DMA will prevent gatekeepers to monopolize the focal market but in very limited cases. This is because the DMA seems to protect specific competitors (some large business users against gatekeepers) rather than competition, as well as protecting only one type of competition (within platform) instead of also, and the more salient for contestability in digital markets, cross platform competition. We discuss these tradeoffs and the implications for competition, value distribution and welfare.

Silicon Valley’s genius combined with limited regulation promised a new age of technological innovation in which entrepreneurs would fuel unprecedented job growth, improve overall well-being, and address pressing issues. Instead, the leading tech companies design their sprawling ecosystems to extract value (often at the expense of individuals and business users), while crushing entrepreneurs that pose a threat. As a result, we get less disruptive innovation that actually benefits us and more innovations that surpass the dreams of yesteryears’ autocracies. This essay highlights several important themes from our new book, How Big-Tech Barons Smash Innovation and How to Strike Back which examines and debunks the self-serving ideological platter that the Tech Barons serve, in depicting themselves as the engines of innovation in the digital economy.

The digital platform economy delivers on many fronts, offering us new products, technologies, and means to communicate, trade, and explore. And one of the celebrated aspects of the digital economy is the ensuing innovation. And even more so when speaking about the platform economy, where platforms, like coral reefs, attract innovators, disruptors, and new businesses and offer them unparalleled access to markets and users.

551,"July 27, 2022",Zero-price Platform Services: There Is No Free Lunch in Applying the “No Free Lunch” Principle,"
The well-known economic principle that “there is no such thing as a free lunch” (“NFLP”) has enjoyed a recent revival in the assessment of digital markets in antitrust. There is a belief that NFLP implies zero-price platform services must somehow be “paid for” by consumers in some manner—such as the loss of privacy and valuable data. Others have gone further, asserting that consumers are not only made worse off by the data collection and use that attend zero-price platform services, but that this state of affairs necessarily points to a lack of competitive alternatives. Both assertions are invalid, pressing the NFLP beyond the limits of logical inference. Inferences about who pays resource costs, and whether those payments reflect market power, are empirical questions as illuminated by other economic principles. Answers to such critical questions cannot be plucked from an NFLP magic hat. The NFLP is the truism that, at the margin, any benefit must come at some cost; economic resources must be expended, andsomeone will have to cover those expenditures. But the NFLP does not, without more, specify who bears the costs. The potential error here is a subtle one, but with profound consequences. It is wrong to conflate the resource costs required to provide a service with the effective price paid by those receiving the service. The NFLP does not imply the two must be equal.

552,"July 27, 2022",“For the Public Benefit”: Who Should Control Our Data?,"
Data-driven platforms collect and commercialize users’ data through advertisements or by selling the data to other third part providers. This practice raises the question of who should have the right to decide which data to collect and commercialize, users or the platform? In this article, we describe the results of our research concerning regulating platforms’ data collection. The main feature of our research is the distinction between the user’s private benefit from data and the data’s public benefit—i.e., the benefit a user’s data provide to other users on the platform, regardless of whether they are sharing their data. We find that when users differ in their disutility from the commercialization of their data and the public benefit of data is high (low), it is welfare enhancing to let the platform (users) control the data. In contrast, when heterogeneity is in the disutility from the commercialization of different data items, it is welfare enhancing to let users (the platform) control the data when the public benefit of data is high (low). Furthermore, we find that an entrant platform may choose to give users control over their data as doing so can help it overcome the advantage the incumbent enjoys.

The EU Digital Markets Act purports to benefit consumers and improve the competitiveness of digital markets. It is likely to have negative and unaddressed consequences, however, in terms of information privacy and security. I illustrate this by focusing on the DMA’s interoperability mandates. Only one of those obligations—on the interoperability of messaging services — is accompanied by a potentially adequate safeguard: a requirement that any third-party service must offer at least the same level of user security as the original service. This is a very demanding standard, which may render the interoperability provision a dead letter for the foreseeable future, but which nonetheless offers welcome privacy benefits from the consumer perspective. The remaining obligations that I analyze are accompanied either by no safeguards, or by insufficient safeguards.

It is notoriously difficult to use the law to strengthen information privacy and security, even where that is the explicit goal of legislation. Thus, perhaps the least we should expect of the law is not to unintentionally weaken the level of privacy and security.

Here, I analyze some of the provisions included in the proposed EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”).[2] The DMA purports to benefit consumers and improve the competitiveness of digital markets.

Some nine months after the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) revealed it was carrying out a market study into music-streaming services, the government department has revealed it believes there is no case to answer — for now, at least.
The CMA already has a pretty full plate, as it’s currently locking horns with Facebook’s parent Meta over its Giphy purchase; investigating Google over its dubious role in the adtech stack; and lining up a possible investigation into Apple and Google’s mobile duopoly.
In terms of music-streaming, the CMA had been tasked by a parliamentary committee with researching the state-of-play in terms of competition between the various music-streaming players, and their relationships with the so-called “big 3” major record labels — and more importantly, whether any of this negatively impacts consumers.
In its preliminary market study report published today, the CMA acknowledges that the music-streaming market is dominated by a few companies, estimating that Spotify had the lion’s share of the market with as much as 50%. It concluded that collectively, Spotify, Amazon, Google and Apple account for 95%-100% of music-streaming revenues.

556,"July 25, 2022",Restraints on Platform Differentiation,"
By Erik Hovenkamp (USC Gould School of Law)
The most pressing debates in antitrust today center on major platforms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Platform markets are subject to strong network effects, which tend to create barriers to entry and reinforce market power. In many such markets, the most viable way for a new platform to enter is to differentiate itself from the leading incumbent in some way, such as by offering exclusive content or features. However, recently some dominant platforms have attempted to prevent this using restrictive “most favored nation” (MFN) agreements with trading partners. But unlike traditional MFNs, which restrain what prices a trading partner can charge, these MFNs prohibit trading partners from offering any exclusive content, features, or other services to smaller platforms. This can make it difficult or impossible for a new platform to differentiate itself from the market leader.
These MFNs have not previously been examined in academic research, despite being the subject of numerous ongoing lawsuits and regulatory probes involving major platforms, including Amazon. This article fills that gap. The primary antitrust concern is that the MFNs restrain product differentiation by market entrants. This may force new platforms to compete on the basis of sheer size, as opposed to the type of content they offer. Due to strong network effects, this can make entry impossible, thus cementing the leading platform’s dominance. The agreeme...

A US congressional leader on antitrust, Senator Amy Klobuchar, on Tuesday called for Congress to pass a bill to rein in Big Tech, as prospects of it becoming law seemed to be dimming.
Supporters have been pressing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to schedule a vote on the bill that would ban self-preferencing by Big Tech platforms like Amazon and Alphabet’s Google. Klobuchar, a lead sponsor along with Republican Chuck Grassley, has said she has the 60 votes required to pass the measure.
“We must pass legislation to put rules of the road in place for dominant tech companies,” Klobuchar said in a statement Tuesday. “These platforms use their dominance to unfairly disadvantage their rivals, all at the expense of competition and consumers.”
She is expected to give a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday evening on the Big Tech antitrust bill and related matters.
Schumer said Tuesday his emphasis was on a bill to boost chip manufacturing, and on judicial confirmations. Asked about antitrust bills, he said: “I’m working with Senator Klobuchar. I support these bills. … We have to see that we have 60 votes.”
The Senate has three weeks, including this one, before its scheduled August recess. When lawmakers return in September, expectations are that the focus will be on November midterm elections.

Two US Senate Democrats active in internet issues are working on a bill to restore landmark “net neutrality” rules that would bar telecommunications companies from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes.
Senators Edward Markey and Ron Wyden plan to introduce a bill this summer that would put broadband under the umbrella of a telecommunications service, which means that providers would be subject to stricter Federal Communications Commision (FCC) oversight, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. Representative Doris Matsui is working on a companion House version.
Markey’s office in a statement said “it is more clear than ever that broadband internet is an essential utility” and the FCC’s “authority should reflect that, so it can fulfill its obligations to the public by reinstating net neutrality rules.”
Telecommunications companies, who are also major internet providers, have been battling net neutrality efforts for more than a decade, while major technology firms like Alphabet’s Google and Meta’s Facebook strongly back net neutrality protections.

Jonathan M. Barnett opens by providing a unique insight that runs counter to traditional assumptions as regards the relationship between patents and antitrust law. The standard assumption, is that incumbents generally favor patents and, in particular, policy actions that strengthen and extend patent protection. As the author discusses, in the real world, markets often fail to conform to this expectation. Historical and contemporary evidence shows that larger firms in a variety of industries tend to favor policy positions that seek to weaken patents or, in some cases, reject them entirely.  
Erik Hovenkamp turns to the hot topic of antitrust reform in so-called “big tech” markets. Recent calls for reform are fueled mainly by concerns surrounding  major “platforms” like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Critics believe, in short, that these platforms have become too large and powerful. In the U.S., some of the most aggressive proposed reforms have recently been codif...

It is common to characterize patents as monopolies.  This assumption, which underlies the standard dichotomy between intellectual property and antitrust law, is challenged by evidence that large companies in technology markets (outside biopharmaceuticals) tend to advocate for weaker patent protection or, in some cases, no patent protection at all.  This revealed preference for weaker patent protection reflects the fact that large integrated firms can often capture returns on innovation through economies of scale and scope and other non-patent-dependent capacities that few other firms can match.  Relatedly, a weak-patent environment can confer a competitive advantage on integrated firms against smaller and more innovative firms that rely on patents to capture value on innovation through licensing and other contract-based monetization strategies.

I. INTRODUCTION
In antitrust jurisprudence and scholarship, it is common to characterize intellectual property (“IP”) rights in general, and patents in particular, as a type of “monopoly.”[2] Economists widely construe IP rights as sources of monopoly power that distort competitive markets.[3] A search of the Google Scholar federal case law database as of May 2022 finds 2,430 decisions that use the phrase, “patent monopoly.” The “patent-as-monopoly” assumption has important implications for antitrust jurisprudence and scholarship, which often characterize patents as...

565,"July 13, 2022",Proposed Antitrust Reforms in Big Tech: What Do They Imply for Competition and Innovation?,"
There is widespread support for antitrust reform, fueled mainly by concerns about major platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Many believe that these companies have become too large and that they use their power in harmful ways. In the United States, some of the most aggressive reforms have recently been codified into two proposed bills, which focus largely on “self-preferencing” by online platforms and various restrictions imposed by mobile operating systems. This short article evaluates the proposed Big Tech reforms based on everything we’ve learned from antitrust’s successes and failures over the last fifty years. In some situations, the reforms could help to curb anticompetitive unilateral conduct that is extremely difficult to challenge under current law. Overall, however, the proposals are an ill-conceived, knee-jerk reaction to a set of complex issues requiring a more careful response. They do a very poor job of limiting antitrust scrutiny to cases that plausibly involve anticompetitive behavior. The self-preferencing proposals in particular offer no secure way to avoid scrutiny other than to stop introducing new products. For these and other reasons, these proposed reforms would have significant adverse effects on competition and innovation — the two things they are supposed to protect.

By Christian Bergqvist (University of Copenhagen) & Elisa Faustinelli (Danish Competition and Consumer Authority)
Without resorting to an overly simplistic statement, it remains difficult to evade the perception that the digital economy is prone to leveraging conducts directed at extending dominance between services. Navigating the internet with Google will often yield Google services at preferential placements. Similarly, Amazon might artificially favor its own retail products on Amazon Marketplace, while Meta (formerly known as Facebook) appears to be using data collected on its social networks to outcompete competitors on Facebook Marketplace. Naturally, tech companies deny bias and self-favoring, referring to misunderstandings, the evolution of the internet, or other plausible explanations. Yet, the anti-competitive effects of leveraging conducts have formed the core of recent EU antitrust investigations, such as Google Shopping and Google Android as well as vintage cases as Microsoft I. In particular, the matter of self-favoring discussed in the Google Shopping case has crystallized the concept of leveraging infringement, where a super dominant position is extended to an adjacent activity or market. Similar allegations are at the center of pending EU antitrust investigations into Facebook or Amazon. Besides whether they are liable, the relevant questions are how these companies benefit from self-favoring and leveraging and if this should raise concerns.These matters are developed in this paper.

570,"July 6, 2022",Big Tech May Not Feel Impact Of EU’s New Online Rules Until 2024,"


After years in the making, on Tuesday, July 5, the EU Parliament approved in plenary session landmark legislation that will set comprehensive standards for regulating the digital space. 
The EU Parliament approved the Digital Services Act (DSA) with 539 votes in favor, 54 votes against, and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with 588 in favor and 11 against. The DSA sets clear obligations for digital service providers, such as Google, Meta or TikTok, to tackle the spread of illegal content, online disinformation and other societal risks. The DMA sets obligations for large online platforms acting as “gatekeepers” (platforms whose dominant online position make them hard for consumers to avoid) on the digital market to ensure a fairer business environment and more services for consumers. 
EU institutions reached an agreement on the scope of these bills already in March with some minor amendments in the following months until the final approval on Tuesday. Now that the laws are approved, what’s next? Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple and other online platforms won’t need to rush to make any changes as they still have a few months to comply with the new rules and make adjustment to their business models, if needed. 
After the approval in parliament on Tuesday, both laws need to be formally adopted by the Council — and this is likely to happen in July for the DMA and in September for the DSA. Then, the legal texts will be published in the EU Official Journal, and they will enter into force twenty days after publication. This means that the laws won’t start to be implemented until September or October the earliest. 
But then, the implementation period, which is between 6 and 15 months, varies between the two laws.  
For the DSA, its provisions will apply in 15 months or from January 2024, whichever comes later, after the entry into force. As regards the obligations for very large online platforms (i.e. Meta, Twitter, TikTok) and very large online search engines (i.e. Google), the DSA will apply earlier — four months after they have been designated as such by the Commission. However, the designation process could take a few months, and the designation is reviewed every six months. 
EU policymakers foresaw a shorter implementation period for the DMA. This law will start to apply six months following its entry into force, which could be in early 2023. However, gatekeepers will have up to six months after they have been designated to comply with the new obligations. This will happen when the European Commission designates a company as a gatekeeper. While this designation process is expected to be straightforward, based on quantitative criteria like the number of users or turnover in Europe, it may take another additional six months, according to the law. This could give large online platforms, in theory, until 2024 to start fully applying the new conditions set out in the DMA. 
It is then safe to assume that, leaving aside possible voluntary changes by the online platforms, the effects of the DMA and DSA on the largest Big Tech companies won’t start to be visible until late 2023 or early 2024.

Facebook has asked a US court for eight documents created by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as part of their review of the company’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the agency allowed to go forward.
The request was made late on Tuesday and comes in a lawsuit filed by the FTC that has asked the court to order both of those deals undone. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.
The FTC sued Meta’s Facebook in 2020, during the Trump administration, alleging that the company acted illegally to maintain its social network monopoly.
Facebook is fighting the lawsuit, and wants the materials as part of that fight. “Both the Instagram and the WhatsApp documents are almost certain to reveal that the FTC determined that each acquisition was unlikely to lessen competition or harm consumers,” Facebook said in its filing.
The company argued that the FTC had given the documents to the House Judiciary Committee when it probed the tech giants, also including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google  and Apple Current FTC Chair Lina Khan was on the staff of that committee.
“Any claim of privilege was waived when the FTC chose to voluntarily share the documents with House Judiciary Committee members and staff,” Facebook said in its filing.

572,"July 6, 2022",UK Probes Amazon Over Sales Practices,"


The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking into whether Amazon “has a dominant position in the U.K. and whether it is abusing that position and distorting competition by giving an unfair advantage to its own retail business or sellers that use its services,” it announced in a Wednesday (July 6) press release.
The investigation, which will consider whether Amazon is offering preferential treatment to its own third-party sellers on the Amazon U.K. Marketplace, follows the European Commission’s examination of similar concerns for the world’s largest retailer.
Some Amazon Marketplace products are provided through Amazon’s own retail business, but “a large proportion are supplied by third-party sellers,” the release stated. “Amazon provides services to these sellers, including those that are essential to make sales, such as matching sellers with consumers,” and “offers optional services that incur additional fees,” such as the Fulfilment by Amazon service, covering some aspects of the sales process, “including storage, packaging and delivery.”
The CMA investigation will look into how Amazon collects and uses third-party seller data, how Amazon sets criteria for allocation of suppliers to be the preferred/first choice in the Buy Box, and how Amazon sets the eligibility criteria for selling under the Prime label, according to the release.
“Millions of people across the U.K. rely on Amazon’s services for fast delivery of all types of products at the click of a button,” said CMA General Counsel Sarah Cardellin the release. “This is an important area, so it’s right that we carefully investigate whether Amazon is using third-party data to give an unfair boost to its own retail business and whether it favors sellers who use its logistics and delivery services — both of which could weaken competition.”
The CMA also has an open consumer protection investigation into Amazon and Google over concerns they haven’t been doing enough to combat fake reviews on their sites.

This paper looks at the latest trends and developments in the E.U. and the U.S. and analyzes the different regulatory approaches taken from a distinct business ethics, that is, ordoliberal perspective. The paper aims to derive ordoliberal-inspired antitrust principles and apply them to the current antitrust proceedings and investigations, thereby assessing their strengths and weaknesses. It also aims at developing ordoliberal-inspired reform proposals which might help to strengthen and ‘harden’ modern-day antitrust regimes.

Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and former chief economist at Microsoft, is joining the Justice Department as its top antitrust economist.
Athey, an expert on the economics of internet platforms — particularly search engines and online advertising, joins the Justice Department as it prepares for trial against Alphabet’s Google and is pursuing an investigation of Apple and another Google case.
Because of her previous work, though, Athey is likely to be recused from the Justice Department’s Google and Apple cases, said two people, speaking on condition of anonymity about internal DOJ matters.
Athey consulted for Microsoft for almost a decade, aiding the company’s years-long antitrust fight against Google. More recently, she served as an economic expert for Epic Games in its antitrust suit against Apple related to the iPhone-maker’s mobile App Store restrictions.
In her work for Microsoft, Athey worked closely with Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, who represented the Windows-maker in its antitrust battles with the DOJ in the early 2000s and later against Google.
A professor at Stanford since 2013, Athey previously taught at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She resigned last month from the board of directors of Expedia Group, a position she had held since 2015.

Japanese legal experts have said an antitrust case related to a local restaurant website could change how large internet platforms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon operate in the country, forcing them to reveal the inner workings of their secret algorithms.
Last month, a Tokyo court ruled in favour of Hanryumura, a Korean-style BBQ restaurant chain operator in an antitrust case brought against Kakaku.com, operator of Tabelog, Japan’s largest restaurant review platform. Hanryumura successfully argued that Kakaku.com had altered the way user scores were tallied in ways that hurt sales at its restaurant outlets.
While Kakaku.com has been ordered to pay Hanryumura ¥38.4mn ($284,000) in damages for “abuse of superior bargaining position”, the internet company has appealed against the decision. Japanese legal experts said the outcome may have far-reaching implications, as the court requested Kakaku.com to disclose part of its algorithms.
While the restaurant group is constrained from publicly revealing what information was shown to it, the court’s request set a rare precedent. Big Tech groups have long argued that their algorithms should be considered trade secrets in all circumstances. Courts and regulators across the world have begun to challenge that position, with many businesses having complained about the negative impact caused by even small changes to search and recommendations services.
“There hasn’t been a case in competition law anywhere else in the world where a court has requested a digital platform to disclose its algorithm,” said Kentaro Hirayama, a lawyer specialising in antitrust issues and formerly with Japan Fair Trade Commission, the country’s antitrust regulator.

577,"July 1, 2022",The Challenge of Holding Big Business Accountable,"
By: Roy Shapira (CLS Blue Sky Blog)
Is big business ungovernable? Some of today’s calls to break up and intensely regulate big business do not hinge on harms to consumers as consumers, but rather on the claim that giant corporations with market power treat legal requirements as mere recommendations, and routinely engage in behavior that harms others as long as it maximizes their own bottom line. Importantly, the big-is-ungovernable claim has by now firmly entered policy circles. To illustrate, in 2020, a congressional subcommittee investigating the conduct of big tech platforms maintained that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple leverage their power to shape the regulatory framework that governs them and repeatedly violate existing laws and court orders. This pattern of behavior, concluded the subcommittee, “raises questions about whether these firms view themselves as above the law, or whether they simply treat lawbreaking as a cost of business.”
Though the stakes could not be higher, the big-is-ungovernable claim as currently construed is underdeveloped. In fact, existing law-and-economics analyses suggest that big is more governable. Larger corporations are more publicly visible, increasing the probability that any misconduct would be detected. And they have more to lose from being caught misbehaving: from higher punitive damages in court to greater reputational fallout in the marketplace. If “big is ungovernable” is based on little more than anecdotes and riding a strong anti-bigness sentiment, we could end up with bad policies negating economies of scale.
My new article examines the extent to which super-large firms with market power are less governable. The article spotlights several unique institutional features of big business that dilute the effectiveness of deterrence across all systems of control – not just legal, but also non-legal controls such as reputation concerns or moral constraints.
Consider first the prospect of legal deterrence. Super-large corporations enjoy greater ability to influence the regulatory agenda not just via lobbying or campaign contributions but also via “soft” channels, such as “epistemic capture,” stemming from their ability to fund research that cloaks their self-interest in a noble, public-interest explanation. They can thus ensure that their behavior falls within regulatory requirements. When their behavior nevertheless transgresses the law, the unique institutional features of bigness hinder public enforcers’ ability to investigate, prosecute, and properly calibrate the sanction for misbehavior. As a result, enforcers often avoid taking big business to court, opting instead to settle early for what big defendants write off as the small costs of doing business. Further, super-large corporations can leverage their market power to force counterparties to sign class action waivers or gag clauses, thereby diluting the prospect of private enforcement as well…

579,"June 30, 2022",Identifying Barriers to Entry: A South African Perspective,"

By Willem H. Boshoff1
 
Abstract:
Barriers to entry are now a core concern of South African competition policy. Conventionally, entry barriers represent one factor relevant to assessing the sustainability and effects of market power and its abuse. South African competition policy now looks beyond conventional concerns, focusing on barriers to the participation and expansion of small firms and – especially – firms owned by historically disadvantaged individuals (“HDIs”) in South Africa. Such a broader policy focus requires identifying industries and markets where such barriers are high. This piece considers some of the associated analytical challenges.
 
I. Evolving Policy Thinking
A broader view of entry barriers has gained traction in South African competition policy over the past twenty years. Following the global financial crisis, policymakers in South Africa grew increasingly concerned about the causes of relatively low levels of economic growth. These concerns grew markedly from around 2016, fueled by two international antitrust developments. One key trend was the academic, and later policy, debate in the US about rising concentration levels and their claimed impact on the dynamism of the American economy. A second, and related trend, involves the debate around the social impact of big tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and the like) and the ability of newcomers to challenge these companies in their respective digital markets.
Reflecting these international developments, the result was that many South African industries and markets are characterized by low levels of new entry and, especially, entry by firms owned by HDIs. This evolving stance of the South African competition authorities on entry barriers is reflected both in wide-ranging amendments to the Competition Act, and in policy practice over the past few years. Indeed, “deconcentrating” the economy and advancing the position of small firms and firms owned by HDIs are now prominent policy goals of South African competition policy.
This piece argues that a broader view of barriers to entry further strengthens the need for context-specific economic analysis. While policy slogans, such as deconcentration, may be broad and cross-cutting, addressing barriers to entry requires industry- and market-specific evaluation. Furthermore, form-based approaches to identifying entry barriers – for example, in the digital sphere, by identifying whether incumbents are platforms – are likely to be of limited use. Ultimately, an economic assessment of the products or services being sold and the rivals and consumers involved is required – a task that requires considerable information to be collected by competition authorities.
 
II. Entry Barriers and Concentration
One consequence of the South African focus on broader barriers to entry and participation in markets is that concentration has acquired a broader meaning among policymakers. Policymakers now consider broader sectoral patterns to identify industries characterized by a lack of dynamism and entry or by limited participation by firms owned by HDIs. While a more expansive view of concentration certainly reflects policy priorities, it also creates challenges for certainty and dialogue. Using concentration to refer to market structure, industry structure. and ownership structure (sometimes interchangeably) creates significant challenges for conceptual clarity.
Analytical accuracy requires distinguishing between three types of concentration measure:
The first, and more traditional, measure of concentration relates to market concentration. Market Concentration measures are based on revenue or volume shares enjoyed by the various firms operating in a relevant market. Competition policy in South Africa and internationally treats a market as a carefully defined collection of products that are substitutable to buyers2. Market concentration measures, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, measure the distribution of market shares: the greater the market shares of the larger firms, the higher the calculated concentration in the particular market.
A second measure, quite distinct from the first, relates to industry or sector concentration. Any one industry may consist of several and indeed hundreds to thousands of different markets. The South African competition authorities have recently published a concentration tracker report, which seeks to measure concentration in the South African economy at large3. This report relies on industry measures to calculate concentration.
The South African competition authorities acknowledge that their concentration measures are not market based, but it nevertheless infers market power on the basis of these industry measures. In some industries, relatively similar players may be active across most of their constituent markets, so industry-level concentration could be an indicator of market power across markets in a particular industry. In others, aggregating the individual markets to an industry level can greatly mask what may be sharp differences in the structure of individual markets and the level of dynamism and entry. It is therefore critical to differentiate industry concentration from market concentration and to be clear about the specific conditions under which these two concepts may be aligned.
A third measure relates to ownership concentration. In keeping with their broader policy goals, the South African Competition Commission argues for a link between market concentration and ownership spread, by which it means the distribution of corporate ownership among a larger number of owners4. The promotion of a greater spread of ownership is a goal of South African competition law, but it is critical not to conflate the concept of ownership concentration with that of market concentration. Large incumbents, facing limited threat of entry, may well be owned by a variety of owners.
Clarity about how ownership concentration is measured is also important to the policy goal of promoting entry by firms owned by HDIs. Higher levels of HDI ownership need not translate into a broader ownership distribution measured in terms of the size of shareholders. Nor does it have any necessary link to entry. These conceptual ambiguities are worsened when referring to industry concentration to make claims about ownership concentration.
Identifying barriers to entry – by reference to outcomes measured by concentration – requires conceptual rigor. Indeed, conceptual clarity is critical not only to competition law proceedings, but also in helping guide policymakers to focus information-collection efforts, including those during market inquiries, which are now a common policy tool in South Africa.
 
III. Entry Barriers in the Digital Sphere
The focus of South African competition policy on entry barriers of various forms is particularly evident in the approach taken toward issues in the digital sphere. Here, policy concerns again reflect those of the US, UK, Europe, and elsewhere. One of the main challenges is how to tailor digital competition policy to the broader entry barrier issues relevant to South Africa.
Digital platforms and their offerings tend to develop more slowly or, at least, differently in developing countries. Many South African markets based on digital products or services may not yet be at a consolidation stage. Also, South Africa has seen the emergence of several successful local platforms, which have developed into large players in their respective markets. This is contrary to the dominance of well-known US platforms in other jurisdictions.
One implication is that it is particularly important to understand competition in these markets from an economics perspective. A principal challenge is to avoid a form-based approach, which would merely categorize particular businesses as digital platforms and make automatic inferences about the viability of entry and expansion in markets in which these platforms operate5. Generalizations about barriers to entry, including an overemphasis on market tipping due to network effects (which theoretically favor incumbents and limit entry), may not necessarily align with the empirical reality.
A proper definition of the relevant market as well as an empirical evaluation of the type and dynamic nature of network effects in the market remains critical to assessing possibilities for entry6. Indeed, market tipping and the possibilities for new entry and expansion can vary greatly by geographic region or product market7. This suggests that wide-ranging inquiries, including the on-going market inquiry into online intermediation platforms in South Africa, face considerable obstacles.
Understanding the relevant network effects and their implications for entry requires detailed analysis, including of market outcomes at a fairly disaggregated level. Such a requirement suggests that a market inquiry that seeks to ultimately impose remedies on a broad class of business organizations (for example, online intermediation platforms) must tread carefully. The arguments presented here suggest that a more modest, yet critical, aim of market inquiries must be the establishment and maintenance of relevant databases concerning how large platforms, and their rivals (not limited to platforms), operate and perform over time.
 
IV. Conclusion
Competition policy seeking to foster entry – including entry by designated groups such as firms owned by HDIs in South Africa – raises key analytical challenges. Indeed, an analysis of entry barriers requires both clarity of concepts – such as different types of concentration – and an assessment of competition based on empirical evidence. It is critical, both to legal certainty and to policy dialogue, that a competition policy concerned with addressing entry barriers remain grounded in context-specific economic analysis.

580,"June 30, 2022",Apple Enables Third-Party Payments in South Korea,"


Apple is now allowing third-party payments in South Korea in response to a new law requiring major app stores to allow alternative payment methods, according to multiple reports on Thursday (June 30).
While Apple will still get a commission, it will be 26% instead of the 30% it reaped from direct payments. In its documentation to developers, Apple said all sales will have to be reported monthly and commissions paid accordingly.
South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act passed last year states that large platform companies can’t force developers to use their in-app payment systems. While Apple and Google were against the legislation, saying it would undermine their privacy protections, the law passed and is being enforced.
Developers for the Korean App Store must create an alternative version of their apps to sidestep Apple’s payment system. The alternate must be approved by Apple. So far, Apple has approved KCP, Inicis, Toss and NICE, Engadget reported. Some features like Ask to Buy and Family Sharing won’t be available, and Apple won’t handle subscription management or refunds.
Apple’s control over in-app payments is being chipped away in the Netherlands as well, with the Dutch competition regulator ordering Apple to allow dating apps to use alternative in-app payment systems, The Verge reported.
The European Union’s planned Digital Markets Act (DMA) also has provisions regarding Apple’s policies and would allow users to install apps from third-party sources, and enable App Store developers to use alternatives to Apple’s payment systems.

581,"June 29, 2022",EU Lawmakers Look To Pass Online Platform Bills Next Week,"


The European Parliament will hold the last plenary session before the summer recess from July 4 to July 7, and lawmakers are rushing to get all the legal texts ready for a vote. As expected, the schedule for the next plenary session is packed with proposals, from international cooperation agreements to banking unions and rules to combat fraud. 
But there are two long-awaited proposals that may be in the spotlight, and Google, Apple, Meta and other Big Tech companies may be paying close attention to them. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) may receive formal approval by the plenary of the EU Parliament. This would mean that these two legal texts would surpass the last procedural hurdle in Parliament: they would be sent to the EU Council and then published in the EU Official Journal. 
The DMA will ban certain practices used by large platforms acting as “gatekeepers” and will enable the European Commission to carry out market investigations and impose hefty fines. The bill targets large companies providing so-called “core platform services” most prone to unfair business practices, such as social networks or search engines, with a market capitalization of at least 75 billion euro or an annual turnover of 7.5 billion. 
The EU Parliament Committee endorsed a deal with the EU Council on May 16, paving the way for a final approval in the next plenary session, but last-minute amendments are still possible, as long as they are minimal changes — otherwise it could risk derailing the agreement with the EU Council. This is what lawmakers are probably discussing this week. In preparation for next week’s plenary session, lawmakers may still add a few changes to ensure there are not procedural inconsistencies with other laws that the DMA may affect. 
Once the DMA is published in the EU Official journal, it will enter into force 20 days following the publication, but the application of the provisions won’t start until six months later. Thus, any real risk for Big Tech firms will likely be pushed back to 2023. 
The DSA is a landmark law that will hold Big Tech companies accountable for the illegal content posted on their platforms — they will be required to put in place mechanisms to ensure the content is removed in a timely fashion. Online platforms will be obliged to be more transparent and more accountable, for example by allowing users to be informed of how content is recommended to them. Very large online platforms will have to provide users with at least one option not based on profiling. Additional rules on online advertising are also introduced, including a ban on the use of sensitive data or targeting of minors. The so-called “dark patterns” and misleading practices aimed at manipulating users’ choices will also be prohibited.

582,"June 29, 2022",The Implementation of the Digital Markets Act with National Antitrust Laws,"
The December 2020 Commission proposal for a Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) reached a compromised text with the Council and the Parliament on March 24, 2022. While the text that will impose obligations and prohibition rules on large online platforms acting as “gatekeepers” before any wrongdoing ex-ante is due to enter into force in October 2022, the same platforms are already under investigation in Germany under a DMA-like competition law that also imposes prohibition rules ex ante. Other countries in Europe, including Italy, are considering following Germany and implementing new competition rules to adapt to the digital economy. How should the DMA implement with national competition laws? This question is crucial because inconsistency will inevitably hamper the effectiveness of both the DMA and national competition laws. The paper addresses this question by studying the DMA and German implementation framework. Section I explains how legislators envisage the implementation of the DMA with national competition laws. Section II then considers the implementation of the DMA-like national competition rules by focusing the analysis on Germany, which already enforced its new legislation in January 2022 against Google. Section III designs a cooperation model between the DMA and national competition laws. Section IV concludes.

583,"June 29, 2022",Antitrust Policy toward Intermediaries: Digital Platforms and “Big Tech”,"
This article considers U.S. and EU antitrust policies regarding intermediaries with digital platforms. The article examines antitrust concerns about “Big Tech.” The discussion emphasizes the need to apply advances in the Economics of Markets and Platforms in developing these antitrust policies.

By Daniel F. Spulber[1]
  
I. INTRODUCTION
The United States and the European Union are developing major antitrust policies targeting digital platforms with a focus on “Big Tech.” The U.S. Congress is considering the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (“AICO”) (S.2992) and the Open App Markets Act (S.2710).[2] The EU approved a provisional version of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”).[3] These antitrust policies are likely to have significant effects on competition and innovation in digital platforms. These antitrust policies also could have far-reaching consequences for economic growth and development.
Antitrust policies should not be aimed at companies simply because they are both “Big” and “Tech.” Antitrust enforcement in the U.S. has long emphasized anticompetitive conduct rather than market power or market share. Antitrust enforcement in the EU involves greater scrutiny of large firms but their conduct must exhibit “abuse of a dominant position.”[4] Targeting companies based on their size and technology risks mischaracterizing both competitive strategies and anticompetitive conduct. Such antitrust policies could penalize innovation comp...

584,"June 29, 2022",What Have the Intermediaries Ever Done for Us?,"
Intermediaries may not be the consumer welfare hero we want, but more often than not, they are one that we need. Policymakers often assume that intermediaries and centralization serve as a cost to society, and that consumers are better off when provided with “more choice.” Concrete expression of this view can be found in regulatory initiatives that aim to turn “closed” platforms into “open” ones (see, in Europe, the Digital Markets Act; and in the United States, the Open App Markets Act and the American Innovation and Choice Online Act). Against this backdrop, we explain that, as with all economic goods, intermediation involves tradeoffs. Intermediaries emerge when it would otherwise be too difficult (or too costly) for groups of users to meet and interact. There is thus no guarantee that government-mandated disintermediation — such as that contemplated in the European DMA and the U.S. AICOA bill — will generate net benefits in a given case. The ongoing Epic v Apple proceedings are a good example of why it is important to respect the role of intermediaries in digital markets, and the unique benefits intermediation can bring to consumers. The upshot is that intermediaries are far more valuable than they are usually given credit for.

By Dirk Auer & Lazar Radic[1]

This article explores the impact of the digital transformation in the retail value chain. The integration of digital technology has mined the traditional retail structure, increasing competition by providing consumers with more choices and through the focusing retailers on satisfying consumers’ evolving needs through innovative multichannel strategies. The article also analyzes the impact of digital transformation on global Regulatory and Competition Authorities, and the current debate on antitrust policies on the emergence and growth of digital markets. Finally, the discussion reaches antitrust policies in Mexico, with a debate regarding the question “should the tech companies that participate in digital channels be regulated?” with the Federal Economic Competition Commission engaging in a series of actions aiming to prepare the institution to answer this debate, in an attempt to avoid ex ante obligations that could jeopardize innovation and efficiencies in certain markets.

586,"June 23, 2022",US House Panel Passes Online Privacy Bill Easily,"


A US House of Representatives panel passed a bipartisan online privacy bill on Thursday that aims to limit the collection of personal data, though doubts remain as to whether it will become law.
The bill would require companies like Alphabet’s Google and Meta’s Facebook, along with a long list of others, to only collect personal data that is necessary to provide services. Sensitive information like Social Security numbers would get even more protection.
The measure easily passed a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on a voice vote. It now goes to the full committee.
Previous attempts to pass privacy legislation were blocked by a buzzsaw of opposition from tech companies, who provide free services by using consumer data for advertising. Much of the debate over these bills focused on whether federal legislation would preempt state laws, which are sometimes stronger, or whether individuals would be allowed to sue in the case of privacy violations.

Breaking up American “Big Tech” companies has in recent years been a topic of much discussion by policymakers and legislators across the political spectrum. Arguments for and against breakup offer various justifications and considerations, but less-discussed potential national security risks lurk within the larger debate — including that breaking up Big Tech could leave American intellectual property, data, technology, and know-how up for grabs by strategic competitors. The interagency U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) was created to protect against this kind of national security risk, but it has its limitations, particularly in terms of resourcing and the inherent opacity of venture capital and private investment.  Given these limitations, policymakers who pursue the path of a Big Tech breakup should be aware of this risk and be prepared to address it; CFIUS and other national security authorities will need to be appropriately resourced and staffed.

The call to break up American “Big Tech” is one of the few policy proposals in Washington on which individuals across the political spectrum seem to agree, albeit for different reasons.

588,"June 19, 2022",Big Tech CEOs Visit Congress As Antitrust Bills Loom,"


As Senate lawmakers embark on a final, urgent push to pass landmark antitrust legislation to reshape the tech industry, Big Tech is bringing out its heaviest hitters to influence the politicians whose votes could decide the bill’s fate.
Next week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is expected to travel to Washington to meet with US lawmakers, two people familiar with the plans said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The visit is being treated with utmost confidentiality due to the charged implications and conversation, which has turned hostile to perceived Big Tech abuses in recent years.
Pichai’s trip comes after Apple CEO Tim Cook was spotted roaming the Senate last week. It also follows a report by Politico that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has directly called multiple members of Congress to express opposition to the bill. In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson told CNN that Jassy “meets with policymakers on both sides of the aisle regarding policy issues that could affect our customers.” The frequency and results of these meetings, however, is not yet clear. 
Opposition from Congress and agency regulators in the US government has quickly grown over the past few years, as Big Tech firms increased their influence and presence during the global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 health emergency. Letters from the DOJ, for instance, have said the agency “views the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition,” adding that letting those platforms “pick winners and losers” with their outsized power “puts at risk the nation’s economic progress and prosperity…”
The CEOs’ hands-on engagement highlights the stakes of the next few months for the tech industry in Washington.Congress is considering multiple antitrust bills, beginning with legislation led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley that could erect strict barriers between a tech giant’s various lines of business. The proposal represents a direct challenge to Big Tech’s business models that encourage consumers to use multiple interlocking services owned by the same company.

589,"June 19, 2022",EU Privacy Watchdog Wants To Take Major Big Tech Cases,"


The head of the European Union’s data protection watchdog said that a landmark privacy law adopted four years ago isn’t being enforced properly and that his agency should handle cross-border Big Tech privacy cases.
As Reuters reported Friday (June 17), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been criticized over the costs of compliance and lengthy investigations that yielded few decisions in enforcing regulations against companies like Google, Apple and Meta.
But Wojciech Wiewiorowski, head of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), said that problem could be solved by turning over big cases to his agency and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).
“I myself share views of those who believe we still do not see sufficient enforcement, in particular against Big Tech,” Wiewiorowski said.
“At a certain moment, a pan-European data protection enforcement model is going to be a necessary step to ensure real and consistent high-level protection of fundamental rights to data protection and privacy across the European Union,” he added.
According to Wiewiorowski, this could mean that critical investigations, based on a certain threshold, would be done at a central level, overseen by Europe’s top court.
Reuters spoke to a European Commission official, who said allowing the EDPB to take on Big Tech cases would mean altering GDPR rules, a move the commission is unlikely to undertake under its current leadership due to lack of time.
This week saw three Big Tech firms making concessions in Europe in the face of investigations. Amazon said it will share marketplace data with its sellers and improve rivals’ product visibility on its platform if the European Commission will end its 2020 probe and not fine the company.
Google, meanwhile, offered to let rival ad intermediaries place advertisements on YouTube as a way of potentially resolving a European antitrust investigation. And Meta Platforms agreed to make changes in France regarding that country’s online ad rules.

590,"June 19, 2022",Why I Think Congress Should Not Enact the American Innovation and Choice Online Act,"

By A. Douglas Melamed1
 
I thought antitrust law was working pretty well when I was in the Justice Department during the Clinton Administration.  Both the Department and the Federal Trade Commission won significant merger and nonmerger cases, including of course the monopolization case against Microsoft, that established important precedents and moved the law in a more aggressive direction.
In the years since then, I have come to believe that antitrust law has become too conservative and needs to be recalibrated to be more aggressive.  It needs to do a better job taking account of modern economic learning and to be concerned about false negatives, as well as false positives.  I have written a number of articles explaining that view,2 and I have testified to that effect before Congress.3  I have also suggested that special competition rules might be appropriate for the largest tech platforms.4
Nevertheless, I believe that Congress should not enact the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) in its present form.  I summarize below what I see as the three most problematic aspects of the bill.
 
I. What Does “Harm to Competition” Mean?
There has been a consensus for several decades that antitrust law is about preventing harm to competition in order to enhance economic welfare.  Preventing harm to competition does not mean protecting individual firms from the rough and tumble of marketplace competition as competing firms try to best their rivals by providing better products and services.  It means prohibiting anticompetitive conduct that creates or maintains market power.  By preventing increased market power as a result of anticompetitive conduct, antitrust law increases output, which benefits workers and results in lower prices that benefit consumers, especially those least able to pay higher prices.
AICOA pays at least lip service to the importance of harm to competition.  Sections 3(a)(1)-(3) of the bill prohibit self-preferencing and discrimination by the platforms, which can be harmful in some circumstances.  The prohibitions imposed by those Sections apply only where plaintiff shows that the conduct “would materially harm competition.”  The covered platforms can avoid violating the other prohibitions of the bill (Sections 3(a)(4)-(10)) if they can show that the conduct at issue “has not resulted in and would not result in material harm to competition” (Section 3(b)(2)).
That language might mean that there can be no violation of the bill unless there is the kind of harm to competition with which the antitrust laws have long been concerned, but that is far from clear.  In the first place, the statutory language is patently ambiguous because “would” is conditional and the bill says nothing about the contemplated conditions.  More important, while the language suggests an antitrust-type concern about competition, the bill does not include the normal antitrust language (e.g., “competition in the market as a whole,” “market power”) that gives meaning to the idea of harm to competition, nor does it say that the imprecise language it does use is to be construed as that language is construed by the antitrust laws.
Plaintiffs will no doubt argue, and courts might agree, that Congress did not intend to incorporate existing antitrust concepts and that “harm to competition” means any reduction in competition by, for example, causing a weak and insignificant rival to exit from an intensely competitive market.  Plaintiffs will argue that Congress could have specified that the bill incorporates the antitrust notion of injury to competition but that Congress chose not to do that, and they will emphasize that the whole point of the bill was to supplement the antitrust laws with stronger prohibitions.
The bill could be very harmful if it is construed to require, not increased market power, but simply harm to rivals.  The U.S. has in the past tried laws that insulate weak firms from competition provided by more efficient firms.  The results have been increased costs, reduced output, and harm to consumers and suppliers.
 
II. The Bill Would Prohibit Welfare-Enhancing Conduct, Even if the “Harm to Competition” Language Were Construed to Mean Increased Market Power
The antitrust laws do not punish firms that succeed by welfare-enhancing competition on the merits, even if they gain market power by doing so.  Those laws prohibit only anticompetitive conduct.  AICOA, by contrast, would prohibit conduct that is not anticompetitive.  The bill could, therefore, reduce economic welfare, even if the “harm to competition” language is construed to mean increased market power.
For example, Section 3(a)(6) prohibits the covered platforms from using “nonpublic data that are obtained from or generated on the covered platform by the activities of a business . . .  to offer, or support the offering of, the products or services of the covered platform operator that compete or would compete with products or services offered by business users on the covered platform.”  In other words, the bill would prohibit Amazon from using Company A’s data to build better products or services that compete with Company B; and it would bar Google from using data about Company C to improve the targeting and value of ads sold in competition with Company D.  Notably, it would prohibit the use of such data even if Companies A and C in the examples above agreed to sell the data to the platform, without being coerced by threats or otherwise, simply because they expected to benefit from the sale.  In these examples, everybody is harmed except maybe Companies B and D.
The bill does provide some affirmative defenses to otherwise prohibited conduct, but those defenses are narrow and do not encompass all welfare-enhancing benefits. For example, Section 3(a)(8) restricts uninstalling software and changing default settings. The conduct prohibited by that section can be justified only if shown to be necessary for the “functioning of the platform” or to prevent transfer of data to China or a “foreign adversary;” that conduct evidently cannot be justified even if it is necessary to develop new, complementary products.  The other conduct prohibited by the bill is justifiable if it is necessary to “maintain or substantially enhance the core functionality of the platform” (Section 3(b)(1)(C)), but not if it substantially enhances other features of the platform or other products or services.  And does “core functionality” mean core functionality today, so that the platform cannot evolve by adding or changing core functionality?  The narrowness of the justifications ensures that the bill, if enacted, will deter and likely prohibit a wide range of efficient and welfare-enhancing conduct.
Sections (3)(a)(1)-(3) could undermine economic welfare for an additional reason.  Those sections would prohibit the covered platforms from preferencing their own products, but the broad language of the bill glosses over important ambiguities. Do the prohibitions on self-preferencing mean that the platforms cannot enable their products and services to take advantage of their joint scale and scope economies?  Do they mean that the platforms cannot preinstall their new products and services, even if users want them preinstalled?  Do they mean that the platforms have to preinstall all alternatives in addition to their own preinstalled products and services, even if doing so makes the platform more cumbersome or the products and services less accessible and less valuable to users?
Economists have long understood that innovation is far more important for economic welfare than static efficiency.5  Yet AIOCA is likely to impair innovation by the platforms.  As noted above, the bill would not permit conduct to be justified even if it is necessary to enable development of valuable new products and services, and it might inhibit or prevent the evolution and improvement of the platforms themselves.  In addition, Section 3(a)(4) prohibits the covered platforms from, among other things, unreasonably delaying third party access to platform features that are available to the platform’s own products, except where necessary to prevent cybersecurity risk.  Does that mean that a platform cannot introduce its own complementary products or features (e.g., voice recognition, mapping and GPS, camera, etc.) until it has enabled all other providers of similar or competing products or features to access the platform?  One might think that others who are later in line for the technical reviews and assistance necessary for that access can reasonably be expected to obtain access later; but does Section 3(a)(4) mean that the platform cannot disclose to one of its own complementary product units technical specifications relevant to that access until it is ready to disclose them to everyone, and that it cannot even disclose competitively sensitive, tentative specifications to its own unit in order to draw upon the latter’s expertise in optimizing the platform’s suitability for the complementary product or service?
AIOCA will prohibit welfare-enhancing conduct by the covered platforms.  It will also prohibit anticompetitive conduct by the platforms, although the benefits of that are unclear because at least some, maybe most, of the anticompetitive conduct that the bill would prohibit violates existing antitrust laws.  Supporters of the bill say that it will promote innovation by making it easier for smaller firms that use the platforms to flourish.  That is an interesting conjecture, and there is undoubtedly some truth to it.  It is possible that efficient, welfare-enhancing conduct by the platforms regarding their businesses in complementary markets is so harmful to other actual and potential firms in those markets that it is harmful to welfare overall.  But there have been no hearings on the bill, and Congress has made no other investigation or findings that would support a conclusion that the costs of restricting efficient, innovative conduct by the platforms will be less than the benefits from insulating rivals in complementary markets from the conduct that the bill would prohibit.6
 
III. Content Moderation
According to newspaper reports, Senator Cruz, Congressman Buck, and other Republicans are saying that the AICOA will be a useful tool against content moderation or, as they think of it, liberal bias on the digital platforms.  Senator Klobuchar and other Democrats have said that the bill is about commercial practices, not content moderation.  In support of their position, the Democrats point in particular to language in the bill that limits the protected Business User category to persons that use the platforms for “advertising, sale, or provision of products or services” (Section 2(a)(2)(A)).
There are three problems with the Democrats’ position on this issue.  First, if Republican supporters of the bill say that it is intended to help reign in content moderation, that will be part of the legislative history and might affect judicial interpretations of the bill.  Second, two of the prohibitions set forth in the bill – Section 3(b)(5), which prohibits conditioning access to the platform on use of other products or services, and Section 3(b)(8), which prohibits restrictions on uninstalling preinstalled software or changing default settings — are not limited by the definition of Business User.  With AI advances, one can imagine platforms conditioning access to the platform on use of, or restricting uninstalling or changing the default settings on, truth filters.  The bill would block that.
Third, and most important, content moderation might be thought appropriate for certain types of Business Users.  Consider, for example, a cake shop that advertises on the platform that it does not serve LGBTQ persons and includes in the advertising false statements about them.  Or a PAC that advertises the sale of MAGA hats, the profits from which will be used to fund efforts to overturn the stolen 2020 presidential election.  Or a third-party app or service that disseminates false information. The platform will defend its refusal to run those ads or enable those apps or services on the ground that it is using neutral criteria based on truth and is not discriminating, but how should counsel advise the platform if she expects that the plaintiff will be able to find hundreds of false ads, or false statements disseminated by other apps or services, that slipped through the truth filters over many months in support of an argument that the criteria are not being neutrally applied?  The plaintiff will have a tough time winning such cases, but given the number of potential enforcers of the new law (including states like Florida and Texas), the litigation risk might nevertheless have a real deterrent effect on content moderation.
The misinformation and bias issues on social media and other platforms are very important.  They should not be confounded by a he-said, she-said debate about the reach of legislation intended, at least by the Democrats, for other purposes.
 
IV. Conclusion
There are many hard issues raised by current antitrust controversies and the digital platforms.  New legislation might be appropriate.  Sound legislation requires a clear, factually-based understanding of the problems the legislation is seeking to address and of the costs and benefits of the solutions.  AICOA is not yet such a bill.

The United Stated was the first to execute its antitrust statue. Today almost all countries have adopted Competition laws and US antitrust agencies have been interacting with them on a daily basis. For the welfare of many of the nation it has become extremely important for the globalization of antitrust as it (digital platforms like the Facebook and Google) face growing antitrust scrutiny by multiple enforcement regimes all over the world. After globalization, when the competition in the global markets surged, it became necessary for the legislators to regulate the competitive structure of the industries with an aim to protect the interest of the consumers. Anti-trust policies centered promoting consumer welfare would be best suited to advancing desirable aims. There is also a need to work with like-minded agencies-and within multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Competition Network (ICN) to promote the rule of law and the procedural fairness in the antitrust enforcement. The soundness of public policy decision making will play a key role to determine the extent to which the law benefits consumers and the global economy.

592,"June 15, 2022",US Senate Passes Bill Allowing AGs To Pick Location Of Where Antitrust Suits Are Heard,"


On Tuesday the US Senate passed legislation to allow state attorneys general to pick the location where their federal antitrust suits are heard, reported Bloomberg.  When first announced Alphabet’s Google had opposed the bill.
The chamber passed the measure by unanimous consent. An amendment removed a provision that would have applied the measure retroactively to a 2020 antitrust suit filed by Texas and 14 other states and territories against the operator of the world’s largest search engine. 
The bill, which has widespread bipartisan backing, now requires a House floor vote. If enacted, the legislation would give states the power to decide where antitrust trials are held, with companies not allowed to challenge those decisions. The federal government already has the same right
The measure grew out of a 16-month investigation by a House antitrust panel into the power of giant technology platforms. It represents a key step by US lawmakers to curb the monopoly power of internet giants in the nearly 30 years since the worldwide web was made available for commercial use — with the exception of a measure to protect online privacy for children in 1998. It’s part of a package of antitrust bills designed to rein in Big Tech that Congress is pushing to turn into law before the August recess.
Other bills, which are expected to be voted on as soon as next week, would bar large technology platforms like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms from favoring their own products over those of smaller rivals who use their platforms. A second proposal would open up distribution of apps on mobile devices, forcing Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. to allow alternate app stores and payment methods.

593,"June 15, 2022",TechREG® Chronicle – Content Regulation,"
Dear Readers,
The issue of how to manage online content scarcely leaves the headlines. The key issues include questions of content moderation, algorithm transparency, and the potential for online platforms to be used to abuse or victimize certain individuals or groups. This can take the form of hate speech or personal harassment, among other forms of problematic speech.  
Recent controversies have included the alleged use of social media platforms to spread disinformation surrounding recent elections, whether certain political figures should be excluded from key social media platforms, and the underlying question of whether given online platforms (and individuals) simply hold too much power over public discourse.
Perhaps inevitably, these questions have led to calls for regulation. But this opens a Pandora’s Box. What entities should be regulated? What type of content should fall within the scope of such regulation? What criteria should be used to determine what type of content is acceptable and what is not? And who should make such determinations? Should the industry self-regulate or is greater government oversight required? And how is such regulation to be squared with the fundamental value of free speech (as understood under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Article 10 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and countless human rights instruments and constitutions worldwide)? 
The timely articles in this Chronicle address these a...

594,"June 15, 2022",The Taming of Internet Platforms – A Look at the European Digital Services Act,"
Various regulatory attempts at taming global Internet platforms have entered the stage worldwide. These set out to renegotiate the cornerstones of a workable social contract and the expectations of the various participants in terms of social roles, acceptable behavior and reasonable means. In this vein, the European Digital Services Act (“DSA”) takes on questions of platforms’ responsibility for content moderation with an asymmetric system of due diligence obligations. This comprises the assessment of systemic risks that may arise from platform services, which includes risks resulting from the dissemination of illegal content or those that negatively affect the exercise of fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and information. The fact that the responsibility for this systemic risk assessment and the deployment of mitigation measures against these risks rest primarily with very large online platforms (“VLOPs”) and their interpretive sovereignty raises various concerns. A major question is what cultural imprint this will inflict on fundamental rights in Europe and what normative values will eventually be accentuated.

595,"June 15, 2022",What We Talk About When We Talk About Deplatforming Trump,"
Following his role in the January 6th attacks on the Capitol, several online platforms banned President Donald Trump from their platforms. While scholars and commentators have spent 18 months debating the value of removing Trump from major online platforms, we still lack sufficient empirical analysis of the positive and negative consequences the ban has had on public discourse, extremism, and Trump’s power and influence. But before we can assess the costs and benefits of removal, we first must develop a common understanding of the metrics we might use to evaluate the impacts of the ban. When we talk about whether deplatforming worked or failed, what do we mean by “worked” and what do we mean by “failed”?  This article provides 13 metrics that analysts or researchers could consider as a means of evaluating the impacts of the ban. While analyzing any of these will involve overcoming serious challenges, from data access, to resources, to how to attribute observed changes narrowly to Trump’s removal, identifying what metrics we should consider is an important first step to understanding the impact of banning Trump.

596,"June 15, 2022","Aesthetics, Technology, And Regulations","
Technology companies have increasingly come under regulatory fire for impairing society, markets, competition, and free speech, among other things. The underlying belief is that consumers require protection in digital markets. Despite the spectrum of harms attributed to Big Tech, relatively sparse attention has been paid to society’s relationship to aesthetics and image. In contrast to traditional forms of media where people passively view images of others, tech platforms allow people to manipulate their own photographs. By doing so, a belief is that unhealthy perceptions of beauty are supercharged compared to conventional mediums. This piece isn’t necessarily claiming that tech’s effects on aesthetic perceptions must come under greater regulatory scrutiny. Rather the goal is to discuss the nature and depth of a largely underspecified issue, which is related to many problems that have drawn the ire of commentators. It is indeed important to acknowledge how tech platforms influence perceptions of beauty and even views of self-worth in ways that were previously unknown — and whether this should implicate modern demands for tech regulation.

597,"June 14, 2022",EU’s Disinformation Code Will Force Big Tech To Tackle Fake News,"


Facebook, Twitter and TikTok are among the signatories of a new version of the EU’s anti-disinformation code that could be published as early as next Thursday and would force companies to share more data about how they tackle disinformation, according to a confidential report seen by the Financial Times. 
The EU’s anti-disinformation code is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in the power of Big Tech companies, and it is a prelude of what is probably coming with the recently approved Digital Services Act (DSA). Most of the large tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, TikTok and Microsoft, will join the EU’s code. While this code isn’t new — it was first introduced in 2018 as a voluntary code — the concessions made by the tech companies are key to understanding the impact it could have. 
First, companies will need to disclose how they are removing, blocking or curbing harmful content in advertising and in the promotion of content. Second, online platforms will have to develop tools and partnerships with fact-checkers to tackle “harmful disinformation,” and in some cases that may include taking down information. Third, big tech companies will also be forced to provide a country-by-country breakdown of their efforts, rather than providing global or Europe-wide data. 
“To respond to disinformation effectively, there is a need for country and language-specific data,” said Vera Jourova, EU’s vice-president for values and transparency in charge of the code. “We know disinformation is different in every country, and the big platforms will now have to provide meaningful data that would allow us to understand better the situation on the country level.”
The companies that sign the code will have six months to implement their measures. 
Digital Services Act 
The EU’s anti-disinformation code may lay the foundation for the content moderation rules that will be imposed through the DSA, a piece of legislation that will force Big Tech to monitor their platforms and remove illegal content. While this code is voluntary, it will be closely linked to the DSA as this legislation foresees the creation of codes of conduct to inform companies how to comply with the new content moderation rules.  
The DSA does not establish in the law how companies should identify and remove illegal content, and it explains that it will provide further guidance in secondary legislation or through codes of conduct. Thus, the updated EU disinformation code may be key to know what Big Tech would have to do to comply with the DSA and avoid hefty fines (up to 6% of global turnover).

598,"June 14, 2022",US Rep Cicilline Believes Big Tech Bill Has Votes Needed To Pass,"


A top Democratic lawmaker on antitrust issues said Tuesday a bill aimed at reining in the market power of Big Tech platforms like Amazon.com and Alphabet’s Google had the votes to pass the both chambers of Congress in the next few weeks.
On the sidelines of an event to rally support for measures before the Senate and House of Representatives that would prevent tech platforms, including Apple and Facebook, from favoring their own businesses in search and other ways, Representative David Cicilline, chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, said: “I’m very confident when these bills come to the floor, they will pass. Convincingly.”
Asked when, he said: “Before we leave for the summer, my hope is that it will happen. Obviously, best case scenario would be in the next week. Worst case scenario in my view, the month of July.”
U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of a Senate antitrust panel, also said last week that she enough support in the Senate to win passage.
Representative Ken Buck, a Republican sponsor, said Tuesday he supported the bill at least partially because of his view that conservative views are stifled online. “We’re being discriminated against,” he said.
The bills have been the subject of a ferocious amount of lobbying, with tech giants warning of dire consequences, like the disappearance of popular consumer online applications like Google Maps. Cicilline called some of those allegations “lies” on Tuesday.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the bills, and said on Tuesday: “The legislation would empower government bureaucracy to reign over our economy. No longer would competition be evaluated on the merits, instead the interest of consumers would be sidelined in favor of the interest of competitors.”

599,"June 14, 2022",How Big Media Handed Digital Advertising to Big Tech,"
By: Oles Andriychuk (Oxford Business Law Blog)
The current structure of digital advertising markets makes the Google-Facebook duopoly an unavoidable trading partner for every party in the content consumption supply chain, creating a typical ‘bottleneck’ problem. The media industry remains the only meaningful market force potentially capable of mitigating the duopolistic order of digital advertising, but traditional media appear to be more interested in partnering with Big Tech than competing with it.
The digital advertising industry shows a remarkable trajectory of growth, both in terms of scaling up as well as technological advancement. Being an omnipotent and omnipresent intermediary between the end-users and their digital life allows a handful of digital champions to hold a unique market position, improving endlessly their algorithmic matching expertise. Extraordinarily, out of all market players active in display advertising in the UK, Facebook generated over 50 percent of revenues. Google alone generated over 90 percent of UK search advertising revenues. 
It is a matter of fact that the entire digital advertising supply chain is being dominated by Facebook’s and Google’s expanding duopoly. This dominance is not only about the scope of their presence in the market, and not only about the astonishing absolute figures of their revenues and profits. 
These are the consequences. An important trigger of this radical metamorphosis in the area of online advertising was a fundamental reconfiguration of the entire ‘production process’—the path from the advertiser to the consumer has become much more technologically advanced. The entire process is currently characterized by tailoring and individualization and underpinned by robust algorithmic matching techniques. This allows myriad individual transactions to take place automatically within milliseconds—and despite some quite astonishing revelations and allegations of horizontal collusion and vertical exploitation, the system is incomparably more affordable than traditional advertising. Micro-targeting and consumer profiling allow a very effective matching of advertisers, publishers, and end-users. Clearly, the technological robustness of the model is accompanied by the objective features of the digital markets, which are characterized by strong network effects and oligopolistic structure, and which until recently have been evolving without any systemic regulatory supervision and enforcement. In antitrust circles, this is now a well-known story…

600,"June 13, 2022",Small Businesses Urge US Congress To Support Antitrust Bills,"


Dozens of companies and business organizations sent a letter to US Congress members on Monday, urging them to support a bill that would rein in the biggest tech companies such as Amazon and Google, and prevent them from leveraging their large resources in both money and data to tilt the markets in their favor.
Last week, Democratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar and lawmakers from both parties said they had the Senate votes needed to pass legislation that would prevent tech platforms, including Apple and Facebook, from favoring their own businesses. According to the rules of the United States’ legislative body, a simple majority is needed to pass such a bill, yet a more robust show of support would be needed to ensure no obstacles can be added, such as the infamous filibuster, which can allow opposing senators to ‘time out’ a bill’s discussion. 
Companies supporting the measure, which include Yelp, Sonos, DuckDuckGo and Spotify, called it a “moderate and sensible bill aimed squarely at well-documented abuses by the very largest online platforms.”
Other signatories included the American Booksellers Association, the American Independent Business Alliance, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and Kelkoo Group. Amazon.com, the Chamber of Commerce and others oppose the measure.

601,"June 13, 2022","Apple Complies With Dutch Regulators, Allows Other Payment Methods on Dating Apps","
Apple now plans to allow other methods of payment for Dutch dating apps, after intervention from the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), a report from ACM said.
This will see a change to the old rules, in which customers of dating apps were only able to pay using payment methods imposed by Apple.
ACM said Apple had abused its dominant position — and now dating-app providers will let customers pay in more varieties of ways.
ACM’s judgment came with an order subject to periodic penalty payments, totaling 50 million euros.
According to Martijn Snoep, chairman of ACM, the intent was to help everyone get the full benefits of the digital economy.
“In the digital economy, powerful companies have a special responsibility to keep the market fair and open,” Snoep said in the report. “Apple avoided that responsibility, and abused its dominant position vis-à-vis dating-app providers. We are glad that Apple has finally brought its conditions in line with European and Dutch competition rules. That offers app providers more opportunities to compete. And consumers will ultimately reap the benefits, too.”
That came after the tech giant also agreed to let the company take alternative payments, scaling back its push for control over all user data.
Google will now not be able to reject or remove Match Group apps from the Play Store for taking other payments.
And the company will take Match Group app updates providing alternatives for Google Play billing, and Google will work on “deficiencies of Google Play billing” to let Match Group apps test Google’s system alongside current pay systems.

602,"June 13, 2022",The Digital Markets Act: The Path to Overregulation,"

By Dr. Aurelien Portuese1
 
“The best antidote to the disruptive power of innovation is overregulation,” once wrote Tim Wu, now the White House’s adviser on competition policy. Paradoxically, a long-time “anti-monopoly evangelist” Tim Wu has recently admitted that “Europe has been interested in promoting competition within its own economy. We are thinking about the same thing ourselves.” This European inspiration for U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration has a name: the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”). But this European regulation is on a collision course with innovation, and looms in the hazards of overregulation.
 
I. Introduction: Overregulation By the DMA ­– An Inevitable Choice
On March 24, 2022, the European Union’s institutions have reached a political agreement on the DMA. Such agreement is both unsurprising and unfortunate. Unsurprising because all institutions of the European Union have agreed, from the first proposal of the DMA by the European Commission in December 2020, on the contours of the new rules about digital competition; institutional discussions have only increased, not decreased, the regulatory burden imposed on the targeted companies. Case in point: The European Parliament approved in December 2021 an earlier version of the DMA with 642 votes in favor, 8 against, and 46 abstentions–the overwhelming support for the DMA unsurprisingly will soon lead to its final adoption. The agreement is also unfortunate since the possible unintended consequences of the DMA have been widely documented over the last two years. These unintended consequences include fewer services from digital ecosystems, greater cybersecurity risks, poorer quality of data privacy because of data combination requirements, and also consumer harm generated out of prohibitions to offer services that may benefit consumers. And yet, European lawmakers have consistently ignored them as frivolous and unfounded critiques, despite the inevitability of the DMA’s unintended consequences.
As the European institutions are now heading toward the final vote of the DMA by the European Parliament and the Council, nothing can stop the DMA from being adopted. The European Commission’s Vice-President, Margrethe Vestager, expects the DMA to be fully applicable in October 2022. The European Commission is already encouraging the targeted companies to comply with this forthcoming regulation.
To paraphrase Tim Wu, the DMA will become the best antidote to the disruptive power of innovation: the DMA is undoubtedly an illustration of overregulation. Two provisions of the DMA, among many others, illustrate its over-regulatory reach, hence generating detrimental consequences on innovations essential for digital technologies that are critically lacking for European technology (“tech”) companies. The DMA lays down the grounds for breaking up and breaking into the platforms, thereby disregarding legitimate innovation arguments and property rights considerations.
 
II. Overregulation By the DMA: Breakups for Non-compliance
First, there is one provision of the future DMA that commentators overlook, and yet, it is paradoxically the most stringent provision of the regulation: Article 16 of the DMA. Contrary to the European lawmakers’ assertions, the DMA may lead to the breakup of tech companies. Indeed, the French Digital Minister Cedric O used former Federal Communications Commission Chair Tom Wheeler’s slogan when he publicly presented the DMA on March 24, 2022. In reference to regulating tech giants, referred to as “digital gatekeepers,” he said: “don’t break them up, break them open.” Despite this call against breaking up tech platforms, the DMA lays down the condition for such breakups–or “structural remedies” in antitrust parlance–to materialize.
Article 16 states that whenever the European Commission considers that a digital gatekeeper “has engaged in systematic non-compliance,” the Commission may decide to “impose on such gatekeeper any behavioural or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to ensure compliance with this Regulation.” “Systematic non-compliance” in Article 16.2 means “at least three non-compliance decisions” issued “within a period of five years” by the Commission regarding obligations laid down in Articles 5 and 6 of the Regulation. Such “systematic non-compliance” may lead to structural remedies against the gatekeeper “where there is no equally effective behavioural remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome for the gatekeeper concerned than the structural remedy” (Article 16.2).
Two sections of the DMA demonstrate that the threat of breakups is much more probable than what European lawmakers admit when hoping to reassure their American counterparts. First, violations of the DMA’s obligations can indeed occur unconsciously. Article 5 contains broad obligations hitting at the heart of the gatekeepers’ business models and intellectual property rights: The DMA obliges them to question their diversification strategies and give rivals access to their patented technologies. Article 6 obligations are purportedly “susceptible of being further specified”: In other words, Article 6 obligations are designed to be broad and indeterminate. Consequently, because of the indeterminacy of the DMA’s obligations, violations of the generalized obligations of Articles 5 and 6 may occur more often than gatekeepers can envisage.
Second, the three “non-compliance decisions,” or violations, do not have to occur successively, but they can be concomitant. This means that a gatekeeper can be subject to three simultaneous investigations for three different violations and receive in the course of a few months three decisions of non-compliance. Furthermore, these three violations can take place regarding the same product. For example, today, LinkedIn profiles and Outlook are bundled together so that users can click on email recipients to discover their social media profiles. By combining data from Outlook with data from LinkedIn, Microsoft may breach Article 5(a) of the DMA,2 Article 6(a),3 and Article 6(d)4 of the DMA: the wrath of the DMA’s obligations and prohibitions may come all at once as the European Commission may issue three simultaneous non-compliance decisions, thereby putting Microsoft into a position of “systematic non-compliance.” Among hundreds of other similar examples, this example demonstrates that a possible breakup is only a few months away after the DMA is finally adopted.
Third, that Article 16.2 does not alone provide sufficient guardrails. Article 16.2 states that “the Commission may only impose structural remedies pursuant to paragraph 1 either where there is no equally effective behavioral remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome for the gatekeeper concerned than the structural remedy.” Consequently, Article 16.2 provides for two situations when structural remedies can be imposed: when there is a lack of available behavioral remedy, or when behavioral remedies are excessively burdensome. Since there are always some sorts of behavioral remedies available, the first theoretical situation is purely rhetorical. The second situation, however, is more interesting as it reveals the lawmakers’ true perception of breakups. That is, behavioral remedies can sometimes be more cumbersome than structural remedies. In other words, breakups can be a more a proportionate solution than companies’ behavioral commitments.
This approach turns antitrust on its head, as structural remedies have historically been considered the solution of last resort, including by European regulators. Behavioral remedies are more proportionate than the highly controversial structural remedies: forcing firms to commit to certain behaviors remains less intrusive than breaking them up. But Article 16.2 reverses this commonsensical logic—breaking up companies becomes less disproportionate than regulating them. The European Commission can easily invoke the alleged proportionality now attached to breakups: Constant micro-managing companies can be said to be more cumbersome for regulators than a one-time company breakup.
For example, should a search engine rank in a “discriminatory” manner its search results, promoting its adjacent services rather than third-party services? Would it not be less “burdensome” to break up the company between its search engine function and its adjacent service, rather than for European Commission’s enforcers to check every update of the algorithm frequently? Indeed, would it not be easier to unbundle Google Shopping from Google search rather than requiring Google search to actively promote rivals of Google Shopping for “fairness” reasons? Breakups may appear more attractive to European enforcers regarding the administrability of the remedies. Moreover, it can be argued that it would be less “cumbersome” for the company to divest its adjacent services than to be subject to weekly or daily regulatory control of its algorithm’s update to ensure a lack of “discrimination.” Article 16.2’s guardrails are either purely rhetorical or wholly ineffective in preventing excessive use of structural remedies. The bottom line is: breakups are looming.
A legal analysis of Article 16 demonstrates that the likelihood of breakups is, contrary to European lawmakers’ vain reassurance, much higher than one can think. Paradoxically, breakups following the adoption of the DMA appear overlooked in the current discussion. This neglect underestimates the risks of overregulation that the DMA threatens concerning the preservation of innovation incentives and the preservation of property rights.
  
III. Overregulation By the DMA: “Break-ins” for Proprietary Assets
Furthermore, not only does the DMA seek to break up tech platforms, but European lawmakers also want to break into these tech platforms by way of the DMA. Indeed, Articles 5 and 6 of the DMA lay down a wide range of obligations and prohibitions applicable to the targeted digital gatekeepers. These rules intend to create “fairness” in the way gatekeepers interact with trading partners and “contestability” in the markets within which these gatekeepers operate. These obligations allow for break-ins by business users and competitors: They purportedly enable businesses to enter the operating systems of gatekeepers. As economists note about the DMA’s obligations, it is unclear whether the benefits of the ex-ante obligations will outweigh their costs. The break-ins provided in Articles 5 and 6 are considerable regarding the implications for innovation and regulatory overreach as they allow rivals to unfairly extract rents through the DMA’s obligations.
For example, nondiscriminatory rules suggest algorithmic accountability, which means the enforcers would constantly micromanage the gatekeepers’ algorithmic formulas to ascertain the absence of “unfair” or “discriminatory” treatments of business users. Algorithm-driven companies may “self-prefer” their products to offer consumers and business users synergies across various services. For instance, Google may place Google Meet in Gmail to provide consumers with an alternative, easily accessible video-conferencing program. Also, Amazon may promote products using its delivery services as these services will enable the company to optimize delivery times for consumers. Additionally, “self-preferencing” can reveal consumer preferences, as illustrated by the fact that consumers generally prefer private label products (i.e., generic products) because of brand loyalty and lower prices. For these reasons, the European Commission’s own experts concluded that self-preferencing practices are “not abusive per se, but [should be] subject to an effects test.” And yet, against its own experts’ advice but also against general economic knowledge recognizing the desirability of self-preferencing, the DMA prohibits “self-preferencing” per se.
Article 6(d) of the DMA bans self-preferencing by gatekeepers with no justification available. The version of the DMA approved by the European Parliament on December 15, 2021 indeed states that gatekeepers have to “not treat more favourably in ranking or other settings, services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself or by any third party belonging to the same undertaking compared to similar services or products of third-party and apply transparent, fair and non-discriminatory conditions to such third-party services or products.” Such an aggressive stance on the platforms’ business models has one objective: to break into the platform and unbundle complementary products and services that the platform has introduced as a result of innovation.
The inevitable consequence would be for the targeted platforms to refrain from introducing new products and services because of the risks of engaging in “self-preferencing,” irrespective of likely lost or foregone consumer benefits. Targeted platforms may no longer engage in fierce competition through innovation since the European Commission enforcers may eventually assess their ability to innovate and challenge other industries’ incumbents as anticompetitive. One example would be for digital gatekeepers to compete less with financial institutions since their ability to innovate in terms of financial payments (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, Facebook Pay, etc.) may be perceived as “self-preferencing” despite lower fees and the greater choice these innovative services offer to consumers and business users. In other words, the DMA breaks into tech platforms with the likely consequence of ossifying markets with entrenched positions–i.e., the opposite result of the DMA’s stated objectives.
Another illustration of the DMA’s intent to break into the platforms and dictate alternative business models is provided with Article 11.1b, voted on by the European Parliament on December 15, 2021. This article states that “[t]he gatekeeper shall not engage in any behaviour discouraging interoperability by using technical protection measures, discriminatory terms of service, subjecting application programming interfaces to copyright or providing misleading information.” In conjunction with article 11.1a, this article means that gatekeepers must not discourage maximal interoperability even in services which are not the “core platform services” identified by the DMA. In other words, gatekeepers, at all times and for all services, have to ensure interoperability of their services with any business users’ services and devices irrespective of considerations related to intellectual property rights (i.e., copyright) or “technical protection measures” (i.e., cybersecurity). To illustrate, this “anti-circumvention” requirement may lead Amazon, for example, to interoperate its cloud services with any domestic or foreign cloud provider, and Amazon cloud services could not impose technical protection measures designed to prevent data leakages, nor could it impose confidential requirements related to the intellectual property rights ascribed to its cloud technology. The unintended consequences for end-users appear blatant—cybersecurity threats and lack of data protection. Additionally, the unintended consequences for the platform’s innovation will eventually arise at the expense of high-quality business users and all end-users (i.e., investment deterrence on the technology because of constant neglect of intellectual property rights may undermine consumer and business users’ experience).
This anti-circumvention provision is further detailed in Recital 32 of the latest version of the DMA adopted on December 15, 2021. This recital states that the DMA’s obligations
“should apply to any behaviour by a gatekeeper, irrespective of its form and irrespective of whether it is of a contractual, commercial, technical or any other nature, insofar as it could, in practice, have an equivalent object or effect to the practices that are prohibited under this Regulation. Such behaviour includes the design used by the gatekeeper, the presentation of end-user choices in a non-neutral manner, or using the structure, function, or manner of operation of a user interface or a part thereof to subvert or impair user autonomy, decision-making, or choice.”
This “neutrality” would lead gatekeepers to offer products and services in a way where they not only disfavor their own products, but also where they actively promote their rivals’ products and services at the expense of the gatekeepers’ incentives to innovate and compete.
The mere likelihood that a practice of the gatekeeper could lead consumers to choose the gatekeeper’s services will be subject to prohibition under this anti-circumvention clause. For instance, any sign-in suggestions (e.g., Apple, Google, or Facebook sign-ins suggestions) may be prohibited as they are “technical” practices that may “impair” consumers’ “choice” in a “non-neutral manner”; even suggestions among a few competing sign-in alternatives may still appear to be non-neutral since other email providers are discriminated against and excluded from the sign-in suggestions. In other words, if Google suggests that consumers sign in with Google accounts, Apple accounts, or Facebook accounts, companies such as Twitter, Alibaba, or many other rivals may complain that these choices are non-neutral since their names do not appear in the suggestions. Given the impossibility of defining “neutrality,” Google may become incentivized to no longer propose its sign-in solutions at the expense of product innovation and possibly consumer preferences.
The DMA intends to break into the way gatekeepers interact with business users and end users, irrespective of intellectual property rights considerations and irrespective of the ways consumers benefit from digital ecosystems so that gatekeepers are subject to “non-discriminatory” requirements that enforcers define, determine, and implement without predictability for these platforms. Such uncertainty as to whether new products and services can be considered as violating the numerous prohibitions and obligations of the DMA will irremediably lead gatekeepers to lower the pace of introducing new products and services in their ecosystems at the expense of the disruptive innovation which has characterized the digital economy. Ideally, European lawmakers want, through the DMA, to treat gatekeepers as public utilities, subjecting them to neutrality requirements— much like the General Court of the European Union has recently considered that Google should be treated as an “essential facility.”
To be sure, European lawmakers have added to possible breakups of digital gatekeepers a range of prohibitions and obligations which will effectively lead enforcers to break into the platform’s ecosystem, business model and, ultimately, property rights. Treating innovative companies as public utilities is not without consequences for either innovation incentives or consumer benefits.
  
IV. Conclusion: Overregulation By the DMA – Does it Whither Innovation? 
Breakups and break-ins are both highly controversial, and yet they are the legal force at the heart of the DMA. The populist “big-is-bad” has its comeback, as breakups aim at shrinking large-scale enterprises. In contrast, break-ins aim at sharing critical assets legitimately created to redistribute power from large companies to (not so) small ones. Both objectives undermine the fundamental protection of intellectual property rights. Thus, they annihilate the incentives for innovation at the potential expense of consumers and only in the name of following a populist stance against large platforms.
The regulatory pattern of overregulation is undeniable: the DMA adds one layer of stringent regulation atop national regulations without removing regulatory barriers to innovation. Indeed, the premise for the DMA was initially that national regulatory barriers burden European tech companies to compete and thrive: The European institutions had to complete the Digital Single Market. In the traditional narrative of the European Commission regarding the completion of the internal market, such completion would only take place by 1) removing national regulatory barriers and 2) adopting a European-wide regulation harmonizing national rules with the benefit of scale. The DMA was supposed to solve the so-called “fragmentation” of the Digital Single Market due to numerous national regulatory obstacles.
Has such fragmentation of the Digital Single Market been solved with the DMA proposal? Not at all. Contrary to the initial and laudable objective of the DMA, which was the completion of the Digital Single Market through the non-fragmentation of digital rules across Member States, the DMA does not even try to address such fragmentation. This insincere objective is highly problematic for two reasons.
First, from a legal perspective, the DMA lacks the legal basis necessary for its adoption. In other words, it does not achieve the purpose which justifies its proposal and adoption. The DMA has Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis, which enables the EU to adopt “measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.” That is, the EU can legislate under Article 114 TFEU only for harmonization purposes. The proposed rule must reduce the regulatory fragmentation within the EU.
But the DMA does nothing to mitigate such regulatory fragmentation. Adding an EU-wide rule and letting Member States adopt their own rules paradoxically increases regulatory fragmentation. Such legal inconsistency–i.e., the legal basis’s objective of reduced fragmentation with the realized objective of increased fragmentation–has led prominent legal scholars to conclude that the DMA may be illegal under European treaties.
Second, from an economic perspective, it is well-known that digital companies can thrive and compete only if they reap off the scale economies inherent to the network effects at play in the digital economy: absent scale, tech platforms are bound to fail, struggle, and ultimately be outcompeted by larger-scale enterprises better equipped for the innovation-driven economy we live in. Consequently, European tech companies will move to the United States to scale-up given the size of the American market and the size of the market for venture capital. There is a consensus that only scale can save the European digital economy. Thus, national regulatory barriers need to be removed.
And yet, the DMA does nothing to help European companies compete in the digital economy, contrary to what European lawmakers might wishfully think that the DMA pursues. In other words, the DMA may very well overregulate and harm a few American tech platforms, altogether harming these platforms’ business partners and millions of consumers. But ironically, the DMA does not help European companies to thrive, since the main obstacle for these companies remains unchanged and could worsen with the DMA–namely, the regulatory fragmentation of the Digital Single Market.
These unfortunate outcomes arising from the DMA proposal and its soon adoption lead to one conclusion: overregulation harms innovation. As a case of overregulation, the DMA will irremediably reduce innovation. The disruptive power of innovation— a force of change and progress—is subdued when a regulation like the DMA adopts a precautionary, risk-averse approach to innovative companies and unleashes radical solutions such as breakups and “break-ins.” In a time of greatly needed transatlantic cooperation, the adoption of the DMA will have lasting consequences on the regulatory divergence of tech platforms between the European Union and the United States.

604,"June 6, 2022",US Antitrust Bill Sparks A Growth In Tech Lobbying,"


Amazon and Alphabet are spearheading what is shaping up to be the most intense political campaign by corporate America in recent history as part of a last-ditch attempt to stop Congress from passing laws to curb their market power. 
The companies are targeting a “self-preferencing” bill which would prevent large online platforms from using their dominance in one field to give other products an unfair advantage — for example, Alphabet using its Google search engine to promote its travel or shopping products. 
If the bill goes through, it is likely to lend momentum to a wave of legislation aimed at strengthening America’s competition rules, in what could be the biggest update of the country’s antitrust rules in a generation. 
“This is one of the most significant campaigns that we have run in recent years,” said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which has co-ordinated the tech industry’s response to the bill. “That is because there has never been so serious a proposal to undermine US competitiveness and put US users at risk.” 
Those on the other side see the lobbying is aimed at shoring up the dominance of the big tech groups. “The internet giants are in Yolo [you only live once] mode — they are desperate and are doing whatever they can to change the trajectory,” said Luther Lowe, senior vice-president of public policy at Yelp, which has lobbied in favour of the bill.

605,"June 6, 2022",UK To Close Online Advertising Consultation Eyeing Stricter Rules,"
Google, Meta, TikTok and other companies in the online advertising industry may face a new regulatory landscape in the United Kingdom as a result of new legislation, the creation of a new regulator and even enforcement actions.
The government will close a public consultation on its Online Advertising Program June 8, which may result in stricter online advertising rules. Currently, the placement of online advertising in the UK is overseen by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which lacks enforcement powers and is governed under a system of self-regulation. Given the increasing number of scams and promotions of fraudulent products, the government is looking at potential changes in the existing regulation and how to properly fund regulators to combat harmful advertising.
One interesting view is that irrespective of the new regulatory approach to be adopted, the responsibility will not only fall under platforms such as Meta, TikTok or Twitter, but also on the intermediaries in the online ad chain, such as Google, TheTradeDesk and AppNexus.
The three options foreseen in the consultation are to continue with a self-regulatory approach with a few new requirements for intermediaries, publishers and platforms; to introduce a statutory regulator to backstop the self-regulatory approach who would only intervene when the sanctions available to the ASA don’t go far enough to ensure compliance; and to create a new regulator with more powers.
While the government didn’t say explicitly which option it would choose, there are references in the report suggesting that the government may prefer to have a new regulator with strong enforcement powers. For instance, on this third option, the document stated: “This is likely to be the most effective approach for increasing accountability in addressing illegal harms like fraudulent advertising … as criminal enforcement powers would likely be necessary for some of the measures required to address such activity.”
If the government chooses this policy option, it will create a new regulator empowered to take appropriate actions, including rulemaking powers, sanctions, blocks and bans, and investigative powers to request data, audit companies or undertake investigations.
The consultation doesn’t provide any estimated timeline for a decision, but its fate may be closely tied to the Online Safety Bill, which also contains provisions to prevent fraudulent paid advertising.
If the Online Safety Bill is approved, it will require the largest and most popular social media platforms as well as search engines to prevent paid fraudulent adverts appearing on their platforms. Under the current draft of the Online Safety Bill, Big Tech already has an obligation to protect users from fraud committed by other users. But a last-minute change added to the bill put the focus on fraudulent paid advertisements, whether they are controlled by the platform itself or an advertising intermediary. This includes ads with unlicensed financial promotions, fraudsters impersonating legitimate businesses and ads for fake companies.
While the online advertising program is just in a consultation stage, the Online Safety Bill is already in second reading in the Parliament, and depending on the outcome, it may pave the way for secondary legislation on the online advertising industry.

606,"June 5, 2022",US Senators Look To Pass Antitrust Reforms Before Midterms,"


Advocates of recent antitrust proposals fear that if congressional leadership doesn’t usher it through before the midterms, or at least the end of the year, it could die, reported CNBC.
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a Senate bill that closely resembles an earlier House version, advanced out of the Judiciary Committee earlier this year by a wide margin.
Known among staff and lawmakers as the self-preferencing or anti-discrimination bill, the legislation would prohibit dominant tech platforms like Amazon, Apple and Google from giving preferential treatment to their own services in marketplaces they operate. If passed, it could prevent Google from having its own travel recommendations at the top of search results, for example. Or Amazon might have to ensure its own products are ranked by the same criteria as competitors’ products.
The bill has overcome intense lobbying from the tech industry, and there are increasingly signs it will move forward before the August recess.
Advocates feel there’s little time to spare. They cite the probability that with Republican control of the House following the November vote, the party would follow current caucus leaders who have signaled that antitrust reform would be a lower priority. In the digital space, Republican House leaders have been focused more on content moderation and privacy issues.
Given that backdrop, onlookers are wondering: What will it take for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to give the bills time on the floor for a vote?
Sources tell CNBC. Schumer met about the status of antitrust legislation on May 18 with Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chairs of the Judiciary Committee and subcommittee on antitrust, respectively, according to a Democratic source familiar with the conversation. (The source, like others who are not named in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes conversations in Congress.)
Schumer asked Klobuchar, the bill’s lead sponsor alongside Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to release the latest version of the text that has input from members on both sides over the next couple of weeks, and Klobuchar released the latest language last Wednesday. Schumer told the pair he fully supports the bill and is committed to putting it on the floor for a vote by early summer, according to the source.
It’s unclear if the bill has the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. Some reports have suggested Democratic leaders are waiting to have enough votes to pass the bills before bringing them to the floor. But some advocates say it would be best to put lawmakers’ feet to the fire by making them go on the record with their votes, gambling that many won’t want to be seen as weak on Big Tech.
CNBC spoke with lawmakers, advocates and opponents of the legislation and congressional staffers involved in discussions around the bills to learn what it might take to move forward as Congress races against the clock to pass tech antitrust reform.

607,"June 2, 2022","Independent, But Together: How Antitrust and Regulation Can Work Synergistically To Benefit Consumers","
By: Al Kramer (Public Knowledge)
Public Knowledge released my new paper, “A Lesson From the Landmark AT&T Breakup: Both a Sector-specific Regulator and Antitrust Enforcers Were Needed.” The paper traces how antitrust enforcers and a regulatory agency with jurisdiction over telecommunications, each working independently in pursuit of its own defined mission, produced a competitive telecommunications industry with the attendant benefits for competitors and consumers and society – lower priced and higher quality goods and services. A similar dual approach of a regulatory agency with jurisdiction over Big Tech and the vigorous application of  existing and enhanced antitrust laws aimed at the industry can do the same for Big Tech.
For the past several years, a number of macro-level public policy debates have been swirling around Big Tech. One debate has been about whether the antitrust laws, perhaps with some strengthening or new provisions specifically designed to reach Big Tech, are sufficient to address the dominance of companies such as Facebook (Meta), Google, Amazon, Apple, and some others. Indeed, whether Section 2 of the Sherman Act, antitrust’s main anti-monopolization law, can be effective for at least part of meeting this challenge is currently being tested in antitrust cases against Facebook (Meta) and Google.
Another issue concerns whether some platforms have particular economic and other characteristics that inherently lead to, or at least “tip” toward, dominance by a single or a very small number of firms with the resultant tendency toward practices that harm competition or lead to anti-consumer practices. If they do, it follows that these platforms need sector-specific competition laws or regulation to prevent the dominance from recurring rather than waiting for these characteristics to lead right back to the same dominance, with the attendant anti-competitive and anti-consumer consequences. 
There is also a question over who should regulate – whether the authority to regulate should go to an existing regulatory agency or a new agency with specific subject matter jurisdiction…

Sheryl Sandberg, one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent executives who helped build Facebook into a global tech juggernaut, is stepping down as chief operating officer of Meta, Facebook’s parent company.
Sandberg, 52, made the surprise announcement in a Facebook post on Wednesday, writing that: “When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years. Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life,” Sandberg wrote. “I am not entirely sure what the future will bring – I have learned no one ever is.”
Sandberg will stay on the board of Meta, according to the company. Javier Olivan, another executive at the company, will takeover as chief operating officer when Sandberg departs the role this fall.
Sandberg was a pivotal figure in helping grow Facebook from a free social network dreamed up in a Harvard dorm to one of the most dominant social media platforms in the world, with nearly 3 billion users around the globe.
Often referred to as “the adult in the room” during the early days of Facebook’s rise, she served as a seasoned No. 2 at company alongside co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was leading the company in his early 20s. Sandberg arrived at Facebook after years of working as a manager in advertising at Google.

610,"May 31, 2022",New Bill Aims To Give Big Tech Its Own Regulator,"


Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and other tech companies may need to deal with a new digital platform regulator in the U.S. if Congress passes a bill that seeks to create a Commission to rein in Silicon Valley’s power. 
Senator Michael Bennet and Representative Peter Welch introduced the Digital Platform Commission Act of 2022 in the Senate and the House respectively in May. This bill, if approved, would establish a new five-person commission tasked with protecting consumers in the age of Big Tech. 
“We need an agency with expertise to have a thoughtful approach here,” said Senator Bennet. According to the Senator, the current institutions aren’t enough to oversight the tech industry. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) are currently focused on competition problems and they do not address many of the industry’s most pressing problems, Bennet argues, such as foreign disinformation or children’s safety. 
The bill seems to take ideas from different legal texts around the world, in particular from other bills introduced in the U.S., Europe and the U.K. For instance, the new Federal Digital Platform Commission could designate certain platforms as “Systemically Important Digital Platforms” (SIDP) based on certain criteria like revenue or users — this is similar to the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and to the Digital Markets Act recently approved in Europe. These SIDP may be subject to new data and portability rules or transparency requirements. 
The new Commission could also investigate recommendation systems and other algorithmic processes of Big Tech firms to ensure that the algorithmic processes are “fair, transparent and without harmful, abusive or deceptive bias.” There is another requirement that goes to the core of content moderation, and it may conflict with the current protection that digital platforms enjoy under section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. The bill establishes that the Commission could require SIDP to conduct “regular public risk assessment of the distribution of harmful content and steps the SIDP has taken, or plans to take, to mitigate those harms.”
Interestingly, the proposed bill doesn’t go as far as the Digital Services Act in Europe or the Online Safety Bill in the U.K. that requires Big Tech firms to remove illegal (and harmful in the U.K.) content as soon as possible. The Digital Platform Commission Act would only require an assessment and a proactive approach by firms to deal with harmful content. 
In addition to the five-member Commission, the bill also proposes the creation of an 18-member Code Council that would develop voluntary or enforceable behavioral codes, technical standards and other policies for digital platforms. In this Code Council there would be representatives of the digital platforms, nonprofit groups, academics and experts in engineering, computer science and other relevant fields. The Council could propose new codes or standards to the Commission, who may adopt, reject or adopt with modifications the proposed codes and standards. 
The new agency would also have jurisdiction over merger reviews, but to avoid jurisdictional conflicts with FTC or DoJ, the new agency would only analyze if the transaction is in the public interest. However, the bill doesn’t provide further information about how to assess what is in the public interest. Besides, the Commission could grant exemptions from this review to digital platforms based on the size and other criteria. 
The Federal Digital Platform Commission would enjoy a budget akin to the FTC. For the first year it would only have $100 million, but it would increase annually to $500 million in 2027. The FTC’s budget for FY22 is around $430 million.

611,"May 30, 2022",EU Data Protection Chief Wants More Choices For Users,"
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) head Wojciech Wiewiorowski said that people should have more choices and opportunities about their own information, and the level of privacy shouldn’t be decided far away, in a clear reference to the decisions made by tech companies outside Europe. 
Speaking at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference, his remarks were focused not so much on how privacy policies are decided or by whom, but on how companies and regulators should put people at the center of the debate. “Sometimes we lose sight of what we are fundamentally protecting at the end of the day: the rights of people,” Wiewiorowski said. 
While he acknowledged that the recognition of the individual is embedded in the structure of the current data protection framework, he warned that people are are dynamic and may become vulnerable to certain use of data by companies. 
The data supervisor referenced behavioral economics and behavioral science that may be used to encourage users to take certain actions online without the user fully realizing it: “The growing use of dark patterns on the internet; the cunning design of certain cookie banners that subconsciously influence users to act in one way or another.”
Wiewiorowski also warned that targeted advertising and the use of pervasive profiling can lead to an asymmetry of power between the data subject and the data controller. 
This shows that people are vulnerable, he argued, understanding vulnerability as a lack of choice, and the only way to address this vulnerability is by giving people real choices and real opportunities. The choices of data protection are still too often made elsewhere, and data protection authorities have a critical role to play in this, Wiewiorowski said. 
During his remarks, this was the only message that seemed to encourage regulators to increase their enforcement efforts, in particular through the General Data Protection Regulation. 
The EDPS is an independent authority comprised of 120 public officials in the European Union. It is responsible for ensuring European institutions respect the right to privacy and protect data when they process personal information. 
As part of its daily tasks, the EDPS acts as a traditional data protection authority. It investigates and, if necessary, conducts investigations on complaints. 
Recommendations by the EDPS often impact the outcome of negotiations between the Parliament and European Commission over data security matters. 
“The EDPS’ role is to recommend policy, and we are mandated to follow new technologies very closely,” said Leonardo Cervera, director of the EDPS, in an interview with PYMNTS. “The idea is to anticipate the impact of new technologies on data privacy.”

Republican Senators want to bar US app stores, including Apple and Google, from hosting apps that allow payments to be made with China’s digital currency, according to a copy of proposed legislation seen by Reuters.
The bill to be unveiled on Thursday by Senators Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Mike Braun states that companies that own or control app stores “shall not carry or support any app in [their] app store(s) within the United States that supports or enables transactions in e-CNY”.
Read More: Competition Policy and Regulation in China’s Digital Economy
According to Cotton’s office, digital yuan could provide the Chinese government with “real-time visibility into all transactions on the network, posing privacy and security concerns for American persons who join this network.”
The Center for a New American Security, a Washington DC based think tank, said in a January 2021 report that China’s digital currency and electronic payments system was “likely to be a boon for CCP surveillance in the economy and for government interference in the lives of Chinese citizens,” noting that “transactions will contain precise data about users and their financial activity.”
The move comes after WeChat, a messaging and payment application owned by China’s Tencent with over 1.2 billion users, announced it would begin supporting the currency earlier this year. Alipay, the hugely popular payments app owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, also accepts the digital currency. Both apps are available in the Apple and Google App stores.
While stopping potential national security threats related to China is a rare point of bipartisan agreement in the deeply divided US Congress, prospects for the bill’s passage ahead of midterm elections are uncertain.

613,"May 26, 2022",Privacy in a Technological Age,"
In our data-driven society, privacy as a fundamental right should be recognized and upheld. We must adopt strong legal and technological protections that preserve our autonomy. Legally speaking we must establish a comprehensive federal scheme that recognizes privacy as a fundamental right. Technologically speaking, solutions that are architecturally developed from the individual privacy point of view should be deployed. These trust frameworks will need to mesh with new laws that support privacy as a fundamental right. New types of decentralized/blockchain identity systems are coming online and evolving which support privacy rights and restore the balance of power between the individual and service provider. These systems are disruptive, potentially very profitable, and will impact status quo business models. Tensions between the old and new will have to be resolved. With legal and technological means working together, we can protect our right to be left alone. Privacy is possible in the digital age.

A global digital tax deal might not be ready until the end 2023 or early 2024, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday (May 24), flagging a big delay to the reform’s implementation, Reuters reported. 
The deal, which officials had hoped to sign off on at the middle of this year, aims to reallocate rights to tax big digital groups such as Apple and Google to the countries where the end clients are located. 
It is the first of two pillars of a major overhaul of the rules of cross-border taxation which also include plans for a global minimum corporate tax of 15% on big multinationals.
“As far as Pillar I is concerned – digital taxation – we won’t spare our efforts to convince the international community and the members of the OECD to do their best efforts to have a consensus in the coming months,” Le Maire said after chairing a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels.
“It might be the end of 2023, it might be the beginning of 2024, the key point is to have a total overhaul of the international taxation system,” Le Maire added.

A delegation of the European Parliament met with executives from tech companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Airbnb, eBay, PayPal, and Uber to discuss the latest digital market advances, but also to get a closer look at the US’ legislative work on eCommerce and platforms.
A delegation of the EU Parliament will be at Silicon Valley between May 23 and 27 to meet with tech companies, authorities and academics. The visit will be led by Andreas Schwab, the main rapporteur of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new EU law that will impose restrictions on Big Tech companies to foster competition in digital markets.  
Related: Antitrust Chronicle – E-Commerce and Pricing Concerns – An Antitrust Perspective
Lawmakers will also use this opportunity to discuss the recent U.S. legislative work on eCommerce and platforms as well as exchange views on the EU’s digital policy agenda. Just last week, the EU Parliament reached an agreement with EU member states for the approval of the DMA. EU leaders expect that this visit will “feed into the committee’s ongoing work on the digital single market and consumer protection.”
The meeting likely won’t be limited to the topics mentioned in the official press release, and Schwab has already given good proof of that. On Monday (May 23), he tweeted about a documentary on Big Tech companies where he is featured, suggesting that issues like taxation and data control could be also part of the conversations with authorities.
Also on Monday, Schwab told Politico that he is planning to bring up accusations against Cloudfare in his next meeting, made by Ukraine’s digital minister that the company is offering services in Russia and paying taxes that “help finance the Russian army.”
But one piece of legislation that is as important to EU lawmakers as the DMA is the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA has been approved by Parliament, but it may still be subject to minor changes in the last legislative steps before the final rubber stamping.
The DSA seeks to make platform companies responsible for the content published on their platforms, and is based on the 2001 eCommerce Directive. With eCommerce being one of the key issues for this visit, there is a strong likelihood the DSA may be discussed. In a similar vein, California lawmakers recently introduced several bills targeting online platforms algorithms, children’s data and privacy.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants bipartisan tech antitrust legislation to be voted on this summer, reported Axios.
Axios reported that Schumer met with Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) Wednesday to discuss next steps for Klobuchar’s bipartisan bill, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which passed out of the Senate Judiciary committee earlier this year.
The bill would ban Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta from favoring their own services in an anticompetitive way, similar to a House bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a marathon markup last summer.
Schumer urged Klobuchar to release an edited version of her bill with input from bipartisan members of the Judiciary Committee soon, so members have time to review it before it’s put up for a floor vote, per the source.
Opponents of the bill say it would undermine national security, embolden China, break encryption services and endanger tech services consumers enjoy. A package of bills limiting the power of tech giants is gaining momentum in Congress, though leaders are running out of time to pass major legislation before the midterms.

After complaints from rivals,  Microsoft is relaxing business terms for its cloud computing service in an attempt to avoid a full antitrust probe in Brussels, reported The Financial Times.
The new changes follow concerns from rival cloud providers that Microsoft is using anti-competitive practices to draw customers to its Azure cloud computing platform and away from competitors. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, confirmed last month that Brussels was “actively following up” on a complaint about Microsoft’s cloud service practices. 
Related: Microsoft Responds To Cloud Antitrust Complaints
On Wednesday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the tech giant was taking steps that were “very broad but not exhaustive” as he sought to address concerns from regulators and competitors.
Smith said the changes being introduced were “grounded in feedback” he had received from multiple cloud providers across Europe. In a blog post, he wrote: “Some of the most compelling feedback for me personally came from a CEO who said that he felt that he ‘was a victim of friendly fire in Microsoft’s competition with Amazon’. It was hard to hear this — but he was right.”
At issue is a set of licensing rule changes that make it more expensive to run Microsoft Windows, Office, Windows Serverand SQL Server on cloud services other than Microsoft Azure. In a report Tuesday, Bloomberg spoke to customers affected by the issue, including one that found switching to Google Cloud would cost an extra $50 million in Windows licenses. It’s unclear exactly how much expense the rule changes add for the typical customer, though.
“While not all of these claims are valid, some of them are, and we’ll absolutely make changes soon to address them,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. “We’re committed to listening to our customers and meeting the needs of European cloud providers.”

618,"May 16, 2022",The Implementation of the Digital Markets Act with National Antitrust Laws,"


By Christophe Carugati (Université Paris II)
The December 2020 Commission’s proposal for a Digital Markets Act (DMA) reached a compromised text with the Council and the Parliament on March 24, 2022. While the text that will impose obligations and prohibition rules on large online platforms acting as “gatekeepers” before any wrongdoing ex-ante is due to enter into force in October 2022, the same platforms are already under investigation in Germany under a DMA-like competition law that also imposes prohibition rules ex-ante. Other countries in Europe, including Italy, are considering following Germany and implementing new competition rules to adapt to the digital economy. How should the DMA implement with national competition laws? This question is crucial because inconsistency will inevitably hamper the effectiveness of both the DMA and national competition laws. The paper addresses this question by studying the DMA and German implementation framework. Section I explains how legislators envisage the implementation of the DMA with national competition laws. Section II then considers the implementation of the DMA-like national competition rules by focusing the analysis on Germany, which already enforced its new legislation in January 2022 against Google. Section III designs a cooperation model between the DMA and national competition laws. Section IV concludes.

619,"May 16, 2022",Seven-Figure TV Ad Campaign Slamming Key Antitrust Proposal Launched,"


The CCIA’s “Don’t Break What Works” campaign will launch its new ad, “Squeezed,” which highlights how the American Innovation and Choice Online Act will hurt Americans struggling amid record inflation, and possibly break services like Google Search and Amazon Prime, The Hill reported. 
The Computer & Communications Industry Association released a 30-second ad on Monday as part of its “Don’t Break What Works” campaign. The ad offers a new line of attack by focusing on inflation and arguing that proposed legislation would further raise prices for Americans.
This is the third installment of the tech-friendly ad campaign. Don’t Break What Works launched an ad, “Progress,” in January ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee markup of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (S. 2992). The campaign then launched a second round of ads focused on how this legislation will break Amazon Prime. 
The antitrust bill targeted by the add is the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.The legislation aims to block tech giants from giving preferential treatment to their own products and services. In practice, it could bar Amazon from placing its own products at the top of search results on its site or prevent Google from highlighting its own services. 
In January the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the bill with bipartisan support. The bill would effectively target Amazon, Apple, Facebook-parent Meta and Google, based on the definition of a covered platform. All four companies are members of the CCIA. 
Chandler Smith Costello, spokeswoman for the campaign, said in launching the ad that “Americans are feeling the squeeze of record inflation every day. We are urging Congress to avoid making it worse by breaking products that American consumers love.”
“While lawmakers in Washington should be focused on doing everything they can to provide American families relief from the high costs at the pump and the checkout counter, certain members of Congress are intent on pressing forward with S. 2992 – deeply flawed legislation that would ruin some of the products Americans use everyday, including products that can actually have a deflationary effect,” Smith Costello continued.
Backers of the bill have said it is necessary to stop Big Tech companies from preferencing their own products over those of competitors and small companies in search results and collecting nonpublic data of businesses selling on the platform.

620,"May 16, 2022","Indian Platform Markets, Data, and Privacy","

By Dr. Geeta Gouri1
  
The attractiveness of Indian data and privacy platforms with nationalist overtones in the context of a global backlash against foreign platforms has been articulated in various ways. While protectionism is easy to comprehend in offline markets bound by national boundaries, the same approach of applying the tools of traditional economics towards online platform markets is beset with awkward competitive analyses.
The Government of India has announced policies to facilitate and usher an e-commerce “India platform” to counter foreign platform markets, of which Amazon is the most prominent. In their effort, the Government has issued rules pertaining to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in these markets. Restrictions have been placed on their operations, following a policy intended to provide protection to Indian platform markets. Ambitious projects are in the offing with the Government’s planned Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which has been reported by local media as an open, neutral platform whose aim is to democratize e-commerce and ensure that small retail firms (Mom-and-Pop stores) will get an equal opportunity to compete with big retail firms. The concept is similar to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a digital payments domain developed by the National Payments Corporation of India, where multiple bank accounts is combined into a single digital payment method that facilitates payment mechanisms, similar to Google pay.
In their effort to create an Indian platform market, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has issued a Suo Moto Order on the social communications app WhatsApp on the premise of possible anticompetitive abuses, from the sharing of personal data with Facebook compromising privacy and weakening control of personal data. The order issued in Case No. 01 of 2021 In Re: ‘Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Users’ is a policy order (hereafter referred to as the “order”) draws inferences to ‘abuse of dominance’ in a reversal of it’s the CCI’s earlier decisions on Vinod Gupta v WhatsApp (Case No. 99 of 2016) and Harshita Chawla v WhatsApp (Case No.15 of 2020). I do not recall such a categorical order issued by the Commission, and one in complete sync with Government policies. The order marks the beginning of non-price competition by considering a reduction in quality and data degradation as antitrust abuse. In a recent newspaper report the Minister of Electronics and Technology refers to the worldwide movement towards “splinternet” in opposition to the internet currently controlled by Big Tech companies. In referring the Cambridge Analytical scandal that involved Facebook to the High Court of Delhi, the single bench declined to interfere or comment on a subject where the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional right to a fundamental level of privacy (K. S. Puttaswamy (Retired) and Anr. v. Union of India & Ors., (2015) 8 SCC 735) leaving it up to the CCI to investigate any competition implications of the privacy policies of messaging apps.
The CCI’s order lifts the veil over two policies awaiting government approval: i) the Draft Bill on personal and non-personal data; and ii) the India Data Accessibility and Use Policy 2022 a follow up on the earlier National Data Accessibility Bill 2017 and the Right to Information Bill, 2005
Data localization is also flagged in the current debate on data and privacy as an extension of the support shown to Indian platforms. A code of ethics is on the drawing board, requiring foreign platform markets to confirm their agreement. This attempt by a sovereign power to shape platform markets is an interesting venture, similar in its approach to earlier policies such as import substitution industrialization.
   
India’s Digital Economy and Indian Platform Markets
The digitalization of business in India has been rapid and widespread. Most firms in India, large and small including local Kirana (grocery) stores, are using digital platforms and operating both offline and online.2 It is estimated that there were about 50,000 startups in 2018 as per estimates by the Ministry of Commerce.3 The proliferation of apps and the availability of cheap smartphones produced in the country are both outcomes of digital markets . Consumer surveys estimate that over 68 percent of the population is on the internet.
The dynamism of Indian business firms in the digital space raises two basic questions: i) Is there a need for government intervention? And ii) what is the best form of government intervention as a support policy for platform markets? For the CCI, concerns include access to data and the possible restraints imposed by large platforms acting as Gatekeepers. In a data-driven economy, entry barriers can be erected if access to data is restricted. Anti-competitive measures for dealing with such entry barriers are still in the offing. Meanwhile, rising competitive constraints affecting 50,000 start-ups, especially Fintech companies where data is presumably firewalled and cannot be shared as per the Reserve Bank of India directive, all pose similar questions: When and where should the CCI intervene?
Contradictory answers arise as platform markets become dominant but not necessarily abusive, and there exists a thriving data market for the sale of data as a commodity, with distinctions in competitiveness between three types of markets – i) traditional product markets; ii) platform markets; and iii) data markets. The economics of each market are quite different. Traditional markets covered in standard textbooks are wary of dominant enterprises under the terms in which the Competition Act 02 (CA02) is framed, whereas in platform markets the same binaries are inappropriate. The economics of platform markets are defined by data network effects, where access to large volumes of data facilitates innovation and expansion. These network effects weigh in favor of large or dominant platform markets, while data markets are quasi-public goods.
Data localization is an important part of India’s policy to support Indian platforms for emerging data markets. The advantage enjoyed by India lies in harnessing rich and diverse personal data with implications for health policy. In the pharma sector, for instance, we find manifestations of techno-nationalism regarding data localization, such the ‘Indian data’ a clumsy phrase that flows from the wider moral issues raised by the US FTC and EU regarding the sharing of personal data that dominates the discourse on data protection and rules. The government is also planning to release a code of ethics and a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism to control and monitor platform markets. This code would be applicable to news media, online publishers, and OTT platforms.
 
Policy Framework – Foreign Direct Investment
The Government of India’s policy towards FDI in platform markets as stated earlier focuses on creating a national platform market and, therefore, restricts platforms such as Amazon to B2B markets only, blocking the company’s famous B2C inventory-based model. The B2B markets includes certain conditions that are not applicable to the B2C inventory-based model of ecommerce. Clause 5.2.15.2.1 of India’s FDI policy implemented:

Subject to the provisions of the FDI Policy, e-commerce entities would engage only in Business to Business (B2B) e-commerce and not in Business to Consumer (B2C)
B2B e-commerce entities are not allowed to have inventory storage facilities
A 25% cap on foreign platforms for purchases from one single local vendor

These clauses on foreign investment have been in the news recently due to the negotiations between Reliance Jio, an Indian Internet platform market and Future Coupons Ltd, a large retailer in which Amazon is a major stakeholder. In order to skirt the conditions imposed on its market-based platform (B2B), Amazon invested in Future Coupons and its related companies while including a ‘non-compete’ clause. Currently, this clause is under litigation between Amazon and Future Coupons, as Reliance Jio seeks to tie up with Future Coupons to expand its platform market in retail sales. Newspapers report that Reliance Jio has taken over the retail outlets owned by Future Coupons in lieu of the latter’s prevailing debt, while Amazon has approached the arbitration courts. Another foreign market platform, Flipkart (Walmart’s B2B venture), has acquired fashion garments retailing company Myntra. Likewise, the Tata group, a large industrial conglomerate, has recently set up an e-commerce platform, ‘Tata Neu.’ Amazon’s investment in Future Coupons was cleared by CCI.
Of the 50,000 startups mentioned earlier, several are fintech firms. Online firms have their own websites and can build their own platform markets. Many of these firms may have also hitched on to major foreign platforms, which include Amazon. The choice depends on whether these startups are leaning towards one-way interaction as in websites or prefer two-way interactions with their customers that generate personal data in the process. It would be interesting to study the factors that determine this choice. These businesses nonetheless create competitive constraints on the five Big Tech companies, besides generating data on consumer preferences. We should also mention ‘Koo’, a social media intermediary similar to Twitter launched by India’s government, which is still seeing limited usage.
Against the backdrop of the Government’s goal of developing Indian platform markets we can consider the CCI’s order on data and privacy directed at WhatsApp and Facebook. A draft policy on data accessibility and usage awaits Parliamentary clearances. The CCI’s order is a forerunner to India’s approach to data privacy.
   
CCI – The Order and Issues on Data and Privacy
The CCI considered it important to seek information from Facebook and WhatsApp regarding the “potential impact” of the new Policy and Terms for WhatsApp users on a Suo Moto basis, without waiting for a complaint to be filed which is the normal procedure. Under Section 19 of Competition Act, 2003 (“CA02”) , the CCI can institute an “Inquiry into certain agreements and dominant position of enterprise” whether certain practices impact competition and constitute a Section 4(1) abuse of dominance or not.
The CCI’s choice of Section 4 ‘abuse of dominance’ of CA02 and not Section 3 – which deals with agreements that lead to ‘appreciable adverse effect on competition’ – is interesting. First, it confirms that WhatsApp is seen as dominant in social communications messaging services while Facebook is dominant in social media, echoing the subjective assessment of Vinod Gupta (Case no 99 0f 2016) of 55.6% using proxy indicators to determine that 95% of smartphone users have Android installed on their devices. The numbers were corroborated by CCI as intuitively in sync with information available from the public domain in the Over the Top (OTT)messaging apps through smartphones (Para 18-20). Second, and more significantly, the decision protects Indian platform markets from being assessed for ‘abuse of dominance’ as there can be only one dominant enterprise under Indian competition law. By way of clarification for those not familiar with procedures of CCI decisions are known as orders; Two orders are normally issued. Firstly, an initial order or prima facie order which is to the Director General to proceed with investigation if anti-competitive violation is suspected. Secondly, the final order post investigation.
 
Change in Discourse
What made CCI change its discourse in issuing a Suo Moto Prima facie order for updated terms of service and privacy policy for WhatsApp users? In earlier decisions, such as Vinod Gupta v. WhatsApp (Case no 99 of 2016) the CCI’s view was that the sharing of data by WhatsApp with Facebook falls within the economics of platform markets in generating revenue through targeted advertisements, the issue of dominance and assertion of market power was not seen as especially significant as there are several alternative messaging apps that can be downloaded freely. In the Harshita Chawla v WhatsApp (Case No, 15 of 2020) CCI opined that data sharing and data localization need not be looked at under competition law (the market was defined as the OTT platform for messaging, communications etc.)
CCI considered it important to seek information from Facebook and WhatsApp on the “potential impact” of the new Policy and Terms, and to explore new territories in the area of sharing data and privacy as exploitative and extortionary tools and as “subject matters of examination under the competition law” (Para 13) . The CCI opined that new policies and terms making it mandatory for businesses using WhatsApp to share their data with Facebook was exploitative, as it would strengthen the dominance of WhatsApp in a data-driven economy. Extortionary as actionable conduct has already taken place from a position of dominance.
  
History of Agreements
The CCI’s order refers to the third agreement issued on February 8, 2021, and not to the two earlier agreements dated August 28, 2016, and December 19, 2019. It is now mandatory for all firms using WhatsApp to accept the terms and conditions in their entirety, including the provision allowing WhatsApp to share information with Facebook. This was not the case in the earlier Agreements. Now, in return for sharing its data, WhatsApp offers users further transparency regarding how WhatsApp collects and uses personal data. The earlier option regarding the sharing of information with Facebook was withdrawn, and all WhatsApp data will now be shared with Facebook. The new terms and policies also removed the 30-day window for agreeing with the terms, included in earlier agreements.
The ‘take-it-or-leave it’ stance taken by the new agreement places consumers in an awkward position, as any social messaging app only has value for users if there is interoperability within the group. Data networks are important to communication apps as they lower the cost of supplying information and are very similar to network economies. Incremental or marginal costs for expanding the consumer base are near zero. Data networks can also create switching costs that dissuade consumers from shifting to other social communications and social media apps. This raises the question of whether communications apps be with new entrants such as Telegram or Search? Multi-homing with consumers downloading different communication apps dilutes the market power of dominant players such as WhatsApp and Facebook, but not their popularity.
One important feature of WhatsApp and Facebook is their usage on a variety of mobile operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone etc. Facebook is available on smartphones as well as PCs, while WhatsApp essentially is a smartphone app. As an Over-the-Top (OTT) messaging app, WhatsApp has the advantage of sharing data on a one-to-one basis or within a group. In addition to text messages, video clipping, photos etc. can all be shared using these services, establishing greater ease of communication. The app’s convenience ease of use are hard to replace, which has persuaded the CCI to conclude that in India “network effects have indubitably set in for WhatsApp, which undergird its position of strength and limits its substitutability with other functionally similar apps/platforms” (Para 26).
The third privacy agreement widened the scope of data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook, raising competition concerns. Privacy agreements protect WhatsApp from competition from other apps such as Signal and Telegram. Consumers get locked-in but gain from interoperability. Facebook can restrict access to only members of a group. In WhatsApp’s case, a notification on the app states that data is encrypted from end-to-end, amounting to a privacy agreement. In updating its privacy agreements with businesses, however, WhatsApp diluted the encryption of data privacy as seen in messages sent to users, asking them to permit full data-sharing with Facebook in exchange for full functionality on WhatsApp. The message sent to users contained information on:

WhatsApp’s service and how they process user data.
How businesses can use Facebook services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats.
How WhatsApp is partnered with Facebook to offer integration across Facebook’s full range of Company Products.

CCI tried to elicit the nature of the information used by businesses on WhatsApp to be shared with Facebook. The information on data was broad and vaguely related to:
“transactions and payments data; data related to battery level, signal strength, app version, mobile operator, ISP, language and time zone, device operation information, service related information and identifiers etc.; location information of the user even if the user does not use location related features besides sharing information with Facebook on how user interacts with others” (Para 24).
CCI was apprehensive with this information, as the list is indicative and not exhaustive with words like ‘includes,’ ‘such as,’ ‘For example,’ etc. This suggests that the scope of data-sharing may extend beyond the information categories that have been expressly mentioned in the policy. The CCI held that “opacity, vagueness, open-endedness, and incomplete disclosures hide the actual data cost that a user incurs for availing WhatsApp services” (Para 27).
  
Control Over Data and Privacy
The core antitrust violation being investigated is control over personal data and the dilution of privacy. Control over personal data is a fundamental constitutional right (Puttuswamy v Union of India) in India’s legal system This right entitles users of WhatsApp to have control over their personal data, including for cross-product processing of their data unless permission is granted by way of voluntary consent …… and not as a precondition for availing WhatsApp’s services. (Para 28). WhatsApp users expect their data to be secure. Sharing data with Facebook compromises said security, and when Facebook uses personal data to build personalized profiles for product development and advertisement quality is compromised too. As for businesses using WhatsApp, their discomfort with sharing data comes from the scope this would allow for WhatsApp to undercut their strategies and thus creating entry barriers, as noted in the order: “Such data concentration may itself raise competition concerns where it is perceived as a competitive advantage”. Such sharing goes beyond the legitimate expectations of consumers.
Privacy agreements mandated by WhatsApp for users are not an example of voluntary consent. The Commission has pointed to the scope granted to a dominant enterprise to compromise on the quality of data. Under competition law, degradation of data and the withdrawal of voluntary consent by allowing ‘opt out’ options is an imposition of unfair terms and conditions on users, violating Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act.
There shall be an abuse of dominant position :
(a) Directly or indirectly, imposes unfair or discriminatory –
i) condition in purchase or sale of goods or services; 
Likewise, the CCI’s views hold that degradation of quality is an abuse of non-price competition. To quote:
“On a careful and thoughtful consideration of the matter, the conduct of WhatsApp in sharing of users’ personalized data with other Facebook Companies, in a manner that is neither fully transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent, appears prima facie unfair to users.”
 
Issues to Ponder
Government policy to support Indian platform markets raises two basic questions: i) is there a need for Government policy intervention? And ii) What form of Government intervention is best as a support policy for platform markets? The burst of platform markets on digital spaces, with 50,000 startups including Fintech companies and industrial conglomerates such as Reliance Jio or Tata Neu provides no insights on the efficacy of protectionist government policies. Neither has the popularity of Amazon waned despite restrictions placed on foreign investment in the B2B marketplace. Consumer preferences for WhatsApp and Facebook have not diminished with the availability of cheaper smartphones. The presence of competitive constraints has seen WhatsApp woo consumers first with soft agreements, then shifting to harsher versions of ‘take-it-or leave it.’ Google is exploring ways of enabling greater privacy and control over personal data. Maintaining their lead is a challenge for the Big Tech companies, just as much as it is for regulator interventions.
CCI has raised concerns over data and dominance erecting entry barriers and degrading the quality of data. There is no indication, however, on how data privacy should be controlled, or on voluntary mechanisms of control. The arguments in the order are hypothetical, based on assumptions rather than on evidence, as can be seen in the use of terms such as ‘unreasonable collection of data,’ and ‘expansive and disproportionate.’ It suggests that feasible regulatory mechanisms are still nowhere near a workable design.
Under these circumstances it may be appropriate to let consumers and market forces take the initiative. Businesses who are open to sharing their data in order to receive the full functionality of WhatsApp by signing privacy agreements may represent a least-cost approach for the use of social messaging and communications apps with routine business information as the CCI order indicates. The suggestion made by the FTC’s Chairperson and by EU authorities in setting limits to collection of data shifts the debate to the design of algorithms and whether the algorithms can be designed with judgement on good data and bad data. The question of what good data is varies with socio-economic differences, income differences, cultural values, and more. Regulatory intervention over the scope and scale or even oversight of data privacy is restricted when translating normative value into positive action policies. While regulatory oversight is imminent, its implementation and monitoring may have to lean heavily on self-regulation.
The order is also silent on data accessed by Indian platform markets. How is the data stored? Is data localization a viable proposition; is data affected by where it is stored? Who controls the data? Is the firewalling of data used by Fintech companies ordered by the RBI feasible? Enquiries and debates on Indian platform markets or on Amazon open unexplored areas in data privacy. For the regulatory authorities in India, the emerging challenges are in the design of nuanced and selective regulatory approaches, not just for platform markets but for emergent data markets. Data investigations and privacy require research, and hopefully the probe ordered by CCI will fill some of the gaps with empirical evidence to help establish dominance; to prove the appearance of entry barriers.

By Jon Swartz, MarketWatch
Nearly three years ago, when the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission launched probes into the business practices of Big Tech, antitrust experts and legal talking heads declared a new age in enforcement and a chastening of unbridled financial power.
But a pandemic and countless bill markups later — amid feverish lobbying efforts by Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook parent company Meta — there is still no significant US law and a real possibility there will be none for several years.
With a midterm election looming in the fall, and both houses of Congress about to take an extended recess in August, the prospect of antitrust legislation is dimming. Policy experts deem the next three months a “jump ball” moment with the real possibility that if bills don’t become laws by Labor Day, nothing will happen until a new administration in 2025, cautions one tech policy expert.
“It could be years before the stars align again to do something impactful,” Paul Gallant, tech policy analyst at Cowen, told MarketWatch. “The summer of 2022 has always been the do-or-die period.”

London Mayor Sadiq Khan is meeting with Silicon Valley technology leaders as part of a trade mission and U.S. tour to boost London’s tourism and technology industries.
He will be joined on his San Francisco area visit by 11 London-based founders of women-led tech firms eyeing investment and expansion opportunities in the U.S., according to a press release on Tuesday (May 10).
Khan will speak with the heads of Google, LinkedIn and others and will visit the Silicon Valley headquarters of global innovation platform Plug and Play, which is opening its first U.K. offices in both London and Warwickshire.
Facebook, Google, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Snap and Stripe are all expanding their office space and workforce in London, per the release.
The visit comes as new research commissioned by London & Partners — a company that promotes the City of London — showed that record global investments for London tech companies came from the U.S. over the past five years.
London and the Bay Area were the top two hubs for FinTech, the study showed, receiving more capital than all other global cities, including New York and Singapore.
From 2017 to 2021, London attracted 251 new tech investment projects from the U.S., creating almost 9,000 new jobs. Singapore had 154 tech projects, Bangalore had 121, Dublin had 121, and Paris had 115 tech projects.

624,"May 11, 2022",UK Competition Watchdog Names New Chair,"


The two-year search for a new chair of the Competition and Markets Authority will end later this month with the expected appointment of Clive Bannister, allowing the focus to switch to finding a successor for the UK competition watchdog’s outgoing chief executive Andrea Coscelli. 
The government is set to announce Bannister, the former chief executive at insurance firm Phoenix Group, as the replacement to Andrew Tyrie, who was ousted in 2020 after a boardroom coup, according to several individuals with knowledge of the process. 
The protracted search for a new chair has led to further disruption at the top of the regulator by hampering the process to replace Coscelli, who announced at the start of the year that he would step down in July. As a result, the government has opted to appoint an interim chief executive with Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s general counsel, the leading candidate, according to these people. 
Officials are keen for the chief executive’s role to be filled by a woman, and while the new chair will have a key role in the search, Cardell has strong internal backing to take the role permanently, according to the same people. The government is not expected to start the official search for a permanent chief executive until after the summer, however. 
The lack of orderly succession planning at the CMA comes at a crucial time as its expands its role in the wake of Brexit and the world’s leading competition watchdogs seek to rein in big technology companies like Facebook and Google. 
But there are other potential candidates and those with knowledge of the process warned that Cardell’s appointment was not certain given that the final decision rests with business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.

625,"May 11, 2022","No-Poach Agreements: Purchasing Power Type, Explicit v. Tacit Collusion, and Lessons From Sellers’ Cartels","
From near obscurity just over a decade ago, no-poach agreements are now in the crosshairs of several competition authorities worldwide, including the U.S. and EU.  No-poach agreements are a type of buyers’ cartel where employers explicitly collude to increase their purchasing power over their employees. They are the mirror image of market allocation of customers by sellers. This short article makes three observations in relation to no-poach agreements. First, depending on market structure, purchasing power can be monopsony or bargaining power. It appears that no-poach agreements could be either and that this is worth some consideration when prioritizing enforcement. Second, no-poach agreements are a form of explicit collusion which recent increased enforcement should deter, but strong enforcement may also have increased the risk of tacit collusion. At the same time however, if the prevalence and enforceability of non-compete clauses in employment contracts decreases, employer incentives to collude explicitly may increase. Finally, given competition authorities’ significant experience of sellers’ cartels, there are interesting lessons to learn from them for the enforcement of buyers’ cartels (including no-poach agreements). The article highlights this potential with two examples.

626,"May 9, 2022",Tech Giants Move Into eGrocery Sales,"


Online grocery is no longer just the purview of brick-and-mortar incumbents and emerging eCommerce startups. Major technology companies are also making moves into the space.
Apple, for one, is said to be looking into launching its own grocery delivery ordering service to rival Instacart, although Apple’s service would have more of a focus on nutrition, according to an Apple Insider report Sunday (May 8).
Apple is not the only major technology company looking to establish itself in this growing sector. The market for grocery delivery can be a valuable category for any company looking to embed its offerings deeper into consumers’ daily routines. After all, people need food every day, and many purchase groceries several times a week, ensuring regular engagement. As such, the category is proving to be a battleground for many players.
Google, for its part, has also been integrating its offerings into the grocery shopping experience. For instance, it is integrating grocery purchasing and order-tracking features into its navigation app. Additionally, in March 2021, the company announced a partnership with Albertsons Companies to integrate its cloud technologies into the grocer’s digital platforms.
Amazon, another member of the Big Tech club, has been changing its policies over the past few years in an attempt to capture the growing number of consumers who have apparently ditched physical supermarkets and prefer to make their grocery shopping online through its Whole Foods division.
Amazon’s foray into groceries has already caught the attention of regulators, with the UK competition regulator saying back in February that Amazon is now officially considered a grocery retailer. Amazon has rapidly expanded its UK grocery presence in recent years and has now opened eight physical stores, as well as its growing eGrocery services.

“This debate is no longer a hot topic amongst competition practitioners but it has strong political attention,” she told a conference organised by the German Cartel Office.
Vestager urged antitrust watchdogs around the world to work together to tackle the issue.
“Close cooperation will be necessary because we will not be short of work and we will not be short of novel services or practices to look at,” she said.
“It goes without saying that the more we, as an international competition community, are able to harmonise our approach, the less opportunity there will be for global tech giants to exploit enforcement gaps between our jurisdictions,” Vestager said.
U.S. antitrust enforcers and some U.S. states are also investigating Google, Facebook and Apple. Big Tech is also under fire in South Korea, India and Australia.

628,"May 3, 2022",UK Ministers No Longer Wish To Empower Tech Regulator,"


The UK is poised to shelve plans to empower a new technology regulator, in a blow to global efforts to curb the dominance of internet companies, including Google and Facebook. 
The government’s new legislative programme is not expected to include a bill to provide statutory underpinning to the digital markets unit that is based within the Competition and Markets Authority, said people briefed on the situation. 
Without the legislation the UK tech regulator will not be able to set rules for leading internet companies and impose fines on them for breaking those rules. The government announced plans to set up the digital markets unit in 2020 and said it would be given powers to devise codes of conduct for tech companies and fine those that did not comply up to 10 percent of annual turnover. 
The unit was established in ‘shadow form’ last year and is operating with around 60 staff, but has no powers beyond the Competition and Market Authority’s existing capabilities. The Queen’s Speech due on May 10, which will outline the government’s legislative programme for the coming year, is not expected to include a bill that would provide the unit with statutory powers.

629,"May 3, 2022",Crowdfund Founded Efforts To Push Antitrust Bills Vote Start Up,"


The digital rights group Fight for the Future is launching a crowdfund campaign to press Senate leadership to bring two antitrust bills targeting tech giants to a floor vote.
“Democrats control the House, the Senate, and the White House,” Evan Greer, the group’s director, told The Hill Tuesday.
“They have a once in a lifetime opportunity to advance overwhelmingly popular bipartisan legislation that would finally crack down on Big Tech monopoly power and abuses,” she continued. “If they fail, they will have no one but themselves to blame, and the American people will not forget.”
The group is raising money to run an ad encouraging Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring the bills forward in New York.
The two pieces of legislation — the American Innovation and Choice Online (AICO) Act and the Open App Markets Act — were both advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee on bipartisan votes earlier this year, albeit with reservations from some backers.
The AICO Act would block dominant online companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook’s parent company Meta from preferring their products and discriminating against rivals on their platforms, while the Open App Markets Act is targeted at reducing the gatekeeping power of Apple and Google over smartphone app markets.
The AICO Act has recently picked up high-profile endorsements from the Justice Department and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

By Evan Greer, Vice
Washington is on the verge of doing something big: finally passing meaningful legislation to rein in the monopoly power and abusive practices of Big Tech giants. 
Feeling the heat, Silicon Valley’s lobbyists have sunk to a new low: using the safety of trans and queer people as a wedge issue to undermine tech reform bills that would help, not harm, the LGBTQ+ community. My community.  
Earlier this month, the Chamber of Progress—an organization that lobbies on behalf of Big Tech and is run by Google’s former head of policy, called on Sen. Klobuchar and Rep. Cicilline to throw cold water on their own bipartisan antitrust bills: The American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act. 
The Chamber opportunistically seized on false claims made by Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) and Fox News host Laura Ingraham that antitrust reform is a way to “stop woke companies’ from standing up for LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter to Klobuchar and Cicilline, the lobbyists encouraged the lawmakers to denounce Buck’s claims. “If antitrust is used to punish companies for speaking up on social justice issues, the result could be a chilling effect on corporate leadership against hate and bigotry,” the tech lobbyists wrote.

631,"May 2, 2022",Report Claims 95% Of American Companies Not GDPR Compliant,"


The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was established to ensure companies are accountable for the data they are handling, managing and storing. This includes keeping data well secured and protected, as well as ensuring the data is not used for reasons that customers are not aware of.
Related: GDPR On The Rise As EU Officials Crack Down
Since its inception in 2018, the GDPR has fined numerous companies that have not taken their data usage and protection seriously. The biggest GDPR fine recorded was a penalty to Amazon in July 2021. The big tech giant was fined a penalty of 746 million euros for not handling its customer data properly. In fact, the top three largest fines for mishandling customer data have been meted out to American companies, with Meta-owned WhatsAppand Alphabet’s Google in second and third place, respectively, after Amazon.
While the GDPR has been touted as the strictest data privacy regulation in the world, many companies are ensuring they oblige with it to not only avoid the hefty fines but also be able to operate in Europe. Globally, data privacy regulations set by other countries are now also echoing some of the regulations made by the GDPR.
In the US, data compliance is also a priority with bodies like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ensuring regulations are met. However, a recent report by CYTRIO has resulted in some concerns about the compliance of most companies in the US when it comes to regulations.
As of March 31, 2022, findings from CYTRIO’s data privacy research uncovered that 90% of companies are not fully compliant with CCPA and CPRA Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) requirements. Further, 95% of companies are using error-prone and time-consuming manual processes for GDPR DSAR requirements.
According to Vijay Basani, founder and CEO of CYTRIO, the research confirms that first-generation privacy rights management solutions have not gained wide adoption due to cost and deployment complexity, resulting in a high percentage of CCPA non-compliance.
“This problem will become more pronounced as CPRA enforcement takes effect in 2023 with the stringent 12-month lookback. Awareness of their data privacy rights by consumers coupled with the rise of data aggregators is driving an increased number of data requests. As the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) begins active enforcement of CCPA and CPRA, non-compliance to DSAR requests will become cost-prohibitive for both medium- and large-sized companies,” added Basani.

632,"April 28, 2022",Brussels May Soon Accuse Tech Giant Of Blocking Others Out Of Apple Pay,"


Apple is set to face fresh antitrust charges in Brussels next week over the way it restricts rivals from accessing its mobile payment system, as the EU sets up its latest challenge to the market power of the world’s most valuable company. 
The tech giant will be accused of breaking EU law in the way it operates Apple Pay, a payments system that operates on hundreds of millions of iPhone devices, according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. The $2.5tn company would receive heavy fines worth up to 10 percent of global turnover if the charges are upheld. 
Investigators, led by the bloc’s powerful competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, will accuse Apple of unfairly blocking groups such as PayPal and leading banks from accessing its mobile wallet system. 
The move signals how the EU has become the centre of a global regulatory crackdown against Big Tech, with groups such as Google and Facebook having regularly been in the crosshairs of antitrust authorities in recent years. 
The case, which was opened in 2020, is one of many investigations opened in Brussels against Apple, which had not faced antitrust charges from the EU before last year. In two other cases, investigators are probing whether Apple is harming competition in the books and music streaming services within its App Store. 
The charges expected to be announced next week relate to the NFC — or “near field communication” — technology that allows a user to pay by tapping their iPhone on a payments terminal. That personal device is linked to debit or credit cards through a mobile wallet.

633,"April 28, 2022",Amazon Refuses To Describe Its Search To Australian Watchdog,"


Amazon has declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator that has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.
The company’s withholding of the information sets the scene for a possible repeat of Australia’s 2021 showdown with Facebook and Alphabet’s Google, which resulted in those firms paying content royalties to the media.
The regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), mentioned Amazon’s stance in a report issued on Thursday that was part of the same five-year review of big-tech regulation that involved Facebook and Google.
The ACCC said in the report that it had surveyed 80 online merchants and that nearly half believed large marketplace platforms skewed searches and website presentation to favour in-house products.
Amazon had told the regulator it did not give an advantage to its own products but “the ACCC sought details about inputs of Amazon’s algorithms, which were not provided”, the report said.
As a result, “the ACCC does not have information about how Amazon’s algorithms produce search results”, the report said.
Amazon Australia director of public policy Michael Cooley said in a statement that the company’s offers were “the ones we think customers will prefer, regardless of whether it is from Amazon or one of our seller partners”.
“We provide data directly to Seller Partners to help them manage their businesses, and give key insights,” he added, without specifying which data the company provided.
Questionnaire results published with the report included several comments accusing Amazon of giving preference to its own products. One unnamed respondent wrote: “Amazon products are always listed first and then second-hand products are available in small print at the bottom of the listing”.
The ACCC noted that, unlike other large online retail markets, such as those of the United States and Britain, Australia’s was not dominated by Amazon. The company did not start operations in the country until 2017.

The Commerce Department backed a key legislative proposal aimed at forcing tech giants such as Facebook and Google to compete against smaller businesses, agency secretary Gina Raimondo said Wednesday, in an announcement that throws the full weight of the Biden administration behind the bill. 
Testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee, Raimondo applauded efforts by Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. David Cicilline to champion the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA), a bill that would prohibit tech platforms from unfairly favoring their own proprietary services on their platforms over those of competing businesses. 
“[I] clearly agree that we need to improve competition, which increases innovation,” Raimondo said. “Last month, the [Justice Department] released a views letter on behalf of the administration in support of the [AICOA] and the department and I certainly support that and concur with the aim of the legislation and the views expressed in that views letter.”
Last month’s DOJ letter said the agency “views the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition,” adding that letting those platforms “pick winners and losers” with their outsized power “puts at risk the nation’s economic progress and prosperity, ultimately threatening the economic liberty that undergirds our democracy.”
DOJ antitrust officials are currently suing Google for allegedly abusing its dominance in the search and search advertising markets. At the time of the letter, policy analysts said the DOJ note increases the odds of the AICOA passing.

635,"April 26, 2022",Television Affiliates Ask FCC To Regulate Big Tech,"


Representatives from ABC Television Affiliates Association, the CBS Television Network Affiliates Association, the FBC Television Association and the NBC Television Affiliates (The Four Affiliates Associations) sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 21, claiming that digital platforms do not fairly compensate broadcasters and urging the regulator to modify existing rules to impose stricter requirements on Big Tech.
According to representatives of the Four Affiliates Associations, local stations are Americans’ most trusted source for accurate, factual, unbiased news and emergency information. Even as shifts in the video programming ecosystem have challenged local broadcasters, their service to the public continues unabated. They emphasized that market shifts in the last seven years have jeopardized both advertising and subscription fees, which broadcasters rely on to produce local news, emergency information, and other locally-focused programming. The Four Affiliates Associations discussed the increasing dominance of Big Tech corporations such as Google, Facebook and Amazon in the advertising sector, as well as the accompanying declines in ad revenues available to local broadcasters.  
According to the broadcasters, Big Tech companies should “compensate local broadcasters fairly for the distribution of the broadcasters’ valuable news content on their platforms.” This is not the only initiative that broadcasters have taken to get fair compensation — they are also advocating on that issue before Congress, but with limited results so far.
Big Tech companies have been under increasing pressure around the world to compensate newspapers and broadcasters for their content. For instance, Canada has recently proposed legislation that would require platforms such as Facebook and Google to contract with news publishers and compensate them for utilizing their content. Canadian publishers have long pressed the government for such a move, alleging that advertising money, which was once their lifeblood, has disproportionately gone to foreign digital behemoths.  
Canada joined other countries, such as Australia, France, and Spain, in requiring Big Tech to negotiate with news publishers and pay for their material. Australia passed a law that operates in case negotiations between the tech giants and media companies fails. The legislation establishes an arbitration system that may make binding rulings on the prices Google and Facebook must pay news publishers for content hosted on their platforms. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, may shortly follow suit.  
The associations also discussed with the FCC the lack of regulatory parity between broadcasters and Big Tech companies, citing as an example the unequal playing field that exists between them in terms of political advertising, which is a particularly pressing issue in the current media environment. Broadcasters are subject to several political advertising restrictions, including disclosure requirements and online public inspection file record-keeping duties, according to the representatives. In contrast, IT platforms are not compelled to abide by the Commission’s political advertising guidelines, which are intended to ensure transparency and accountability. “As a result, despite capturing billions of dollars in political advertising each election cycle, Big Tech and other digital platforms are not constrained by the norms designed to defend the safety and integrity of our electoral process,” said the associations in the letter.

 A new Japanese antitrust report into the smartphone market has raised the possibility of new legislation intended to reduce the dominance of Apple and Google. It calls for multiple app stores for each platform.
Additionally, it suggests that the pre-installation of Apple and Google’s own web browsers on smartphones means that competitor apps are disadvantaged, reported Kyodo News.
In the interim report released following discussions about digital market competition, the government sees the Google and Apple internet browsing apps being pre-installed in smartphones as a problem.
The report proposed the introduction of rules to prohibit acts that prevent users making decisions and choices, as such practice could eliminate the room for competition.
The government also expressed concern over application developers paying a high fee to Apple as they can only distribute their products through the company’s store and called for allowing OS providers to allow users to select the app store of their choice.
Apple has lodged a protest following the release of a Japanese government report that indicated the possibility of regulations being introduced to ensure fair competition in the smartphone operating system market, which has been dominated by two major U.S. tech firms.

US President Biden looks to restore net neutrality and has met with significant delays because his nominees for top posts have struggled to gain Senate confirmations.
The shortage of key personnel at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prevented Democrats from having a majority at both agencies and stopped them from moving forward with their ambitious antitrust, broadband, and net neutrality goals, reported The Washington Examiner. 
Read More: FTC & FCC Nominees On Tough Road To Senate Confirmation
FCC nominee Gigi Sohn, a prominent liberal activist and a former Democratic staffer at the commission, was nominated six months ago, and FTC nominee Alvaro Bedoya, a Georgetown University law professor and prominent privacy advocate, was nominated eight months ago. Both nominations have taken significantly longer to get confirmed compared to those nominated under previous administrations.
Their nominations have remained in limbo due to limited Senate floor time. The upper chamber has been preoccupied recently with the Ukraine invasion and Supreme Court nominees, on top of the difficulties created by the Democrats’ razor-thin majority in the Senate.
Allies say the delay in confirming them hurts the Biden administration’s agenda while temporarily allowing the broadband industry and Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google off the hook for bad behavior because the FTC and FCC are gridlocked.
“Rules related to bringing back net neutrality and regulating the Big Tech companies will take time to implement, and this delays those goals from being achieved,” said Greg Guice, head of government affairs at open internet advocacy group Public Knowledge.
“At some point, these folks will get confirmed and the agency work will continue, and the opposed industries will have bought a little time and not much else. It’s so frustrating,” said Guice, who has pushed to get FCC and FTC nominees confirmed since 1999.

Apple, Amazon and Meta spent record sums on federal lobbying through the first three months of the year as they fought bipartisan antitrust legislation, according to documents filed with Congress Wednesday night.
Apple spent more than $2.5 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 71 percent from the same period last year. Meta spent nearly $5.4 million, up 13 percent from last year’s first quarter. Amazon shelled out nearly $5 million, a 4 percent increase.
The rise comes as the big four tech firms attempt to derail the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bill to prevent dominant digital platforms from favoring their own services and empower antitrust officials to more aggressively investigate tech giants.
Tech giants, along with tech-backed lobbying groups and former national security officials, have increasingly cited China and Russia in their effort to defeat the bill, claiming that the measure would strengthen U.S. adversaries by weakening the nation’s tech giants.
Apple and Google are leading the charge against the Open App Markets Act, which would block app stores from favoring their own apps in searches, requiring developers to use their payment systems and blocking users from using third-party app stores.  
Apple CEO Tim Cook has personally lobbied lawmakers to drop the latter measure and warned last week that it would “undermine privacy and security” of Apple users.
Google, whose CEO has also pushed back on the bill, spent nearly $3 million on lobbying in the first quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year but down from previous years.

Data sits at the center of our digital economy and does not conform to regulatory or geographical boundaries. It is clear further understanding and collaboration by authorities across privacy, consumer protection and competition regulatory spheres is needed to achieve optimal regulatory outcomes. The Digital Citizen and Consumer Working Group (“DCCWG”) is focused on considering the intersections of, and promoting regulatory co‐operation between, the privacy, consumer protection and competition (also referred to as antitrust) regulatory spheres. In doing this, the DCCWG seeks to support “a global regulatory environment with clear and consistently high standards of data protection, as digitalisation continues at pace.” This article explores some of the key learnings of the DCCWG over the past 5 years. Ultimately, the DCCWG view is that collaboration between competition agencies and privacy agencies is becoming an imperative for any jurisdiction that seeks to achieve cohesive digital regulation.

640,"April 21, 2022",The Right to Privacy and Personal Data: Some Considerations for Optimal Protection,"
The protection of privacy and personal data is a must for maintaining democracies and avoiding authoritarianism led by extreme surveillance. For the optimal protection of both rights, it is necessary to promote regulatory compliance, ethics, self-regulation, the strengthening of regulations, and of public bodies and institutions.

By Blanca Lilia Ibarra Cadena[1]
  
I. INTRODUCTION
Privacy is the key to the most intimate details of our lives. We do not want to disclose certain information without our consent. In turn, privacy entails the protection of personal data. Safeguarding both rights is a must for maintaining liberal democracies and avoiding authoritarianism led by extreme surveillance from both private and public corporations.[2]
Personal data has acquired a high value in the current economic system. Such value “is not based on the data but rather on its management, use, and relationship to other data.”[3] This situation has caused large and medium-sized technology companies to profit from the overuse of personal data to predict users’ behavioral patterns.[4]
There has been a broad discussion about social media, disruptive technologies, and the ongoing surveillance we all experience. I would first like to state a clear stance: I am not against technology and innovation; on the contrary, I am in favor of progress. I am aware that technological advances form a key part of the development and progress in areas as critical as medicine and personal saf...

641,"April 21, 2022",Facebook v. Bundeskartellamt – May European Competition Agencies Apply the GDPR?,"
The relationship between privacy and competition law is complex and contentious. May or should competition agencies consider business conduct’s negative impact on privacy when this effect was the consequence of a restriction or absence of competition? This contribution critically assesses the issues at stake in Case C-252/21 Facebook Inc. and Others v. Bundeskartellamt. It argues that competition agencies should be allowed to consider the legality of business conduct under the GDPR when applying competition law. In the age of data-based business models, it is unhelpful to look at competition and privacy issues in isolation. Judicious regulation of digital platforms requires an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional approach.

By Anne C. Witt[1]
 
I. INTRODUCTION
Privacy and competition law have long been considered separate areas of law, guided by different objectives and enforced by different agencies. Competition law aims to protect competition, and privacy law aims to protect the personal information of individuals. In the age of data-driven business models, however, where consumers receive free services in exchange for their data, the dividing lines have become blurred. If a digital platform restricts competition by foreclosing competitors or acquiring a competitive threat, and is consequently able to degrade its privacy standards, is this a relevant form of harm within the meaning of competition law? If a dominant platform uses its near monopoly position to...

642,"April 21, 2022",Can the FTC Promulgate Effective Privacy Rules?,"
In the absence of federal privacy legislation, the FTC is widely expected to commence a rulemaking to “curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” This paper addresses some of the reasons why FTC rulemaking is a poor substitute for federal legislation and an inefficient allocation of limited agency resources. While the FTC has considerable power to craft rules banning unfair or deceptive practices, Magnuson-Moss rulemaking is slow and resource-intensive, may not produce enforceable final rules, and does not necessarily preempt inconsistent state law. Plus, the limits of FTC’s unfairness authority do not always square well with privacy. Competition rulemaking, meanwhile, would be a terrible strategic blunder for the FTC and should be avoided. The FTC should instead focus its efforts on the most egregious practices that plainly fit within the statutory rubric of unfairness.

When the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) announced in December that it is considering commencing a “commercial surveillance” rulemaking to “curb lax security practices, limit privacy abuses, and ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination,”[2] privacy advocates appeared to have cause for celebration.

643,"April 20, 2022",The Anticompetitive Stickiness of Default Applications: Addressing Consumer Inertia with Randomization,"


By Omar Vásquez Duque (Stanford University)
Preinstalled applications are pervasive in both computers and mobile devices. Recent antitrust cases in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized the defaults’ potential to foreclose competing applications. So far, enforcers and analysts have tended to assume that default (or stickiness) effects exist, and that forced choice strategies are the best way to overcome the users’ inertia and consequently level the field among competitors.
This article uses experimental methods to test the stickiness hypothesis and the effectiveness of potential remedies. With a series of experiments ran on Amazon Mechanical Turk, this work evaluates whether current market shares reflect what consumer would choose if they were forced to choose; or whether default effects exist and why. Due to the difficulty of resembling the choice environment in which people use a search engine, this study focused on the desktop segment of the market, but the participants completed the task from both desktop and mobile devices.
When facing a task for which a search engine must be used, most of the experiment participants choose Google, and the preference for Google resembled current market shares. Nonetheless, the participants who were assigned to the Yahoo or Bing by default conditions tended to give these alternatives a try before switching to Google. My data suggest the consumers’ misperceptions about Google alternatives’ quality is an important obstacle to their market penetration. This effect is clear for Bing and not for Yahoo. Despite both having the same search algorithm only Bing benefited from a substantial increase in its perceived quality after experimenting with it. This may imply that only defaults that users regard as a high-quality option may stick in the long term. The preceding findings suggest that the main anticompetitive effect of Google’s strategy is to prevent users from exploring competing search engines that they do not already believe to be good enough. Thus, effects of choice screens are limited by the consumers’ lack of information about their alternatives.

The final text for the Digital Markets Act contains some unexpected last-minute changes, reported EURACTIV.
The EU co-legislators reached an agreement on the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on 24 March. Since then, stakeholders have been trying to get hold of the final text, fine-tuned in the utmost secrecy until it was finally circulated last week.
The text will likely be presented to the Council’s competition working party on 28 April and approved by the EU ambassadors at the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) on 4 May.
The text’s preamble was changed to clarify the meaning of the legal obligations and make a legal challenge more difficult.The text now clearly states that the DMA is intended to ensure the contestability of all online services. A general explanation of contestability and fairness has also been added.Related: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – An Ex Ante Landmark
The document states that users should be able to uninstall any apps that are not essential to the functioning of the operating system or device.
On sideloading, new wording has been added to ensure that third-party apps and app stores can ask users to become their default setting. The Council’s language on allowing gatekeepers to apply ‘duly justified’ security requirements to the third-party apps has been added.
An entirely new requirement prevents gatekeepers from using personal data from users that are using the service provided by a third party when that third-party service is using the gatekeeper’s platform.
The preamble explains that this measure is meant to prevent Google and Facebook from tracking users who have denied their consent when they visit websites that are part of their ad networks. The regulation only allows requesting consent to process personal data once per year.
Advertisers will be able to access both aggregated and non-aggregated data for the ads they run. The data must be provided so advertisers can analyse it with their tools.
The DMA is expected to be adopted next month, meaning it will enter into force in October 2022. Following that, it will take six months to apply, taking up to April 2023. The designation process will start, which might take up to the end of summer 2023. From there, the regulatory dialogue would formally start. Finally, the compliance process will begin around the first quarter of 2024.

It’s unclear exactly how much expense the rule changes add for the typical customer, though.

Apple CEO Tim Cook warned in a speech at a Washington, DC, conference on Tuesday that antitrust legislation aimed at lessening the monopoly power of app stores could harm users, The Hill reported.
“We are deeply concerned about regulations that would undermine privacy and security in service of some other aim,” Cook said at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit.
“Here in Washington and elsewhere, policy makers are taking steps in the name of competition that would force Apple to let apps on the iPhone that circumvent the App Store through a process called ‘sideloading,’” he continued.
Apple has pushed back against letting iPhone users download products from third parties, or sideloading, in white papers and letters to Congress.
The company warns that doing so would open up users to spyware or malware infections.
“[Sideloading] means data hungry companies would be able to avoid our privacy rules and once again track our users against their will,” Cook said Tuesday. “It would also potentially give bad actors away around the comprehensive security protections we put in place, putting them in direct contact with our users.”
Proponents of legislation to force Apple to allow sideloading both in Washington and Europe argue that the company’s tight control over the App Store gives it a stranglehold over developers that it can exploit to charge exorbitant fees.
The bipartisan Open App Markets Act would enshrine the right to sideload and block Apple as well as Google from requiring developers to use their payment tools, helping make it easier for developers to distribute their apps and connect with their customers. The bill was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year but has yet to get a vote on the floor.
“Apple believes in competition,” Cook noted. “But if we are forced to lead unvetted apps on the iPhone, the unintended consequences will be profound.”

647,"April 12, 2022","The Decline, Fall, and Renewal of U.S. Leadership in Antitrust Law and Policy","
The United States has lost its world leadership in antitrust, evidenced by its narrow conception of market power and its abuse.  This essay pinpoints exactly where the U.S. has fallen behind and suggests how it can regain footing, this time not as hegemon but sharing the reins with sister jurisdictions.

By Eleanor M. Fox[1]
 
I. Introduction
The United States was the pioneer in antitrust law. By and through the 1960s and most of the 1970s, it developed a law that was harsh on price-fixing, harsh on powerful firms’ exclusionary practices, and harsh on mergers that consolidated power. It was admired world over as the leader in competition law and policy.
Post-World War II, U.S. antitrust was exported to Germany and Japan as the economic law of democracy. In the late 1950s, to anchor peace in Europe, six European nations formed the European Economic Community (later to grow to 28 nations and then to contract to 27), drawing from the U.S. Sherman Act as well as from the German law against restraints.
Over the next many years, scores of nations adopted competition law, taking lessons from both the U.S. and the EU. But by early in the new millennium, the bloom was off the U.S. anti-monopoly rose.
U.S. monopoly law shrank in its reach while public concerns about monopolies grew. People came to fear that very big business – epitomized by Big Tech – was taking control of their lives; that the market system works for the elites, not for “the people”; that the...

648,"April 11, 2022",The Italian Competition Authority’s Decision in the Amazon Logistics Case: Self-preferencing and Beyond,"

By Claudio Lombardi1
  
 Introduction
In a long-awaited decision, the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) has found Amazon in breach of Article 102 TFEU. The ICA has defined the anticompetitive conduct in question as ‘self-preferencing’,2 although this term may not fully or adequately explain Amazon’s actions.
The case concerns a series of exclusive and irreplicable benefits accorded to vendors subscribing to ‘Fulfillment by Amazon’ (FBA), with which Amazon aimed at gaining a dominant position in the Italian market for logistics services at the expense of other efficient competitors, consumers, and competition as a whole.To determine whether this conduct infringed Art. 102 TFEU, the ICA has followed the standard method of defining the relevant market before establishing dominance and its abuse.  This article unpacks the ICA’s decision and considers its contribution to the development of competition law in this sector.  In particular, the article considers some of the differences between this decision and the Google case regarding the definition of self-preferencing practices, claiming that this definition might be inadequate to fully describe Amazon’s conduct and the ICA’s decision. Finally, the article discusses some of the drawbacks and limitations of the ICA’s decision.
 
II. The facts of the case: a primer
Amazon’s website operates two sales channels simultaneously. On the one hand, it sells goods that it owns directly. On the other hand, it operates as a platform where third-party vendors can sell their goods (i.e. the Amazon Marketplace,  ‘AM’), similar to other e-commerce platforms such as eBay.
The conduct at issue concerns the relationship between Amazon.it, third-party sellers, and the logistics service providers operating on the AM. Currently, a third-party seller active on Amazon can manage the logistics of its products in two ways. It can independently operate the storage, logistics, and delivery; or outsource it to an independent operator. This operator can be Amazon itself, or another firm. If the seller decides to use Amazon’s logistics network (ALN), they are requested to purchase a service called ‘Fulfilled by Amazon’ (FBA). If they entrust an independent logistics firm instead, Amazon defines the operation as a ‘Merchant Fulfilment Network’ (MFN).
FBA is an integrated logistics service that includes: (i) warehousing and inventory management for retailers at Amazon’s distribution centres; (ii) fulfilment of orders received on Amazon.it, including packaging and labelling; (iii) shipping, transportation, and delivery; (iv) returns management; and (v) customer service.
Amazon’s warehousing and shipping rates have increased considerably in recent years. Despite this, most third-party sellers use the FBA services as, on the whole, it is preferable to switching to an independent logistics service provider because of the unique advantages FBA gives on the Amazon Marketplace.
The hypothesis that the ICA sought to verify in this case was whether these benefits were designed, or were anyway sufficient to allow Amazon to leverage its dominant power in the e-commerce sector to monopolize the market for e-commerce logistics to the detriment of competition in the industry.

III. The relevant markets
According to the ICA, the conduct mainly concerned two markets:

the market for intermediation services on e-commerce platforms; and
the market for logistics services for e-commerce. 

i. The market for intermediation services on e-commerce platforms.
Brokerage services on e-commerce platforms (marketplaces) are provided by the owner and operator of the platform to third-party vendors selling their products on the platform. Considering Amazon to be a two-sided transaction platform, the ICA defined the relevant market on each side of the platform using a multi-market approach.3
According to the ICA, the market for the supply of intermediation services on e-marketplaces is characterised by the absence of demand-side substitutability with other retail channels. Brick and mortar sales, sales through proprietary websites, and price comparison services are complementary to e-commerce sales rather than substitutes. As the authority argues, for both consumers and sellers, these are “substantially different sales channels, complementary and not alternative to each other” (Page 142). Thus, e-commerce transaction platforms were considered to be an independent relevant market. The ICA included all e-commerce marketplaces in this category, both hybrid (such as Amazon itself, selling proprietary products and third-party products simultaneously) and traditional e-commerce platforms selling only third-party products (such as Ebay).
Based on this market definition, the ICA concluded that Amazon occupied a position of super-dominance in the Italian e-commerce market. All market indicators showed that Amazon had increased its market shares in the e-commerce sector steadily (to about 80% in 2019), together with its popularity amongst third-party sellers, and that its main competitors were marginalized.

Moreover, the market is also characterized by high barriers to entry, due to “loyalty and stickiness of consumer preferences, variety and breadth of services offered, network effects, brand popularity and reputation all hinder the possibility of reaching a minimum size sufficient to exert a competitive constraint” (p. 167).
ii. The market for logistics services for e-commerce.
Logistics services, in this case, encompass order fulfilment, warehouse management, and delivery (in some cases, including also returns). The ICA considered the rapid expansion of a national market for e-commerce logistics services, in which players with different characteristics and sizes operate on the supply side. Given the high start-up costs, several logistics companies are changing their business strategy through vertical integration or collaboration agreements with other companies. The B2C logistics for e-commerce requires specific investments given its characteristics, such as instant fulfilment of multiple small orders on demand, which sets it apart B2B logistics, where some of these companies were already operating.
The growth of the e-commerce industry has also attracted new entrants in the markets for integrated logistics services in Italy.4 However, as the type of service needs dedicated technologies, space, know-how, and workers, these new entrants have made significant investments, especially for the adoption of advanced technologies to integrate the different logistics phases.
These operators offer a fulfilment service dedicated to e-commerce, similar to FBA.
However, their investment is conditioned upon the possibility of tapping into a sufficiently large pool of demand.
 
IV. The Abuse
The ICA has concluded that Amazon was able to illegally leverage its position of super dominance in the Italian e-commerce market to gain a significant advantage over competing operators in the Italian e-commerce logistics industry to the detriment of third-party sellers and consumers.
The strategy, according to the antitrust authority, was also likely to strengthen Amazon’s dominant position in the national market for intermediation services on marketplaces.
The advantages of FBA are, in particular: (i) non-application of performance metrics to third-party sellers; (ii) obtaining the Prime badge; (iii) higher probability of being awarded the BuyBox; (iv) possibility to participate in special events and offers; and (v) eligibility for “Free Shipping via Amazon”.
In particular, access to Prime members seems to be crucial for most vendors as the purchases made by Prime consumers in 2019 amounted to approximately [80-90%] of the total value of transactions on Amazon.it, and [70-80%] of the products purchased by these users had a Prime badge. (Page 187)
The ICA also observed that the conduct had the effect of discouraging retailers from multi-homing their logistic services. The high costs of the FBA service, including the MCF multi-channel management, and the costs associated with operating multiple warehouses simultaneously were already sufficient to disincentivize retailers from multi-homing. In addition to that, the ICA noted that Amazon’s “abusive pressure” to adopt their logistics services was also geared towards pre-empting multi-homing and that the strategy had already worked in their favor as “reflected in the drastic worsening of the competitive position of the second player in the brokerage services market, eBay” (Page 188).
Amazon argued that the benefits were bestowed only on FBA subscribers because of the “superiority” of Amazon’s services, which would ensure a certain level of quality. The ICA, however,  considered that Amazon failed to provide any evidence of said greater quality of service. Moreover, the attribution of sales advantages was not linked to the sales performance of retailers. On the contrary, FBA retailers received a more lenient treatment in their evaluation and control requirements than did those who turned to MFN.
A. Classification of the Abusive Practice
The ICA defines the conduct above as “a single, complex and articulated exclusionary strategy, implemented by the Amazon group in violation of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)” (188).
More specifically, the ICA defined the conduct as self-preferencing, observing that Amazon used its super-dominant position in the e-commerce industry to increase third-party seller demand for its logistics service, to the detriment of competing services.
Amazon has argued that their conduct cannot be classified as an abuse ofdominant position in the form of self-preferencing due to the lack of relevant case law. The company has also highlighted the differences between this case and the Commission’s recent decision in Google Search (Shopping), the only case so far in which self-preferencing was qualified as autonomous abusive conduct. Moreover, Amazon did not coerce retailers to adopt FBA because they remained free to decide whether they wanted to use the service, and no minimum inventory requirements were imposed.
The ICA respondedby observing that the designation of the conduct as abusive does not depend on whether it falls within a particular classification, but on the identification of substantive features of the abusive conduct. (P. 190)
Regardless of the nomen iuris used for the specific conduct, the ICA held that it has submitted all evidence needed to prove an abuse of dominance.
Indeed, the classification of the conduct as self-preferencing might be inaccurate if one considers a narrow interpretation of the Google Shopping case. However, the conduct is not about tying either, let alone bundling of services. The conduct hinges more precisely on leveraging the company’s dominance in the e-commerce sector (through special offers and treatment) in order to favor the purchase of its logistics services, which were neither better priced nor necessarily of better quality than competing logistics services.
In other words, “Amazon has artificially combined two distinct services: the presence on the platform at remunerative conditions (possibility of not being subject to the evaluation of one’s own performance, of offering products with the Prime label, of selling during special events and of having a high chance of winning the BuyBox) and the FBA service for the fulfilment of orders – in order to create an illicit incentive to purchase FBA, in the absence of alternative ways of accessing the same advantages, apart from the use of FBA” (Page 191).
B. Efficiencies
According to the ICA, there is no commercial or technical reason to justify the link between the benefits granted to subscribers and FBA usage, nor does the conduct find justification on grounds of efficiency. In other words, while the evidence suggests that other logistics operators are able to provide services of comparable quality,5 the respondent undertaking has failed to prove the contrary. And, indeed, the ICA observed, Amazon has introduced a Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) program in 2021, in the midst of the ICA’s investigation. Thanks to SFP, sellers can undergo a qualification process that recognizes their warehouse management capabilities according to standards deemed adequate to the Prime experience. Then, using Amazon-approved delivery services deemed “suitable,” sellers may access the same benefits guaranteed to third-party sellers using FBA. However, SFP did not put an end to the anticompetitive conduct as it is not an alternative to FBA.
The SFP service is reserved for a particular class of retailers and conditioned to strict contractual limitations. SFP is geared toward retailers selling products with a low turnover rate or needing more flexibility in the provision of their service, such as packaging. The high tariffs charged by Amazon for long-term storage of products and the high standardization of certain elements of the service render Amazon’s marketplace either too expensive or too restrictive for these retailers. The ICA reckoned that they ultimately represent a portion of the demand for logistics services that is unreachable to Amazon, as it does not fit the FBA conditions.
To date, under SFP, Amazon does not merely set the standards necessary to qualify for and obtain the Prime label, but also defines the terms and conditions of the contractual relationship between SFP sellers and Prime carriers, going so far as to negotiate with the latter the price of their delivery services to sellers. Thus, managing the fulfilment of an order from a third-party seller included in SFP is still entirely dependent on Amazon, both in the choice of carrier and in the terms and conditions of the service provided to sellers.
Such a constraint was deemed as “completely unjustified and invasive of the freedom of negotiation between the carrier and its customers” (Page 209).
Today’s SFP does not allow, therefore, the emergence of an autonomous offer, independent from Amazon, capable of intercepting the demand for delivery services and warehouse logistics – or integrated logistics – offered by Prime level to retailers on Amazon.it.
In this sense, FBA is not only in competition with the integrated logistics services offered by other operators, but is also able to intercept the demand for carrier delivery services only, expressed by retailers who carry out in-house upstream logistics activities (Page 213)
 
V. The Effects of the Abusive S qtrategy
The investigation has uncovered several exclusionary effects related to the conduct.
First, the conduct had the effect of excluding potential competition, as well as industrial and technological development. By linking all the benefits in terms of visibility and increased sales performance on the marketplace to the FBA subscription, Amazon’s strategy has succeeded in curbing the development of competing integrated logistics services by innovative operators.
The second anticompetitive effect concerns operators that had already invested in this market but were not given the opportunity to “compete on equal terms with Amazon”. In order to reach the minimum efficient size and be competitive in the market, new e-commerce logistics operators need to intercept the demand of a significant number of players, which can be found only on the AM (Page 213).
Third, the conduct also has the effect of increasing Amazon’s power in the delivery industry. The use of third-party couriers for delivery has declined from 100% in 2016 to 30-40% in 2019. (Page 216) In this way, Amazon has further increased its bargaining power vis-à-vis other market players which, being both competitors and suppliers of the delivery service, see their ability to react to Amazon’s strategies increasingly diminished.
A. Effects on Other E-commerce Platforms
Amazon’s alleged conduct has also eroded the market shares of other e-commerce platforms as it made it more difficult to multi-home logistics services and thus operate on these platforms and on Amazon simultaneously. While Amazon offers a multi-channel logistics service (MCF), very few retailers adopted it due to the high operating costs. (Page 220)
Equally important because of the confusion it is likely to generate in consumers is the fact that a retailer’s order packages handled through MCF are marked with the Amazon logo even when the order comes from a competing platform. This is a marketing choice that can “cannibalize” a retailer’s sales on other platforms and, consequently, decrease the profitability of a multi-homing option. (Page 221)
As a result of this strategy, many retailers have left other marketplaces to be active only on Amazon.it, to the detriment of competition from other e-commerce platform operators. (Page 222)
 
VI. The Sanction
The decision includes a 1.2 billion euros fine, a cease-and-desist order, and a set of behavioral remedies. The hefty fine imposed by the antitrust authority in this decision was justified by the need to ensure effective deterrence of the sanction. Moreover, consideringthat the Amazon group achieved a global turnover in 2020 of more than €330 billion, and the importance of Amazon at the global level, the ICA increased the amount of the sanction by 50%. (Page 231)
Perhaps even more importantly for the e-commerce behemoth, the ICA has imposed additional measures meaning Amazon has to cease the anticompetitive conduct and offer equal treatment to all vendors using logistics operators that meet objective standards for the fulfilment of online orders. These standards need to be clearly defined, reasonable, transparent, and applied in a non-discriminatory manner. (Page 235)
The decision states that this can be achieved by reconfiguring the current SFP programme so that Amazon defines such standards alongside  requirements for sellers to participate in SFP, but refrain from any intermediary role between third-party sellers and the logistics operators. The defined standards will be applied uniformly to offers operated by Amazon through its logistics network (i.e., Amazon Retail offers and those of third-party retailers participating in FBA) and to all offers operated by third-party sellers that qualify in SFP. (Page 235)
Moreover, SFP and FBA’s sales shall be subject to the same system of monitoring and verification of compliance with the Prime standards. Monitoring of compliance with the standards and any changes to these standards should be carried out by an independent trustee.
Amazon will have to give full visibility on its platform and in its promotional campaigns to the existence of the SFP programme and the possibility to access Prime via SFP. (Page 236)
 
Conclusion
The ICA’s decision comes at a time when a handful of digital platforms have accumulated sweeping powers in the real economy, while their scope has also crept to include formerly unrelated sectors. Such concerns were also lately addressed with the adoption of the EU Digital Markets Act.
In an official statement, Amazon has revealed that they will appeal the ICA’s decision because the sanction and obligations imposed are unjustified and disproportionate. The e-commerce behemoth sees its role as an essential complement of small and medium-sized businesses in the country and a driver to their growth. As Amazon’s logistics services are optional, the company argues in the official statement, retailers choose them for the higher quality offered, not because they are coerced to do so.
Moreover, the company contests, in the same statement, also its position of dominance in the Italian retail industry, claiming that the market definition should include all retail channels (online and offline).
It seems, therefore, that the appeal to the administrative court will not be limited to the sanctions, despite the initial narrow focus of the statement. Amazon may consequently try to challenge the decision on all its substantive elements, from the market definition to the imposition of remedial measures.
The ICA has defined a relevant market including most of the e-commerce platforms (traditional, proprietary, and hybrid, horizontal and vertical), but excluding brick-and-mortar sellers. Assuming that Amazon’s dominance in the Italian e-commerce market will be confirmed, the administrative court will have the role to establish whether Amazon fell short of its special responsibility not to allow its behaviour to impair genuine and undistorted competition (Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, U:C:2017:632, paragraph 135).
Amazon’s objections finding that there are differences with Google/Alphabet’s self-preferencing case are not misplaced, but not for the reasons for now only sketched out by the company.
Alphabet relied on its own platform alone to redirect consumers by fine-tuning the website’s design. Amazon, on the other hand, had set up a series of connected contractual arrangements with third parties to create the exclusionary effects under scrutiny. Moreover, although not sufficiently evidenced, the ICA’s investigation suggests that Amazon may be exploiting its position of dominance. The decision often mentions the fact that Amazon’s logistics services are more expensive than the competition. But again, the ICA focuses on the exclusionary effects of the infringement, thus purporting little evidence on this point.
The case law shows that not every exclusionary effect is inherently harmful to competition, because competition on the merits might result in the elimination or marginalization of less efficient competitors (see Post Danmark C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 22, and Intel v Commission C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 134). However, in this case, the set of advantages set up by Amazon are designed or at least have the effect of excluding, from what seems to be an essential facility, as efficient competitors. When asked, Amazon was not able indeed to submit evidence of the superiority of its logistics services. While, on the contrary, most merchants vouched for some of the competitor’s quality of service but declared their intention to stick to Amazon’s for the higher visibility this would bring.
Amazon’s conduct does not resolve in an outright refusal to grant access to an essential facility, but rather in imposing unfavourable conditions leading to the elimination of competition in the e-commerce logistics market. Moreover, this conduct has had the effect of reinforcing Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce sector by hindering multi-homing. In other words, Amazon’s conduct deviates from competition on the merits when it leverages its super dominance in the e-commerce to exclude competitors in the logistics market.
The lack of definitive evidence of the superiority of Amazon’s logistics also hampers the possibility of assessing the pro-consumer benefits of such practices. On the other hand, in the ICA’s decision there is little evidence about direct consumer harm. Although, on this point, it is important to remark that Article 102 TFEU protects consumers not just from acts that directly hurt them, but also from practices that harm them indirectly through their impact on competition (see Post Danmark, C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 20).
Finally, the measures adopted, albeit severe, could not solve the problem of removing the barriers to multi-homing. As most sellers have already adopted FBA, and considering the high switching and the multi-homing costs, logistics operators may still find it difficult to enter this market.
Even assuming that the Italian administrative courts will confirm the ICA’s decision on the merits, it is likely that its effects will be mostly palliative, especially for other e-commerce players.

Several retailers heard at the hearing also confirmed the ability of warehouse operators other than Amazon to meet order fulfillment times and, more generally, a level of service adequate to their requirements.
As to the ability of carriers operating in Italy to deliver orders according to the criteria required by Amazon for SFP, all operators stated that these service levels are similar to those normally offered to their customers and, in some cases, guaranteed to Amazon itself for AFN parcel deliveries (Page 210)

649,"April 10, 2022",EU’s Vestager Speaks Up For The Digital Markets Act,"


EU executive vice president Margrethe Vestager defended the Digital Markets Act on Thursday, saying it’s up to tech companies to figure out how to live with it.
Critics of the legislation have said it could break encryption for messaging, it makes products less useful for users, and it provides little clarity on how companies can avoid massive fines.
Changes to the law were being hammered out as late as last month, with key aspects of the law concerning the growing crypto and blockchain market being sharply revised. 
Some critics suggest the DMA story could mirror that of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation — a privacy law, implemented in 2018, that many users dealt with only in the form of pop-up windows. 
Worse still, harsher criticism of the EU’s approach includes questions on the effects of the DMA and accompannying legislation on innovation considering the fast-changing nature of the technologies being regulated. Big Tech companies, including Apple, Google and Amazon, have all spoken out against the law.

Speaking to Axios‘ Ashley Gold and Dan Primack during a Twitter Spaces event, Vestager said it’s up to tech companies to bake DMA requirements into their platforms in a way that’s user-friendly and attractive.
“I think it’s about time we are asked for real consent,” Vestager said. “I think there’s a lot of room for improvements… for a consumer to know what it is I’m consenting to or not.”

650,"April 7, 2022",Senate Confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson For Supreme Court,"
The United States Senate confirmed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman to serve on the top US court.
The 53-47 final vote tally showed bipartisan support for Jackson, with three Republicans joining all their Democrat counterparts to elevate the 51-year-old federal judge to a lifetime appointment.
In February, while introducing  Jackson at the White House, Biden declared “I believe it’s time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation.” The landmark appointment is important beyond its effects on the US legal and political landscape, with strong cultural and social significance at a moment of hightened polarization. 
Jackson joined the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in June 2021 after seven years as a trial judge on the DC federal court. Before taking the bench, Jackson served as an assistant federal public defender, a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission, a lawyer in private practice at several firms, and a law clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose big shoes she has been nominated to fill.
While much has been talked about regarding her historic nomination, it is hard to determine where Jackson might fall on issues related to antitrust. She was reassigned from a class-action lawsuit targeting Facebook, Google and Alphabet last June after being elevated to the D.C. Circuit, while the remaining antitrust cases she faced on the district court rarely delved into substantive issues. Most opinions issued by Jackson on this subject dealt with procedural or jurisdictional matters. 
At least one antitrust hawk is already a fan, however. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s head of antitrust and an outspoken skeptic of market concentration in the tech industry has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. 
Kanter is leading several Justice Department competition cases against Big Tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. “Ketanji is a person of tremendous character and intellect,” Kanter stated, adding that he “could not imagine a better selection.”
While Jackson does not have a strong antitrust background in either private practice or on the bench, her predecessor and former boss, Stephen G. Breyer, has left an indelible mark on antitrust case law in the United States. One of Breyer’s best known antitrust opinions was for the majority in the court’s landmark 2013 ruling in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis. That case stemmed from the FTC’s challenge of agreements ending patent litigation over the testosterone drug AndroGel that enforcers said unfairly delayed the entry of cheaper, more accessible generic versions of the drug.

Last month, Senator Amy Klobuchar was able to ask about topics the senator has focused on in Washington, including voting and antitrust laws. Klobuchar had a similar focus during recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings, for Justices Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett.
“What role do you think that Congressional intent should play in the court’s interpretation of the antitrust laws?” Klobuchar asked.
Jackson answered in part that “courts are not policymakers and judges should not be importing their own policy preferences.”

651,"April 6, 2022","The Fast Growing Concentration Of The Connected TV OS Market: Getting Ahead Of Another Big Tech Duopoly, Before It’s Too Late","
By: Damien Geradin (The Platform Law Blog)
The European Commission recently published its final report into the Internet of Things, with Executive Vice-President Vestager stating: “The consumer Internet of Things sector is increasingly becoming part of our everyday life …  This is a market with high barriers to entry, few vertically integrated players and concerns about access to data, interoperability or exclusivity practices amongst others.”
More specifically in the context of connected TVs, in a recent submission to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), the BBC expressed concerns that “by 2023, as many as 60 to 80% of new TV sets sold may have an operating system owned by the tech giants (including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon).” This could in turn lead these companies to engage in the type of conduct, such as self-preferencing, in which they have already engaged in other digital markets.
As has occurred in the case of mobile ecosystems, there is a significant risk that – absent regulatory intervention – the connected TV market could end up being more concentrated than predicted by the BBC, as this market would be  controlled by just two companies, i.e., Google and Amazon. Concentration in the connected TV market would in turn create significant risks for competition in a series of adjacent markets, such as content streaming and creation, online advertising, and hardware manufacturing since companies active in these markets would have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google and Amazon. Reduced competition in these markets could in turn affect consumers in terms of higher prices, reduced choice and innovation. By controlling the connected TV market Google and Amazon would further increase their data collection capabilities, enhancing their data advantage over other companies and raising privacy concerns…

652,"April 5, 2022",UK’s Next Antitrust Head May Be A Woman,"


The UK’s government may appoint the first female head of the UK competition regulator, in replacement of outgoing director Andrea Coscelli when he steps down in July, reported The Financial Times. Sarah Cardell, the Competition and Markets Authority’s most senior lawyer, is considered to be one of the leading contenders.
Coscelli announced in January that he was stepping down after six years at the helm of the CMA, one of the most influential competition authorities worldwide. The official start of the search for his successor has been delayed, however, as the government still needs to appoint a permanent chair at the CMA, almost two years after Andrew Tyrie was forced out in a boardroom coup. 
The new chair is expected to be appointed next month. The strong preference in government is to replace Coscelli with a female chief executive, according to several people with knowledge of the process. 
The CMA and its predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading, have never had a permanent female chief executive, although Vivienne Dews served as interim head of the OFT for a month before it was dissolved in 2014. 
Cardell is said to have the backing of a number of people influential in the selection process, according to several sources, and she would be expected to continue Coscelli’s agenda of pursuing large-scale and increasingly transnational investigations against dominant firms, particularly in the Technology sector.

Proceedings in the legal dispute between Epic Games and Apple have bogged down in Australia, and won’t reach a courtroom until 2024.
A Monday ruling of the nation’s Federal Court decided that, as Google and Epic are also fighting over essentially the same issues, it makes no sense for Epic and Apple to air their grievances separately, as was planned for November 2022.
Epic and Apple had already told the court they would not be ready by November, which led Justice Nye Perram to push the hearing into 2023. Epic and Google, meanwhile, had told the court they would not be ready to front until late 2023 or early 2024.
Perram felt that assessment was optimistic, so has scheduled 18 weeks commencing in March 2024 to hear both cases.
But the judge is also worried that the cases will be very difficult to manage, because both address essentially the same issue: whether Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store lessen competition, as Epic alleges they did by excluding Epic’s game Fortnite after it bypassed their payment schemes. Perram therefore pondered that one case could resolve issues raised in the other.
“For example, if in the Apple case, Epic is found to be correct and that the iOS App Distribution Market consists of the provision of distribution services to the developers of apps on the iOS platform, then this necessarily implies that the App Store does not compete in relation to gaming with the Google Play Store,” he wrote. “Having made that finding, could it then be concluded in the Google case that the Android App Distribution Market is in fact a market of two-sided transaction platforms providing services to both consumers and developers and that the platforms compete with each other?”

654,"April 5, 2022",Apple In DMA’s Crosshairs Over Payments,"


Apple’s latest plan to develop its own payment processing system may test the limits of the recently approved European Digital Markets Act (DMA). 
According to Bloomberg sources, Apple is planning to bring some financial services in-house, including the development of its own payment processing system, but it could also add credit checks, risks assessment for loans, and other financial services.
This revelation comes just a few days after the European Union agreed on its final draft of the DMA. Apple’s project could raise some interesting questions about the way the new EU law is interpreted by authorities in what could become the first real-world test for the landmark legislation.
The DMA will impose new obligations and restrictions on gatekeepers, mostly Big Tech firms, by the end of this year. At this point, it is well known that some of these obligations will likely force Apple to provide access for third parties to alternative payment methods in the App Store, to share more information with app developers, or even to make iMessage work with competition messaging services.
Far less known, though, is the real scope of the DMA and how it is designed to address structural features of digital platforms, as well as future conduct that could prevent competition in certain markets.
For payments, in addition to the provisions that will compel Apple and Google to provide alternative payment methods to their own in the App Stores, the DMA establishes that gatekeepers that have a dual role as developers of operating systems and device manufacturers, namely Apple and Google, cannot impose restrictions to access certain functionalities in their devices to third parties, like near-field-communication technology (NFC). NFC chips are used for “tap and go” payments.
In paragraph 52, the DMA sets out the potential problem, “a gatekeeper that is a manufacturer of a device may restrict access to some of the functionalities in this device, such as near-field-communication technology and the software used to operate that technology, which may be required for the effective provision of an ancillary service by the gatekeeper as well as by any potential third-party provider of such an ancillary service.”

And it continues with the solution if a gatekeeper engages in such practices, “the gatekeepers should therefore be obliged to ensure access under equal conditions to, and interoperability with, the same operating system, hardware or software features that are available or used in the provision of any ancillary services by the gatekeeper.”
These provisions are drafted using broad terms and it is yet to be seen how they will be interpreted in practice, but there is a risk that Apple and Google may need to provide access, not only to current rivals but also to “potential third-party providers,” to the software and hardware that they use to provide ancillary services.
Will a new payment processing system be an ancillary service? Will Apple be able to limit access to certain features if this access represents a risk to the integrity of the system? There aren’t straight answers and most likely regulators, judges and Apple will debate the limits of the DMA on these points.
 Apple may be considered a gatekeeper for certain core platform services, and this could enable third parties to request access to certain Apple functionalities. The European Commission is already investigating the NFC chip technology. The preliminary concerns were Apple’s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system. 
The new DMA now could go one step further and prevent Apple from refusing access to third parties to software and hardware that could limit the provision of any ancillary service that Apple provides.

655,"April 4, 2022",Federal Judge Drops Antitrust Claims In YouTube Suit,"


Florida federal Judge Darrin Gayles has dismissed Content ID-related antitrust claims against YouTube. The allegations were part of a digital piracy lawsuit filed against the streaming platform last year by movie tycoon Carlos Vasallo. While the lawsuit has been slimmed down, YouTube still has to defend itself against copyright infringement claims.
Spanish-born movie tycoon Carlos Vasallo sued YouTube last year over various piracy-related claims.
The actor and producer owns the rights to the world’s largest collection of Mexican and Latin American movies, many of which are illegally shared on YouTube.
While copyright and other IP allegations against Google and YouTube aren’t new, the case came with an interesting twist. According to Vasallo, YouTube would only allow him to join the Content ID copyright protection program if he agreed to a revenue share deal. In addition, he had had to waive all possible piracy claims that took place in the past.

The movie tycoon refused to accept these terms. Instead, he opted to send old-fashioned DMCA takedown notices. However, according to the complaint filed at a Florida federal court last year, that did little to stop people from pirating his films.
The lawsuit accused YouTube of breaching antitrust laws through ‘illegal tying.’ According to Vasallo, YouTube tied Content ID participation to a required revenue-sharing deal and the condition to waive older copyright claims.
The movie tycoon also accused YouTube of several copyright infringement claims by making movies available on the platform without permission. On top of that, YouTube allegedly violated the DMCA by removing copyright management information from the videos.

Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later firm, has completed its purchase of PriceRunner, the comparison-shopping service in the Nordic region, the Stockholm-based company announced Monday (April 4).
The merger promises PriceRunner will bring new features to the Klarna app with product discovery, price comparisons and customer reviews to help shoppers save time and money while making more informed decisions.
Klarna, which boasts more than 400,000 global retail partners, coupled with PriceRunner’s retail cohorts will benefit from increased website traffic, Klarna said.
“The acquisition will serve to strengthen our consumer offering,” said David Fock, Klarna’s chief product officer, in a statement. “Klarna will not be a marketplace but a viable and competitive alternative for retail partners versus Amazon, Google and Facebook.”
Mikael Lindahl, CEO of PriceRunner, said his goal is to create the best shopping experience for consumers together with Klarna.
Last month, Klarna introduced Klarna Kosma, a business division geared toward open banking.

657,"April 3, 2022",DOJ’s Kanter Plans More Merger Scrutiny,"


If US Department of Justice (DOJ) Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter gets his way, mergers would be examined with more scrutiny, decades of lenient antitrust enforcement would end, and competition would bloom.
In an interview with Bloomberg, the 48-year-old Antitrust Division chief, said change is coming from the nation’s top law enforcement agency.
“We’re not just bringing a few big cases, we’re changing the way it’s done,” Kanter told the news outlet.
It’s time, he said, to turn the page on a failed experiment, referencing years of laissez-faire merger policy.
Kanter said he is implementing a major part of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda to increase competition after decades of consolidation, the report stated. Biden hired Kanter last year amidst a wave of appointments that many have interpreted as marking a change in attitude towards corporate concentration, particularly in the tech industry.
But it won’t be easy. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has the deep pockets needed to fight a lengthy war against the antitrust watchdog. 
In the fiscal year that ended in September, Kanter and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), also responsible to enforcing competition laws, reviewed a record 3,500 transactions.
Kanter has made it a priority to prevent tech companies from acquiring new technologies that threaten their dominance. Kanter told the news organization that he will sue to block more mergers rather than accept settlements that allow deals to proceed.
This week, PYMNTS reported that the DOJ has endorsed the proposed American Innovation and Choice Online Act. The measure would prohibit digital platforms like Amazon and Google from giving preference to their own products and services over their competitors. This marks the Biden administration’s first support for the antitrust proposal.

658,"April 3, 2022",EU Watchdog Goes After Microsoft Cloud,"


EU antitrust regulators are quizzing Microsoft’s rivals and customers about its cloud business and licensing deals, a questionnaire seen by Reuters showed, in a move that could lead to a formal investigation and renewed scrutiny of the U.S. software company.
The European Commission has fined Microsoft a total 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the previous decade for breaching EU antitrust rules and for not complying with its order to halt anti-competitive practices.
The company found itself on the EU competition enforcer’s radar again after German software provider NextCloud, France’s OVHcloud and two other companies filed complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices. The complaint focuses on the way Microsoft licenses its products, such as its Office productivity suite, that may make it more expensive to use cloud services.
“The Commission has information that Microsoft may be using its potentially dominant position in certain software markets to foreclose competition regarding certain cloud computing services,” the questionnaire said.
Regulators asked if the terms in Microsoft’s licensing deals with cloud service providers allow rivals to compete effectively.
They also want to know if companies needed Microsoft’s operating systems and productivity applications to complement their own cloud infrastructure offering in order to compete effectively.
Having been at the center of a historic antitrust case in the 90s, Microsoft has often managed to avoid the close scrutiny levelled at other Big Tech companies, such as Google or Meta (formerly Facebook). However, other recent moves by the company have also been questioned, signalling a tougher stance from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

659,"April 3, 2022",EU’s DMA May Face Challenges With Limited Resources,"


Looming regulations in the EU — specifically through the Digital Markets Act — have raised questions regarding the apparent focus on technology sector giants, known as Big Tech, and the amount of resources the push for closer regulation will entail amidst a struggling global economic recovery..
Critics have raised questions over the (arguably) limited resources that legislators and regulators are bringing to bear against the marquee names in commerce and social media: Amazon, Meta, and perhaps any number of names down the line. Many of these, including Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet, rank among the richest companies of all time, wielding considerable resources with which to push back against laws that affect their business.
The DMA will be implemented beginning in January of 2023 and is focused on the largest of tech platforms, establishing rules that put guardrails around how these companies can act within the competitive sphere. The legislation comes as a response to growing concentration, as well as the rapid evolution of the Digital Economy that has transformed it into one of the main driving forces of global growth.
Among the mandates of the DMA: platforms will be restricted from showing favoritism to their own services on offer to customers or via search engines.  The companies are also banned from using data that is gleaned by activities on their sites to use in their competitive efforts against other firms.
Read More: Big Data Protection: Big Problem?
If the platforms are found in transgression of these and other rules, the fines can be hefty – equivalent to 10% or more of annual global sales. As it stands, most of these companies would likely be in violation of these rules already, with a limited timeframe to correct these issues before the penalties begin to kick in. 
According to one study, 67% of the top 1,000 websites in the United States were in violation of the GDPR, the EU’s previous landmark legislation targeting data-gathering and privacy protection practices. 
But drilling down into the proposal itself, as had been introduced in December of 2021, we see that a total budgetary allocation, beginning this year and lasting into 2027, of roughly 81 billion euros will be allocated to enforce the Act; after 2027, the number given annually is about 2.7 billion euros.
Let’s examine 2026 and 2027, as noted in the text of the proposal, when the EU member nations will be spending a bit more than 16 billion euros annually.  Now compare Apple’s revenue for that latest year, which stood at about $366 billion for all of fiscal year 2021.

660,"April 3, 2022",DC AG Says Fighting Big Tech Is Like “David & Goliath”,"


In his battles with Big Tech, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine sees his office as something of an underdog.
“In a real way, when you take on tech, it’s David versus Goliath,” Racine said in a recent interview with CNBC in his office. “Which means you’ve got to be thorough, studied and precise. And willing to go the distance.”
Racine, who is now in his last year of office after announcing he will not seek reelection, has demonstrated his resolve in lawsuits he’s brought against companies including Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Grubhub. Still, his office has seen significant blows to several different actions against Amazon and Facebook owner Meta in recent months.
A US court dismissed a lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc on Friday March 20th that accused the company of antitrust violations for barring third-party sellers from offering better deals for their products elsewhere. The suit had been presented a year earlier by Racine.
Racine has now also joined the attorneys general of Texas, Washington and Indiana in a suit alleging that search giant Google made misleading promises about how much privacy it could guarantee users dating back to at least 2014.
Racine said his office plans to move ahead with those cases and others, and will ask the courts to reconsider. He said he’s not surprised that the tech companies would hire the most experienced lawyers to back them up and engage in a process that “grinds down smaller players and plaintiffs.” 
And, he said, he has faith that the courts, with a little bit of extra explanation on the particulars of their cases, will come around.
“We are willing to take on that David role,” Racine said. “And after all, I think, David won.”

661,"April 3, 2022",Canada Looks at Revising Its Competition Act,"

By Thomas W. Ross1
 
Momentum is building for a potentially far-reaching review of Canada’s competition regime.2 Canada does not modify its competition statute frequently. The first competition statute in Canada dates from 1889 and, while the law has been extensively amended a number of times, the current law took shape when the last comprehensive revisions produced the Competition Act in 1986. The most recent significant amendments to this Act came in 2009.3
However infrequent change has been, it is clear that the government is open to a thorough review at this time. It has said as much. On February 7, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry announced: “In recognition of the critical role of the Competition Act in promoting dynamic and fair markets, the Minister will also carefully evaluate potential ways to improve its operation.”4  This follows a call several months earlier from the Commissioner of Competition for “a comprehensive review of the Competition Act. We need to have a debate in Canada about what our competition law should look like in the 21st century.”5
In support of this effort, Senator Howard Wetston, himself a former Commissioner of Competition,6 launched a consultation; commissioned a paper by Professor Edward Iacobucci, a leading competition law scholar;7 invited commentary from others; and posted both the paper and commentary on his government website.8
 
I. Why Now?
A number of reasons motivate the present interest in reform. First, as is the case in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, concerns have been expressed about the seemingly sudden rise to dominance of firms in the digital platform space such as Google, Facebook (now Meta), and Amazon. An often-expressed worry is that the traditional tools of modern competition policy may not be up to the task of controlling the market power amassed by these new titans.9 The push for changes in other leading competition law jurisdictions, by itself, has encouraged discussion in Canada about keeping up and adapting in order to harmonize the Canadian system with others.
Second and related, in at least the United States and Canada, more general concerns about perceived increasing rates of concentration leading to higher profit margins have led many to wonder if competition policy and enforcement need to be strengthened across the economy, not only in the tech sector.10 This strengthening may involve simply increasing funding to the Competition Bureau to allow it to take on more cases, but some have also expressed the view that legislative changes may be necessary to add new teeth to the Act.  Responding perhaps to these first two concerns, the government of Canada has committed to providing the Competition Bureau with significant additional resources: CDN $96 million over the next five years and $27.5 million more per year after that to enhance its enforcement capacity.11 The Bureau’s increase in resources to take on the new challenges has been met with approval.12
Finally, over the past twenty or so years a series of cases has exposed important gaps in the current statutory framework. Below, I delineate these gaps and some of the amendments to the Competition Act that are proposed to fill them.
 
II. Gaps
With the major amendments of the 1970s and 1980s, Canada had a modern, sophisticated competition statute.13 To a considerable extent it codified best practices with attention to economic principles. However, gaps have emerged in each of the major areas of competition law.
A. Cartels
One feature that was not in alignment with economic principles related to the treatment of cartels. The Canadian law stated that to be illegal an agreement had to “unduly” limit competition. As is easy to imagine, the presence of the qualifier meant that price-fixing, even of the most naked variety, could not be taken as per se illegal. This early failing was at least partly corrected with the 2009 amendments that created two tracks for the review of agreements between competitors supplying products: a per se criminal track for naked collusion (i.e., no undueness test) and a civil “rule of reason” track for other horizontal agreements such as joint ventures and strategic alliances.
In the process of fixing the old “undueness” problem by creating the two-track approach, a new problem was created—one that has recently been drawing significant attention. While the old price-fixing law had applied equally to sell-side and buy-side agreements, it was unclear whether the new per se provision applies only to collusion by suppliers. Recent cases revealed this uncertainty: cases involving no-poaching agreements in the fast-food sector14 and allegations of an agreement among major grocery retailers to roll back “pandemic pay” bonuses they had been paying their workers during earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.15 Following these cases, the Bureau was compelled to issue a statement clarifying that the criminal price fixing provisions could not be applied to buy-side collusion.16up>
B. Abuse of Dominance
A series of cases has moved the Canadian law on abuse of dominance away from modern competition economics. The key decisions on this subject came in the NutraSweet17 and Canada Pipe18up> cases which determined that, for an anticompetitive act to be considered an abuse of a dominant position, it must have an exclusionary, predatory, or disciplinary character. In short, challenged conduct must hurt a competitor. This reliance on negative effects to competitors, rather than on competition, is not consistent with how most experts see the proper role of competition policy.19 Most importantly, it misses the various ways firms can harm competition without hurting competitors, for example through a series of acquisitions of very small firms (each too small to trigger a “substantial lessening or prevention of competition”)20 or by adopting strategies to facilitate tacit collusion among current market participants.21
C. Mergers
The review of mergers in general has been considerably complicated by court decisions in the Superior Propane22 and Tervita23 cases. One way in which Canadian merger law differs from that of most other jurisdictions is the weight it attaches to efficiencies achieved by the merging parties and the balancing of those efficiencies against any potential lessening of competition. Many observers initially felt that the 1986 amendments had incorporated a total welfare standard for merger review.24 This standard would allow an anticompetitive merger to proceed if the projected efficiencies attributable to the merger would be greater than and would offset the effects of the lessening of competition. The effect of lessening of competition was generally expected to be measured as the deadweight loss flowing from higher post-merger prices. The efficiencies in cost reduction (for example) would be measured by the reduction in costs of production of the post-merger quantity. This standard is less restrictive of mergers than the more common consumer welfare standard. It is nevertheless a clear standard and was supported by many economists.25 The Competition Tribunal initially adopted the total surplus approach in Superior Propane (and cleared the merger). On appeal, however, the Federal Court instructed the Tribunal to consider a wider set of anticompetitive effects, in particular effects involving redistributions of surplus from lower income buyers to higher income sellers.26 The Court directed the Tribunal to develop its own approach to weighing the effects on these different groups. As a result, whatever one thinks about the total welfare standard as compared to the consumer welfare standard, this has left the Canadian approach quite uncertain: what will these weights be, will they vary from case to case, and might they depend on who is sitting on the Tribunal at any point in time?27
Tervita also added a new challenge. Many agreed that the merger would produce anticompetitive effects— supported by largely qualitative evidence—and that the possible efficiencies were negligible. But the Supreme Court decided in Tervita that the Commissioner bore the burden quantifying any anticompetitive effects that can possibly be quantified, with an expansive interpretation of “possibly.”28 Under this standard, the Court rejected much of the qualitative evidence offered by the Commissioner and approved the merger. The burden thus placed on the Commissioner, even in cases in which competitive harm is quite clear and efficiencies virtually non-existent, has been extensively criticized.29
 
III. Proposed Amendments
There is no shortage of suggestions for amendments to the Competition Act. Nevertheless, there remains a great deal of support for Canada’s current approach to competition policy, as evidenced by commentary supporting the current model as sound and only in need of more vigorous enforcement (supported by larger Bureau budgets) with possibly a few tweaks to address some of the gaps that have emerged.30
Amendment suggestions continue to come in,31 but a broad list of ideas can be compiled from an article by John Pecman,32 the previous Commissioner of Competition; from Professor Iacobucci’s Consultation Paper;33 and from the Competition Bureau’s own submission to Senator Wetston’s consultation.34up> Some suggestions relate to assuring adequate funding of the Competition Bureau and enhancing its independence. Others relate to improving the timeliness and effectiveness of enforcement.35 And there has been considerable commentary on the appropriate goals for a modern Canadian competition law, with some suggesting clarifying its central purpose be to enhance the efficiency of markets and others suggesting an expanded set of goals not unlike many suggested by subscribers to the New Brandeis school in the United States.36
Important specific suggestions for improvements pertain to the key substantive areas of competition law: cartels, abuse of dominance and mergers. Many relate to fixing some of the gaps identified above.
1. Cartels
With respect to the price-fixing provisions, the most common suggestion is for revised statutory language that would bring buyer-side collusion under the per se prohibitions in § 45 of the Act. Proponents of this amendment argue that collusion by buyers can have efficiency effects similar to those resulting from the exercise of monopoly power by sellers. Proponents also argue that agreements on wage fixing can have potentially large effects on the welfare of employees through depressed earnings and reduced employment opportunities.37 While in principle such agreements can now be reviewed on a civil standard under a different section of the Act, the relevant provisions do not allow for per se review and do not provide for fines or for damages to be paid to the victims.38
2. Abuse of Dominance
As suggested, many have pointed to the gap created in the abuse of dominance area by the series of cases that led to the adoption of a “harm to competitors” test rather than a “harm to competition” test. Not surprisingly, several commentators have suggested clarifying in the law that a negative effect on competition is or should be the standard.39
A second suggestion for the abuse of dominance provisions has also gained some traction. The Competition Act currently allows for private actions and damages for those who have suffered harm as a result of violation of the criminal provisions of the Act. For about twenty years private damage actions following price-fixing cases have been growing in importance in Canada.40 However, because abuse of dominance is not criminal behavior under the Act, damages are not available as a remedy to victims of an abuse. This contrasts with the approach to monopolization in the United States. Allowing private parties to bring actions before the Competition Tribunal for injunctive relief and damages for abuse of dominance could bring the extra energy and enforcement to the abuse of dominance area that private actions have brought to the cartel area.41 The Competition Bureau itself recommended such an amendment in its submission to Senator Wetston’s consultation, emphasizing in particular the benefit of having more cases: “Such an extension of private access [to the Tribunal] will serve to more rapidly expand valuable case law, and bring these sections into sharper relief for both the Commissioner and Canada’s business community.”42
3. Mergers
With respect to merger review, experts recognize the uncertainty about welfare standards created by the Superior Propane case and the heavy burden placed on the Bureau, in Tervita, to quantify all possible anticompetitive effects if they are quantifiable—which could only be done at considerable expense and would come with some margin of error. That said, there are very different views as to how to move forward. One suggestion is to simply undo Tervita with an amendment making it clear that the Tribunal must consider all effects based on the quality of the evidence provided, whether those effects have been quantified or not.43
A very different approach, taken by some, would be to remove the efficiency defense altogether.44 Some arguing for its removal, though recognizing efficiencies as a source of wealth and seeing them considered in jurisdictions using a consumer welfare standard, suggest listing efficiencies as a “factor” to be considered by the Tribunal in its review of a transaction.45 While this makes sense as a strategy to allow consideration of significant efficiencies when the evidence supports them, it does not address the uncertainty about welfare standards created by Superior Propane. What does it mean to be a factor: for example, how much weight will be put on efficiencies and will that weight depend on other circumstances surrounding the merger, for example the identity and wealth levels of the various market participants?
One specific way to make efficiencies a factor (after eliminating the defense) would be to add efficiencies to the list in S. 93 of “Factors to be considered regarding prevention or lessening of competition.” This list currently includes considerations of foreign competition in the market, barriers to entry, and the nature and extent of change and innovation in the market, among others. A complication arising from adding efficiencies to this list is that the efficiencies would (in theory) only be relevant to the extent they had an impact on a lessening of competition. The Canadian merger provisions have clearly recognized that anticompetitive effects and efficiencies are two distinct possible outcomes from a merger. A particular merger may produce neither, one, or both and when they both arise in a merger they are to be, essentially, added up. Other jurisdictions that wish to take efficiencies into account but that do not have efficiency defenses may try to work around the problem by claiming that a merger that lessens competition “in fact” (perhaps as evidenced by increasing margins) does not lessen competition “in law” if efficiencies would be such as to keep the firm from raising prices (though margins and profits have risen).46
If what is desired is to move Canadian merger review closer to the consumer welfare standard common in many other jurisdictions, perhaps a statutory statement of that standard is more direct, for example by amending the efficiency exemption to require that the efficiencies must be of sufficient scale and scope such that consumers (or other trading partners) are not harmed.
4. Market Studies
An interesting suggestion for reform that lies outside the core areas of competition enforcement relates to market studies. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) notes that “[m]arket studies can reveal previously unsuspected forms of private conduct or government regulation that impair competition. And study results can play an important role in promoting public understanding of how competition works and what benefits it produces.”47 Competition authorities around the world have different powers when it comes to conducting market studies or market inquiries. In some, the powers to work outside the bounds of regular enforcement activity are very limited. In others, the authorities may be able to conduct studies but all participation must be voluntary and the provision of information cannot be compelled. Other authorities have much stronger powers, including the power to compel participation and the provision of information. Finally, some authorities are able to order remedies based on findings in a market inquiry.48
The Bureau has powers on the weaker end of this spectrum. It has some authority to initiate studies but not compel participation or the provision of information. Adding these powers could be a valuable middle step in helping the Bureau work in the digital world.49 Short of creating new sectoral regulators, formal market study powers would enable the Bureau to launch detailed investigations into the workings of new industries that, at this point, might not be well understood. Out of the learning from such studies could come better targeted interventions, even possibly support for sectoral regulations if a study concludes that conventional competition policy tools are inadequate to the task. There could be benefits beyond the digital world from this kind of amendment. Stronger market study powers would put the Bureau in a better position to advocate across government for competition. To take a very important example, comprehensive market studies could evaluate the performance and inefficiencies of other government regulations, such as the foreign ownership limits in some sectors and the supply management programs for dairy, poultry, and eggs. The targeted regulatory authorities might even be compelled under such an amendment to provide a response to the Bureau’s findings.50
 
IV. Ahead
There is no public timetable yet for the drafting of any amendments, hearings or consultations on that draft, or the presentation of a bill to Parliament.51 This likely leaves a long road ahead. But the widespread desire to open up the Act, and the energy to debate meaningful changes, are clearly present. It would indeed be surprising if significant changes to Canada’s core competition law are not presented to Parliament and if some are not enacted. Almost all proposals seek to expand the Competition Bureau’s (or private plaintiffs’) powers, facilitate the exercise of these powers or at least argue for the status quo (i.e. no weakening of the law or enforcement). This fact, combined with the additional resources being provided by the federal government, suggests that Canadians can look forward to a heightened level of antitrust enforcement in the coming years.

18 Canada v. Canada Pipe Company Ltd., 2006 F.C.R. 233.
19 This is not to deny the more recent emergence of a view, held by some in what is called the “New Brandeis” school, that competition law should protect smaller businesses in markets with a dominant firm even when there might be a (possibly short term) cost to consumers in the form of higher prices.
20 While the Tribunal in the Laidlaw decision (after NutraSweet) held that a series of acquisitions could be an abuse of a dominant position, the Federal Court in the later Canada Pipe case reaffirmed the standard from NutraSweet. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd., [1992] 40 C.P.R.3d 289 (Comp. Trib.).
21 See, e.g. Ralph A. Winter, The Gap in Canadian Competition Law Following Canada Pipe, 27 CAN. COMPETITION L. REV. 292 (2014). The classic reference on such facilitating practices is Steven C. Salop, Practices that (Credibly) Facilitate Oligopoly Coordination, in NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS OF MARKET STRUCTURE 265 (Joseph E. Stiglitz & G. Frank Mathewson, eds., 1986). These practices can, for example, include the use of “most favored customer” and “meeting competition” clauses.

27 This is a major concern discussed in, for example, Iacobucci, supra note 7.
28 Importantly, the Commissioner bears this burden before the parties have to prove any efficiency gains.
29 See, e.g., Ralph A. Winter, Tervita and the Efficiency Defense in Canadian Merger Law, 28 CAN. COMPETITION L. REV 133 (2015) (offering “three general criticisms” of the Tervita standard).

35 These various proposals are presented in the set of submissions to Senator Wetston’s consultation here:  https://howardwetston.sencanada.ca/competition-consultation/submissions/. For example, many have suggested increasing maximum cartel fines and civil administrative monetary penalties. Some considered changes that could be made to current enforcement activity that would not require legislative amendments. For example, some commentators have urged the Bureau to consider more seriously anticompetitive effects other than those related to price—for example on quality, innovation, or privacy. See, e.g., Iacobucci, supra note 7, at 20­–23.
36 For discussion of a broader set of goals, see, for example, Iacobucci, supra note 7 and Shapiro, supra note 10. On the New Brandeis challenge to current antitrust approaches, see, for example, Herbert Hovenkamp, Is Antitrust’s Consumer Welfare Principle Imperiled? 45 J. CORP. L. 101 (2019).
37 See, e.g., Peter Glossop, A New Approach to Wage-Fixing and Anti-Poaching Employer Deals, C.D. HOWE INST. INTEL. MEMO (July 9, 2021), https://www.cdhowe.org/intelligence-memos/peter-glossop-%E2%80%93-new-approach-wage-fixing-and-anti-poaching-employer-deals.
38 The strong arguments for criminalizing buyer-side collusion notwithstanding, some have suggested that Canada move cautiously, arguing that there may be procompetitive explanations for these practices in some cases, such that per se criminal enforcement may not be appropriate. For example, a per se prohibition could catch buyer groups made up of small numbers of relatively small firms combining to achieve better supplier prices through bulk purchases. See, e.g., Chris Margison & Robin Spillette, No-Poach and Wage-Fixing Agreements in Canada – So What’s the Issue?, CPI COLUMNS – CARTELS (Mar. 29, 2021), https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/no-poach-and-wage-fixing-agreements-in-canada-so-whats-the-issue/.
39 Suggested in both Iacobucci, supra note 7 and Competition Bureau, supra note 34.
40 For some of the history here, see J.J. Camp, A Historical Perspective of a Made-in-Canada Remedy for Anticompetitive Behaviour, 31 CAN. COMPETITION L. REV. 85 (2018).
41 While not always distinguished clearly by commentators, there are two distinct powers at issue here. One would be to allow private access to the Tribunal to change a dominant firm’s behavior (e.g., through injunctions or access to an essential facility). This is currently allowed under S. 103.1 of the Act for matters related to refusals to deal, resale price maintenance, exclusive dealing, tied selling, and market restriction but not for the broader category of abuse of dominance. The second power would be to allow private parties to claim monetary damages for harms following from an abuse of dominance (and possibly the other just listed practices). Amendments then could include one of these powers or both.
42 Competition Bureau, supra note 34, § 3.4.
43 If this were the only change to the merger provisions, it might leave Canada (as prior to Tervita) with a standard close to, but not exactly, a total welfare standard. See, e.g., Thomas Ross & Ralph Winter, The Efficiency Defense in Merger Law: Economic Foundations and Recent Canadian Developments, 72 ANTITRUST L.J. 471 (2005). While there is support for reversing Tervita, support is not unanimous. For example, in its submission to Senator Wetston’s consultation, the Competition Law and Foreign Investment Review Section of the Canadian Bar Association expressed less certainty that the approach is now broken and urge further study before changes are made. Letter from Omar Wakil, Chair, Canadian Bar Ass’n Competition L. & Foreign Inv. Rev. Section, to Sen. Howard Wetston 4 (Jan. 14, 2022),  https://howardwetston.sencanada.ca/media/50758/cba-22-01-eng.pdf. Others have even more strongly defended the status quo. See, e.g., Brian Facey, Navin Joneja & David Dueck, Efficiencies Exception: Let’s Keep It, C.D. HOWE INST. INTEL. MEMO (Feb. 17, 2022), https://www.cdhowe.org/intelligence-memos/facey-joneja-dueck-efficiencies-exception-lets-keep-it.
44 Technically, S. 96 of the Act provides for an efficiency “exception” rather than “defense,” but it is commonly referred to as the efficiency defense.
45 This is a suggestion made by the Competition Bureau in its submission to Senator Wetston’s consultation, supra note 34, Recommendation 2.1, and by former Commissioner Pecman, supra note 32, at 37.
46 Thus, we could have a situation in which a merger to monopoly would be viewed as not being anticompetitive just because the efficiencies were so large—a strange outcome. Making efficiencies a factor in S. 93 would risk creating this kind of situation, though it is not clear that Canadian case law would take us to this “work-around.”
47 OECD, CANADA—UPDATED REPORT 36 (2004), https://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/prosecutionandlawenforcement/34425393.pdf.
48 For a description of the various powers related to market studies and market enquiries held by competition authorities around the world, see OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs, Competition Comm., The Role of Market Studies as a Tool to Promote Competition: Background Note by the Secretariat, DAF/COMP/GF(2016)4 (Dec. 2016), https://one.oecd.org/document/DAF/COMP/GF(2016)4/en/pdf.
49 Both the Bureau, supra note 34, and Pecman, supra note 32, among others, recommend stronger market study powers. Previous market inquiries powers in the Combines Investigation Act (S. 47) did not survive the amendments that created the Competition Act in 1986, though the Bureau has been able to conduct some studies in support of its mandate to make submissions to regulatory bodies. A notable example here is the Bureau’s examination of the fintech sector, which produced a number of suggestions for regulatory change, many of which led to action. Competition Bureau, Canada’s Progress in FinTech (Jan. 20, 2022), https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04392.html. Other commentators have urged a greater use of ex post reviews of cases (generally mergers) which might usefully be conducted under a market studies provision.
50 This is also a suggestion of the Bureau’s, supra note 34 (recommendation 7.2).
51 Change could come in stages, with some amendments proposed relatively quickly and a more substantial package put forward for consultation later.

662,"April 1, 2022",The EU’s Antitrust Lessons for America,"
By: Zach Meyers (Project Syndicate)
US corporate giants often criticize the European Commission’s aggressive competition policy, claiming that it protects inefficient European firms. Meanwhile, they applaud America’s laissez-faire antitrust policies, which regard market dominance as a reward for success and have aided the development of today’s US megafirms, especially in the tech sector.
With US President Joe Biden’s administration seeking to boost competition in order to reduce what it views as excessive corporate consolidation, this may be about to change. But the risk is that, rather than tweaking an antitrust regime that has mostly served America well, Biden may go too far in reforming it. US big business may therefore find that, in the long run, the European Union’s competition policy ends up being more predictable and reasonable than America’s.
Consider how the EU and US authorities currently regulate anti-competitive conduct by dominant firms. The European Commission, already tough, is getting even stricter – but there are checks and balances to prevent it from going too far.
For example, the Commission is increasingly concerned about large tech firms leveraging their most-used services to support less-used ones – as, for example, Microsoft does when it uses Windows to promote its search engine, Bing. But, although these practices can give big firms huge advantages over smaller competitors, they are not necessarily anti-competitive. While Bing has a small market share, it is the only meaningful challenger to Google’s near-monopoly in online search. Microsoft’s practices boost competition in this domain and should thus be welcomed, not banned…

663,"March 31, 2022",67% Of US Websites Violate EU Data Protection Law: New Study,"


The European Union has passed several laws aimed at providing digital identity protection, among them the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018.
Among the biggest violators of these protocols? American websites. According to one study, 67% of the top 1,000 websites in the United States were in violation of the GDPR.
The violations at work here vary, with 43% of websites not offering users the ability to opt out of selling data, 55% failing to notify users of cookies when they visit the site for the first time, and 32% of sites containing ad trackers.
The study pointed out that while GDPR exclusively concerns Europe, websites originating in the U.S. still sell goods and services to EU customers. This lack of compliance could have significant implications for companies unless they agree to modify their practices for European visitors. Fines for violations of the GDPR range from $80,000 to $120,000.
To help smaller app developers make sure they’re complying with the GDPR — and thus avoiding penalties they may not be able to afford — Google has launched a new platform called Checks, designed to automate GDPR compliance.
Developed by Google’s in-house incubator program, Area 120, Checks leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to scan code bases and evaluate them for privacy and other areas in which they may fall short of GDPR’s standards. In addition, the platform performs scans for compliance in the U.S. and Brazil, ensuring a significant portion of the world’s app developers are avoiding regulatory penalties.

664,"March 31, 2022",DOJ’s Kanter & FTC’s Khan Promise Stricter Merger Review,"


US antitrust chiefs voiced support for an American crackdown on gatekeeper tech giants a week after the European Union reached a deal reining in the likes of Google and Meta Platforms, reported Bloomberg.
Jonathan Kanter, the head of the Justice Department’s (DOJ) antitrust division, speaking during a conference in Brussels Thursday, said acquisitions of nascent rivals by larger players should be closely scrutinized because such deals over time risk weakening competition in the economy.
“The plain text of our merger laws in the United States demand that we have aggressive enforcement against acquisitions by firms that already possess a dominant position,” Kanter said.
Kanter is among a number of recent personnel choices who most observers have interpreted as signaling the Biden administration’s eagerness to regulate the tech industry, after the companies have flourished for years seemingly without limits or oversight. 
The US has lagged Europe in creating a tougher environment for digital behemoths. Last week, the European Union agreed on a sweeping slate of rules on how tech giants can operate in the bloc known as the Digital Markets Act.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan called the law “a landmark proposal to promote fair access to markets controlled by digital gatekeepers.”
DOJ and FTC officials have recently worked on revamping the US’s decades-old Vertical and Horizontal Merger guidelines, in efforts to adjust the rules to the rapidly changing realities of modern digital economies.

Regulators are looking to update rules, which target companies abusing their market power and those setting up illegal cartels, to make them more efficient, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday.
Under the rules, known as Regulation 1/2003 and in force since 2004, the European Commission has taken on Alphabet unit Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Intel and imposed billions of euros in fines.
The rules have also allowed the EU competition enforcer to go after car parts cartels, banks’ manipulation of financial benchmarks and other illegal price-fixing groups, putting the EU agency in the forefront of antitrust enforcement.
The Commission wants to maintain its leading position, Vestager said. “I’m announcing today that in the coming months we are going to launch an evaluation of Regulation 1/2003, the central plank of our antitrust enforcement framework,” Vestager told a conference organised by economic consultancy CRA.
“It is important that we hear the views of stakeholders concerning what has worked well, and where there is scope for more efficient and effective procedures and enforcement tools; making sure Regulation 1 is truly ‘fit for the digital age’,” she said.
Vestager said the updated rules would seek to make them more operational and useful to businesses.

The auto sector has been under strict scrutiny by antitrust regulators across the globe including China. In 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines on the Automobile Sector (the “Auto Guidelines”), which provide guidance and outline SAMR’s enforcement positions on key antitrust issues in the automotive industry. Over the past decade, SAMR and its predecessors have undertaken significant enforcement actions along the entire auto supply chain, from auto parts supply and distribution of cars to aftersales servicing. Leveraging from the existing legislation and the authority’s decisional practice, this article will discuss the main characteristics that define the new BEV era and attempt to analyze a series of antitrust issues automakers should take note when trying to gain an edge in the BEV market.

I. INTRODUCTION
China has been the top market in the world for battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”), with total BEV sales reaching nearly two million in 2020.[2] It is forecasted that the BEV sales in China will continue to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future. Three in five new cars go on China’s roads may be powered by electricity instead of fossil fuel in 2030 according to UBS, while the China government’s forecast is for a 20 percent penetration rate by 2025.[3] Key drivers of this growth include the extension of BEV state subsidies and the continued pu...

667,"March 31, 2022",New Developments in China Merger Review,"
The Chinese competition authority went through a major restructuring in November 2021. The Anti-Monopoly Bureau under the State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) was expanded to three separate bureaus to cover respectively conduct investigation, merger review and competition policy, which together constitute the new independent State Anti-Monopoly Bureau (“SAMB”) within SAMR. Looking back on the merger review cases during the past few years (2018-2022), there are some notable new trends: (1) SAMR appears to be more likely to find competition concerns in vertical and conglomerate mergers than competition authorities in other major jurisdictions; (2) FRAND supply commitments to Chinese customers have become common in most conduct remedy cases; (3) SAMR has embraced a new behavioral remedy of helping a third party to enter the market; and (4) SAMR is less willing to allow automatic sunset clauses after an initial remedy term and instead often requires parties to apply at some certain points in the future for and justify termination of the remedy conditions based on changed market conditions.

668,"March 29, 2022",US DOJ Endorses Big Tech Antitrust Bill,"
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent letters to lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle, on both the House and Senate Judiciary committees, endorsing antitrust proposals that aim to block tech giants from giving preferential treatment to their own products. 
“If enacted, we believe that this legislation has the potential to have a positive effect on dynamism in digital markets going forward. Our future global competitiveness depends on innovators and entrepreneurs having the ability to access markets free from dominant incumbents that impede innovation, competition, resiliency, and widespread prosperity,” acting Assistant Attorney General Peter Hyun wrote in the letters.
The letters were sent to top members of the Judiciary committees and the antitrust subcommittees. The letter to senators was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. 
This communication marks the Biden administration’s most direct endorsement of the American Online Innovation and Choice Act, a piece of progressive legislation that has caused waves among tech sector analysts, businesses and observers, with deep divisions over those who support and those who oppose the act’s provisions, methods, or objectives. 
The legislation would block dominant online companies, determined by user base and revenue, from preferring their own goods or discriminating against rival products on their platforms. The definition would likely mean the bill would apply to Amazon, Apple, Meta and Google, the so-called Tech Giants that have come to dominate much of our modern tech landscape. 
Read More: Publisher Trade Group Backs Two US Big Tech Antitrust Bills
The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the proposal in a bipartisan vote in January, and the House Judiciary Committee advanced a version of the bill in bipartisan vote in June as part of a raft of antitrust bills against Big Tech. 
Tech giants and industry groups representing them have lobbied heavily against the legislation. But relatively smaller tech companies, including Yelp, Sonos and Basecamp, have backed the proposal as a way to level the market.
Despite advancing out of committees with bipartisan support, the fate of the bill is still rocky. 
During January’s vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, even lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who voted in favor of advancing the bill raised concerns about the legislation they said they wanted to see addressed before supporting it on the floor.

669,"March 28, 2022",EU Sees Deal On Big Tech Rules Policing Content Coming In April,"


A deal between EU countries and the European Parliament that would require tech giants to do more to police content on their platforms could be finally clinched next month, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager proposed the Digital Services Act, (DSA) which forces tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content or risk fines up to 6% of their global turnover, just over a year ago.
EU lawmakers and national governments are now thrashing out the details, with debates remaining over the definition of an online marketplace subject to the rules and the criteria for banning targeted advertisements.
“There is a very strong momentum to get things done. And the leadership of the French presidency may allow us to finalise the Digital Services Act before the end of April. But if we work hard, and we’re lucky, it may be possible,” Vestager told Reuters in an interview.
Vestager last week secured the green light from EU countries and EU lawmakers for her other landmark proposal, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), targeting big tech like Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft.
The DMA sets out a list of do’s and don’ts and gives companies designated as online gatekeepers, which control access and data on their platforms, six months to comply with the rules. Businesses, however, say that is too short for such complex legislation. Vestager has said there would be no extensions, as companies are aware of what constitutes anti-competitive practices.
“Well, actually I think we in our work and the companies should be very happy that we have six months because it was one of the things that were intensively discussed during the negotiations,” she said.

670,"March 28, 2022",No Antitrust Concerns Over Cloud Computing Yet: Vestager,"


Cloud computing, in which Amazon and Microsoft are the biggest players followed by Alphabet’s Google, doesn’t pose competition concerns yet because of Europe’s Gaia-X initiative, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Cloud computing services have seen demand soar, driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.
They have become a big driver of growth at the big tech companies, with AWS generating 13% of Amazon’s revenue last year and 74% of its operating income while Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of its overall sales.
The market power of the big companies has sparked unease at smaller rivals in recent years, with German software provider NextCloud, France’s OVHcloud and two other companies filing complaints about Microsoft’s cloud practices to Vestager.
“No, so far we’ve had no concerns,” Vestager told Reutersin an interview when asked if she was worried about companies potentially abusing their dominance.
She said Gaia-X, a project to create secure and efficient cloud data that seeks to reduce the EU bloc’s dependence on Silicon Valley giants, would boost competition.
“This is not something that we are engaged in, but I basically see it as pro-competitive when you have someone to show potential customers that there are more than two giants where you can place your business,” she said.

671,"March 27, 2022",Tech Giants Rail Against Landmark Digital Markets Act,"


The European Union’s newly-unveiled Digital Markets Act (DMA) is being blasted by big technology companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon for being more aggressive than originally anticipated, Financial Times reported on Friday (March 25).
Europe’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager won backing from EU members and lawmakers for the legislation, which requires gatekeeper firms to abandon anti-competitive practices or face fines of up to 20% of revenue for repeat offenses. The DMA goes into effect in October; if violated, it could lead to the breakup of offending big tech companies. 
Under the measure, for example, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, as well as Google, will no longer be allowed to offer targeted ads using people’s data across multiple platforms without receiving explicit consent.

“Faced with big online platforms behaving like they were ‘too big to care,’ Europe has put its foot down,” Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, told the New York Times. “We are putting an end to the so-called Wild West dominating our information space. A new framework that can become a reference for democracies worldwide.”
Apple said that the DMA opens its users to privacy and security weaknesses and prevents the company from collecting payment for “intellectual property in which we invest a great deal.”

672,"March 25, 2022","Final DMA: Now We Know Where We’re Going, but We Still Don’t Know Why","
By: Lazar Radic (Truth On The Market)
After years of debate and negotiations, European Lawmakers have agreed upon what will most likely be the final iteration of the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), following the March 24 final round of “trilogue” talks. 
For the uninitiated, the DMA is one in a string of legislative proposals around the globe intended to “rein in” tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple through mandated interoperability requirements and other regulatory tools, such as bans on self-preferencing. Other important bills from across the pond include the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, the ACCESS Act, and the Open App Markets Act. 
In many ways, the final version of the DMA represents the worst possible outcome, given the items that were still up for debate. The Commission caved to some of the Parliament’s more excessive demands—such as sweeping interoperability provisions that would extend not only to “ancillary” services, such as payments, but also to messaging services’ basic functionalities. Other important developments include the addition of voice assistants and web browsers to the list of Core Platform Services (“CPS”), and symbolically higher “designation” thresholds that further ensure the act will apply overwhelmingly to just U.S. companies. On a brighter note, lawmakers agreed that companies could rebut their designation as “gatekeepers,” though it remains to be seen how feasible that will be in practice. 
We offer here an overview of the key provisions included in the final version of the DMA and a reminder of the shaky foundations it rests on…

673,"March 25, 2022",EU Lawmakers Agree On New Rules To Take On Big Tech,"
The new European Digital Markets Act which aims to rein in Big Tech may enter into force by the end of the year after the EU institutions reached an agreement on Thursday on the final text of the bill. 
While most of the debate has focused on the definition of gatekeepers — Big Tech firms that meet certain size and revenue thresholds (i.e. Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft) — little attention has been paid to the concept of “emerging gatekeepers.”
Yet this concept may gain relevance as the digital space evolves and companies’ presence in Europe grows. This subcategory of gatekeepers may be the perfect solution for regulators to monitor the market and impose gradual obligations on companies as they become more important in their core platform services. 
But first, what is a gatekeeper? According to the DMA, a provider of a core platform service shall be a gatekeeper if it meets three conditions. It must have significant impact on the internal market, defined by an annual turnover of at least €7.5 billion within the European Union (EU) in the past three years or a market valuation of at least €75 billion. It must also serve as an important gateway for business users, which is met if the company has 45 million monthly end users and at least 10,000 business users established in the EU. Lastly, it must enjoy an entrenched and durable position in its operations or will enjoy such position in the future, quantified as 45 million monthly end users for at least three years. 
The last prong of this trident, “will enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the near future,” is rather vague, but it would allow the European Commission to follow companies that are growing fast and impose measures before that position becomes more permanent. The Commission may use this concept as a traffic light to modulate the obligations a company should face when it is on track to become a gatekeeper. 
The original draft of the DMA doesn’t contain a specific definition of “emerging gatekeeper,” but the introduction provides a good understanding of the purpose of this term. 
“For gatekeepers that have been designated by the Commission as likely to enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the near future, the Commission should only impose those obligations that are necessary and appropriate to prevent that the gatekeeper concerned achieves an entrenched and durable position in its operations. With respect to such emerging gatekeepers, the Commission should take into account that this status is in principle of a temporary nature, and it should therefore be decided at a given moment whether such a provider of core platform services should be subjected to the full set of gatekeeper obligations because it has acquired an entrenched and durable position, or conditions for designation are ultimately not met and therefore all previously imposed obligations should be waived.” 
Therefore, the Commission seems to have an important tool to avoid companies circumventing the rules if they don’t fully meet the quantitative criteria set in the law. For instance, if a company doesn’t meet the users thresholds but it is controlling a core platform service, may be subject to some of the gatekeeper obligations.  
According to a press release from the Council, the latest agreement will include in the text of the law a new category of “emerging gatekeeper,” and it may offer more information about when a company may have this status, rather than leaving this definition completely at the discretion of the European Commission.  
The real question is, who may be an “emerging gatekeeper”? For instance, companies that are competing with Big Tech but are not yet at the same level, like TikTok, whose revenue and user base don’t meet the gatekeeper criteria — or Booking.com, which may just be near the limit to qualify as gatekeeper.

Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai will meet Europe’s antitrust chief on March 30 to discuss competition and digital issues, a European Commission official said on Thursday.
Alphabet confirmed the meeting with the EU’s top competition official.
Margrethe Vestager has handed out more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in fines to the world’s most popular internet search engine in the last decade for hindering rivals in shopping comparison websites and online search advertising, and over its Android mobile operating system.
She is also investigating Alphabet unit Google’s digital advertising business and its online display advertising deal with Meta Platforms Inc. As part of its investigation, the CMA will consider whether an agreement between Google and Meta (previously Facebook) – which Google internally codenamed “Jedi Blue” – broke the law. This secret pact was the focus of an investigation in the United States looking into the claim that Google executives “induced” senior Facebook staff to agree to a plan to undermine competition in digital advertising.
Vestager has also proposed rules that could force Google and other US tech giants to change their core business models. The new European Digital Markets Act which aims to rein in Big Tech may enter into force by the end of the year after the EU institutions reached an agreement on Thursday on the final text of the bill.

675,"March 24, 2022",Antitrust Chronicle® – Asia Pacific: Opportunities & Challenges,"
Dear Readers,
This edition of the CPI Antitrust Chronicle® sets out recent antitrust enforcement, policy and legislative developments and trends in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region. The APAC region represents one of the most dynamic geographic regions in the world economy in recent years, as it occupies an increasingly important role in global supply chains and world geopolitics. As a result, practitioners are well-advised to keep their finger on the pulse of developments in this region across all policy areas, including in particular antitrust.
Antitrust is a growth area in APAC. As Ruben Maximiano, Wouter Meester & Leni Papa outline, APAC includes a mix of well-established, experienced competition authorities, including those from OECD member countries (Australia, Korea, Japan, and New Zealand) and a larger number of younger authorities. As the authors outline, each authority is at a distinct stage in the maturity of the development of its competition enforcement practice, as is reflected in the activities of its authorities, particularly in terms of competition advocacy. In particular, as the authors set out in detail, APAC authorities’ advocacy activities are becoming more pronounced as the region emerges from the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
APAC is no different from the rest of the world insofar as it is grappling with the conundrum of how to apply competition principles to the ever-dynamic tech sector. Perhaps unsurprisingly, APAC countr...

Recognizing the economic opportunity and potential Asia-Pacific countries offer, the present article seeks to leverage competition advocacy tools for building and strengthening competition culture in particular and overall socio-economic improvement, as a whole. The second section of the paper highlights a few Asia-Pacific region-specific illustrations of such competition advocacy tools, before segueing into the fundamental role a competition policy can play. Lastly, the challenges faced by developing countries which have to be considered before incorporating the advocacy tools are highlighted. The article is a global call for the incorporation of active competition advocacy in Asia-Pacific regions.

The Asia-Pacific region presents multiple opportunities as global supply chains are heavily dependent on it and in fact, now forms the center of gravity of the global economy.[2]  
In economic terms, this region accounts for almost 37 percent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”), at purchasing power parity[3] and being the largest regional economy, it is estimated to account for more than half the world’s GDP.[4] Moreover, with the recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (“RCEP”) of the Asia-Pacific, the trade effects are estimated to spiral by approximately two percent, i.e. to the tune of nearly USD 42bn.[5]

677,"March 24, 2022",Big Data Markets and Competition Law in Asia,"
The sheer size of e-commerce markets in Asia and their projected growth are remarkable. South Korea’s projected e-commerce revenues in 2025, for example, are comparable to France and Italy, and Indonesia’s projected revenues exceed Italy’s. Further, key parameters such as consumer behavior related to the frequency of online shopping, use of mobile phones to conduct online transactions, and the number of mobile phone users are often significantly higher than those observed in many developed countries. As consumer and business online transactions increase, the amount of Big Data accumulated and analyzed by e-commerce firms and platforms increases dramatically. This setting in many Asian economies offers an opportunity to take a deeper look at the potential competition problems that may emerge due to consolidation of Big Data. After discussing the scale and scope of e-commerce markets and related attributes, this article presents some competition law initiatives in selected Asian countries. While many competition authorities have concerns about consolidation of Big Data and its effects on M&As, firms’ behavior that may result in dominance, and potentially algorithmic collusion, they are also cognizant of the innovations these firms and emerging markets bring to their countries and consumer welfare.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an economic recession in most countries around the world with global GDP declining by 3.4 percent in 2020 (OECD, 2021[2]). Governments have implemented far-reaching measures with the objective to contain the effects of the virus, mitigate its economic impact and boost economic recovery. Such measures have been diverse in scale, scope, and objectives. For instance, they have focused on specific industries or companies or on the economy as a whole and have, intentionally or not, temporary or long-lasting effects on the economy. Competition authorities, through their advocacy efforts, can play an important role in ensuring that these measures lead to a faster and more sustained recovery. Firstly, their expertise in how markets function positions them well to provide support in the development, implementation and phasing out of government measures by avoiding or minimizing com...

Over the past several decades, tech companies have innovated to provide great products to consumers for free. While most people are happy about this, politicians seem not to be. Driven by the perception that tech needs fixing, in the U.S., Europe, and recently Asia, politicians have begun proposing disruptive antitrust legislation targeting tech companies. Many of these proposals seek, in some form, to limit “self-preferencing” by tech companies on digital platforms. Others seek to constrain tech companies with online platforms from merging with or acquiring other online products and services. These proposals threaten the business models that have made these great products free to consumers, and risk harming developers by increasing fragmentation and raising the cost of capital.

Legislators across the world have been struck by the urge to dictate how online marketplaces are run. In December 2020, the European Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), which proposes to regulate everything from how online services can conduct rankings to what services they must make interoperable. In 2021, both houses of the U.S. Congress followed suit with a barrage of legislative proposals, some based on the DMA and others adding new restrictions and requirements.

This article presents propositions about competition and transparency in the mobile ecosystem consisting of various submarkets. Facilitating competition is a major goal of competition policy. The view is stated herein not only for competition within individual submarkets of the mobile ecosystem, but also for competition across multiple submarkets. Moreover, the author insists on the importance of transparency in the ecosystem for better decision-making by involved parties therein, leading to the remarkable conclusion that enhancing transparency matters also in terms of cross-market competition. Transparency can facilitate cross-market competition between distinct platforms that have dominant power in their respective submarkets. Discussions are devoted mainly to two submarkets of the mobile ecosystem: the application (app) stores market and the mobile advertising market.

682,"March 23, 2022",Revising the Competition Law Rulebook for Digital Markets in Europe: An Update,"

By Kris Van Hove, Argyrios Papaefthymiou, and Margot Vogels1
 
I. Introduction
The present article provides an update of the ongoing process taking place in Europe that is reshaping competition law to bring it up to speed with the digital era. It follows on from a previous CPI Europe article published in October 2020 on the same subject.2 That article set the scene by: (i) identifying the perceived shortcomings of competition law enforcement in the digital sector in Europe; and (ii) discussing the various approaches being considered to tackle them. Since the publication of this first article, various legislative initiatives have been launched that have turned the reflective discourse into concrete action. For instance, in December 2020, the European Commission (“Commission”) published its Proposal for a Digital Markets Act3 (“DMA Proposal”). This proposal seeks to ensure fair and open digital markets by imposing stringent requirements on so-called “gatekeeper” platforms. The inter-institutional deliberations on this key piece of EU legislation are now in their final stretch, with adoption expected sometime in April of this year.
In short, we now have tangible regulatory reforms in the open, at the level of both the EU and national jurisdictions, as well as a flurry of recent enforcement action and judicial developments in “digital antitrust.” It is therefore time to take stock of the concrete regulatory approaches presently being considered to tackle competition law concerns in the tech sector, as well as of the recent developments in the enforcement of “classic” competition law relating to these same concerns. From the “mosaic” of these different yet parallel workstreams, the hope is to shed further light on the precise extent to which a material need for new rules specific to the digital sector actually arises, as well as to assess the adequacy of the approaches that are currently on the table to target the perceived concerns.
  
II. Self-Preferencing and Interoperability
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Self-preferencing can be defined as a practice engaged in by a platform operator that gives preferential treatment to this operator’s products and services when they compete with products and services of other entities using the platform. This type of practice has featured prominently from the outset of the ongoing debate on digital competition policy. Despite continuous controversy among policymakers, practitioners, and academics on the merits of a “self-preferencing” theory of harm, this type of conduct is vigorously scrutinized by competition authorities in Europe and is the behavior most  closely associated with competition concerns attributed to the practices of Big Tech companies.
For instance, the Commission’s engagement with self-preferencing nowadays spans from antitrust enforcement to sector inquiries.4 But self-preferencing is also targeted as particularly pernicious behavior under newly proposed as well as existing sector-specific regulation for Big Tech. First, under the DMA Proposal, gatekeepers5 would be prohibited from ranking their own products and services more favorably than those of third parties.6 The DMA Proposal would also create interoperability obligations.7 These obligations are often presented as potential remedies to self-preferencing practices, when the latter are implemented via “closed systems” that indirectly foreclose competitors on one or more levels of the supply chain.
Second, self-preferencing rules have also recently been enacted (e.g. in Germany) or are under consideration (e.g. in Italy) in various national jurisdictions across Europe.8 In Germany and Italy, competition authorities could prohibit an undertaking of paramount significance for competition from treating the offers of competitors differently from its own offers when providing access to supply and sales markets. Finally, in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) Digital Markets Unit (“DMU”) would be able to impose pro-competitive interventions (or “PCIs”), in the form of “consumer choice and defaults intervention,” on undertakings designated as having “strategic market status” (“SMS”), which is defined as a “substantial, entrenched market power in at least one digital activity, providing the undertaking with a strategic position.”9 These PCIs could be used to address concerns relating to the architecture of a service which influences the consumer’s decision-making.10
B. Enforcement and Judicial Developments in the Fight against Self-preferencing: Luxembourg finally Weighs In
Beyond the legislative and policy initiatives that target self-preferencing with novel tools, the self-preferencing theory of harm is also making headway in the conventional track of abuse of dominance enforcement.
The much-awaited General Court judgment in Case T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission (Google Shopping), issued on 10 November 2021,11 is indisputably the most important recent case law development in the ongoing process of delineating the exact contours of the self-preferencing theory of harm. The case centered on the question of whether Google had abused its dominant position in the market for online general search services to favor its own comparison shopping services over competing services.
The General Court’s judgment is, of course, still subject to appeal before the European Court of Justice. This said, the importance of the judgment cannot be overstated: the very validity of self-preferencing as a self-standing antitrust theory of harm – let alone the particulars of its application in individual factual scenarios – has been the subject of controversy. Critical opinions have invariably been expressed among EU competition law commentators, from the view that self-preferencing is merely a natural – if not intended and efficiency-enhancing – outcome of vertical integration (so that sanctioning self-preferencing would be tantamount to sanctioning vertical integration itself), to the view that, even if some antitrust harm may be identified in what is dubbed “self-preferencing,” this could nevertheless easily fit within existing theories of harm, such as a refusal to supply an indispensable input/a refusal to access an “essential facility.”
The General Court takes a rather straightforward position in the debate on the validity of self-preferencing as a self-standing category of abusive conduct, viewing self-preferencing as, in effect, one of various possible manifestations of “abusive leveraging.” In doing so, the Court has rejected Google’s argumentation to the effect that the conduct at issue should have been examined by the Commission through the prism of the “refusal to supply” theory of harm. The Court did not see, in the conduct at issue, the key constituent elements of a refusal to supply warranting the application of the Bronner12 criteria, namely: (i) an express refusal following a request or otherwise expression of the wish to access the infrastructure at issue, and (ii) the exclusionary effect being principally predicated on this refusal, and not on a separate practice (such as an independent “leveraging abuse”). According to the Court, EU case law indicates that the Bronner criteria do not necessarily apply when assessing the potential abusive nature of conduct beyond the set confines of a refusal to supply, such as the supply of services to competitors on disadvantageous terms.
The most tangible consequence of the Court’s reasoning is that the analysis of whether or not Google’s general search results page is, in fact, an “essential facility” – to which Google could be mandated to provide access subject to the fulfilment of the Bronner criteria (elimination of competition if access is not provided, and indispensability of the “infrastructure” for other market players to be able to compete) – is not a necessary component of the legal test to determine the potential abusive nature of the conduct. In fact, although the Court views Google’s general search results as having “characteristics akin to those of an essential facility […], inasmuch as there is currently no actual or potential substitute available that would enable it to be replaced in an economically viable manner on the market,” it finds that the Commission was not required to establish that the Bronner criteria were satisfied. The Court reasoned that the Commission had identified a form of abusive leveraging that amounted to “‘active’ behavior in the form of positive acts of discrimination in the treatment of the results of Google’s comparison shopping service, which are promoted within its general results pages, and the results of competing comparison shopping services, which are prone to being demoted.”13
In a way, Google got the “worst of both worlds”. Its general search engine is considered “essential enough” to mandate increased scrutiny of any possibly disadvantageous treatment; yet the conduct at issue was not considered a classic refusal to supply, so that the Bronner criteria – which place a rather high threshold to establish a refusal to supply – were not applicable.
In an also very interesting (if somewhat nebulous) refrain, the Court noted that Google, in favoring its own comparison shopping services and simultaneously demoting competing services, engaged in conduct that entailed “a certain form of abnormality.”14 The Court made this finding based on the rationale that the ability to showcase results from multiple and diverse sources is an inherent element of a general search engine’s business model. In conjunction with the rather bold statement that a general principle of equal treatment in EU law is applicable in the context of Article 102 TFEU, the Court concluded that the practice by which Google favored its own comparison shopping service over competing  services amounted to a self-standing form of abusive conduct. That conduct consisted in the abusive leveraging of Google’s dominant position in the market for online general search results to provide less favorable treatment to certain search results, based on the origin of the results, that is, based on whether the results originated from Google’s own comparison shopping service or from a rival comparison shopping service. In this context, little relief or legal certainty is derived from the Court’s phrasing that “certain differences in treatment may be considered contrary to Article 102 TFEU when what is at issue are favoring practices established by operators in a dominant position in the internet sector.”15 Although this seems to imply that not all differences in treatment will be considered abusive in breach of Article 102 TFEU, the Court’s judgment provides little in terms of clarity as to where the line might be drawn in this respect.
The Google Shopping judgment unarguably represents a pivotal moment in the broader ongoing discourse on the review of competition law norms as applied to digital markets. The notion of self-preferencing has now been recognized by the EU judiciary (subject to reaffirmation by the Court of Justice) as an independent, self-standing category of abusive conduct, and thus not subject to the specific conditions of the refusal to supply / essential facilities doctrine (i.e. the Bronner test).
What is more, as the General Court pointedly noted in Google Shopping:
“[I]t is for the national courts and authorities to apply Article 102 TFEU uniformly and in accordance with the case-law of the Courts of the European Union, since divergences between the courts and authorities of the Member States as to its application would be liable to place in jeopardy the unity of the EU legal order and to undermine legal certainty.”16
To appreciate the potential impact of this comment, one only needs to consider the number of ongoing antitrust investigations and court cases within the EU at the national level, which revolve around practices whereby a vertically integrated undertaking is providing some form of favorable treatment to a proprietary product / service as compared to the equivalent product / service provided through that undertaking (e.g. a digital platform) by third parties. The necessary deference of national competition authorities and courts towards the approach of EU courts means that, if the General Court’s position is upheld by the Court of Justice, a series of infringement decisions from national authorities can be expected, if not a further proliferation of antitrust complaints against digital “gatekeepers” for similar practices.
C. Takeaways: Unlawfulness of Self-preferencing Becoming a fait accompli
Reading through the rundown of recent intense enforcement action on the basis of the self-preferencing theory of harm, one might reasonably wonder whether an ex ante approach in this respect (as most clearly reflected in the DMA) is truly necessary and/or proportional to the perceived competitive concerns associated with the practices falling within the ambit of self-preferencing. Both the Commission and EU national competition authorities (“NCAs”) as well as the CMA seem to be more than adequately stepping up to the challenge of reviewing and sanctioning this type of practice with ex post enforcement of classic antitrust rules regarding abuse of dominance.
Relatively more critical voices may argue that the Commission is trying, through the DMA, to circumvent the procedural safeguards laid out by EU competition law (notably in Regulation No. 1/2003)17, taking a horizontal stance that practices falling within the broader “self-preferencing” category are presumptively anti-competitive. Such a stance is economically dubious. Self-preferencing may, at least in a multitude of possible manifestations, be viewed as a perfectly valid outcome of vertical integration (without which, in fact, the incentives of firms to vertically integrate, with the corollary efficiencies that may come with such integration, may not arise in the first place).18 In this context, the establishment of what seems an awful lot like a legal presumption that self-preferencing is inherently anti-competitive (thereby also placing the burden on companies that implement practices that may be construed as such, to prove that these practices do not restrict competition), may be considered a step too far, in the direction of dictating to companies what business model they should adopt, in order to accommodate their rivals. That, of course, is not in line with the prime directive of competition law, which is to uphold competition on the merits.
 
III. Data-related Practices
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Data is indisputably acquiring an ever-increasing status of importance within the broader competitive process. This trend is even more prevalent in the realm of digital platforms, whose intensive use generates vast amounts of data, including both personal data (which remain relatively constant over time) and dynamic data (which relate to interactions with content and other users).
Illustrating the pressing nature of the competition concerns arising from data-related practices, the DMA Proposal would impose a comparatively large number of data­-sharing obligations aimed at loosening the tight grip that gatekeepers allegedly exert on user data. Primarily, gatekeepers would have to refrain from using, in competition with business users, non-public data generated by the activities of business users on the gatekeeper’s core platform services.19] Moreover, gatekeepers would have to grant a business user effective, real-time access to data provided for, or generated in the context of, the use of the gatekeeper’s core platform services by that business user and the end user engaged with the products or services provided by the business user.20 To allow for easier switching between platforms’ services, the DMA Proposal creates a data portability right for business users (in addition to end users) regarding the data generated through the activities of those users.21 Finally, in a provision designed to address one of the sources of their market power, gatekeepers would be prohibited from combining personal data sourced from their core platform services with personal data from any other services, unless the end user has provided consent.22
Similar rules have been enacted (e.g. in Germany) or are under consideration (e.g. in Italy) at national level.23 For its part, the UK DMU would be able to impose PCIs that should ensure greater end-user control over the end user’s data and that mandate third-party access to data. Additionally, the DMU would be able to oblige SMS undertakings to separate data silos.24
B. Data-related Theories of Harm take Center Stage
Competition authorities in the EU are taking their cue from policy makers, increasingly placing data-related concerns at the epicenter of antitrust enforcement actions. The tempo in this area has been set by the German Facebook case, relating to the social network giant’s data collection practices, and more specifically its combination / integration of data from different sources (e.g. the Facebook Like and Share button functionalities along with the – also Facebook/Meta-owned – WhatsApp and Instagram apps and third-party websites), without the explicit consent of Facebook users to the processing of such combined data. With breach of relevant privacy laws (notably the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) being at the core of the theory of harm proposed by the Bundeskartellamt, the case’s development into a saga was anything but surprising: on appeal, the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf halted the implementation of the NCA’s decision via interim proceedings (after Facebook had applied for suspension of the decision’s execution); the Federal Supreme Court (“Bundesgerichtshof”) went on to reinstate the decision’s immediate implementation; and, in the main proceedings on appeal, the Düsseldorf Court decided in March 2021 to refer seven questions to the Court of Justice, mainly revolving around the interpretation of the GDPR, particularly in the context of (i) the German NCA’s competence to establish breaches of the privacy regulation, and (ii) the manner in, and weight with, which GDPR infringements may play into an antitrust law assessment.25 Facebook is also facing a £ 2.3 billion data-related antitrust class action claim before the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal, on behalf of approximately 44 million UK consumers, for an alleged abuse of dominance in the form of unlawful exploitation of consumers’ personal data.26
Competition authorities in other EU jurisdictions are also increasingly following suit with their own investigations into Big Tech’s data-related practices. On 26 November 2021, the AGCM announced the imposition of € 10 million in fines on both Apple and Google for breach of the Italian Consumer Code, in relation to practices involving the collection of data from consumers and the insufficient compliance with the related obligation to adequately inform consumers of said data collection and obtain their prior informed consent.27 Both companies have announced that they will be appealing the Italian authority’s decision. Especially in the case of Apple, this decision probably strikes a particularly sensitive chord, given the company’s proverbial refrain of a privacy-focused comparative advantage vis-à-vis its competitors, ostensibly thanks to its closed-system architecture.
In a similar vein as the AGCM’s infringement decision on Apple’s and Google’s data collection practices, the French data privacy authority (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés or “CNIL”) announced on 6 January 2022 fines of € 60 million and € 150 million on Facebook and Google respectively, for indirectly restricting users’ freedom to reject cookies. The CNIL took issue in particular with the discrepancy between, on the one hand, the ease of accepting cookies on the two companies’ French websites, requiring the push of a single button, and on the other hand, the relatively more complex process of rejecting cookies, which required that a user go through a number of prompts to reach the intended rejection. The CNIL found that this practice was in breach of the French Data Protection Act.
C. Takeaways: Consumer Protection, Privacy and Competition Law Continue to Find Common Ground in Data-related Antitrust Considerations 
The enforcement record on data-related practices so far does not always have competition law as its legal basis. We are increasingly seeing infringement decisions against GAFAM companies with regard to data-related practices on the basis of national consumer protection and data privacy legislation. However, in light of the increasing invocation of data-related language by competition authorities to substantiate competitive harm (most characteristic example in this respect being the German Facebook case), these cases, and their adjudication at the appeal level, are likely to influence the evolution of thinking on data-related theories of harm in the competition law space in the near future. This is even more so given that we are now in anticipation of the opinion of the Court of Justice – in its capacity as the highest authority on the interpretation of EU law – on questions that go directly at the core of the privacy/antitrust nexus.
  
IV. Retail Most-Favored-Nation (“MFN”) Clauses
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
Most-favored-nation (“MFN”) clauses are traditionally divided into two categories:
(i.) “narrow” MFNs, which provide that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website (but can do so on other platforms); and
(ii.) “wide” MFNs, which provide that the seller may not offer better terms and conditions on its own website or on any other platform.
In particular, MFNs imposed by providers of online intermediation services, such as marketplaces or price comparison tools, and relating to the conditions under which business users offer goods or services to end users, are commonly referred to as “retail MFNs.” From a competition policy perspective, wide retail MFNs are generally considered more problematic than narrow retail MFNs. At its core, the differentiation traces back to the idea that MFNs may have certain efficiency benefits due to the prevention of free-riding behavior: a provider of online intermediation services will often undertake significant investments (in e.g. advertising and marketing), which would be undermined if, once informed by the intermediation services, the consumer then proceeds to make a final purchase on the seller’s own website because the latter charges a lower price. Although this rationale might, exceptionally, justify a narrow retail MFN, wide retail MFNs are generally considered too disproportionately restrictive to benefit from an efficiency exemption.
The Commission’s draft revised Vertical Block Exemption Regulation28 (“Draft Revised VBER”) excludes wide retail MFNs in favor of online intermediation services from the benefit of the safe harbor. Wide MFNs require a buyer of online intermediation services not to offer, sell or resell goods or services to end users (final consumers or other undertakings) under more favorable conditions using competing online intermediation services.29 As a result of the proposed change, the legality of wide retail MFNs in favor of online intermediation services would be subject to a self-assessment.
The UK may well take a slightly stricter stance on what the CMA prefers to call parity obligations. Unlike the Commission, the CMA has recommended that wide retail MFNs should be viewed as hardcore restrictions regardless of whether they apply to online or offline intermediation services.30
Gatekeepers, for their part, will not have to think twice about concluding wide MFNs in respect of their online intermediation services. According to the Commission, MFNs between gatekeepers and their business users deter the latter from using alternative online intermediation channels, which in turn limits inter-platform contestability, and therefore choice for end users. For this reason, the DMA Proposal will outright ban wide MFNs concluded with the business users of online intermediation services.31 The European Parliament even considers that this prohibition should extend to narrow MFNs.32
B. German Federal Supreme Court Leads the Way against MFNs
The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) might be sympathetic to the idea of a rigidly harsh stance against MFNs. On 18 May 2021, the Court confirmed a 2015 decision of the Bundeskartellamt which found that the online hotel reservation platform operator Booking.com had infringed competition law by imposing narrow MFN clauses.33 Through the narrow retail MFNs at issue, Booking.com obtained a commitment from hotel owners operating through its platform to refrain from providing on their own websites lower prices or otherwise better terms than the ones offered on the platform. The German NCA found these clauses to constitute an anti-competitive vertical restraint, in breach of Article 101(1) TFEU and Section 1 of the German Competition Act.
The Bundesgerichtshof disagreed with the OLG Düsseldorf’s key premise that there was a significant free-riding problem that could best be addressed via the narrow retail MFNs. The German Supreme Court highlighted that the main prerequisite for an ancillary restraint to be exempted from the prohibition of Article 101(1) TFEU is that the restraint must be objectively necessary and indispensable for implementing the main activity covered by the agreement, which it did not consider to be the case for the narrow retail MFNs at issue. The Court seemed to consider that the narrow retail MFN was not a fundamental prerequisite for the existence of the distribution agreement itself, as the Bundeskartellamt had viewed it. In the Court’s view, the fact alone that, according to evidence from the Bundeskartellamt’s investigation, Booking.com had not only retained, but actually consolidated its market position after it stopped implementing the clauses at issue, was enough to reject the notion that the clauses were objectively necessary and therefore not an ancillary restraint.
C. Takeaways: Pressure Mounts against Price Parity Clauses of all Shapes and Sizes
The German Federal Supreme Court’s decision in Booking.com has marked the first time that MFNs have been adjudicated at the highest judicial rank within an EU jurisdiction. What is more, the ruling dispels the commonly held view that narrow price parity clauses are “safer” from a competition law perspective than wide MFNs (whereby the supplier – in the Booking.com context, the hotel owner – would be precluded from providing better terms anywhere else, i.e. not only on its own website, but through any other platforms). The key premise behind this differentiation has always been the “free-rider” line of argumentation (which ostensibly might provide some merit to the conditional lawfulness of narrow MFNs). Yet, this reasoning has now been dealt a serious blow by the German Federal Supreme Court. With no case law available in this respect at the highest EU level (i.e. the European Court of Justice), this judgment by the German Federal Supreme Court is the “next best thing”, and is therefore likely to provide the necessary impetus to NCAs in other EU jurisdictions to pursue narrow price parity clauses in a more vigorous manner, at least to the extent that they fall outside the safe harbor of the Verticals Block Exemption Regulation.
In any event, the regulatory mélange of stricter and relatively looser approaches to MFNs in Europe, may inevitably nudge companies to take the safer option of refraining from the implementation of such clauses altogether. This is unfortunate given the efforts the Commission is undertaking to clarify its position with respect to the legality of MFNs in the Draft Revised VBER and the draft revised Vertical Guidelines (“Draft Revised VGL”) 34. More clarity from the European Court of Justice in this respect would be most welcome.
 
V. Online Sales Restrictions
A. Concerns and Regulatory Response
As a general rule, every distributor must be allowed to sell its products and services over the internet. From a competition law perspective, vertical competition rules assimilate making products and services available online to passive sales, while the use of certain promotional and advertisement strategies over the internet is considered to constitute active sales.35 Furthermore, while restrictions of active sales are generally permissible under certain conditions, restrictions of passive sales are not.36 Accordingly, under the Draft Revised VBER and Draft Revised VGL, restrictions on certain methods of selling or advertising online will be block exempted, as long as they do not amount to an effective ban on online sales.37 As a matter of fact, the Commission proposes to broaden the range of online sales practices which would be block exempted, including some that are currently considered hardcore restrictions. Similarly, the CMA has already indicated in its final Recommendations for a UK Order replacing the retained Vertical Agreements Block Exemption Regulation that it is inclined to treat as active sales certain categories of online sales which are currently assimilated to passive sales.38
Another major change in the Commission’s approach to online restrictions relates to dual pricing: under the revised draft rules, a supplier may validly charge a hybrid buyer different wholesale prices for products to be resold online and those to be resold offline, so long as this difference reflects differences in the costs incurred in each sales channel at retail level and does not have the object of preventing online sales.39
The Commission, however, takes a stricter stance on restrictions on the use of specific advertising channels, such as price comparison websites and advertising on search engines. While a supplier could validly prohibit the use of one specific price comparison tool or search engine without losing the benefit of the block exemption, for example to protect its brand or fight against counterfeiting,40 a ban on using all most widely used advertising services could amount to preventing the use of the internet and, if so, would therefore not be block exempted.41 Likewise, a ban on the use of the suppliers’ trademarks or brand names for bidding to be referenced in online search advertising services would effectively prevent the buyer from selling over the internet and is for that reason considered problematic.42
Finally, the Commission is also stricter as far as online intermediation service providers are concerned. Under the Draft Revised VBER, the Commission categorizes online intermediation services as suppliers. Accordingly, the Draft Revised VGL clarify that online intermediation services cannot in principle qualify as “genuine agents” for the purposes of Article 101 TFEU.
B. The Italian Apple/Amazon Case: Platform Bans in the Spotlight 
In an interesting development in antitrust enforcement against online sales restrictions, Italy’s AGCM imposed in late 2021 fines of € 58.6 million and € 114.7 million on Amazon and Apple respectively, for an Article 101 TFEU infringement related to the distribution of Apple products via Amazon Marketplace.43 The Italian NCA’s decision centers around the fact that Apple allowed Amazon itself and a limited number of resellers to distribute Apple-branded and Beats-branded products (Beats being an Apple subsidiary) over Amazon Marketplace. Amazon was thus in fact acting as a hybrid platform, in that it provided intermediation services to Apple resellers, while also acting as an Apple reseller itself. The AGCM noted that the selection process for distributors was arbitrary, without any consideration for objective, qualitative criteria. The Italian NCA thus considered the relevant agreements to be in breach of Article 101 TFEU, as they restricted intra-brand competition by unjustifiably discriminating in favor of a select few resellers.
This case presents a particular novelty in terms of the competition law assessment of platform bans. Such bans are not considered hardcore restrictions of competition under the EU case law in Coty44 and may therefore benefit from the safe harbor of the VBER. Yet, the AGCM in this case considered that the limitations on distribution at issue constituted restrictions of competition by object, given that – according to the authority – the relevant agreements had as their object to hinder the access to Amazon Marketplace of undertakings that were lawfully authorized to resell Apple’s products. The Italian NCA made this finding even though the resellers at issue were still allowed to sell on online platforms / marketplaces in general, except for Amazon.it. The AGCM also identified a cross-border element to the restriction at issue, as it found that the selection process discriminated based on the reseller’s country of establishment, in fact favoring resellers without significant export activities (thus, in effect, favoring Italian resellers). The cross-border restriction element may have accentuated the discriminatory nature of the restriction in the NCA’s view, thus leading to the finding of a “by-object” restriction. Finally, the Italian NCA also conducted a separate effects analysis and found that the online sales restrictions concerned amounted to restrictions by effect that could not be exempted. In any event, the parties are reportedly appealing the AGCM’s decision and it will be interesting to see what the Italian courts will have to say on these aspects of the NCA’s findings.
C. Takeaways: Revised Vertical Rules set to Provide some Clarity on Platform Sales Restrictions 
The Commission’s and the CMA’s revision of their respective rulebooks on vertical restraints is expected to provide much-needed clarity on previously grey areas. Key principles that have arisen from European competition authorities’ decisional practice as well case law are now set for crystallization into black-letter law (e.g. platform bans explicitly qualified as non-hardcore restrictions, inasmuch as they do not span into restrictions on the use of online search engines or price comparison tools, which could prevent the effective use of the internet for making sales).
Of course, the revised EU regulatory package on vertical restraints will not alleviate all of the ambiguities that existed under the previous regime (as the AGCM’s decision in Apple/Amazon attests). Therefore, competition authorities and courts in Europe will continue to be tasked with streamlining the interpretation and application of these rules. Having said this, with specific, targeted guidance on the books on all of the hallmark practices that have raised competition law concerns in e-commerce (e.g. marketplace restrictions, price comparison website restrictions, MFNs), the scramble of European competition authorities over the past decade to try to fit novel issues arising from the online reality into an increasingly outdated framework of analysis is hopefully nearing some conclusion.
 
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Beyond any policy and legal aspects / criticisms of the novel regulatory approaches to digital-specific antitrust in Europe, this piece has provided an overview of the current landscape in classic antitrust enforcement against tech companies’ practices in Europe. As may be deduced from this exposition, enforcement in Europe seems to be robust and rife with new investigations propping up across the region seemingly on a daily basis, by the Commission as well as the EU NCAs and the CMA. While one should not downplay the increasingly complex nature of antitrust enforcement in the digital sector, it is nevertheless a reality that cases dealing with novel questions may take a while to conclude, sparking the unavoidable criticisms regarding the risk of locking in anti-competitive effects until it is too late for any remedies to deliver their intended results. Nevertheless, some optimism may be in order: with classic theories of harm being tested and adapted for the digital economy, European competition authorities seem to be familiarizing themselves with the characteristics of the tech space, and enabling themselves to scrutinize more swiftly the commercial practices implemented in the digital sector.
These trends are intended to generate positive outcomes for consumers in the near future. Given the central role that digital services play in everyday life nowadays, underenforcement of competition law in the digital space is certainly a risk worth serious consideration. However, at the same time, tech companies are facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape in Europe; and notably, this may, sooner rather than later, affect companies beyond the small GAFAM circle. One important factor in this may be the Commission’s ability to impose certain DMA obligations to providers of core platform services which do not yet enjoy an entrenched and durable position in their operations, but may soon enjoy such a position.45 Additionally, in data-related cases, several NCAs have started relying on sectoral regulatory obligations as standards of conduct in abuse of dominance cases. In light of this ongoing trend, commentators have warned against the possibility that competition authorities or courts may transpose the obligations of the DMA to “dominant non-gatekeepers” through traditional abuse of dominance provisions. The rationale would be that, if data-related regulatory instruments, such as the GDPR, can be used as “benchmarks” for abuse of dominance assessments (see German Facebook case), the DMA could also serve as a similar benchmark for an abuse of dominance assessment by a dominant non-gatekeeper.46
In turn, this could lead to a chilling effect, dampening innovation due to a competition law framework that interferes excessively in digital companies’ business models: why innovate if equal access to the fruits of one’s labour would have to be provided to rivals? So, it is not beyond imagination that any near-term benefits for consumers may be offset by long-term welfare losses, due to missing out on efficiency- and welfare-enhancing practices in the tech space. This is so in particular given that a number of the DMA’s blacklisted practices, such as self-preferencing, do have an efficiency dimension. Indeed, it is hard not to marvel at the concept of the DMA itself, bearing a strong “per se prohibitions” mindset (without the possibility for justification) that is rather foreign in most European competition law regimes (and in fact, is entirely foreign – in principle – to abuse of dominance assessments).47
A lot may depend on whether, in their effort to safeguard consumers’ interests in the digital economy, competition authorities in Europe (including the Commission) overshoot by underestimating classic supply and demand forces. How all of this will play out remains to be seen. With the DMA still being fleshed out, one thing is for certain: no boredom in sight for the digital antitrust afficionados.

4 In terms of antitrust enforcement, the Commission has ongoing investigations or proceedings against all GAFAM companies on grounds that seem to reflect self-preferencing concerns, including of course the Google Shopping saga but also in the Amazon Marketplace (AT.40462), Amazon Buy Box (AT.40703), Facebook leveraging (AT.40484), and Apple – App Store Practices (music streaming) investigations. The Commission has also launched an investigation into allegations that Microsoft has been force-installing Teams in the Office suite and preventing its uninstallation (EU questions Microsoft rivals over Teams integration in Office, Reuters (8 October 2021), available at https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-questions-microsoft-rivals-over-teams-integration-office-2021-10-08/).

See Final Report – Sector inquiry into consumer Internet of Things, 20 January 2022, SWD(2022) 10 final.
5 Under the current draft of the “gatekeeper” definition, the term may apply to undertakings that (i) have a significant impact on the internal market, (ii) operate a core platform service which serves as an important gateway for business users to reach end users, and (iii) enjoy an entrenched and durable position in their operations (or can be expected to enjoy such a position in the future).  In respect of each of these conditions, the Commission has chosen to create presumptions of satisfaction on the basis of specific quantitative thresholds.

37 For instance, taking the view that online marketplaces like Amazon represent only one method of selling online, the Commission considers in the Draft Revised VGL that direct or indirect online marketplace bans should be block exempted irrespective of the distribution system in place and regardless of whether the contract product is considered a luxury product (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(a)). Similarly, setting quality standards for selling online and requiring that the buyer operates brick-and-mortar shops to be admitted in the supplier’s selective distribution system should also be block exempted (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(b)). Following the same line of reasoning, a supplier could validly require a buyer to sell at least a certain absolute amount of the contract goods or services offline (Draft Revised VGL, para. 194(c)).

683,"March 20, 2022",Apple Looks To Delay Implementation Of EU App Store Bill,"


Apple is facing regulatory headwinds that may threaten its App Store revenue. However, the Cupertino, California-based company still has some legal arguments that could help it to delay the implementation of one of the most far-reaching provisions in the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). 
The European Union approved the DMA in late 2021, aiming to increase competition between digital platforms by limiting what some BigTech companies can do. New requirements set out in the bill will force Apple to allow software to be downloaded outside its money-making App Store and to allow companies to use other payment systems on apps. 
Related: The Digital Markets Act (DMA): A Procompetitive Recalibration of Data Relations?
The law is expected to be approved by all the European institutions before summer, and will likely be enforced six months after it is passed. Thus, Apple should, in theory, start complying with these requirements by the end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. 
However, Apple has fought any attempt so far to open up its App Store to third parties. For instance, in South-Korea, Apple challenged a new regulation that ordered the tech giant to loosen its grip over the app economy. In the Netherlands, the company has chosen to pay a $5 million weekly fine rather than complying with a decision from the competition authority that asked Apple to allow other apps to use other payment methods in the App Store. 
The reason for Apple to push back on these obligations is not only financial — 20% of Apple’s annual operating income comes from the App Store — but also because by complying, it may weaken its own privacy and safety arguments to keep its system closed. Besides, Apple is facing a similar legislative threat in the US, the Open App Markets Act, which is on its way to the Senate floor for a vote, and any concession in Europe or elsewhere about the App Store may have repercussions in the US.

Russian internet giant Yandex on Friday said it was exploring options, including divestment, for its news aggregation service and its Yandex.Zen content feed and blogging platform.
Nasdaq-listed Yandex, which is facing potential issues in redeeming convertible bonds over a trading suspension of its shares, said the company wanted to focus on developing its other businesses and products. 
Zen, with over 20 million users, is an Artificial Intelligence-powered content feed that automatically provides users with video feed based on data, including browsing history, location, and other factors.
Yandex, a multinational corporation founded in 1997 by Russian billionaire Arkady Volozh, primarily develops internet services for Russian and Russian-language users, including search and information services, e-commerce, navigation, mobile applications, and online advertising, in a model similar to Big Tech giant Google.  Much like its western rival, Yandex has had run-ins with Russia’s regulator over possible anticompetitive practices involving the company’s use of data. 
Yandex has also forayed into the transportation and cab-hailing game, launching Yandex Taxi in a joint venture with Uber in 2019. Uber which had already considered selling its stake in Yandex Taxi, would be speeding up the sale, the company announced, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The European Commission is aiming to clinch a fast-tracked deal with EU lawmakers and countries to establish new rules that will help rein in the influence and power of the so-called ‘Tech Giants’ of Google, Amazon , Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Wednesday. 
Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the Digital Markets Act more than a year ago with a list of dos and don’ts for US tech giants, said there has been good progress in negotiations involving all EU member states, as well as representatives from industry organizations and the companies themselves. 
“We are now aiming to reach political agreement by the fourth trilogue by the end of March. If we manage that, that will be legislation with almost the speed of lightning,” she told a European Parliament hearing.
Talks are due to resume on March 24, giving EU lawmakers only a handful of days to talk out any remaining objections or adjustments. 
Issues that need to be ironed out include the list of obligations for online gatekeepers – companies that control data and access to their platforms – and the level of turnover that defines which companies will be covered by the DMA, people close to the matter said.

Internet giant Amazon could be days away from closing its deal to buy MGM, the fabled studio behind “Rocky” and “James Bond,” as a mid-March deadline for regulators to challenge the online retailer’s merger plan approaches, reported Reuters. 
Antitrust agencies in the United States and Europe both have to decide if Amazon’s $8.5 billion deal for the nearly century-old studio breaks antitrust law. Amazon announced the transaction in May 2021, saying it offered a trove of content for the company to develop and draw consumers to its Prime fast-shipping and streaming club.
In Europe, EU antitrust regulators are set to clear the planned acquisition without conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. They have a March 15 deadline to act. 
Likewise, the US Federal Trade Commission is approaching its own deadline for making a decision on whether the deal violates antitrust law. The FTC’s deadline is in mid-March, at least a day after the European Commission’s deadline, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The online retailer substantially complied with the FTC’s requests for information about the deal, which started the clock for the FTC to make a decision, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Exactly when Amazon might close the deal, subject to whether or not the FTC attempts to stop the MGM merger, was unclear.
The FTC, whose Chair Lina Khan gained internet fame with a law review article entitled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” has a broader antitrust probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook and Google.

687,"March 14, 2022","Regulation of Artificial Intelligence – Global Trends, Implications, and the Road Ahead","
The topic of regulating Artificial Intelligence has gained momentum in the past few years, most recently with the European Union’s AI Act, which was released last year. At the heart of these discussions is opacity of machine learning models, the risk of bias from AI systems and issues like agency and keeping humans in the loop. There has been a proliferation of principles related to ethical and responsible AI which includes sector specific approaches and guidance. But there is also an increased demand from stakeholder groups, especially civil society, to ensure that these principles are adopted and implemented. While the AI governance landscape continues to evolve, businesses will have to prepare for emerging regulation which includes elements like certifications and conformity assessments for high-risk use cases (e.g. automated hiring). Governments, private sector and civil society will have to work together on multistakeholder and agile approaches for governing AI to ensure balance between innovation and regulation.

688,"March 14, 2022","AI Ethics, Regulation & Firm Implications","
As the widespread application of artificial intelligence permeates an increasing number of businesses, ethical issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and transparency have gained increased attention, raising renewed calls for policy and regulatory changes to address the potential consequences of AI systems and products. In this article, we build on original research to outline distinct approaches to AI governance and regulation and discuss the implications for firms and their managers in terms of adopting AI and ethical practices going forward. We examine how manager perception of AI ethics increases with the potential of AI-related regulation but at the cost of AI diffusion. Such trade-offs are likely to be associated with industry specific characteristics, which holds implications for how new and intended AI regulations could affect varying industries differently. Overall, we recommend that businesses embrace new managerial standards and practices that detail AI liability under varying circumstances, even before it is regulatory prescribed. Stronger internal audits, as well as third-party examinations, would provide more information for managers, reduce managerial uncertainty, and aid the development of AI products and services that are subject to higher ethical as well as legal, and policy standards.

689,"March 10, 2022",South Korean Watchdog Releases Rules on in-App Payments,"


South Korea’s telecommunication regulators have banned Apple Inc., Alphabet’s Google and other app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems, The Korea Herald reported Thursday (March 10).
Under the Telecommunication Business Act that was enacted last year, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), will implement the enforcement order starting on Tuesday, March 15.
The new rules are among the first restrictions to be placed by a major economy on Apple and Google in the context of a heavy backlash against the companies’ policies regarding their app stores. The tech giants have faced criticism worldwide for requiring the use of proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%.
Apple and Google’s policies have been flagged as abuseive by software developers big and small in recent years, with Apple facing off against Fortnite makers Epic Games after the latter attempted to circumvent Apple’s payment systems.
In January, Apple said it will allow alternative payment systems in the country to put the company in compliance with a law that prohibits app store operators from requiring customers to use their own in-app payment systems. Apple promised it would provide an alternative payment system at a reduced service charge, compared to the original fee.
Last fall, Google said it will offer an alternative payment system on its app store in South Korea at a slightly reduced service charge to abide by the new law.
Regulators said they will determine whether store operators are in violation based on whether app developers are free to choose their preferred app payment system. The KCC will also determine whether the store operators hurt consumers’ benefit or crush competition.

UK said on Tuesday it would force Google, Facebook, Twitter and other online platforms to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts after calls from regulators and consumer groups for a stronger crackdown on scams, reported Reuters. 
The government said its draft law on preventing online harms would include the requirement for large platforms to improve protection from criminals impersonating celebrities or companies to steal personal data, peddle unsafe financial investments or break into bank accounts.
Communications regulator Ofcom will check if platforms have put in place systems to prevent and remove fake adverts. The watchdog could block services or issue a fine of up to 18 million pounds ($24 million) or 10% of annual turnover, the government said.
“These changes to the upcoming Online Safety bill will help stop fraudsters conning people out of their hard-earned cash using fake online adverts,” Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a statement.
The Online Safety bill, whose draft was published as early as May 2019, is intended to improve safety for internet users with regard to abuse or fraud, among other violations.

South Korea’s government has approved detailed rules for a law banning dominant app store operators, such as Apple and Alphabet’s Google, from forcing software developers to use their payments systems, reported Reuters.
South Korea passed the law, an amendment to the Telecommunication Business Act, last year.
It was the first such curb by a major economy on Apple and Google, which face global criticism for requiring the use of proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%.
The rules, called the enforcement ordinance, will be put into effect on March 15. They specify that the law bars “the act of forcing a specific payment method to a provider of mobile content” by unfairly utilising the app market operator’s status, the regulator Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement.
“In order to prevent indirect regulatory avoidance, prohibited acts’ types and standards have been established as tightly-knit as possible within the scope delegated by the law,” said KCC Chairman Han Sang-hyuk.
Advocates for the Big Tech platforms targeted by these changes have opposed the new legislation, arguing that the changes will negatively impact consumers by reducing the platforms’ ability to ensure publishers’ reliability, opening users up to possible fraud or poor quality products.

692,"March 1, 2022",Regulating Big Tech: Lessons From the FTC’s Do Not Call Rule,"


By William E. Kovacic (George Washington University) & David A. Hyman (Georgetown University)
Big Tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google) is under regulatory assault. Cases have been brought against each of these companies in multiple countries around the world, but there is an emerging consensus that more needs to be done – most likely in the form of ex ante regulation that prescribes rules of conduct for dominant information platforms. The European Union and the United Kingdom are well on the way to establishing such frameworks, and the United States appears poised to undertake similar measures in the coming years. Most of the debate has focused on the case for ex ante regulation of Big Tech, with much less attention to the complexities of developing and implementing such regulation.
This is not the first time that regulators have sought to use ex ante regulation to govern a technologically dynamic sector of the economy. In 2003, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) promulgated its Do-Not-Call (DNC) Rule, which allows individuals to block unsolicited commercial telephone calls by enrolling in a national registry. The DNC Rule provides a useful case study of the complexities of developing and implementing ex ante regulation of a dynamic industry in the face of substantial legal, technological, and political risks. We identify a series of lessons for those now seeking to use similar strategies to regulate Big Tech.

693,"February 28, 2022",Market Studies: Making All the Difference?,"

By Francesco Naismith & Baethan Mullen1
 
Market studies have recently risen to prominence in Australia’s competition policy. Reviews of energy markets, financial services, insurance, agriculture, Murray Darling water markets, car retailing, and digital platforms have all been completed in the last half decade.2 Almost every major sector of the Australian economy has been examined.
Why has this happened? What is the role of market studies? Why are they needed when we have traditional enforcement and compliance tools?
This article seeks to answer these questions and makes the case that market studies are an important and complementary part of the toolkit for a competition enforcement agency. Market studies can enable a deeper and broader understanding of how markets are operating, and this can inform important further actions including legal action, regulatory reform, and competition and consumer advocacy.
  
I. Introduction
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) is an independent Commonwealth statutory agency established by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (“CCA”). Its purpose is to make markets work for consumers, now and in the future.
In pursuit of its mission, and in addition to pursuing breaches of the CCA in court, through settlements, and promoting compliance through education and outreach, the ACCC undertakes in-depth market, sector, or industry reviews. These reviews help to improve the ACCC’s understanding of sector dynamics and industry practices that may impact competition and consumers.
Reviews are either self-initiated (market studies) or undertaken with the direction or approval of the Australian Government (price inquiries),3 in accordance with the ACCC’s enabling legislation.4 With some exceptions, market studies and price inquiries are broadly similar in nature. They typically involve a public fact-finding exercise culminating in public reporting, often with recommendations for policy changes and sometimes leading to enforcement or other action by the ACCC itself.
Market studies and price inquiries help the ACCC to:

identify market failures and determine how to address them
assess the implications of emerging competition issues
support and inform compliance and enforcement action
identify areas for regulatory and policy considerations.

Before 2015, the ACCC undertook two price inquiries5 under Part VIIA. The ACCC also engaged in a variety of activities involving market research and industry assessments, although did not formally refer to these activities as market studies. Since 2015, the ACCC has held fourteen Part VIIA price inquiries and self-initiated six market studies.6
 
II. Role and Regulatory Context of the ACCC
The ACCC is a combined competition, consumer protection and product safety authority, and economic regulator, which administers a range of ex post and ex ante regulatory frameworks in pursuit of its purpose. It is equipped with a diverse set of tools to effectively pursue its broad mandate. This diversity and range in regulatory tools provide the ACCC with a degree of discretion in deciding which tools it uses to address market failure or consumer harm.
The ACCC sits within the Commonwealth Treasury portfolio and is accountable to the responsible Minister, the Treasurer. The ACCC advises the federal government and Australian Parliament in relation to matters impacting consumers. It also has responsibility for raising awareness of the Australian public of competition and consumer policy and objectives.
Competition Policy Review 
In 2013, the Australian Government commissioned a wide-ranging review of competition policy, law, and institutions in Australia.7 The Competition Policy Review Panel delivered its final report on March 31, 2015,8 in which it had formed the view that the competition regulator should not be responsible for competition advocacy, because “advocacy on particular issues may be seen to prejudice the outcome of investigations.”9 The Panel’s position was in direct contrast to the view of the ACCC (and others) and ultimately no legislative change was made.
Interestingly, the Review Panel’s Final Report was published just before the significant increase of self-initiated market studies and price inquiries directed under Part VIIA. The experience of the intervening years since the Final Report might have more clearly demonstrated the value of markets studies with some persuasive examples (elaborated below in section V).
III. Market Studies
Self-initiated Market Studies
The ACCC self-initiates market studies to enhance outcomes across its range of functions. A decision to commence a market study involves evaluating the effectiveness of the ACCC’s various regulatory tools concerning the issues or conduct raising concerns. Sectors chosen for market studies are based on the annual compliance and enforcement priorities.
The ACCC undertakes different forms of market research and review in the performance of its legislated functions. Section 28 of the CCA establishes the ACCC’s obligations regarding the dissemination of information, law reform, and research, and identifies the mechanisms available to meet those obligations.
The ACCC cannot access compulsory information-gathering powers where it has self-initiated a market study and instead relies on information that is publicly available or obtained voluntarily from market participants or other interested stakeholders. This includes circumstances where the ACCC undertakes a market study as part of responding to a request from a house of Parliament or a parliamentary committee.10
The ACCC has initiated six market studies since 2015, relating to customer loyalty schemes, certain wine grape markets, agricultural machinery, cattle and beef processing, the new car retailing industry, and a broad-ranging market study into the communications sector.11 In addition, the ACCC provides the Australian Senate with an annual report on anti-competitive or other practices in the private health insurance sector in Australia.12
  
IV. Part VIIA Price Inquiries
The Treasurer may, on behalf of the Australian Government, require13 or approve14 the ACCC to undertake a “price inquiry.” Typically, price inquiries are high profile and generate significant commentary and scrutiny. Sectors and industries under inquiry often exhibit characteristics such as significant bargaining power imbalances; stifled or reduced competition; opaque or deceptive trading practices; and uninformed or misled consumer decision-making.
Price inquiries can inquire into “a specified matter or specified matters”15 relating to the supply of goods or services,16 and are not limited in a literal sense to “prices.” For example, the ToRs for the 2017 Digital Platforms Inquiry required the ACCC to look into the impact of digital platforms on a range of matters including the choice and quality of news and journalism in Australia, without once using the terms “price” or “cost.”17
Background and Context 
In 2001 the Productivity Commission recommended the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 (“PSA”) be incorporated into the CCA to align with monetary policy reforms during the intervening period and squarely identify prices oversight as a plank of competition policy and regulation.18 The PSA was repealed and replaced by Part VIIA – Prices Surveillance of the CCA, which commenced on March 1, 2004.
Section 95E of the CCA sets out the object of Part VIIA – Prices Surveillance:
The object of this Part is to have prices surveillance applied only in those markets where, in the view of the Minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers.19
Part VIIA establishes three types of prices oversight:

price inquiries
price notification, and
price monitoring.

Whereas the price notification provisions have remained dormant, the ACCC has well-established government-directed price monitoring roles in certain sectors, including petrol, container stevedoring, and aeronautical services and facilities.
The object statement clarifies the responsible Minister – the Treasurer – has ultimate authority over Part VIIA. Taken as a whole, Part VIIA enables market intervention of economic significance and potential national consequence it amounts to public policy, suggesting the Treasurer’s authority strikes an appropriate balance between regulatory and executive power.
Current and Concluded Price Inquiries
The ACCC held two price inquiries under Part VIIA before 2015.

In June 2007 the Treasurer approved a request from the ACCC to hold an inquiry into the price of unleaded petrol.
In January 2008 the Assistant Treasurer requested the ACCC hold an inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries.

Since 2015, the ACCC has held fourteen Part VIIA price inquiries relating to particular sectors and/or industries:

4 into agriculture and regional issues
4 into energy with two focused on gas and two on electricity
3 into digital platforms, including a specific inquiry in digital advertising
3 into financial services, including two relating to home loans and mortgages and one into foreign currency conversion services.

Gas, electricity, and digital platforms are each the subject of long-term inquiries with regular reporting requirements and, in the case of digital platforms, the ACCC was directed to hold an inquiry into digital advertising services concurrent with the long-term inquiry underway.
The significant increase in market studies and prices inquiries reflects the growing recognition in Australia of the significant value of market studies as a tool for understanding how to address difficult and long-standing competition and consumer issues.  Each review, taken in isolation, had a unique set of specific reasons warranting a close and deep assessment of sector issues.
In 2018, ACCC Chair Rod Sims postured:
The age old question of when to intervene in markets has long held a fascination for economists. Do you intervene to prevent market failure, or to correct it once it has already begun? If you do intervene, do you do so with a light-touch, or a heavy-touch?20
Enforcement action cannot always address the causes or facilitating circumstances of the harmful conduct. This may be particularly important where competitive harm and/or consumer detriment is widespread or not limited to particular market participants or occurring at such a pace that enforcement action would not be timely enough. Over the last decade, critical sectors of the Australian economy have emerged for scrutiny. While the sectors are diverse in nature, a common feature has been concerns about high prices, conduct that harms consumers or customers, and oligopolistic market structures.
The ACCC’s purpose, “making markets work for consumers, now and in the future,” demands a holistic and nuanced assessment of market factors and sector conditions – including for example policy settings, industry frameworks, upstream and downstream influences – so proposed responses deliver improved competition and consumer outcomes over the long term, while also addressing immediate harms. Market studies and price inquiries are vital tools because sometimes it is not enough to only consider explicit and immediate breaches of the CCA.
Price Inquiries in Practice 
The Australian Government has wide discretion in determining the topics of price inquiries as well as the substance and scope of an Inquiry’s Terms of Reference (“ToRs”). The Treasurer may direct the ACCC to have regard to certain matters in the course of the inquiry.21 However, once the inquiry has commenced the Treasurer is prohibited from intervening in the conduct of the inquiry,22 for example in relation to how the ACCC construes the ToRs.
Government directed price inquiries are in-depth processes involving comprehensive exploration and analysis of matters under inquiry. They impose added regulatory burden on market participants, often in already highly regulated industries. Part VIIA imposes robust governance arrangements on the conduct of price inquiries, including strict transparency and accountability mechanisms such as prescribing publication obligations on the ACCC.23
  
V. Outcomes and Impact of Market Studies and Price Inquiries
Market studies and price inquiries are a “key component of the ACCC’s competition advocacy role”24 and can lead to a range of outcomes including: enforcement action; determination intervention into a market is not required; and/or can assist the ACCC in identifying market problems and possible solutions.
The ACCC reports its findings at the completion of a market study or price inquiry, along with a suite of recommendations it considers will be effective to address its findings. These recommendations generally fall within the following categories:

policy review and law reform
recommendations to industry
regulatory action, including referrals to the ACCC or other relevant regulators for enforcement or compliance action, and
recommendations to the government identifying further specific matters or sectors suitable for subsequent inquiry.

Publicly reporting findings and recommendations contributes to making markets work for consumers by informing stakeholders and encouraging public debate, contributing to policy considerations, and improving the way markets function through the adoption of recommendations.
Set out below are several examples of the different types of outcomes that may arise from a market study or price inquiry.
Findings
Reporting findings publicly, including identifying nefarious conduct and/or traders, promotes compliance and provides evidence and analysis underpinning recommendations and regulatory actions. Findings are often the initial focus of media reports and commentary, and also form a critical component of advocacy initiatives.
In December 2020, the ACCC published its Home loan price inquiry – Final report,25 which made a range of findings about impediments to Australian consumers switching mortgage providers, several of which supplied the substance of headlines in the ensuing media coverage.
In September 2021, the ACCC published the Digital advertising services inquiry – Final report, which found that:
Google is the dominant provider of services across the ad tech supply chain. No other provider has comparable scale in any ad tech service or reach across the supply chain.26
This blunt and unequivocal statement not only garnered substantial media attention given Google’s pervasiveness, but it also publicly clarified a critical part of the ACCC’s understanding of digital advertising and the digital platform sector more generally, potentially influencing regulatory analysis and other activities.
Transparency over its reasoning and the evidentiary basis for its findings allows interested stakeholders and the public to analyze and assess the strength of the ACCC’s conclusions and recommendations and is crucial for the ACCC’s integrity and continued credibility.
Recommendations – Advocacy and Policy Reform
Reform Proposals and Advocacy 
The ACCC prioritizes advocacy initiatives guided by formal findings of a market study or price inquiry. Publicizing this work can help inform government, businesses, and consumers, as well as encourage public debate over competition and consumer matters and contribute to policy considerations. Whether self-initiated or government-directed, the ACCC commits to advocacy initiatives that continue long after the market study is complete.
The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry – Final report made a suite of recommendations for review and reform of Australia’s privacy regime.27 This included 6 specific changes recommended to the Privacy Act 1988, along with an overarching recommendation for broader reform of the Australian privacy law. In December 2019, the Attorney-General announced the Australian Government would conduct a review of the Privacy Act 1988. The announcement specifically mentioned that the review formed part of the government’s response to the ACCC’s Final Report.28
The ACCC’s Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry: Final Report recommended abolishing and replacing retail electricity standing offers with a default market offer to be set by the Australian Energy Regulator.29 The Australian Government adopted the recommendation, and in April 2019 the AER completed consultation and published its final determination on default market offer prices, which applied from July 1, 2019 for standing offer customers in regions not subject to state-based price regulation.
Industry Codes
The ACCC regulates mandatory industry codes that are prescribed under the CCA30 and also supports industries in developing and implementing voluntary codes. The ACCC has recommended the adoption of mandatory or voluntary industry codes on several occasions.
Industry codes can improve consumer and small business outcomes and/or enhance competition, for example through transparency measures or by addressing bargaining imbalances. Mandatory codes facilitate efficient regulatory action where appropriate, allowing the ACCC to respond swiftly to proscribed conduct and possibly limiting the harm caused.
In 2018 the ACCC recommended the government prescribe mandatory industry codes following completion of price inquiries in the dairy and retail electricity sectors. Similarly, in 2019 it recommended that designated digital platforms be required to sign on to a code of conduct governing commercial relationships with news media businesses. The Australian Government adopted each of these recommendations.31
In September 2019, the ACCC recommended a substantial strengthening of the voluntary Australian Wine Industry Code of Conduct32 after finding the Code had not been effective in addressing industry problems, primarily due to a low number of signatories.33 In December 2021 the ACCC reviewed the industry’s progress in implementing the recommendations and found there had been significant efforts made to improve the coverage and strength of the voluntary code.34
Recommendations – Industry
In April 2016, the ACCC launched a market study into the cattle and beef industry in Australia, examining competition, efficiency, transparency, and trading issues in the beef and cattle supply chain. Its Final Report made a range of recommendations including several for direct action by the industry’s main bodies, Meat & Livestock Australia and the Red Meat Advisory Council.35 In May 2018 the ACCC reviewed progress towards implementing the recommendations. The review found the industry had not acted on most of the recommendations.36 The ACCC highlighted the industry’s inaction in the media, foreshadowing subsequent engagement with policymakers to advocate for the implementation of the market study’s substantive recommendations.37
Regulatory Action
Further Inquiry
The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry – Final Report recommended the ACCC be directed under Part VIIA to hold an inquiry into competition in the market for the supply of ad tech services and the supply of online advertising services and media agencies.38 The Australian Government adopted the recommendation and provided the necessary direction to the ACCC in February 2020.39 The ACCC published its final report in late September 2021.
In October 2018, the Australian Treasurer issued a notice approving the ACCC to hold an inquiry into the supply of foreign currency conversion services in Australia.40 The ACCC had sought approval for  the Inquiry after receiving several complaints from consumers about the relevant services, in addition to a Productivity Commission recommendation to the Australian Government that the ACCC should review the transparency of fees for foreign exchange services as part of its Inquiry into Competition in the Australian Financial System.41
Referrals – Internal
In addition to publishing an extensive list of findings and recommendations, the Digital Platforms Inquiry – Final report disclosed the existence of several investigations into certain digital platforms under the CCA, and included specific details relating to the alleged conduct, traders, and contraventions. It is fairly unusual for the ACCC to reveal such specific details of multiple investigations in this way, and in taking this strategy it highlighted the seriousness and pervasiveness of the conduct.
Referrals – External
In November 2020, the ACCC published a detailed and extensive final report after completing a wide-ranging price inquiry into the supply of residential buildings (home), contents and strata insurance in northern Australia.42 Among its recommendations, the ACCC recommended the Insurance Council of Australia work with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to update the General Insurance Code of Practice in order to obtain ASIC approval for the Code.43
 
VI. Conclusion
The use of market studies and inquiries has become a core part of the ACCC’s functions. They have been used widely across the economy, achieving significant outcomes for Australians (including those detailed above) in ways that standard enforcement and compliance tools could not.44 Their increased use means greater market transparency and more informed decision-making by the ACCC, governments, industry, and consumers alike. ACCC findings, recommendations, and advocacy efforts apply a competition and consumer lens on policy development in order to mitigate unforeseen consequences before they materialize, or to address problems at their source. Based on recent experience, it seems likely that market studies will continue to help shape the future direction of competition law and policy as well as broader policy and regulatory settings.
The market studies tool is an important component of the competition agency’s toolkit for several reasons:
First, market studies enable “deep dive” fact finding that allows the agency to methodically gather information and present a clear picture to the government, industry members, and consumers about how markets operate. This transparency is vital for promoting confidence in public policy decisions affecting the operation of markets and the welfare of consumers. Enforcement and compliance tools are insufficient for this purpose.
Second, market studies can uncover nefarious conduct that is harming competition or consumers that would otherwise not have been identified. The Digital Platforms Inquiry and the Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry are examples of this.
Third, market studies help ensure that the right public policy tool is being used for the policy problem at hand. While the core focus of market studies is on competition, consumer protection and economic regulation, related areas of policy affecting competition and consumers are inevitably examined as well, such as the privacy considerations examined as part of the Digital Platforms Inquiry.
Finally, ongoing scrutiny of particular sectors, such as that which is occurring with gas, electricity and digital platforms, helps to “shine a light” on sectors where issues are still nascent or evolving and cannot be resolved through action under the CCA, legislative change, or other actions. Regular reporting on the operation of these sectors provides an ongoing source of evidence on which to base policy decisions.

Australia’s consumer watchdog wants major legislative changes spanning the entire gamut of Big Tech’s issues, covering anti-competitive conduct, bargaining imbalances, insufficient consumer and business user protections, reported Znet.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) proposed measures, outlined in a discussion paper, aimed at providing new tools to combat anti-competitive conduct, barriers to entry, bargaining imbalances, and insufficient consumer and business user protections. 
Outgoing ACCC chair Rod Sims said last week that core proposals would take the form of a new code of conduct, focusing on the creation of clear and upfront rules that seek to “prevent the worst abuses of dominance and protect consumers”.
In the discussion paper, the regulator said the new measures are needed as current tools provided under Australia’s consumer laws may not be sufficient alone for addressing harms identified within digital platforms.
Australia has emerged as one of the fiercest critics of Big Tech’s policies, with landmark actions against the internet giants that have served as precedent for other jurisdictions, including a major decision on the use of news content and advertising revenues.

695,"February 28, 2022",The Microsoft Open App Store Principles in Eight Points,"
By: Damien Geradin (The Platform Law Blog)
It is no secret that Microsoft has charted a rather different course compared to Apple and Google when it comes to ex ante regulation – a course aiming to embrace, rather than fight, regulation (see for example, this May 2021 blog post where Microsoft in principle voiced its support for the EU Digital Markets Act). It is also no secret that Microsoft is at odds with Apple’s (and, to a lesser extent, Google’s) app store policies, with the Seattle-based software company recently filing an amicus brief in support of Epic Games’ appeal before the Ninth Circuit against the ruling of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. As discussed below, to some extent this reflects the starkly different approaches of Microsoft and Apple to cloud gaming, with Microsoft heavily investing in cloud gaming with its Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Apple “block[ing] the emergence of cloud gaming on iOS”, as the CMA found (see the excellent post of our colleague Stijn Huijts on this issue).
It is thus with great interest that I saw yesterday Microsoft’s Brad Smith announce a set of “Open App Store Principles” in what he describes as a proactive move to adapt ahead of regulation. Specifically:
Grounded in existing or forthcoming legislation: The Open App Store Principles are said to be grounded in app store legislation currently being considered across the world, including the US (this is presumably a reference to the Open App Markets Act, recently voted by the US Senate Judiciary Committee), the EU (the DMA), the Republic of Korea (see here), and the Netherlands (presumably this refers to the Dutch Competition Authority’s decision mandating Apple to allow dating app developers to use alternative in-app payment systems; as I explained earlier this week, Apple refuses to comply, begging the question of whether it is a threat to the rule of law).Scope: According to the blog post, the Open App Store Principles shall apply to “the Microsoft Store on Windows and to the next-generation marketplaces [Microsoft] will build for games”. Some of the principles will also immediately apply to the Xbox console store, with Microsoft committing to close the gap on the remaining principles over time (more on this later).Content: The announced principles are said to reflect Microsoft’s commitments in four areas:– Quality, safety, security, and privacy (principles 1-3): Microsoft commits to continue protecting user security and privacy, and allow developers to access its app store as long as they meet reasonable quality and safety standards.– Accountability (principles 4-5): Microsoft commits to hold its own apps at the same standard it holds rival apps, and not to use non-public information from the app store to compete against rivals (this reminds me of Article 6.1(a) of the DMA)).– Fairness and transparency (principles 6-7): Microsoft commits not to unreasonably self-preference its own apps and to be transparent about rules for promotion in its app store.– Developer choice (principles 8-11): In what I consider to be the most interesting part, Microsoft commits to, among others, (i) allow developers to use their own in-app payment processing system, and not disadvantage them if they do so; and (ii) allow developers to communicate directly with their users inside the app on, inter alia, pricing terms.– Operating systems: Finally, Microsoft commits to (i) continue allowing developers for Windows to make their apps available through alternative app stores or sideloading; (ii) continue providing such developers with timely access to interoperability information; and (iii) enable Windows users to use third party app stores and apps, including by changing defaults…

696,"February 24, 2022",30 US Lawmakers Want EU To Change Digital Markets Act,"


A bipartisan group of 30 lawmakers sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to talk to EU leaders and persuade them to change the proposed Digital Markets Act (DMA), as in their view, it “unfairly” targets US tech companies.
According to CNBC, the group, led by Representatives Suzan DelBene and Darin LaHood, wrote in their letter that they “are greatly concerned that EU’s proposed approach to promoting competition among digital platforms unfairly targets American workers by deeming certain U.S. technology companies as ‘gatekeepers’ based on deliberately discriminatory and subjective thresholds.” 
Related: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – An Ex Ante Landmark
The DMA aims at tackling competition concerns with digital platforms. The proposed law establishes a list of activities that Big Tech companies must do or must refrain from doing, including self-preferencing of products in their own platforms, or opening up App stores. Similar laws have been introduced in the U.S. — the Open App Markets Act and the American Innovation and Choice Online Act — and both bills have passed the Senate Committees and are now on their way to the senate for a vote.  
The DMA was approved by the EU Parliament back in December, but due to the complexities of the EU legislative system, it still needs to be ratified by the 27 member states. This ratification process may still last for a few months; it is expected to be fully ratified by summer, but during this time there is still a possibility of introducing amendments to the text. Nonetheless, given the agreement between all the EU institutions and member states, it is unlikely that a last-minute proposal could succeed because it would mean that the text would be back to the EU Parliament to get a new vote and new approval.
The main issue raised by US lawmakers is that the DMA is targeting U.S. Big Tech companies in everything but name. “As European leaders have made clear, the DMA as currently drafted is driven not by concerns regarding appropriate market share, but by a desire to restrict American companies’ access in Europe in order to prop up European companies,” they wrote.
The DMA is not targeting only US companies, as it includes all the digital platforms that meet certain criteria in terms of revenue and users. However, given the presence of US companies in Europe and the smaller market share of other companies, the law will most likely affect Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple first. Additionally, other European companies such as Booking.com or Spotify are likely to fall under the scope of the DMA.
This letter comes the same day that the European Commission presented a new law, the Data Act, which may compel US companies to share more data with EU companies and consumers. The proposed law won´t limit the capacity of US firms to collect data from the web and from connected devices, but it will empower consumers by giving them the possibility to access and share their data with third parties much easier.

697,"February 23, 2022",The Global Challenge of Digital Asset Regulation,"
Digital assets add complexity to an already complex global financial system. Jurisdictions around the world are adopting measures to respond to ongoing developments. As activity grows, bespoke legal regimes are either in place, in development, or under discussion around the world. Regulatory interest now extends beyond token offerings and exchanges to include stablecoins, decentralized finance (“DeFi”), non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAOs”). In this article, we take a bird’s eye view of the global state of digital asset regulation. While some countries have adopted a hostile posture, most regulators are attempting to balance concerns about potential harms against potential benefits. Despite concerns about uncertainty and fragmentation, the regulatory environment is gradually adapting to the novel challenges of digital assets and blockchain-based financial services.

I. Introduction 
The financial system has become increasingly global and intertwined over the past century. While this has produced tremendous benefits, it also raises the stakes on the risk side of the equation. Higher volumes, greater velocity, and increasing sophistication of financial engineering open opportunities for unintentional crashes as well as intentional manipulation. And failure in one market can ultimately have cascading effects into others. More digital and global money also raises the stak...

698,"February 23, 2022",Can Crypto Fix Itself in Time?,"
Payment methods have a high degree of inertia making change slow and challenging for new alternatives. So it is not surprising that crypto currencies based on public blockchains are not broadly used 13 years after Bitcoin launched. The future of the largest public blockchains is limited, however, because they cannot, as is now widely acknowledged, provide stable currencies or operate efficient payment systems and other transactional services at scale. Their ability to correct these problems is impeded by the fact that they serve several masters—decentralization of authority in particular—and are not as nimble at making hard pivots as traditional startups given their consensus-based governance. Established public blockchains may solve these problems but that will take time; new faster public blockchains are entering but must attract capital and labor, which takes time too. Meanwhile payments and financial services are not standing still. Real-time payment methods, mobile money platforms, non-crypto FinTechs, and private permissioned blockchains are developing innovative payment and financial services. In the end it is race, probably over a decade or more, to see who prevails in this competition. Could crypto fix itself in time to win this race? That is possible but far from sure. For those concerned about systemic risks, the public blockchains, and their applications, given the plausible pace of adoption, are less alarming than they may appear from the current hype and va...

699,"February 23, 2022",Crypto Love is a Battlefield,"
The battle over blockchain technology and digital assets bears a striking resemblance to the debate over the potential of the internet in the mid-1990s. Where critics see a passing fad with little actual utility or a lawless industry rife with fraud, many others believe a financial system supported by blockchain technology and digital assets, including virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, has significant potential has the potential to democratize and transform the very nature of the financial services industry and change how consumers, businesses and even governments interact with the financial system. Innovation in the financial services sector sparked by blockchain and digital assets, however, have caused U.S. federal and state regulators to devote more resources to better understanding this technology and the potential impact a digitized financial system could have on consumer protection, the “traditional” finance industry, and the overall safety and soundness of the financial system.  As a result, regulators are taking steps to develop the tools and regulatory infrastructure to better ensure that innovation is being done responsibly.

According to a report from POLITICO, The European Commission is starting the next round of its intensifying face-off with Big Tech with a handicap.
Three top competition officials, who helped lead high-profile probes into Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, have over the past year left to join law firms that act for the tech giants.
The timing could hardly be worse, as the regulator is about to get broad new powers and responsibilities to ramp up the crackdown on anticompetitive behavior by online platforms.
Vestager has three ongoing antitrust cases into Apple, two into Amazon, one into Facebook and one into Google. That number is likely to increase drastically when the Digital Markets Act (DMA) enters into force. The DMA, which will impose strict limits on the behavior of “gatekeeper” platforms, is in the final stages of negotiations.Related: The EU’s Proposal for a Digital Markets Act – an Ex Ante Landmark
But Brussels can no longer count on the 80 years of combined experience of Carles Esteva Mosso, Cecilio Madero Villarejo and Nicholas Banasevic. The three heavyweights have been key to the EU competition regime for the past two decades, reported POLITICO.Madero and Banasevic teamed up in the late 1990s on the landmark Microsoft case and later formed the driving force in three Google cases that ended with over €8 billion in fines for the search giant.
Esteva Mosso led the Commission’s competition review of mergers and acquisitions between 2014 and 2019, including Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014 and Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.
While the cases they worked on are criticized for not having sufficiently restrained Big Tech’s dominance, they have first-hand experience in confronting these firms and the tactics of their lawyers.

Meta Platforms is facing an order to suspend data transfers to the United States by the European Union (EU) agency responsible for protecting personal information, The Irish Times reported.
The Dublin-based Data Protection Commission’s (DPC) ruling could cause Facebook’s parent company to retaliate by removing its websites from Europe.
DPC Commissioner Helen Dixon sought the suspension Monday (Feb. 21), the news outlet reported. The final decision to proceed with the order is up to her European counterparts.
If the judgement is agreed to by EU regulators, the decision would have sweeping impacts on any company that transfers data between the EU and the U.S.
Meta has 28 days to respond to the preliminary decision, Dixon’s spokesman said.
A Meta spokesman told The Times that suspension of data transfers would not only impact millions of people, businesses and nonprofits in the EU who use the service, but also affect other companies that rely on EU-US data transfers to provide a global service.
“A long-term solution on EU-US data transfers is needed to keep people, businesses and economies connected,” Meta said.
The complaint against Facebook stemmed from Max Shrems, founder of the European Center for Digital Rights (NOYB). The Vienna-based nonprofit launched the advocacy group to initiate court cases in support of the General Data Protection Regulation, the EU’s ePrivacy measure.
Schrems said the data of Europeans is at risk when transferred across the pond, reported PYMNTS.This is not the first action encouraged by NOYB. It filed 101 complaints in the 27 EU member states about the alleged transfer of personal data to the U.S. by Google Analytics.

US Bipartisan lawmakers are worried about how Apple runs its App Store and currently the tech giant is defending against legislation that would loosen its supremacy, The Wall Street Journal writes.
According to PYMNTS, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 20-2 this month on legislation that could erode fees Apple collects on digital app revenues. This all happened in spite of calls to senators and Apple’s warnings that this would be detrimental to privacy and security.
The bill is backed by a loose alliance of Apple’s rivals like Epic Games and Microsoft. It will offer a middle ground for lawmakers who want to curb big tech power but can’t reach a consensus for regulating social media.
The report says the Senate leaders’ focus on Apple marks a shift from the strategy employed previously by Congress, which had been focused on Amazon’s treatment of retailers, Google’s ad business control, and other such issues.
“For a long time, Apple floated above the fray in Washington,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co, adding that the company has now “been pulled down into the muck.”
The app store bill is just one front in the war Apple is waging against rivals challenging its control of the app economy — and access to the over one billion users of its devices.
Earlier this month, Apple was fined 5 million euros by Dutch antitrust regulators because of an order to open up app payments for dating services.

Canada’s Competition Bureau is trying to find its place in a world where other jurisdictions are using antitrust measures to combat the increasing market power of Big Tech companies, reported The Globe & Mail.
The federal government and the bureau itself both said last week that they hope to bring Canada’s competition rules in line with the realities of a digitally driven economy. Meanwhile, some of Canada’s most vocal advocates of competition policy reform released a 31,000-word study that argues the Competition Act isn’t equipped to deal with how market dominance is achieved today.
All of this aligns with the increasingly aggressive antitrust measures levelled in the United States and Europe against companies such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Google operator Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.
Regulators and politicians there have argued that the consumer data collected by these companies and their enormous market capitalizations give them power to strong-arm not just markets and individual competitors, but consumers themselves. 
Everyday citizens, policy makers argue, often have little choice but to use the world’s top platforms to connect with people, information and commerce, trading away data about their digital travels and reinforcing platform dominance along the way.

By Emily Birnbaum, Politico 
Legislation targeting Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple would hurt Hispanic business owners. An overhaul of antitrust laws would harm Black-owned newspapers. A bill targeting online sales of counterfeit goods would hurt people of color in the same way as voter ID laws.
These are some of the arguments that lawmakers considering tougher regulations on the tech industry are hearing from groups representing Black and Hispanic businesses — including several groups with financial backing from the nation’s wealthiest online companies.
At least six such groups advancing these arguments receive funding from or have close partnerships with Google, Amazon and Facebook’s parent company Meta, according to public financial disclosures. The tech companies, along with trade associations they belong to, are amplifying those messages as they seek to combat bipartisan regulatory proposals in both houses of Congress.

Below are a few extracts from the article:
On July 18, 2018, the European Commission (“EC”) fined Google €4.34 billion for imposing illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. The case revolved around contractual restrictions that Google had allegedly imposed to strengthen its dominant position in the market for internet search. The EC, in addition to imposing a fine, also coordinated with Google a change in business practices involving the determination of the default search engine on new Android devices.

By PYMNTS
When Meta announced its quarterly results last week and warned about the strong competition that is facing from other companies like TikTok, the price of its shares plunged, wiping out $230 billions of market value. The biggest one-day loss in history.
But maybe this big loss could offer a silver lining for the social media giant. Meta’s current market value stands at $612 billion, which is just $62 billion above the threshold established in the American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act is a bill passed by the Senate Committee which aims at preventing Big Tech firms from favoring their own services over others. This bill, if approved, would make unlawful to unfairly preference a platform’s own products, services or lines of businesses over those of another business user and to limit the ability of another business user’s products, services to compete on the platform. Competitors and businesses have complained regularly that Google and Amazon systematically favored their own products when consumers use the search engine or a marketplace. Google was fined 2.7 billion euros for this practice in Europe and is in the spotlight for allegedly favoring its vertical businesses like Google Maps or Google Flights. If approved, this bill would put an end to this type of practice, or at least make it very hard for these companies to engage in it.

Potential competition is an economic force not yet shaping competition in a given market, but which has the potential to do so in the foreseeable future. It has recently moved up the competition policy enforcement agenda due to the growing interest in innovation-related theories of competitive harm and the rapid development of digital technologies and services. In this article, we briefly review, from an economic perspective, the current theories of harm relating to potential competition, the industries and market situations where such competition is relevant, as well as a few considerations regarding its assessment.

Competition authorities’ growing interest in innovation-related theories of harm, together with the rapid development of digital technologies and services, have intensified the attention paid by competition authorities to potential competition. While potential competition complements actual competition in restricting the market power of a dominant incumbent or of two merging companies, its assessment requires a somewhat different legal and economic toolbox than that of actual competition.

Potential and nascent competition have seen renewed interest from academics, antitrust practitioners, and United States enforcement agencies in recent years. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) focused on issues of potential competition during its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century in 2018, as did the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) during its 2020 Competition Meetings. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and FTC’s recent request for information on merger enforcement included questions related to potential and nascent competition. Importantly, both potential competition and nascent competition describe competition that does not currently exist. The DOJ and the FTC’s concerns about potential or nascent competition arise because firms’ strategies (e.g., pricing or investment decisions) are informed by their expectations about competition in the future. During the last 25 years, the FTC consistently challenged transactions and agreements over concerns related to the elimination of future competition. Given the increased scrutiny on potential or nascent competition in antitrust matters, it is critical to understand the economic rationale that underpins the but-for world when evaluating such competition. In this article, the authors highlight some of these challenges, describe some illustrative examples, and discuss how these challenges may vary across dif...

713,"February 10, 2022",Potential Competition Mergers: Lessons from Outside the Box,"
The puzzle of potential competition mergers is not theoretical but empirical — verifying that the firm not in the market is a likely significant competitor and that very few others are.  It may help to look at potential competition in other antitrust contexts.  From collusion, “reverse payment” pharmaceutical cases work only because regulation and legislation identify a unique potential generic competitor.  From abuse of dominance, the U.S. Microsoft case suggests low requirements for establishing that Netscape was a potential competitor to Windows, but in practice the case became equivalent in evidence and outcome to one about excluding actual competitors in browsers.  We conclude by looking at the relevance of empirical methods for assessing competitive risk in mergers, shifting the burden of proof, adding objectives beside “consumer welfare,” and, perhaps most important, focusing on how U.S. merger law specifies illegality when competition “may,” not “will,” be substantially reduced.

By Tim Brennan[1]
 
In principle, potential competition mergers are not puzzling. Understanding how a merger between an ongoing firm and a supplier not yet in the market could reduce competition in the future is neither difficult nor requiring the latest advances in industrial organization theory or even Chicago School economics. Courts have recognized a potential competition doctrine going back to at least 1964.[2]

714,"February 10, 2022",Making the Potential Competition Doctrine Great Again,"
Antitrust enforcement efforts against “big-tech” have been hobbled by the destruction of the “potential competition doctrine.” This post describes how the Supreme Court made the doctrine ineffective after creating the doctrine.  It then describes how the antitrust enforcement agencies handcuffed themselves further in the development of the doctrine through their merger guidelines. As currently formulated, the potential competition doctrine makes merger enforcement by tech companies impotent. The paper uses Facebook’s Instagram acquisition as an example. It then offers a proposal on how to fix the doctrine to render potential competition a meaningful tool in antitrust enforcement.

I. INTRODUCTION
Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook (Meta), and Microsoft (“Big Tech”) dominate the American technology sector.[2] All of these companies exercise considerable market power through various strategic practices. A growing chorus of commentators have argued that Big Tech’s dominance has been advanced and maintained by hundreds of acquisitions of smaller start-up firms, many below the Hart-Scott-Rodino thresholds.[3] Some of these firms, had they remained independent, might have quickly scaled, or entered into alliances, and challenged the Big Tech firms.[4] To prevent this from occurring, Big Tech stopped these potential competitors in the cradle by establishing “kill zones” where the potential challengers are ei...

715,"February 10, 2022",Discriminatory Antitrust in the Realm of Potential and Nascent Competition,"
One of the most important topics in antitrust is how to analyze potential and nascent acquisitions by the largest digital platforms. Notably, there have been calls to implement “discriminatory antitrust” policies where one set of rules applies to big tech while another set of rules applies to everyone else. However, less attention seems to be paid to the actual empirical evidence. To that end, this article reviews a recent FTC report on big tech acquisitions and finds little to raise alarms. Second, the article examines several recent acquisitions by Spotify, an important technology company that sits outside of the “big tech” classification. If Spotify’s recent series of acquisitions can reasonably be considered procompetitive, then why is the same not true (or even possible) for Apple and Amazon within the same product space? Finally, the article summarizes the findings of several recent studies that examined a series of big tech acquisitions. Taken as a whole, these studies indicate insufficient evidence to conclude a systematic concern that large digital technology companies are engaging in anticompetitive acquisitions of potential and nascent competitors.

716,"February 10, 2022",Potential Competition as Process and Structure,"
Before the development of formal price theory in the early twentieth century, which included the invention of the theory of “perfect” competition, economists held an understanding of competition as active striving, leading to economic growth rather than to “optimality” in any static sense.  In the twentieth century, Joseph Schumpeter would be a lonely voice reiterating and amplifying the conception of competition as a dynamic process.  If competition is active and dynamic, the important form of competition is potential competition, often from sources we cannot easily foresee.  If competition is active and dynamic, the market structure we observe today, or even the market structure we imagine will prevail in the future, is a poor guide to antitrust policy.  We should focus instead on impediments, especially legal impediments, to entry, experiment, and contract.  In this light, recent proposals to impose on Internet platforms “structural separations” defined in terms of existing technological boundaries are likely to restrict not enhance potential competition – just as such separations did in the twentieth century.  Moreover, proposals to restrict platforms from diversifying, including through acquisition, are likely to mute the powerful potential competition that the large platforms represent to each other.

Below, we have provided the Japanese translation of the full transcript of our panel discussion Mobile Ecosystems: Competition, Choice and User Protection. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to Japan.

大軒 敬子:
こんにちは、大軒敬子です。 本日、CPIのTVプログラムの モデレーターをさせていただきます。 『モバイルエコシステム：競争、選択、ユーザー保護』 というトピックです。 デジタル経済における競争は、明らかにエコシステム間の 競争となりつつあります。 今回のパネルにご参加いただくのは、 これらの問題の最前線にいる弁護士と学者の方々です。 角田龍哉弁護士、西村あさひ法律事務所より。 神戸大学より、善如悠介 准教授。 OECDのコンサルタントより、レニ・パパさんです。 初めにオープニングの言葉、そしてそれについて話し合いながら 質問をしていきます。 では始めましょう。 ではまず、悠介さん、モバイルエコシステムの経済状態についてお話いただけますか？
 

善如 悠介:
この問題について話す機会をいただき有難うございます。 最初は英語で話しますが、途中から日本語に切り替えると思います。 経済学の観点から、モバイルエコシステムについてお話ししたい点が2つあります。 1つ目は、状況によっては独占が必ずしも悪いことではないということです。 特にネットワーク商品に関してです。 2つ目は、モバイルエコシステム内の様々なサブマーケットでの競争の存在に関連しています。 １つ目の点では、ご存知のように、最近の政策論議では、非常に高レベルな市場集中が大きな問題となっています。 例えば AppleのApp StoreとGoogleのPlay Storeは各モバイルOS市場でほぼ独占的なゲートキーパーの地位にあると批判されています。 しかし、経済繁栄の観点から言うと独占は必ずしも悪いわけではありません。 特にネットワーク外部性のある市場では。 例として、次のような状況を考えてみましょう。 市場では複数のネットワークが競合しています。 そして、それらは全く互いに互換性がありません。 この場合、ユーザーは別々の ネットワークに分割されます。 そして、こうしたユーザーの分裂は、ユーザーが大きなネットワークを楽しむことを困難にします。 対照的に、独占ネットワークが市場に存在する場合、すべてのユーザーが同じネットワークに入ることで、最大規模のネットワークやネットワーク帯域幅を楽しむことができます。 そこで、市場環境によっては、このネットワークサイズの拡大によるメリットが、価格上昇による悪影響を上回ります。 その場合、独占はより高度な社会福祉や消費者サービスをもたらすことができます。 もちろん、独占会社が消費者に対し、非常に高額な価格を設定した場合、これは当てはまりません。 これが私の最初のポイントです。 そして、2番目のポイントはもっと重要だと思います。 また、ご存知のとおり、モバイルエコシステムの現状は、非常に複雑です。 様々な種類のサブマーケットがあります。 さらに重要なことは、これらのサブマーケットは互いに密接に 相互接続されていることです。 これは他の製品市場には見られない、モバイルエコシステムの面白い特徴です。 したがって、人によっては、各市場内だけでなく、異なったサブマーケット間でも 競争があると考えられます。 そしてこの場合、各サブマーケットに 独占企業が存在する場合でも、そうした異なる市場を支配する独占企業間の、市場の壁を越えた 競争を促進することができます。 したがって、これが実行可能であれば、ネットワーク効果を犠牲にすることなく、非常に良い競争環境を実現できると思います。 これが私の2番目のポイントです。 ご清聴有難うございました。
 
大軒 敬子:
悠介さん、有難うございました。 では、龍哉さん、いかがですか？ モバイルエコシステムに関する日本の競争法の現状は？
 

角田龍哉:
敬子先生、どうも有難うございます。 日本の競争の観点から状況を紹介させていただきます。 ご存知と思いますが、悠介先生がおっしゃったように、日本では他の国と同じように、モバイルデバイス、モバイルOS、アプリケーションストアなどの 基本層、つまり必須な層は、Apple と Googleといった2社のプレーヤーによる売り手寡占の対象となっています。 これに関連して、公正取引委員会（JFTC）は、最近、近年のモバイル市場およびアプリケーションストア市場に関する市場調査を行なっています。 これに加えて、今年の9月、JFTCはAppleが支払い方法の制限を修正し、アプリケーションの審査に関するガイドラインを改訂または更新した後、Appleに対する調査を終了すると発表しました。 それは、アプリ開発者にとって不透明なことです。 さらには、今年の4月からアプリケーションストアは、日本の新しい規制、「デジタルプラットフォーム取引透明化法」の対象となりました。 これは、経済産業省によって管理されています。 この結果として、指定されたアプリケーションストアの運営会社、つまり、GoogleとAppleは、アプリケーションストアの利用規約の透明性を確保する必要があり、十分な情報を、利用規約を変更する際には事前通告することが必然化されました。 これらの状況を考慮する際に初めに目を向ける 点として注意が必要なのは、モバイルエコシステムがどのようにデザインされるかは独断的に各事業者が決定することが可能だということです。 一方、日本の現在の競争状況を考慮する際、一般的な考え方として、モバイルエコシステムの構造は、一般消費者だけでなく、 エコシステムの最大のプレーヤーにも大きな影響を与える可能性があることにも注意する必要があります。 したがって、日本にとって今重要なのは、エコシステム間の競争の促進、また、プラットフォーム上での競争の 促進を確保することなのです。 それが現状についての私の最初の見解です。 以上です。
 
大軒 敬子:
龍哉さん、最近の日本の状況の 動向についてお知らせいただき有難うございました。 JFTCは他国の競争当局とも連絡を取り合っており、私たちは他の機関や他国の見解にも関心があります。 レニさん、外国人の視点から私たちと意見を共有していただければ幸いです。
 

Leni PAPA:
有難うございます、敬子さん。 まず初めに、この非常に重要でタイムリーな、モバイルエコシステムに関する話し合いを企画してくださったCPIに感謝します。 それでは、少しさかのぼって、日本以外でのこの経済状況などを説明しましょう。 では、なぜそれがパンデミックの時に特に重要なのでしょう。 OECD諸国では、2020年にはOECD諸国全体で、モバイルデータの使用量が平均15％以上増加し、モバイルブロードバンドのサブスクリプションが 3.6％増加。 その中でも日本で最も高いモバイルインターネット普及率の伸びを示しています、住民100人あたりと同様に。 失礼、住民100人あたり 185％の サブスクリプションでした。 また、各国がパンデミックの回復に向けて努力している今、モバイルエコシステムは特に重要です。 ヨーロッパで見られたように、モバイルテクノロジーはGDPの 大部分を生み出しているからです。 ヨーロッパのGDPの4.6%だったということは、約240万人の雇用に相当します。 そのため、多くの国際機関やシンクタンクは、我々がより素晴らしくより包括的な社会を構築するために各経済を活性化する際、モバイルエコシステムが非常に大きな役割を果たすと認識しています。 ですから、このような背景を踏まえ、現在、他国のさまざまな展開を観ております。 つまり、悠介さんがおっしゃったように、 モバイルエコシステムには成長傾向とともに懸念が高まってきていると言えます。 それは、少数の主要なデジタルプラットフォームが市場を支配する地位に定着していることです。 このことを米国においても見てきました。 つまり、米国の独占禁止法小委員会による 2020年の報告で、Amazon、Apple、 Facebook、Googleの4つの最大のデジタルプラットフォームについていくつかの点が記してありました。 まず第一に、これらのプラットフォームが ゲートキーパーの役目をしており、主要な流通経路を制御しています。 彼らは市場にアクセスでき、経済全体での勝者と敗者を選ぶことができます。 これはEUでも懸念されていることです。 EUのデジタル市場法案の説明メモにあるように、ヨーロッパのデジタル経済には、10,000のオンラインプラットフォーム プロバイダーがありますが、そのほとんどは中小企業で、少数の大規模なオンラインプラットフォームが、全体の生産価値の大部分を占めています。 そして、これは数々の、EUの地域レベルか国レベルで決定済みのケース、または、現在追求されているケースで明らかになっています。 最もよく知られている判例の一つは、 多分、EUの一般裁判所により最近、支持されたGoogleショッピングの事例です。 それに対するGoogleの控訴を一般裁判所は却下しました。 そして今、ご覧の皆さんにも言えるのは、このケースがGoogleの自社利益優先と 関係することです。 Googleは独自の検索エンジンを使用しました。 EEA市場の市場シェア90%以上は、 それが占めていますね。 また、Googleは、EEAの13か国のオンライン一般検索サービスの市場での支配的地位を濫用しました。 したがって、欧州委員会の主張は、自社の比較ショッピングサービスを他社のものより優遇したというものでした。 また、非常に、非常に、非常にごく最近、実際、文字通りほんの数時間前に、イタリアの競争当局はAmazonに対し、同社が市場での地位を濫用したとして最高の罰金を科しました。 同社のオンラインマーケットプレイスでの販売者が同社の物流サービスにも登録した際に、同社が不法に販売者にベネフィットを与えていたことが発覚したからです。 そしてその逆に、Amazonのサービスをフルに利用しなかった販売者は、Amazon Primeの顧客に提供された特典を利用できなくなったということでした。 また、米国やEUだけでなく、アジアにもいくつかの例があります。 特に韓国ではNAVERのケース。 韓国最大のオンライン検索エンジンNAVERに対し、韓国公取委は、同社が市場の独占的地位を濫用し、契約条項を締結するときに契約プロバイダーがNAVER不動産プラットフォーム事業のライバルに情報を提供することを妨げ、罰則を科したことを明らかにした事例でした。 そして、こうしたケースが起こった後に、世界中でいくらか政策の進展がありました。 それらについては、おそらく後で より詳しく説明しますが、多分、既に採用された様々な方策を要約するだけになります。 一部の法域では、競争法を改正することを選択しています。 現在の法律では、モバイル経済におけるこれらの懸念に対処するには不十分であるという議論に基づいてです。 合併法を改正しようとしている法域もあれば、モバイルエコシステムを綿密に監視する ためにデジタルマーケットユニットを制定または設立しようという法域、また、EUや英国のように事前規制オプションを準備または 提案している法域もあります。 ですから、これは日本でも議論されていると思いますが、モバイルエコシステムで特定された問題の解決策となる行動規範の開発が進んでいます。 以上です、敬子さん。
 
大軒 敬子:
有難うございました、レニさん。 様々な管轄区域の観点から 見解を共有していただきました。 さて、皆さんのオープニングのお話を参考に、論議の主な構成を立ててみました。 さっそく最初の質問に移りたいと思います。 最初の質問は、悠介さんとレニさんにお伺いします。 悠介さんがお話くださったクロスマーケットでの競争について、どう思いますか？ 例えば、アプリプラットフォームと 広告プラットフォームの間など？ 悠介さんはこの分野の専門家で いらっしゃることは知っています。 そこで、専門家としての考えを教えてほしいです。
 
善如 悠介:
有難うございます。 オープニングで述べたように、市場の壁を越えたクロスマーケット・ プラットフォームの競争は、優れた政策立案をより適切に実施するための良い 方法となる可能性があります。 本日は、私の最近の研究成果について主にお話したいと思います。 その研究では、アプリプラットフォームと広告プラットフォーム間のクロスマーケット競争に関する複雑な関係を探求しようとしています。 特に、アプリプラットフォーム市場では、ご存知のように、AppleとGoogleがゲートキーパーの立場にあると批判されてきました。 しかし、彼らは完全な独占者ではないと私は思います。 なぜなら、彼らは別のタイプのプラットフォーム、 つまり、広告仲介業者またはアドテク企業と競合しているからです。 これらの広告仲介プラットフォームにより、アプリ開発者はアプリの販売ではなくアプリ内の広告によって収益を上げることができます。 実際、アプリ開発者の90%以上がこのビジネスモデルに依存しています。 つまり、彼らはアプリを無料で配布しているのです。 そして、Apple の App Storeや Google の Playストアなどのアプリプラットフォームに手数料を支払うこともありません。 そこで、アプリプラットフォーム市場と広告プラットフォーム市場の間の クロスマーケット・プラットフォームの競争を考慮することは非常に重要だと思います。 しかし実際には、AppleとGoogleは 現在、手数料削減を求める社会的圧力に直面しています。 そして今年、彼らは一部のアプリの手数料率を30％から15％に引き下げました。 それと対照的に、CMA報告書と呼ばれる英国政府の報告書によると、広告価値の少なくとも35%をアドテク企業に奪われています。 広告プラットフォーム市場では35%ですよ、アプリプラットフォーム市場で15%のところ。 かなり不均衡ですね。 つまり、広告手数料はアプリの手数料よりもはるかに高くなっているわけですよね。 したがって、これらのことは、App Storeや Google Playストアなどのアプリプラットフォームに対する最近の社会的な圧力が、もしかすると、モバイルエコシステムの 現在の状態におけるクロスマーケット競争のバランスを歪めているかもしれないということです。 もしそうなら、状況は悪い方向に 進んでいるように思います。 これが、今のモバイルエコシステムに関して私が一番懸念していることです。 以上です。
 
大軒 敬子:
有難うございました、悠介さん。 プラットフォーム間の競争に関する経済的見通しを説明していただきました。 では、レニさん、悠介さんのお話に対する考えを共有していただければ幸いです。
 
Leni PAPA:
有難う、敬子さん。 そして悠介さん、興味深いお話を有難うございました。 実際、OECDの最近の研究と同じ路線です。 したがって、この、国境を越えた調査では、デジタル市場が関与するクロスマーケット競争に関する多くの懸念を実際に要約しています。 そのいくつかを簡単に説明しましょう。 順番に言いますと、まず第一の懸念は、自社利益優先です。 広告枠を販売し、パブリッシャーと広告主の仲介役として機能するプラットフォームには、独自のものを優遇する動機があります。 また、批評家によっては、デジタル広告のサプライチェーンの 特定のプラットフォームが消費者とデータへのアクセスに関し、自社の事業ユニットに優遇措置を与えていると議論しています。 2番目の懸念はレバレッジに関係します。 論評者たちが提起した懸念は、デジタル広告サプライチェーンの一部に市場支配力を持つ垂直統合型企業が、その市場支配力を サプライチェーンの他の部分にも活用できてしまうのではないかということです。 そしてレバレッジの成功率が上がるのは、市場支配力を持つプラットフォームが市場の様々な側面への切り替えを他社には困難にしてしまえる状況です。 また、クロスマーケット競争に関するもう1つの懸念事項は、ユーザーデータの収集です。 特にCMAからですが、懸念の声が上がっているのは、特定のプラットフォームが市場支配力を悪用して大量の消費者データを収集する可能性があるということです。 それは、ターゲット広告、特にディスプレイ広告が目的です。 また、CMAは、消費者の多くは、サービスを使用するときに共有している情報についてあまり理解していないことが発覚しました。 そして、この議論が、ドイツ連邦カルテル庁によるFacebook訴訟の大きな特徴です。 独カルテル庁は、Facebookの利用者が、個人情報に関する同社の条件について、有意義な同意を していなかったことを表明しました。 ですから、そういったことは、悠介さんの研究内容とかなり一致していると思います。
 
大軒 敬子:
有難うございました、レニさん。 レニさんがFacebookの事例について触れました。 特定のケースです。 そこで龍哉さんに、モバイルエコシステム または、エコシステムに関連した最近の日本の事例を共有していただければと思います。
 
角田龍哉:
大変有難うございます。 最近の日本のデジタルプラットフォームの事例については、先ほどお伝えしたように、公正取引委員会がAppleに対して調査を行いました。 このケースはデジタルコンテンツ関連のアプリケーションセクター、中でも音楽、ビデオ、電子書籍のアプリに 多く関連していますが、Apple社の約束は、アプリケーションプラットフォームの透明性の向上に貢献する可能性があります。 そして、お伝えしたように、取引透明化法は、将来的にはアプリケーションストア全体の透明性も向上させることでしょう。 このアプローチは、レニさんが先ほど説明されたように、国際的なアプローチと概ね一致している可能性があり、モバイルエコシステムの競争状況を改善できるかもしれません。 しかし、モバイルエコシステムに関する独占的状況を対処または理解するためには、まだこれからも議論すべき問題があると思います。 今年の12月、公正取引委員会は、日本の大手eコマースプレーヤーである楽天に対する捜査を終了すると発表しました。 この判例では、楽天が、一定額以上の注文の配達が送料無料になることを目的に、対象店舗の配送料に関する条件を一方的に変更したとされています。 そうした行為は、優越的地位の濫用と見なされます。 一方、楽天は、この条件変更により市場全体の効率が最適化されるのだと主張しました。これは、Amazonなどの強豪プレーヤーと競争する上で重要である、ということでした。しかし、それにも関わらず、 訴訟は今まで続いていたのでした。 これは、アプリケーションストアが透明性を確保しながらアプリケーションストアの完全な最適化を図るとしても、プラットフォーム上の中小企業の競争力を保護することは、まだまだ困難であることを意味します。 さらに、複数のアプリケーションストアがより大きなプレーヤーと競争しようとしているという事実は、彼らの行動や行為を正当化するものではなく、日本の独占禁止法の、現在の分析の フレームワークの下で中小企業の保護が優先されることになるかもしれません。 だから私も、市場間の競争に焦点を当て、その分析を行い、独占禁止法に基づく評価をも考慮する必要があることに同意します。 しかし、最近の執行事例を考えると、最近のフレームワークが十分でない可能性があること、もしくはある程度更新または近代化する 必要があることを意味します。 これが日本の最近の状況についての私の見解です。
 
大軒 敬子:
龍哉さん、有難うございました。 今お話しいただいた楽天のケースは、興味深いケースであり、 難しいケースでもあると思います。 楽天は他の企業と競争するために その計画を立てようとした・・・他の企業とは楽天の競争相手を意味します。 しかし、それはJFTCから考えると、楽天がユーザーや利用会社に対し、優先的地位を濫用した可能性があるということでした。 では、悠介さん、これについての見解を伺えますか。経済学者は何でも解決できると 私は何となく信じているのですが。
 
善如 悠介:
有難うございます、敬子さん、 このトピックについて話す機会をくださり。 私の意見では、楽天の配送料ポリシーに関する現在のJFTCの決定は、楽天の第三者の販売人に対する優越的地位や支配的地位の濫用に基づいていると思います。 この判決はつまり、プラットフォームと、第三者である販売者との間の関係の要因のみを考慮して行われたということです。 そして、このケースでは消費者の視点は 考慮されていないということです。 私は、消費者保護を検討する方法がほかにもあると思います。 しかし同時に、プラットフォームによる行為が、売り手側だけでなく消費者側にとっても有益または有害であるかを特定することは非常に難しいと思います。 ですから、この点について具体的な答えはありませんが、これは世界中でもっと考えるべきだと思います。 以上です。
 
大軒 敬子:
では、次の質問に移ります。 次の質問は主にレニさんと龍哉さんにします。 このセッションの題名は『モバイルエコシステム：競争、選択、ユーザー保護』ですが、ユーザー保護はどう行える、または 行われるべきなのでしょうか。 レニさん、いかがでしょう。
 
Leni PAPA:
はい、有難うございます、敬子さん。 この点に関しては、モバイルエコシステムのユーザーを保護するための政策方法として、それぞれの法域で様々な種類の方法が検討されており、それは基本的には、3つに分けられます。 1つ目は、異なったプラットフォーム間の利益相反に対処しようとする措置であり
反競争的行為を引き起こす可能性があります。 それが１つ目です。 2つ目は、潜在的な反競争的行為を管理することです。 これには自己参照とレバレッジ関連が含まれます。 そして3つ目は、市場の不透明性に対処することです。 したがって、1つ目は、利益相反を 管理するという観点からすると、様々なアプローチがあります。 それに含まれるのは、第一に、関連する様々な事業者の間を構造的に分離するという提案で、その後、CMAの推奨の下で、モバイルエコシステムに構造的分離の救済策を課すことを専門とするデジタルマーケットユニットを設置するという点がありました。 そして、これは米国の下院側でも見られます。 米国下院は独占禁止法報告書で、米国議会に対し、より大きなデジタルプラットフォーム間の 利益相反を管理するために事業間の構造的分離を可能にする法律を検討するよう勧めました。 完全な構造的分離がない場合、それが中国の壁を通して、行動と開示の規則で管理するべきだという提案がありました。 そして、その下での3番目の提案は、競争当局を通じて構造的救済を実施することです。 一方で、2番目の提案も必要です。 それは反競争的行為から守ることで先ほどもお伝えしましたがモバイルエコシステムの事前規制を支持する声が高まっています。 おそらくヨーロッパで最もよく知られているのは、EUのデジタル市場法の提案です。 EUでは特定のプラットフォーム、大きな オンラインプラットフォームについて、最も不正行為を起こしやすいオンライン仲介サービスと呼んでいます。 それには、ゲートキーパーと見なされる 4大企業が含まれます。 そして、市場において、特定の高さの敷居と特定の影響力を遵守または満たす必要があります。 ゲートキーパーと見なされた場合、特定の事前標準の禁止事項や義務に従う必要があります。 したがって、第一に、相互運用性を許可し、データの効果的な移植性を提供する必要があります。 また、他の主要プラットフォームの サービスプロバイダーを巻き込む意図的な集結については、欧州委員会に通知する必要があります。 その反対側に英国があります。 英国ではデジタルマーケットユニットが設立され、戦略的な市場地位（SMS）にある企業を特定するための規定があります。 そうした企業は、実質的に定着した市場支配力を持つ企業です。 SMS企業と見なされたら、特定の行動規範の対象となります。 しかし、英国とEUの提案の違いは、英国のほうには、よりカスタマイズされた行動規範があることです。 それは、特定の会社用に 行動規範を加減するということです。 しかしその代わり、SMS企業には、すべての取引をCMAに報告する義務があります。 そして最後。これも消費者データを保護する方法として、かなり大きな討論が繰り広げられています。 これに関して、競争法だけでなく、 データプライバシー保護法から採掘する、または相乗効果を得る必要があるという世論が高まっています。 そして、後でまた話しますが、我々、政策立案者も注意する必要があります。 クロスマーケット・プラットフォームの競争を制御または促進するための競争法を提案する際には、データやプライバシーへの影響についても考慮する必要があります。 最後に、今の点をまとめさせていただくと、これらの政策提案から生じるであろう費用と便益を評価する必要があります。
 
大軒 敬子:
レニさん、比較視点を共有してくださり、 有難うございました。 また、事前規制についても少しお話くださいましたね。 それは、日本がすでに検討中のトピックの1つでもあって、将来どのように使用できるかを検討しています。 そして龍哉さんは取引透明化法 について触れられました。 そこで龍哉さん、取引透明化法についての 見解を共有していただけますか。
 
角田龍哉:
大変有難うございます。 敬子先生とレニさんが話されたように、モバイルエコシステムでユーザーを保護する方法は色々とあります。 そして、それは各管轄区域で決めることです。 したがって、一方では、競争やイノベーションを促進することになると、ビジネスプレーヤーの予測性、または法的確信を保証することが重要です。 その意味で、競争法や方策が消費者やユーザーの保護の問題に対処している場合にも、それが信頼性のあるものか、プライバシー保護法などの他の専門的な条例により作成された基準線を反映する必要があります。 日本には電気通信事業法があります。 それは、ユーザーのプライバシーなどの 通信向けのデータを直接、または規制で保護するものでもあります。 また、消費者の快適さを守る条例や不実表示に関する条例などの消費者保護法も適切なものがあります。 これらの他の規制や制度は、 特定の種類、または特定の側面や観点からのユーザー保護に関する調査に基づいた、広範囲にわたる政策の議論を通じて開発されました。 したがって、これらの制度が独占禁止法の施行または適用の際には基準線を提供するべきなのです。 そうです、そうすれば、事業者は洞察を得たり、競争政策を予測したり、ビジネスモデルを修正したり、自己評価を効果的かつ積極的に 実施したりすることができます。 それがこのトピックに関する私の見解です。
 
大軒 敬子:
龍哉さん、有難うございました。 悠介さん、ユーザー保護に関して、経済的な面から何か共有したいことはありますか。
 
善如 悠介:
有難うございます。 私のような経済学者にとっては難しい質問です。 経済学者は通常、ユーザー保護については考慮せず代わりに、社会福祉の最大化を考慮します。 そこで申し訳ありませんが、 この質問には答えられません。
 
大軒 敬子:
大丈夫ですよ。今のお答えも参考になりました。 それでは、悠介さんへの次の質問に移りましょう。 何が選択なのか。 選択もこのセッションの題名の一部です。 選択とは何か、そしてそれは モバイルエコシステムにおいてどうあるべきか、競争法と政策の 観点からいかがでしょうか。
 
善如 悠介:
了解です。有難うございます。 私は弁護士ではなく競争法の研究者です。 だから、経済学者として話させてください。 より良い選択をできるようになるには、まず、現在のモバイルエコシステムの非常に複雑な状況を理解する必要があります。 でもこれは簡単なことではないと思います。 とても難しいです。 しかし、私たちが取り組む必要のあるもう1つのことは市場の透明性を強化することです。 これは非常に重要なポイントだと思います。 特に、透明性の欠如は広告市場において非常に重大な問題だと思います。 ご存知のように、そして現在の状況の話の中でも述べたように、アプリの手数料は、15％から30％です。 それと対照的に、広告手数料は少なくとも35％です。 アプリの手数料よりもはるかに高いわけです。 それにもかかわらず、アプリ開発者の90％以上が広告収入に依存しています。なぜでしょう？ シンプルな質問ですよ。なぜ？ 私にもその理由はよくわかりません。 しかし、私の推測では、これは広告市場が非常に不明瞭であり、透明性がないためです。 欧州委員会の報告によると、アプリ開発者は自分達のアプリの 広告スペースに、誰がいくら払ったのか知らないそうです。は非常に悪状況です。 現在の広告市場には全く透明性がないのです。 この状況では、アプリ開発者がより良い選択、今の状態で普通に良い選択を することはできないと思います。したがって、この問題を解決するには、広告、特にモバイル広告市場の透明性を強化する必要があります。 これがこのトピックに関する私の考えです。以上です。

有難うございました、悠介さん。 透明性が重要というお話でした。 私は日本の弁護士として、日本の取引透明化法がうまく 実施されるよう期待しています。 そして、それで日本の問題が解決できれば素晴らしいです。 ではレニさん、これについての見解をお話しください。
 
Leni PAPA:
はい。 有難う、敬子さん。 私の見解は、悠介さんの今の 透明性の問題に関するお話と非常に関係しています。 現在、そうしたケースが進化する中で 私たちが把握できたのは、消費者の選択は、価格や品質、その他の製品自体に影響を与える要因にはあまり依存していないということです。 その代わりに市場のほかの力の影響を受けていることが分かりましたね。 そして、選択肢のある消費者を分析する際に思い浮かぶ質問は、 第一に、消費者の選択肢が実際にどの程度、情報に基づいているかということです。 したがって、これは透明性と情報に関連しています。 消費者は本当に自分の選択を行使できるのでしょうか。 そして、消費者は自分で選択をする力がある場合、どう行使するのでしょう。 そして、エコシステムの抑制は、消費者の選択の行使にどう影響するのでしょう。 これは、消費者の選択を評価する際に効率基準を置き換えようとしていることを示唆するものではありませんが、その効率基準を分析する際のインプットになります。 したがって、私が複数の管轄区域でもっと探求したいのは、モバイルエコシステム内の特定の慣行が、特にオンラインでの消費者の選択方法にどう影響を及ぼすかをより直接的に認識することです。 そして、効果的な選択をする能力に 対して、有意か人為的な束縛があった場合、それらをより綿密に分析する必要があります。 なぜなら、現職者はおそらく競争により不透明性を壊されることを恐れているからです。 彼らは、消費者がより多くの 情報を得て選択できることより自分達のビジネスモデルを守りたいと考えています。 ですから、この問題には、各国の政策立案に関しても慎重に踏み出さなければならないのです。
 
大軒 敬子:
有難うございました、レニさん。 モバイルエコシステムは非常に複雑です。 誰もが、競争が重要であるとお考えだと思います。 そして、競争は安定しているべきです。 でも、どうすれば競争は安定するのでしょう。 そして、競争とは何でしょう。 そこで、プラットフォーム間の競争とプラットフォームユーザー間の競争に触れます。 この問題は複雑です。 JFTCを含む競争当局がこれに対処しています。 そして競争法はもしかすると、もちろん、役に立つはずではありますがそれが競争を促進する唯一の ツールではないかもしれません。 そして今日、事前規制と透明性について話しました。 多分、これらが2つ、いや、3つと言うべきですが、おそらく2つの最も重要な鍵となる用語であり、状況は変化してきて、今後もおそらく劇的に変化するでしょう。 それがどうなるか、具体的な見解はありませんが、私は劇的な変化が起こると確信しています。 そして、意見を共有してくださったパネリストの皆さんに感謝します。 では最後に、各パネリストに閉会の言葉をお願いしたいと思います。 日本や世界中のモバイルエコシステムでは様々なことが起こっており、それらの問題について皆がより深く考えることが不可欠となる可能性があります。 では、クロージングにレニさん、見解を共有していただけますか。
 
Leni PAPA:
有難う、敬子さん。 モバイルエコシステムに関するこの国際的な議論の高まりに関連して、私が締めくくりの一環としてお伝えしたいのは、モバイルエコシステムを綿密に調査することに関して確実に 声が高まっていることです。 そして現在疑問となっているのは、既存の規制措置やツールがこの急速に進化するエコシステムに適切であるかどうかということです。 また、もう一つお伝えしたいのは、おっしゃるように、この問題は競争だけでなく、他の政策分野にも影響を与えるということです。 そこに、プライバシーとデータの保護があります。 また、消費者保護も考慮せねばなりません。 今回それについては話し合いませんでしたね。 しかし、それはメディアコンテンツの提供と報酬にも影響を与える可能性があります。 ですから、この問題が他の政策分野に どのように影響するかには、必要性があると思います。 プライバシーに関与する他の政策専門家も関与する必要があることを 認識しておく必要があります。 私たちはこの分野の知識を独占していません。 また、もう1つ重要なことは、モバイルエコシステムはますます国際化してきているため、皆にとって非常に有益となるのは、政策のオプションを国際協力により話し合うことです。 今、私たちが行っているのと同様に。 繰り返しますが、今回、ここで非常に 有益な議論をしてくださった同僚の皆さんに感謝します。 大いに勉強になりました。
 
大軒 敬子:
有難うございました、レニさん。 私も全くレニさんと同感です。 特に、国際協力は、デジタル分野では大変重要になるでしょう。 では次に、悠介さん。
 
善如 悠介:
了解です。有難うございます。 ご存知のように、今のところ、現在の競争環境は非常に複雑です。 そしてまた、競争はダイナミックです。 したがって、この複雑な状況の将来については誰にもわかりません。 しかし、私たち経済学者と競争政策研究者は、この点に関して最善を尽くさなければなりません。 そして実際、現在、テクノロジー企業は事業領域を拡大しています。 その動きは状況をますます複雑にするでしょう。 もしそうなら、より良い政策立案を作成するためには、個々の市場を見るだけでは不十分でしょう。 そこで私たちは、モバイルエコシステムについてもっと視野を広げる必要があります。 もちろん関連したプラットフォーム市場についても。 しかし、この挑戦は簡単ではありません。 そのため、世界中で、さらなる議論が多々必要です、アジア、ヨーロッパ、北米だけでなくて。 以上が私の今の結論です。 ご清聴ありがとうございました。
 
大軒 敬子:
悠介さん、有難うございました。 龍哉さん、閉会の言葉をお願いできますか。
 
角田龍哉:
有難うございます、敬子先生。 ２点、お伝えしたいと思います。 最初の点は、透明性に関してです。 このセッションでも観たように、透明性はモバイルエコシステム業界で流行語になりつつあります。 そうは言っても、最初に述べたように、エコシステムの運営社はそれ自体にエコシステムを設計することができます。 それは私たちの行動に大きな 影響を与えるかもしれません。 したがって、透明性を促進する実装や対策が今後さらに増える可能性があるとしても、そうした対策が透明性を促進または保護するための関連性を本当に持っているかどうか、慎重に検討する必要があります。 言い換えれば、レニさんがおっしゃったように、Google ショッピングの事例を参照することによって、管理などの措置の背後に隠された目的があるかどうか。 そしてもう一つのポイントは、規制当局がこの種の問題にどのように取り組むべきかということです。 管轄区域として、日本はモバイルエコシステムの競争関連の問題に対処するための規制ツールも開発しています。 しかし、これらのツールは一般的に、大手企業間のコミュニケーションまたは協力に基づいています。 EUのように高額の罰金を課すことによる厳しい執行アプローチではありません。 これは日本の規制制度の歴史的な傾向ですので、このアプローチが日本の国内企業だけでなく、外国企業にとっても効果的なのかはわかりません。 したがって、将来、日本の当局がこのアプローチを追求する場合、当局側の透明性も確実にすることが重要です。 彼らは、合理的かつ客観的な証拠、そして説得力のある議論を、 私たちと同様な懸念を共有する可能性のある外国企業、異なった文化や背景をもった外国企業に対し示さなければなりません。 それが私の閉会のコメントです。 有難うございました。

US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who has argued for the breakup of tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook, has urged the Justice Department to be more aggressive in fighting price-fixing, reported Reuters.
“The nation is dealing with inflation at its highest level in decades, much of it driven by corporate greed and anticompetitive behavior, and the federal government must use every tool available to prevent price gouging and reduce prices for Americans,” Warren wrote in a letter dated Monday and sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland and his deputy, Lisa Monaco.
Warren criticized, in particular, price-fixing deferred prosecution agreements that the department reached with Argos USA, a cement producer, and three generic drugs companies, Taro Pharmaceuticals, Novartis unit Sandoz, and Apotex.
Warren said the Argos deal was “unusual particularly because the concrete industry has been rife with criminal antitrust issues for decades.” Regarding the deals with pharmaceutical companies, she said that “none of the criminal executives will see any time in prison in spite of confessed illegal practices scamming the government and patients in need of drugs.”
Warren asked Garland and Monaco for any data that the department kept regarding price-fixing enforcement efforts, including prison sentences that executives might be serving, penalties and restitution; information on how the Justice Department decides to enter into deferred prosecution agreements and whether the government has observed multiple instances of price-fixing in any industry and focused resources there.

On Monday, the Dutch antitrust watchdog fined apple Apple 5 million euros for a third time for failing to allow software application makers in the Netherlands to use non-Apple payment methods for dating apps listed in the company’s App Store, reported Reuters
The Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has been levying weekly fines of 5 million euros on Apple since the company missed a Jan. 15 deadline to make changes ordered by the watchdog.

Apple, which could not immediately be reached for comment, has twice published information on its own blog about changes it is making to comply with the Dutch order. However, the ACM said on Monday it was not receiving enough information from the US company to assess whether Apple was actually complying.
“ACM is disappointed in Apple’s behaviour and actions,” it said in a statement. It noted that Dutch courts have upheld its decision, which found that Apple’s behaviour violated competition law.
Apple is under pressure in many countries over the commissions it charges on in-app purchases, with the U.S. Senate approving a bill last Thursday that would bar Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google from requiring users to use their payment systems.

720,"February 3, 2022",Apple App Store Antitrust Bill OK’ed By Senate Judiciary Committee,"


The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, February 3, approved legislation that, if passed into law, would force Apple to let users install apps from outside of the App Store, reported Axios.
If the bill passes the full Senate and makes it to President Joe Biden’s desk, Google and Apple would essentially have to give up full control of their app stores.
According to Axios, the new rules could require them both to allow app side-loading, installing apps from non-sanctioned marketplaces, and alternative payment processing systems. Apple and Google have argued vehemently against the bill.
The 21-1 vote shows there’s increasing support in Congress for the kinds of bills that aim to reel in Big Tech companies. It will still be a long haul for this bill to become law, but it’s notable that it made it out of committee so easily, garnering the support of many Republicans.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota), a co-author of the bill along with Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut) and Marsha Blackburn (Republican – Tennessee), dismissed tech company claims that the bill would cause privacy and security problems.
The Open App Markets Act, spearheaded by Sens. Blumenthal and Blackburn, the chair and ranking member of subcommittee on consumer protection, seeks to require dominant app stores to make it easier for developers to distribute their apps and connect with their customers.
The app store operators have opposed the bill as originally drafted, warning it could jeopardize consumer privacy and result in a worse user experience.
″This bill could destroy many consumer benefits that current payment systems provide and distort competition by exempting gaming platforms, which amounts to Congress trying to artificially pick winners and losers in a highly competitive marketplace,” Google VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy Mark Isakowitz said in a statement ahead of the markup. App Store
In a letter to Judiciary Committee leaders obtained by CNBC, Apple Senior Director of Government Affairs in the Americas Timothy Powderly wrote, “We are deeply concerned that the legislation, unless amended, would make it easier for big social media platforms to avoid the pro-consumer practices of Apple’s App Store, and allow them to continue business as usual. It does so by mandating that Apple allow the sideloading of apps and app stores that need not comply with the App Store’s pro-consumer privacy protections.”

722,"February 2, 2022",India’s Fair Market Regulator Needs to Define What is the Market Sin it has Penalized Amazon For,"
By Subhomoy Bhattacharjee1
 
When France and Germany went to war in 1870, a London newspaper pithily remarked “The Liberal Empire goes to war on a mere point of etiquette.” The order issued by the Competition Commission of India2 against Amazon revoking its acquisition of 49 percent in Future Coupons Private Limited (“FCPL”) in 2019 seems to be similarly based somewhat on a question of etiquette.
Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“Amazon”), a direct subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc, and India’s Future Group, operating in the retail and fashion sector have presented competing claims before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”).  Amazon has claimed3 the fair market regulator made a mistake in approving FCPL’s sale of its retail assets housed in Future Retail Limited (“FRL”) to a company owned by Reliance Industries (“RIL”) for US$ 3.4 billion. According to the US-based multinational technology company, the approval was “illegally obtained” since a previous order exists against the finalization of the deal, issued by a Singapore arbitration court.
FCPL has, in turn, contended4 that Amazon filed “false and incorrect information” to acquire the 49 percent stake in FCPL. For context, FCPL is the primary shareholder of FRL, holding a 9.82 percent equity. The key point of the dispute was whether FCPL should get prior approval from Amazon before exercising any rights over FRL, essentially a Right of First Refusal clause.
At this stage, it is not my intention to question whether Amazon has disclosed all that is material in the case with CCI or anyone else. The same holds true regarding its competitor, RIL. Rather, this paper analyzes only the documents made publicly available in the respective cases.
The fast-growing retail sector in India has become a highly sought-after space for Indian and foreign businesses to expand their presence. The struggle between Amazon and RIL is the most visible manifestation of this competition.
The CCI has upheld FCPL’s argument that Amazon had “suppressed the actual purpose and particulars of the combination.” In issuing its order the Commission noted Amazon’s original application had “omissions, false statements and misrepresentations (which) have the effect of influencing the line of inquiry in assessing the Combination.”
Consequently, the CCI has:

revoked its approval of the combination between Amazon and FCPL which was given on 28th November 2019;
asked Amazon to refile its application within 60 days of the new order “with true, correct and complete information”; and
imposed a penalty of Rs two hundred and two crores (Rs 2.02 billion) on Amazon.

Whatever the position of the contestants, one of the highlights of the dispute pitching Amazon against RIL is that it has again come back to be settled by the CCI. This is where it should have been from the beginning, since August 2020, when RIL’s  branch Reliance Retail Ventures Limited announced the buy-out of FRL’s retail business. Soon thereafter, however, Amazon moved to contest the deal at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. An interim decision was passed by the Emergency Arbitrator in Singapore in favor of Amazon, preventing FRL from moving forward on the deal with the RIL-owned company.
In response, the Future Group also turned to the courts in order to nullify the arbitration orders. There were competing court cases at the Delhi High Court and at the Supreme Court.
  
CCI Purview
At its core, the dispute between Amazon on one side, and FRL and RIL on the other, should be about market share and the possible formation of cartels, basically the possibility of an anti-competitive behavior.  However, in its 57-page order issued 17th December, 2021 the CCI only provided reams of text to prove that Amazon had “concealed its strategic interest over FRL.” Principally, it has argued that Amazon did not disclose FRL’s shareholders agreement, which apparently gave Amazon an overriding presence in FCPL. This is what I call an issue of etiquette, which has riled CCI. While the CCI is within its rights to demand all sorts of documents in order to issue a decision on a proposed combination, if they do not establish the reasons why the absence hurts the market and consumer welfare, the regulator has no basis for passing any order.
Under the Competition Act, the CCI’s rationale for examining any case is only supposed to be anti-competitive behavior. It is not a court of law, and therefore is not able to examine evidence from any other point of view. This is the basis, as one understands, even for its power to impose penalties for furnishing false or incomplete information on a transaction, under Sections 44 and 45 of the Competition Act, as in this case.
An examination of how “strategic” Amazon’s interest in FRL is should therefore be linked specifically to the use of penalties to impact the market. For instance, when the capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“Sebi”) examines any charge of insider trading (the highest offence under its purview) or that of misguiding investors, it does so with reference to the integrity of the market. The government has, for instance, denied Sebi the power to tap phones5 and other similar activities, leaving those up to the tax authorities and other prosecuting agencies. Penalties are therefore monetary, while issues of fraud and other related problems are dealt with by the courts.
The Sebi order in the Sahara case is a fine example in this respect:
“The Board as a regulator has been assigned a statutory duty to protect the integrity of the securities market and the interests of investors in securities, apart from promoting the development of and regulating the market by such measures as it may deem fit.  It is in the discharge of this statutory obligation that the Board has framed the Regulations, with a view to keeping the marketplace safe for investors to invest by keeping undesirable elements out.”6
Nowhere in the CCI order does it mention what material damage to the market was being investigated in this case. The Commission has not gone into whether the submission of additional documents was necessary to understand the supposed market power that shall be garnered by either Amazon or FCPL.
Instead, it argues, as follows:
“Through these transactions, Amazon Group wanted to secure its ability to become the single largest shareholder of FRL when foreign direct investment opens up in the retail sector; preclude/ block competitive interest in FRL, and utilize FRL’s pan-Indian store infrastructure to bolster their ultra-fast delivery program, exclusively carry private-label portfolio in grocery and value fashion; and drive fees for Amazon.”
All of the above are objectives that a company can legitimately have. More significantly, these do not denote any anti-competitive behavior. What, then, is the misdemeanor being pursued by the CCI in the order delivered on December 17, 2021?
In determining its approval of the investment by Amazon into FCPL, the CCI was supposed to stitch all the information Amazon offered, considering whether said information or facts were a) materially different from what it had offered earlier, and b) whether they would have hurt the market adversely. Incidentally, para. 12 of the CCI order did recognize the overlap of Amazon’s business with FRL7.  In other words, the question was whether the combination had the potential to affect the operation of a fair market.
To provide further context, the acquisition of FCPL by Amazon in 2019, and by the RIL subsidiary of FRL in 2020 were both cleared by CCI. While the two acquirers had offered different reasons for their respective transactions, the CCI, surprisingly made no mention of the first one in its second order. In para. 42 of the second order, CCI had recognized the presence of Amazon in the B2B marketplace in India, among others, as a competition constraint. Yet it had found no reason to contextualize the second order.
Incidentally, in the case of RIL subsidiary RRVL’s takeover of FRL, while the RIL entities had clearly stated the market where the combined entity would operate as being the one for business-to-business sales in India (the same market where Amazon got its license to operate). However, CCI’s order was regarding the B2C segments. In paragraphs 25, 29, 31, and 33 of the order, the regulator notes8 that the parties have averred “that the relevant product market may be considered as the market for the overall retail market and alternatively as the markets for retail of (i) F&G; (ii) AFA; and (iii) GM…The retail market in India comprises large brick-and-mortar stores, online retailers, mom and pop stores, kirana stores, etc. These offer the same or similar products to end consumers and compete inter-se. There is presence of retail hubs such as haats, mandis, bazaars, and cluster markets (“Local Hubs”). Largely, the stores can be said to fall under the unorganized or the organized segments. All kinds of retail products (like grocery, apparel, general merchandise, etc.) are sold through both organized and unorganized segment stores.” Comparing the size of this retail universe to the proposed merger, the Commission “decided to leave the delineation of the relevant market open as it was observed that the Proposed Combination is not likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition in any of the possible alternative relevant markets.” The assessment does look all over the place.
This brings us the need to define “consumer welfare.” The CCI has always shied away from a definition of consumer welfare. In other words, has there been any welfare loss for the economy? It has instead pursued market share as evidence of anti-competitive behavior, as it has done in the case of Google. If the charge is of suppressing “strategic interests” in FRL, that should have been served by referring the same to other government agencies like the Enforcement Directorate. The latter has already summoned both the companies for a hearing on the same.
Finally, in order to face a legal challenge for which there is essentially no precedent and very little jurisprudence to guide its work, the CCI will be handling this most sensitive analysis when the post of adviser (law) in the Commission is vacant. It has put out an advertisement to fill this position.

The EU General Court sided with EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager in her big antitrust case into Gazprom, upholding her main 2018 decision to accept commitments from the Russian energy giant and not levy a fine, reported Reuters.
Following a challenge of that decision by Polish state-owned energy company PGNiG, the judges ruled that the European Commission’s decision did not contain any of the “procedural or substantive errors claimed by the applicant.”
In the 2018 decision, the Commission imposed legally binding commitments on Gazprom to address competition concerns identified in Gazprom’s practices in Central and Eastern European gas markets.
Related: Poland’s PGNiG urges tough stance in antitrust case vs Gazprom
Polish rival PGNiG, the Polish government, and some eastern European countries criticized the settlement for being too soft on Gazprom, contrasting it with hefty EU antitrust fines for US tech giant Google.
PGNiG challenged the settlement at the Luxembourg-based General Court and also asked the court to annul the Commission’s rejection of its complaint about Gazprom’s allegedly abusive practices.
“The General Court finds that the contested decision is not vitiated by any of the procedural or substantive errors raised by the applicant,” the court stated.
Judges dismissed, however, the Commission’s decision to rebuff PGNiG’s complaint against Gazprom, stating the Commission failed to respect the company’s procedural rights.
“The judgement of the General Court means the European Commission must re-examine PGNiG’s complaint,” PGNiG’s CEO Pawel Majewski wrote on Twitter.

Microsoft’s US$70 billion bid for Activision may be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in what will become its first test to show its new approach to mergers since the joint consultation with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division (DOJ) to review the merger guidelines, reported PYMNTS.
In the US, merger reviews are conducted by the FTC or the DOJ, depending on the sectors affected by the merger. If this merger is reviewed by the FTC, it will be the first big deal that FTC Chair Lina Khan, a noted critic of Big Tech, reviews from Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, or Microsoft. 
Related: Microsoft-Activision Deal To Face Antitrust Scrutiny
Khan has already displayed a tough approach to big deals since she was appointed by President Joe Biden in June 2021. Her first case was Nvidia’s US$40 billion planned acquisition of Arm, which the FTC sued to block in December 2021. The deal may never go to trial as the parties are reportedly considering walking away given the increasing number of regulatory hurdles, including national security concerns in the UK.
The second example, from January, is Lockheed Martin’s US$4.4 billion takeover of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of Khan’s intentions to scrutinize Big Tech companies is the current litigation where the FTC is seeking to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. The FTC will face an uphill road to prove allegations of harm in the court, as the judge expressed in his opinion, “whether the FTC will be able to prove its case and prevail at summary judgment and trial is anyone’s guess.” However, if the regulator succeeds, it will be the biggest divestment since Standard Oil was ordered to break up in 1911.

725,"January 28, 2022",App Stores as Public Utilities?,"
By: Giuseppe Colangelo & Oscar Borgogno (Truth on the Market)
App stores are at the forefront of policy debates surrounding digital markets. The gatekeeping position of Apple and Google in the App Store and Google Play Store, respectively, and related concerns about the companies’ rule-setting and dual role, have been the subject of market studies launched by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), theNetherlands Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM), the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the Japan Federal Trade Commission (JFTC), and the U.S. House of Representatives.
Likewise, the terms and conditions for accessing app stores—such as in-app purchasing rules, restrictions on freedom of choice for smartphone payment apps, and near field communication (NFC) limitations—face scrutiny from courts and antitrust authorities around the world.
Finally, legislative initiatives envisage obligations explicitly addressed to app stores. Notably, the European Digital Markets Act (DMA) and some U.S. bills (e.g., the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the Open App Markets Act, both of which are scheduled to be marked up Jan. 20 by the Senate Judiciary Committee) prohibit designated platforms from, for example: discriminating among users by engaging in self-preferencing and applying unfair access conditions; preventing users from sideloading and uninstalling pre-installed apps; impeding data portability and interoperability; or imposing anti-steering provisions. Likewise, South Korea has recently prohibited app-store operators in dominant market positions from forcing payment systems upon content providers and inappropriately delaying the review of, or deleting, mobile content from app markets.
Despite their differences, these international legislative initiatives do share the same aims and concerns. By and large, they question the role of competition law in the digital economy. In the case of app stores, these regulatory interventions attempt to introduce a neutrality regime, with the aim of increasing contestability, facilitating the possibility of switching by users, tackling conflicts of interests, and addressing imbalances in the commercial relationship. Ultimately, these proposals would treat online platforms as akin to common carriers or public utilities.
All of these initiatives assume antitrust is currently falling, because competition rules apply ex post and require an extensive investigation on a case-by-case basis. But is that really the case?…

726,"January 28, 2022","Agree or Disagree, Abuses ‘By Object’ Are a Thing Unless the Case Law Changes","
By: Pablo Ibañez Colomo (Chilling Competition)
The story of competition law is, above all, a story of eternal returns. It is a story of well-established doctrines that are progressively eroded until it becomes clear they were right all along and repentant authorities return to them. A story of disdain for economic analysis that is followed by enthusiastic embrace and subsequent abandon in favour of other approaches.
Against this background, I thought it would be fitting to start the blogging year exactly where I left it at the beginning of 2021 (see here). In that post, I explained that the case law distinguishes between abuses ‘by object’ and ‘by effect’. In other words: some behaviour is deemed abusive without it being necessary for the authority or claimant to show that it has an actual or potential impact on competition.
Almost exactly a year later, in this Groundhog Day of sorts, we have gone full circle. The issue has come to the fore again and I find myself writing about it. The Google Shopping judgment is part of the reason why. In a particularly interesting (but wholly inconsequential for the outcome of the case itself), the General Court touches upon the question (see paras 435-437 of the judgment).
Advocate General Rantos’s Opinion in Servizio Elettrico also addresses the point, and goes as far as to claim, uncontroversially, that there is no such thing as a per se abuse in the EU legal order (see para 55 of the Opinion).
So, coming back to the question: are abuses ‘by object’ a thing? There should be no doubt about it, in my view. This said, it makes sense that I spend some time on legal terminology to avoid misunderstandings…CONTINUE READING…

South Korea’s antitrust agency has realigned the ICT task force team to toughen its watch over multinational and domestic platform and streaming services in line with their ever-enlarging proliferation, reported Pulse News.
The Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) Thursday announced its new digital market response team with expanded roles and responsibility. The previous ICT task force team that formed in November 2019 has imposed sanctions against Google’s market power abuse, and Naver’s shopping and video search algorithm manipulation for favoring affiliated contents and products. 
The latest realignment is to better respond to the fast-changing digital market beyond the earlier focus on correcting the abusive market dominance by large platform operators. 
For systematic and structural response, the KFTC formed the new team with five departments responsible for digital monopolization, unfair business arrangements, customer protection, digital international cooperation and market communication. 
The digital monopolization department will prevent and monitor any preferential treatment for affiliated contents or others by platform operators and practices unfair to competitors. Review of Google’s interference in Korean game developers service launch on other app stores and Kakao Mobility’s preferential treatment of its Kakao-membership taxis will soon be completed, the KFTC said.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Reforming India’s Competition Act: Considerations & Best Practices. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding India’s competition act and the implications such measures could involve.

Geeta GOURI:
Good evening, all of you. This is something I’m looking forward to, because it’s back again with all old friends, and a new friend whom I haven’t met, on a subject, we have all been so immersed with.
I’ll just take a few seconds to introduce each one of you, because you’ve all meant something special to me. Dhanendra Kumar and I were in the first commission and he was Chairman of the Competition Commission of India. A man of tremendous patience who put up with all the arguments I made, and I learned a lot.
I would also like to say hello to Pradeep, and in fact, Pradeep’s involvement in competition and market issues predates the Competition Commission and one has always been privy to his thoughts, his books, and his writings.
T.S. of course, is an old friend from NSIU and totally professional and he’s been writing a series of blogs, which are interesting, and I’m not able to get him to write for CPI, in fact, the only one of them who hasn’t.
And then we have Rahul with us, who I think is the devil’s advocate, because he always manages to get a different argument, which makes him someone interesting in a discussion and, Rahul, it is really nice to meet you and I hope we keep in touch further.
Now without much ado, let me just give a little introduction and then start asking general questions. I have sent you all a three pages note only because I’ve put down all my thoughts, and I don’t think each one is going to be covered. Let’s just let a free flow of thoughts take place on something that is important. The topic is Reforming India’s Competition Act and what is considered as best practices?
We have had a Competition Law Review Committee Report, of which Dhanendra Kumar was also a member of it. The report has been well-written and there are lots of areas which haven’t got covered, because suddenly there’s been a lot of activity. I hope that when we get into the question of digital economic networks, or should I say data networks, as compared to the usual network effects, is going to be something very different and the government will have to consider these aspects completely. I deliberately chose the topics privacy and contract, privacy or privacy, whichever way you like to pronounce it, because there are so many implications to it and they’re interrelated. There’s nothing else further to it but that they’re interrelated.
When you just stick up the privacy for one thing we had the first case that was, I think, sometime in the second commission, when it was felt it was not part of competition law. Competition law doesn’t get into privacy. There was the Harshita Chawla v WhatsApp case. And now we have taken up Suo moto case on the aspect of What’s App and privacy. Now having stated this on what’s on a privacy and what has to be done, Dhanendra Kumar, did you really think privacy should come into the competition law or do you think it is an issue that comes up much later? The reason why is my privacy different from your privacy. So how does one get this into competition law and decide?


Dhanendra KUMAR:
Thank you for your question.
Geeta, I feel that privacy and a competition law, in several places, they impinge into each other. This matter also came up before the Competition Commission in the case of Facebook, when they also referred to their study report, a competition study report in the case of telecom sector.
The data, volume of data, the big data, it is impacting the behavior of the firms in several ways, so some of the bigger firms who have control over big data, big volumes of data, mountains of data, and they are able to use their data for their advantage in various ways and at times create barriers for the entry of new players by using or abusing or misusing that data in several ways. What happens, coming to your question on privacy, that as an individual actor I have my right for protection of data, and this was in the Indian competition context, as you will recall, this was appealed in the Potosuami case also. The article 21 of the Indian constitution.
Privacy is the right of every citizen and it has been so upheld in several ways in the European context, also the GDPR that celebrated Spanish Law or Spanish judgment also. When we have our right for protection of privacy, then there could also be a situation when the individuals, and this is a matter which is under consideration in the Indian data protection law which is before the parliament. They might take a view that the citizens will have a right to ask for deletion of the personal information or private data, in which case the volumes of data, the big data, would also be impacted and therefore the behavior of the firms also. What I was meaning to say is that at the end of the day, privacy would also be in some manner intertwined with the competition law interplay and to that extent the right of the individual and the right of the firms for using it commercially and at times the right of the society generally to know about the individuals data, they would all be impinging into each other and the data protection law would have to come in to balance the claims of each one on the use of their data.
So I feel that privacy would have an interplay with the competition law, to answer your question briefly.

GOURI:
Well, what you said is very true. But to get to Vivek, the kind of privacy, the right to be forgotten needs to be understood at the way we in India look at privacy, if you’re giving everything up when it has come to your KYC in the bank, and they want to know anything about you, everyone knows everything about you. But why is it that especially in the EU situation, there has been a little bit of a controversy, which is what I’d like to ask you about because the EU commission of course has gone hammer and tongs.
There has been one judgement that favours them and another judgment, I think it’s the Dusseldorf judgment, and maybe the concept of privacy that pervades in the Western countries may not be something that the Indian Competition Act needs to worry so much about.


Vivek GHOSAL:
I agree with you, Geeta. I think privacy is kind of a flavor of what people want to look at, and I think across different cultures, different countries, the value of privacy varies a lot. If you look at privacy, I personally think that it’s more of a regulatory matter. I think it is less at the margin of a competition policy issue, I think it is much more of a regulatory matter because if you look at big data issues, big data has clear competition policy effects.
Data per itself is not a problem, but it’s a question of who has how much data and what is being used with the data- what are the data you use for. I think privacy and data need to be separated somewhat. I think privacy is more a regulatory matter. I think big data issues impinge more on competition law effects.
So, you’re right. If you look at the US, if you look at the EU, for example, or at other countries increasingly as they’re coming to grips with the mountains of data that companies possess, what do you do with them? Also, if you look at privacy, it is true that when you look at surveys of individuals and you ask them, do you care about privacy? They’ll say, “Yes, we do care about privacy,” but then there are studies, for example, by Christopher Yoo at UPenn, that show that when you look at surveys of individuals and you actually see what they do, that is, when you’re trying to do a new app, for example, or you’re trying to sign up to a new database, for example, what do you do to check the privacy items? People just blanket say, “Yes, it’s fine.” So when you look at people’s actions, it is as if they don’t care so much about privacy, but when you ask them, “Do you care about privacy?” they say yes. I think, overall, this is much more of a regulatory matter, but big data has very different competition policy and law affects.
 
GOURI:
Pradeep, I saved up this question for you. There has been this piece that has been written by Pinar Akman, who says, “When it comes to data and when it comes to privacy, it’s not really such a big issue.” There’s a lot of data, no doubt. We have a lot of big data, but from your own experience, because you have been very involved in doing surveys, and when you are looking at data, and it’s just that now we are talking data, since everything is new and data is very quick and accessible, it really doesn’t matter because data is required for every business and whoever has the data always protects it. All these surveys and trying to look at data, how does one decide whether the data is valuable or not? There’s a lot of white noise.
 

Pradeep MEHTA:
Three points, Geeta. Number one is that a huge amount of data is collected and if it is anonymized and used for commercial interest it will not breach the privacy law and that’s a very important part. Privacy is a regulatory matter, it is not a competition issue, but, and this is where I would like to add on to what my fellow panelists have spoken about, is that if collected data is used for commercial purposes, it can be a subject matter for competition law enforcement.
For instance, if such data is used to leverage one’s own product it can amount to unfair practice, breach of platform neutrality, and can also amount to abuse of dominance.
However, let me end with a caution that competition jurisprudence over there, you said, cause you will data anywhere is still in an initial stage, and we should be cautious about over-regulating and we need to have more market studies to get more clarity on digital market function and firm behaviors. Thank you, Geeta.

GOURI:
Rahul, the question I can ask you, but let me ask T.S., because he’s having a series which has come out on the blogs, and especially today’s one with Apple and the issues that have come up with Apple and Epic Games, why it is no doubt a public policy issue, and there is the need to anonymize your data, but in terms of commercial objectives, what sort of data would be really looked for? There is this entire hype that has been made about data and it’s also the fact that we try to combine it by looking at it in terms of the fact that the barriers to entry is being created, but let us face it, we are in an oligopoly situation; the big is always there, and we’re talking of competition of small players to come in, and from your paper, which I know I’m mentioning it again and again, I think you had brought up some issues that were extremely witty and you also had your little bit of twists on the Apple group. Would you like to explain further?


T.S. SOMASHEKAR:
Specifically with respect to the Apple case where it basically deals with in-app purchases and the way in which they are essentially getting the app developers to use their own mechanism for in-app purchases and end up paying a hefty fee of 30%, which is what they objected to. The question is why are companies able to do this? Of course, I’m not even coming into whether that in itself is an abuse which needs to be determined and whether data plays an important role is a different issue, but I think when you’re dealing with privacy and when you’re dealing with the commercialization of the data that comes through the exploitation of privacy, these would definitely come into the realm of the competition enforcement agencies. For the simple reason that, let’s say if a firm forces someone to part with their personal data. When I say forces someone, that force essentially comes, let’s say because of the fact that just like, as in the case of Apple, you’re locked in to the Apple garden, let’s say. So if you’re locked in without the ability to so easily switch to another platform, if you’re asked to compromise on certain data aspects, and if you’re willing to compromise in order to stick on to this particular ecosystem, well, it’s a price that you’re paying.
Now, the question is whether it’s a price that you are willing to pay in a counterfactual situation, that is if you had a choice of an alternate platform without being locked in. So nevertheless, if it’s a price that you’re willing to pay, and if it’s a price that you ordinarily wouldn’t have been willing to pay, or which you wouldn’t have necessarily have been coerced to pay, let’s say in the sense of an excessive pricing sort of a situation, well then the competition authority certainly has a look at it, right? Because it is in one sense an abuse of dominance in the sense of an exploitative abuse of dominance.
Let’s view privacy as a non-price factor, which can be utilized by firms. Now, why would firms want private data? Of course, there’s plenty of discussion on why firms would want such kinds of data. Well, let’s view it this way. If the firm wants it, then they wouldn’t want it. If there’s, I mean, the only reason why they would want it in one sense of reasoning, is because there is a commercial aspect to it.
Well, the Facebook / WhatsApp merger, they said, there’s no possibility for us to merge private data across these platforms. It took place. It didn’t take much of an effort for them, technologically, to pretty soon merge this data. How will they use it? It’s not about them using it. As of now, it’s about them being able to use it in the future, because we already know that data has an important role in the ability of firms, not just in the current market, but in the ability of firms to move into diverse markets and that’s the key when it comes to these swaps. It’s not just about current markets, and that’s the concern that’s being expressed.
So now what is discussed in the blog was the new, so-called neo-Brandeisians talking about the inability of the present competition law to tackle such firms and their so-called anti-competitive behavior, simply because of the obsession with consumer welfare, and also the obsession with price as a mechanism for measuring the abusers or measuring abuses by these tech firms. Well, that’s debatable whether that is correct or not, but anyway commercial possibility is there simply because of the different areas in which they can spread into and use it potentially in the future.
No firm, if you look at any of these tech firms, none of them are in any particular market. They’re moving into diverse markets because they understand the threat can come through market integration of different sorts of products and services. What they’re trying to emerge as some kind of an internet wholesale, or internet supermarket for providing various kinds of internet services, for which this kind of data can be applicable at any one point.
It’s not just current use, but future use.

GOURI:
This is what we’ve all been saying about data, and we tend to think of it as huge mass of information that is available and that can be used and I’ll dig it up later because maybe shifting out from what you can do with data and I was trying to understand when does a company know how much data it requires? Because the important point that is there is that even if you have a lot of data, you’ll have a lot of people there and they will try to do because they have the inputs into it and there’ll be going into building up consumer profiles.
The point that has been continuously bothering me is the consumer profile. Is it so different for every country and what is the data that is really required? It is not that I’ve wear a sari and you wear a shirt or something like that, and what is the data that they’re looking at to be able to sell, do they sell?
I’ve been looking at data markets too, and there’s not a single big five in the data markets. I mean, how would you then show your concern on the aspect of, yes, anonymize your data, fine but what is relevant? What is the relevant data that is required, and is this sort of buying on Amazon or getting onto Facebook ever really going to get you good data which is useful?


Rahul SINGH:
Right, and that’s a very interesting and at the same time a very intricate question, if I may, and that possibly also leads us to ask two different questions about this data and privacy that you have raised. Those two questions are as follows: first one is there might be a, let’s say assuming there is a need to regulate this data economy, who is best place to regulate this? Because the question that you have posed when companies, let’s say they are mining this data, how do they figure out whether it is useful or not? I am assuming that there is a need for some kind of an expertise over that, just like I suppose within the Competition Commission, presumably there is an expertise that the Competition Commission has on competition law issues, and therefore similarly, I suppose, for data, there has to be an expertise.
I’m not sure at this stage that in an Indian context, one can say that the Commission is the repository of that expertise, and possibly because of that rational, the way India has been thinking is to have a separate data protection authority and because of that data protection authority, which is being envisioned, it looks like the answer to your question is that companies do a very complex set of things to figure out at what stage to stop and when exactly to stop collecting data. Maybe if you permit me, I can amplify it through an example.
All of us, I’m sure, use WhatsApp over here. If you are on WhatsApp, I’m also on WhatsApp, regardless of whether you are texting me, I can see that you are online by the way, right? And that may be seen as in some context that it is invasion of some kind of a privacy but well, there is a superior product in the market. It’s called Signal. If you utilize Signal, this problem goes away. Absolutely, the point is the moment somebody else’s on Signal even if they are chatting with somebody else, you can’t see that the person is online, right?
Now, what is it that Signal does that WhatsApp is not doing? Now is this is not a question which I suppose the Competition Commission is best placed to answer, and it looks like therefore, somebody else who presumably will have an expertise should be looking at questions like what you have raised: how do companies collect data? When do they think they should stop collecting data? And through this WhatsApp and Signal example, I’m only raising a question about expertise, or maybe lack thereof.
Let me take a pause over there and hand it back to you. Thank you.
 
GOURI:
The analogy I come back to, because this is really the Competition Commission as to whether in the commission, I mean, we didn’t have these cases back then, they came later.
You referred to the research paper that has been done, and even there, no one has been able to say what exactly is stopping competition, because if you have the personal data protection act, which is what the European Commission has brought in the General Protection and Data Act, then in many ways you might be just stopping competition. It’s this data network effects, it’s not the same as normal network effects, which we were very comfortable with.
As a commissioner and someone who has been very familiar with the problems that come up, what sort of obligatory things can we do? How can we tell the commission “This is the time you should interfere”? How to interfere, when to interfere, when to intervene. These are problems that somehow never get resolved.
 
KUMAR:
Geeta, if you look at our competition law, and for that matter, most other competition laws around the world, these laws were designed for traditional markets, traditional economic markets. Now, the shape and structure and the nuances, they’ve changed quite a lot in the digital economy, and as a result, the price factor has also undergone some change. It is not the question of monetary price alone, which is irrelevant to the firms, it is also the value of the data, which they reckon while evaluating the price or the value of the firm.
For example, why should Facebook pay something like $19 billion for buying WhatsApp when its estimated value at that time, as people say, was about $1 billion at the most. They probably assess the value, keeping in mind the data, which they will be able to have access, and then they will be able to use that data for a number of other applications.
The point I’m trying to make that the competition tools, which had been drafted in our competition laws, in our case in 2002, in many other countries in various parts of time, they are probably not adequate to take care of this situation. The Competition Law Review Committee looked at this, and you referred to it, I was also a member, and also in the Competition Law Amendment Bill, which is pending before the parliament, many of these issues have been discussed and there’ve been matters relating to the deal size and so on, not only the value of the assets in monetary terms or turnover in terms of the enterprise, but also the deal size. We are trying to take into account what will be the behavioral propensity of the firms in M&A or in dealing with the markets and how can they distort the market by using their data.
Altogether, the point I am trying to make is that the entry of big data in the new digital economy is influencing the behavior, the propensity of the firms to intervene in the market, and in many ways, distort the market at times. So the Competition Commission, or for that matter, the other jurisdictions also, they would have to evaluate whether the basic tenets remain the same, whether it is distorting the level playing field in the market, whether it is creating the entry barriers or whether it is giving undue advantage, unfair advantage to certain firms and so on.
Those are the kind of basic tenets which have to be seen at the touchstone of the new situation. All together, I feel that this is a situation where we have to evaluate the tools that exist with us and ensure that the principles of the competition law of creating a level playing field equal, or basically it means economic democracy. To give equal opportunity to all the players and protect the interest of consumers those things are taken care of by the existing tools or by modified tools, which are under examination at the moment.
 
GOURI:
It’s something that is very important and what you have said, you have clarified exactly what is the concern of all of us and I just wanted to know, let me just ask this, because being in the law faculty and an economist there how would you possibly measure the effectiveness or the amount consideration where data is required? What is the value you give to data itself?
Dhanedra Kumar, has given us one answer, but you know this entire thing of coming up with new tools, we again would have to redefine the markets and they’re coming up with what is known as multiple HHI. So what is the additional factor that you put into HHI that would be very useful? Which is the market that we are looking at the data and as I have always been trying to look at it also is, which is something that perhaps, if you just let competition come in, or don’t even worry about competition, like Rahul was saying, there’s always someone in the background who would want to make a quicker buck than someone else and coming with the new innovation, what do you suggest?
You see it because when we look at it and you want to try and see what is to be done with it, you can get a Nash equilibrium which is a non-collusive equilibrium than trying to get into something when you have a cartel otherwise, because that’s the way business is now working. The smaller people and they’re getting into bigger things. Each one finds out what to take up.
 
SOMASHEKAR:
It’s not an easy question to answer. I think we are actually still struggling with that and it also relates to the theory of harm when you try to estimate this. But how do we measure the value of data? I think in our earlier discussion, there was a question as to whether data really matters because some type of data is extremely fungible.
Let’s say for instance, we use Google Map to travel from point A to point B and it’s very, and it tries to give us an appropriate route based on the real time scenario as to what exactly is the traffic intensity in different locations. Now the data acquired today may not be relevant for tomorrow because the scenario may be quite different. So that’s probably fungible data, but yet from that same data, it may still have access to other forms of data, which it may use. For instance, the locations traveled to, and the frequency with which one travels to different rotations. So, there is always a fungibility aspect of certain types of data and there’s always a continuity aspect to certain type of data.
Well, the question is, what exactly is the value of data? Well, in one simple sense, we can say, we do know that data can be monetized and there are different ways in which data is monetized through targeting advertisements, through targeting various other types of services.
In one sense, for companies like Google an online search and targeted ads, we know that advertisements are the predominant source of revenue and so we know that predominantly information or data is used in this particular manner. That’s one way of looking at it. But then there is a limitation to that. There’s a limitation because this data is used to expand into different markets and these are markets which they expanding into, at the same time, applying innovative technology, and there’s a benefit to be derived, but at the same time data is being used to move into different markets.
For instance, let’s say if Google were to use data related to all traffic movement from point A to point B or across the city, well, Google might perhaps also use the same tech if it’s developing its concept of self-driven car, right? The range in which it has applications is simply enormous. We cannot quantify all of that and it’s probably not possible to, because you don’t know if they’re going to succeed in that sense. As of now, the only way in which we can probably go about it is to assess what is the correlation between the revenue earned and its reliance on data. How much is the revenue dependent upon this kind of data availability.
That, perhaps, is not too complex, but at the same time having said this, we have to be careful when we talk about privacy. When we talk about data and we talk about commercialization, and when we talk about the competition commission getting into it, we should not read the commission’s requirement or any competition agency’s requirement to get into this particular issue as something which is to the exclusion of an ex ante regulation. We still would need an ex ante regulator with different perspectives. The commission’s role is simply limited to whether that act is related to an abuse of its market power or whether that act is related to reducing the degree of competition to entry in a particular market.
I think Rahul asked a very pertinent question, as to whether commission is the right agency to actually determine this. I don’t think the commission is the right agency, but at the same time, when we deal with competition related issues arising out of privacy, it shouldn’t be a problem having two different agencies tackling this. The commission tackling it from a competition perspective and a regulator tackling it from a more general perspective because privacy and data has a more general issue, including as you raise, you said the issue of small companies wanting to come up, right? So there may be larger issues that come up.
Thank you.
 
GOURI:
You know, Rahul, it’s here I want to bring you back to your controversial article the one on the MMT and the Google one, which we couldn’t get you to agree to let us publish it in CPI, because that had something very interesting and you had raised an extremely specific issue with regard to an interim order on privacy. Not only was it a question of privacy, it also had the relationship to contracts, and whether, if this is something that you would like to talk a little bit more, and then we can go into contracts, and I want to really find out from Vivek what sort of tools they use elsewhere, because this is something all of us in India want to know.
So let me just ask Rahul and then I come across to you, Vivek.
 
SINGH:
Thank you very much on this interim injunction issue.
The competition act in India has had the provision, right from the beginning. What has been interesting is the commission’s new found sort of approach towards issuing interim injunctions in certain sectors, and in that context the questions that you are raising in terms of is it a good idea to use vis-a-vis a contract, vis-a-vis data, that leads to a law and economics sort of a problem, I would say, if I may.
What is that law and economics problem? I think you had yourself mentioned in the introductory part of this panel discussion that in many contexts, the digital economy’s interface with data is that a very nascent stage. It’s very early stage. Sometimes it’s unclear as to which exact direction it will take. Like taking another example from Indian context.
I don’t know how many people know this, but India is the world leader in UPI technology. Payments. Online payments. Every Indian is paying through mobile phone. They don’t worry about credit cards and banks and everything else. It’s actually rightfully so the world leader in UPI. Now that has happened because the infrastructure was there, not because Competition Commission of India had this part to issue interim injunctions and therefore injunct somebody either through a contract or otherwise to innovate about UPI technology, and therein lies the answer to the question that you have posed; my answer would be that in certain contexts it might be a good idea when we don’t know what could be the consequences in a particular sector, a sector which is nascent. It might be a good idea to celebrate our reticence towards intervention because, as you know, in law and economics there is something called type two error, right? That’s something which Competition Commission should be aware of and to that extent, I think it may be a good idea to revisit some of these interim injunction orders which has come across, what we have come across in recent times and we look at them whether they relate to a sector which are nascent, and therefore the chances of errors might be higher.
Let me take a pause over there and hand it back to you. Thank you.
 
GOURI:
Vivek, I’d really like you to respond again. I know it’s about reforming the competition act, but the sort of indices that have been talked about and they’ve been getting some new ones also as to how very useful they will be when it may be just better to let things take over. You see, I have this very, very wrong approach maybe for a commissioner, but when there is a honey bee and there’s a honey spot, there’ll be any number of people who will get attracted to it. I just wanted your responses and I want you to know, my only understanding was that the European Commission was going very soft on the GPDR for other firms, not for their own, while we may go soft, not go soft at all. We were not even bothered about it and let the market work out.
 
GHOSAL:
I’m going to come back to a little bit of a general point and then see if we can work this in.
I think one of the biggest challenges that we face in this area of new age, big data, is the players who run these marketplaces, for example, like Amazon, which is an obvious name, what are they doing with the data, and are they creating an unfair playing field as they keep accumulating more and more data? So I don’t know what brand name Amazon sells in other countries, in the US they have Amazon Basics, for example. When you go to them Amazon site, they are putting an array of products under the Amazon Basics.
Now, if you think about this issue a little bit, anybody running a marketplace could potentially do it. So in the US or in Europe, for example, I can do store brands. If I go to a pharmacy in the US, I can see store brands. CVS is a huge pharmacy in the US. I can see name brand products, and I can also see CVS branded products for the same thing. Anybody who’s running any retail operation, any online marketplace, can actually try to do this – that is the copycat the branded products. If there’s no infringement, if there’s no copyright infringement, there is not a patent, then there is no issue. If I’m simply making a new USB stick and selling it under my name, nobody cares really. But the issue here is that when a marketplace like Amazon gets so big, right?
Suppose Rahul were to run his own marketplace, it is going to be a very small market share. He can demonstrate the same type of behavior and have Rahul’s own Basics, right? Nobody would really care because he’s such a small player in the market. But when you look at Amazon with possession of mountains of data and specific details about how the seller, a private seller in the marketplace, is selling, details of the product, who the customers are, you get all this data and then Amazon replicates that in the Basics model.
The question here is to what extent is this a problem. So if you look at some market indices like market share, how high does Amazon’s market share have to climb, or any marketplace market share have to climb, before this becomes a problem? This is something that competition authorities have to deal with. So again, if Rahul has 1% of the market, nobody would care, but if T.S. has 50% of the market and he does the same behaviors as Rahul, people will start being concerned..
I think going forward in online retail marketplaces, this is like a huge issue coming up and it’s going to be a big challenge because we don’t know what the inflection points are as to where the competition policy problems arise.
The second thing that is related is advertising revenues. Of course, the data has not been collected for the sake of it. Data, in part, has been collected to figure out where the demand function is, what kind of goods and services consumers demand, differentiated products, et cetera. It is not demand for today, we can forecast tomorrow’s demand because having this data and the ability to forecast demand, puts them at a greater advantage compared to a smaller player in the market, and of course, advertisers pay for this. Somebody who has more sophisticated data or more data can actually reap much more advertising dollars.
I think from a competition policy standpoint, these inflection points as to how much data you have, what client you has, your market share. I think HHI by itself is fine. It just needs to be redefined for the particular product we’re looking at, which is data in this case. So I think precisely what kind of behavior a marketplace a platform engages in, what kind of inflection points do we have in the market shares I think these are very critical issues for competition law enforcement.
 
GOURI:
You had come up with a very good suggestion on this, and had suggested that the government should encourage a lot of the younger platform entrees so that, you see it is true, whether we like it or not, the commerce online now has become far more important than commerce offline and a lot of the Kirana stores have also bought into Amazon and then there’s a whole set of arguments that have come about on the question of discounts and predatory pricing, we’ll take that up later when I’m doing contracts.
Pradeep, you had suggested that perhaps in some ways we’re getting protectionist. If you feel that the government should give support, give loans and encourage startups in getting onto the platform or starting their own website, do you feel that will be a good response to the issues that have been raised by Rahul and Vivek and others?
 
MEHTA:
Certainly, certainly. But Geeta, can I go to a very larger point of this whole discussion?
 
GOURI:
Sure, sure.
 
MEHTA:
To me it appears like five blind men around trying to identify the elephant. Honestly, if you had to looking at the form of the competition back then, this is not, this doesn’t require such a big discussion at the moment because we still are at a very nascent stage of the digital economy and its aspects that sort of damage to the competition.
Having said that what is also important is that I find the discussion so far have been illuminating in the sense that at least they’ve been able to inform us about a lot of other things but is that the core of this program, Geeta? If you look at the title, it was Reform of the Indian Competition Act; the law doesn’t require any reform. In order to deal with this kind of situation you’re looking at is the enforcement, and then the analytical part of the Competition Authority, which will be required to be booted up or to be, sort of strapped up, and how are you going to do that? That would be a bigger challenge in the sense that the manpower in the kind of–
 
GOURI:
You’re very right Pradeep. What we have to get back to, and to get back to the competition–
 
MEHTA:
I mean, I said this is a very nascent state, and my worry often is in many, many of these cases, we find that regulators become over-zealous and that kills innovation. One thing we should, I don’t think any of our learned academics have spoken about the innovation dimension of dealing with any kind of regulation.
What we have found through our own experience is that our regulators are not even very good about all this. A, they have a controller’s mindset. They don’t have a regulators mindset. They’re not built up that kind, it will require another generation or two that we need, and therefore, what I’m worried about is that in many of these cases we have to be very clear about our understanding what the situation is and therefore I gave the analogy of the elephant and five blind men. I find you can all talk about various collateral and very sort of flaky issues. They all sound very good. Whether you talk about the Google Map, or you talk about factors that, yes, we would like to promote more competition, by promoting more players in the market so that you don’t have this kind of monopoly control about few.
 
GOURI:
Pradeep, here I’d like to come in again. I know you do get, you are very right on some things, but both Dhanendra and I have worked together, I think we’ve been open to every issue possible, at least during our time, am I not right, sir? I think we have tried to get to every argument, and the point that I want to ask is and why I brought this privacy up is how do you bring about confidentiality obligation into the competition law?
 
MEHTA:
Really, is it competition issue, Geeta? I think most of us don’t agree that it’s the competition issue.
 
GOURI:
No, because that’s just what it is.
 
MEHTA:
It is a regulatory issue.
 
GOURI:
Well, but then it is something that the Competition Commission has been asked to look and take it up, you see? The regulatory issue, which other regulator will do it? Because all this, see we’ve got cases that are there right in front of us, which we have to now handle, which the Competition Commission has to handle. There was the one on the WhatsApp privacy policy, which is something that has taken this aspect of, well, how do you define privacy and what privacy is up to? Am I right?
 
KUMAR:
Absolutely, Geeta, but before I comment on this question, may I also make one or two brief remarks on the issues, which you just alluded to?
Basically, I wanted to add that when we talk of the competition and the benefits which would accrue to the economy as a result of the competition, it refers to both static and dynamic efficiencies and the benefits which will flow through the economy as a result of infusion of technology. The job of the competition also is to encourage innovation, to encourage infusion of new technology and bring in new applications. The firms also adapt the market; they train the consumers and they make them used to new applications, new appliances, new technologies, and that’s how the economy progresses. There are new side applications also, and stuff like this.
The job of the competition jurisdiction regulator is not only to promote competition in the market, but also to promote innovation and dynamic efficiencies. It’s a continuous process, and to that extent, the use of data when they accumulate data, big data and so on, and they use big data for bringing up new innovations and new applications cannot be underestimated also. So it is not all that undesirable. It is not all that bad, also.
The point I’m trying to make is we have to keep in mind the benefits of the new innovations and the application of data therein. That is one point I wanted to mention. Now, coming back to the point which you just now were referring to, can you just repeat that? I seem to have lost track of that. What was the point you were asking me just now?
 
GOURI:
I was asking, or Pradeep was asking? What I was trying to ask is, if there’s a question of just looking at competition law, is it possible to get a confidentiality obligation into the commission?
 
KUMAR:
Yes, that was the confidentiality part. There also, I would come back to your original question and I see that we are now reaching towards the end of our deliberation, then mention about the privacy and the related issues. The confidentiality part also comes into, because at times it has been seen that the firms are very chatty about, and very protective about the confidentiality part for a number of reasons and legitimate reasons. They would not like their competitors and others to know about various parts. To that extent it becomes a competition issue also, more than a regulatory issue because to the extent it impacts the defense of the party concerned wherein you are examining the party about contraventions and so on, and if they, what they said or their arguments and their position is also known to the competitors, it may put them at a disadvantage. To that extent only, to that extent only, I would say that it’s a competition issue.
 
GOURI:
But Somashekar, and this is what I wanted to bring in. When you had talked about the walled garden, the entry into the walled garden, because the basic thing when you have this data is that what does the competition commission look at? It’s not to the question of the number of players, but just to see if there is a barrier to entry.
I’ve looked across everything and studied all of them, and I find that as long as there’s no barrier to entry, than anyone can come into the walled garden, which is what you were saying, that Apple was not willing to share anything on its iOS within this walled garden, but Android went around and became free, and of course Android has other conditions that Google comes up with.
What is your response on the debate that Pradeep and Dhanendra had on whether privacy is a competition issue or not?
 
SOMASHEKAR:
As I pointed out earlier, defining what privacy is not really the role of the Competition Commission. I don’t think that’s within its domain. That’s the role of a regulator. The role of the Competition Commission with respect to privacy is strictly with respect to competition related issues. Is a firm in a position such as to coerce a person to give up private information and does it actually do it? And does it actually lead to people giving up such information? Can be hold up. Can be a competition issue.
Now, the question is whether we need to amend the Competition Act in order to actually take that into factor? I really don’t think so. If you look at section 19.4, there are the others aspect, which is pretty much included there. The commission pretty freely, say privacy is another aspect and we have to recognize the fact that the way in which any competition agency looks at these issues is dynamic. The position that it had as you pointed out, the position that the commission had with respect to privacy, much early on, was quite different.
That should rightly be so. It should be evolve with respect to the economy and the role that it plays, and also importantly, we will be, I think we understand quite clearly and we respect the fact that agencies across the world, the way in which they interpret acts and whether it does an abuse of dominance and whether it causes harm, also flows along with the development of economic theory of harm.
We have seen changes, shifts in both Europe, as well as in the US, with respect to what harm is, what can be defined as harm, as economic theories have developed. So there’s no principle which is struck in stone saying that this is what it is, and this is how it should be as we go on.
So therefore, yes, the commission does have a role to play, and the commission’s position will evolve, and with respect to entry barriers, to the extent that data is fungible, and to the extent that therefore other players can move into this market and capture similar type of data, there really wouldn’t be barriers to entry.
Apple’s garden is a different volume altogether, and Android is a different ecosystem altogether. Android’s, the basis, Android’s revenue is essentially through advertisement sources. Its business model is completely different. Apple’s business model is completely different. It’s driven through devices, sale of devices, and then through the sale of devices, keeping them within the ecosystem to earn service revenue, increasingly large amounts of service revenue.
Now, Apple is also known, just to get into more interesting areas, Apple has started designing its own chips, kicking out Intel. Will, one day, Apple also kick out Google? That is something Google will be looking over its shoulder, because Google derives a lot of ad revenues through Apple, right? So are Apple and Google frenemies is something which they discuss? I know as in one sense, as pointed out earlier, are we blindly groping around to understand what’s happening? Well, when we are blind, I think we need to be even more cautious. Tthe digital economy, the rate at which it expands is fantastically fast. If you look at the earlier technology and the rate at which it expands, at which it expanded, quite slow. If you look at the rate at which smartphones have expanded and the way in which people are using smartphones, incredibly fast. So simply because of the speed, we may be blind, but the blinder we are, the more cautious we need to be, and when we say cautious, going back to Bork, and he said, any competition laws should have an objective. Without an objective, we have no direction. So even though we are dark, even though we are in the dark, we should have, still grope around towards a particular direction, and what is the direction? To ensure that we continue to retain a competitive process. Not protecting competitors, but a competitive process.
 
GOURI:
In this whole process, which has happening and is one of the most important things is, are we giving it up?
I’m going to ask all my panelists on the aspect of consumer welfare; are we now going to let go of consumer welfare and moving to producer surplus? Because the moment you talk in terms of numbers and competition, then you’re more interested in terms of producer surplus and not what the consumer gains. The counter argument is the consumer is very foolish and doesn’t realize what he’s giving up just to get a little bit of satisfaction. It’s really a very, very tricky situation that prevails at present.
When a contract is drawn up, there is an argument that the contract, traders have come up with a case at the Competition Commission of India, complaining that these are unfair contracts. We are forced to give more discounts, but if you’re interested in the consumer gaining, if you give him more discounts, they’ll only be too happy about it. Does it matter? Should that be a case that should be taken up by the Competition Authority?
I’m now shifting, if you have noticed, from privacy to contracts, and I know Pradeep will say, “Geeta, let’s stay with one subject itself,” but these are sort of interrelated issues that have come up. Rahul, would you like to take it on? Or Vivek? Whoever wants to start because then I can get to Pradeep because I know he’s itching to tell me something.
 
GHOSAL:
Maybe Rahul can start and then I can go?
 
SINGH:
Sure, Vivek, thank you very much, I’ll begin.
All right, so let me actually talk about two things over here because you spoke about the traders’ case at the Competition Commission, right? I think in the earlier part of this discussion, Amazon has already cropped up. Let me speak about a different company called Shopify. Now, Shopify is a competitor to Amazon what it does is it aggregates small traders and sells products. It guarantees, unlike Amazon, it guarantees that it will not compete with them. I wonder, what is the barrier to entry for Shopify to emerge in India? Why is it that all the narrow place traders, we just go across to aims and reach the Competition Commission, but they don’t find time to set up a website like Shopify, and therein lies the conundrum for me when you talk about consumer welfare versus producer surplus.
Now, if we assume that these traders are looking for some kind of a surplus, I would think rationally speaking, they would come together and set up a company like Shopify, and to me it sounds very perplexing that they are not really able to do that considering that India has a very great reputation, in at least the tech segment and setting up websites. I’m not sure what really is the barrier to entry that they face, and therefore putting all of the queries together that you have put to us, I’ll think that the absence of a Shopify like company in India at one level is very perplexing, at another level it’s also very telling because it looks like producer surplus if we are choosing that producers have less in India, it might be a candidate because it looks like people are okay going to the commission, knocking the doors of the commission. They’re not so okay looking within. Maybe they’re looking for some kind of a paternalistic state help with sounds like a very problematic kind of a situation to be in. Let me take a pause over there and hand it to Vivek.
 
GOURI:
But, Vivek, because Pradeep has talked about how to support these platforms. I presume that was your idea right in the beginning, if I’m not mistaken. What would you say, Vivek?
 
GHOSAL:
I think I find myself kind of torn a little bit about the scale and the scope of the issues. If you go back to Amazon, you see they’ve made make huge investments in data storage, automation of equipment centers, spreading this out all over the country, all over the world. I think going back to Rahul’s point – why can’t somebody replicate? If you look at what Amazon has done, they have invested huge amounts in this business, this online business over decades now.
What has happened is, effectively, somebody could start another competitive business, but it’s going to take quite some time to reach the scale that we think is efficient. So on the point of consumer and producer surplus, I’m also torn as a consumer there’s huge benefits to shopping on Amazon, and there’s no question about it. I’ve already shopped before I saw someone else’s site. I think in some sense looking at consumer and producer welfare, of course, Amazon is getting a lot out of it, but I think consumers are also getting a lot out of it and terms of delivery mechanism.
It’s not just what they find on the website, it’s also the issue of delivery on time among other things. It’s not any one attribute, it’s a combination of attributes. It’s not like going to a grocery store and picking out the right tin of mangoes or whatever it is. I can go on Amazon, where there’s this huge array of products and services, and there’s consumer welfare attached to it because you are benefiting from sitting at home and doing all this.
I think it’s a little bit of a more complicated problem as to how to assess the relative elements of consumer and producer surplus. Since my time is going to be up shortly, I wanted to say that in terms of India competition policy, moving ahead, I think personally it is a mistake to bring in privacy issues into competition law enforcement. I think these are very distinct issues and I think privacy should go separately under some consumer protection bureau.
US has, for example, the Federal Trade Commission that has a competition policy dimension, but then it has a consumer protection dimension, which is very different. I think privacy and related issues need to be done by a regulator under consumer protection issues and not competition policy issues. For the benefit of time, I’ll have others talk.
 
MEHTA:
I mean, Vivek has said what I would have said, and that’s the sort of a very sensible part. What I said, and again, I repeat, I think I’m getting lost into the jungle of words and jargon and Apple and so on and so forth, without understanding is to what the issue is.
Now, Geeta, it is not an issue about the producer welfare versus consumer welfare, or producer surplus versus consumer benefit. As Vivek pointed out. Now, scale allows large businesses to offer lower prices. You can’t beat that. Now scale itself then becomes a barrier to entry, but it is not something which is an illegal barrier to entry which, as you see in many sectors, many industries where you require deep pockets, thereby, inheritly it is a barrier to entry because anybody with smaller pocket won’t be able to enter that sector.
What is it that you can do about it? I mean, look at the telecom sector in India. They had very tough price competition and the prices came down to be the lowest in the world. Today, of course, there are only three or four players, and yet now they have realized that this is not a sensible way to go about it and they’re all raising tariffs of 15, 20%, but I don’t think they’re going to lose business, and consumers are not going to be hard in that sense that there is any exploitation going on or abuse going on in that particular sector.
Similarly, if you look at the retail sector, which is what we’ve been talking about quite a lot, which is where data plays a very important role because it offers, as it was pointed it out earlier, that in economic forecasting, for example, data helps. Other than reaching out to a possible consumer, they can find any of us going by a toothpaste certainly will get other ads for some other toothpaste into our inbox, or wherever or WhatsApp or wherever you can think about it.
Now that, of course, is data, and I feel a conscientious consumer, you’re not going to fall prey to that advertising, let’s not forget that. If you’re not, then you will fall straight to the advertising, and somebody said earlier look at KYC, for example. KYC is totally opening up your privacy. Then every time we will keep on revising KYC all the time with the new debit payment system. Geeta, what idea is brought near to renew your KYC every year? Where is the privacy? Maybe it could be no, privacy is not a competition issue at all, and we should be very careful there could be impact to privacy, as I pointed out.
 
GOURI:
But you know the reason why, and since I have the advantage of having the last word, let me use it. Well, the simple thing is that this discussion, I’m deliberately taking up privacy and the question of contracts which we could not deal with, because these are two cases that are before the Competition Commission of India. That is the specific reason why it’s being taken up.
 
MEHTA:
I think we should have started off the contract issue. That would have been closer to this. Yeah.
 
GOURI:
Yes, that’s fair enough. That’s perfectly fair enough.
Maybe we should ask CPI to have another discussion for us on the contracts itself, because there’s a lot to be said about contracts that are taking place, but having stated these, the discussion that we’ve had so far now I think it is very, very important to understand, not only that the culture and country specific issues that are going to come up and whether we talk about consumer surplus or producer surplus what is important is we’re in a global economy, and therefore if you adopt a very nationalist attitude between buying from Reliance and buying from Amazon, it makes no difference.
It is on this note I think what happens, and this is where the contracts also become very important, the boundaries which we take in the political sense, for e-commerce, there are no boundaries. There’s absolutely a wider perspective taking place and as Vivek we have said, yes, we have to look at it in terms of the mergers that takes place and in India in mergers that are taking places, more or less are clear. This is a routine thing that is occurring but at the same time, sometimes there could be a merger of a small bright spark startup with another large company but–
 
MEHTA:
Which has been happening all over the world.
 
GOURI:
Absolutely. You’re right and that’s why I want your in for money. You are for globalization and you are there to get the benefit as a consumer.
 
MEHTA:
We need another panel one day.
 
GOURI:
Yes, thank you all so much. ",Google
729,"January 27, 2022",Ensuring International Alignment of National Competition Policy Initiatives,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Ensuring International Alignment of National Competition Policy Initiatives. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic in the context of the APAC region, and globally.

David EVANS:
Hi, this is David Evans. Welcome to the webinar today on international alignment of national competition policy initiatives.
We have really just an incredible panel, and I know everyone says that, but we truly do have an incredible panel today.
We have a Debbie Elms, executive director at the Asian Trade Center who works closely with businesses and governments in the Asia region.
We have Geeta Gouri, who is a former member of the competition authority in India and was previously heavily involved as an economist there.
We have Vivek Ghosal who is a professor of economics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the US and is actually the head of the department there, has done a lot of work on cartels and along with a number of other topics in antitrust.
We have Arun Sundararajan who is professor of entrepreneurship and technology and operations and statistics at New York University, but I think importantly for this is really a deep expert in everything involving digital, lots of interesting writings on that, including a book a few years ago, The Sharing Economy.
And then last but certainly not least, we have Christopher Yoo who is OG. This is an odd thing for a CPI panel, I think he’s the loan law professor or lawyer on the panel, but is more than equipped to outweigh, or at least equal, the economist on the panel, he’s the John H. Chestnut Professor of Law at University of Pennsylvania with lots of additional topics like computer and information science attached to that title, has done a lot of work in a number of different areas, including antitrust, but a variety of other topics related to the digital world.
With that, let me get this going. Why don’t we begin by just seeing whether there’s actually an interesting topic to talk about today and if not, we can stop and just go off and do other things. Where countries are dealing with with similar issues, are they dealing with them in similar ways? Are we seeing inconsistent results? Do we see this has having gotten better or worse, let’s say in the last decade or so?
Let me start with Vivek; what do you think?
 

Vivek GHOSAL:
Thanks, David. I think the timing issue is for me a little bit complicated, because I think the major issue of our times is dealing with technology and related areas, and particularly big data; who has it, who doesn’t. Also this business of certain companies potentially giving preferential treatment to their own services, to want their own portals compared to rivals. The timing issue of exact cases is a little bit hard for me to figure out, but I think in the technology area, US typically has had a somewhat different, much more laissez-faire, innovation first approach to give entrepreneurship a good chance.
As we take up names and cases, we are looking at, for example, cases bubbling up against Google, have been for a while in some other jurisdictions, later in the US. If you look at cases against Amazon, for example, other countries that express more serious reservations, the US is likely later than that.
I think if you look at alignment issues, are different jurisdictions treating similar issues same way in the same timeframe? I think I would point to those types of technology, big data platform cases, as having a different time dimension. So that’s my quick take and we can discuss more later on.
 
EVANS:
Yeah, so let me stop you there and turn to turn to Geeta now.
 

Geeta GOURI:
I personally think that there are certain things which are very peculiar to a country, very culturally peculiar, and this is true when you look at data network effects. I like to make the distinction between normal network effects and data network effects because there’s more complications with regard to data and how responses come to data. And therefore in a country like India, everyone has their own concepts of what they want to do.
But what has happened, and which is what somehow attention is not being drawn to, and rather when they talk about technology, they bring in new concepts, which is what I like to discuss, and we did have a little bit of this discussion earlier on the question of privacy and on the question of contracts. These were not considered as part of competition law at all. So the cases that are coming up before the commission is that. And therefore technology, when you look at it, has the positive effect. It also has the negative effect. And data networks, you have to do a lot more to understand then look at it in terms of the traditional, usual network effects and economies of scale. I’ll just stop here because I think we can build up on this much later.

EVANS:
Your point, Geeta, is that a lot of these issues like the degree of indirect network effects and views on privacy and so forth tend to be jurisdiction or country specific and that’s a reason for countries not taking the same approach and a reason for non-alignment. That’s the fundamental.

GOURI:
We seem to be quite taken in when I say the European Union approach to data, and as a country or people who are willing to give up data for everything, starting with our own identification, unique identification number at that, it then depends on what data you want to share. I can be a little insensitive, or we are more bothered about dimensions of data that do not come on the platform at all, they don’t come on an e-commerce platform. That’s when it becomes very difficult because studies have to be done to understand what is the data that is crucial for each country.

EVANS:
Debbie, what do you think? Let me stop you there. Let me stop you there, Geeta, and let me turn it over to Debbie.


Deborah ELMS:
I think this is interesting that we’ve taken a question about whether or not you have regulatory consistency and competition policy and gone straight to some of the specifics in the digital world, and particularly around data, privacy issues, platforms, networks, et cetera. I think that’s interesting. I don’t know why that is the case, but I just want to flag it as, for me, at least interesting.
I think when you ask about whether or not we have consistency, the answer is not really. We have consistency on a certain set of approaches towards competition policy, especially drawn from traditional enterprises dating back to the breaking up of the railroads and Standard Oil, and so forth. What we don’t have is a lot of consistency about how those competition rules or that competition approach should be handled in the digital age.
If we’re going to stay on digital, we have inconsistencies building up in the way that different jurisdictions or different governments manage competition in the digital space, and some of those issues are likely to get much more complicated and make life much more complicated in terms of delivering on the premise of the digital economy, I think, as we have different regulations in different markets, the compliance costs continue to rise, some of those tools may or may not be appropriate for simply sliding it over and saying this applies to the digital economy. I think there’s a lot of issues that need to be unpacked when we ask about the consistency of competition policies by jurisdiction in the digital space.

EVANS:
I was actually hoping to do digital later, but given how it’s a top of mind for everyone around the world, it’s kind of hard not to get into it right away and that appears to be what we’ve done.
Before I move on to it to another question, Christopher, Arun, do either of you want to add anything briefly to this?


Christopher YOO:
What I would say is that I think there’s actually a fair amount of alignment in a lot of areas of law. For example, cartel policy, certain different aspects of a merger policy, really what it is is about single firm conduct, and so I wouldn’t exaggerate the differences across countries to a point. I do think that we have worked out some global consensus on a number of different issues, which isn’t to say that the remaining areas that we’re still working out aren’t significant, but this isn’t a new major sector.
If you look at the top 10 companies by market cap, it’s radically transformed. And the idea that we are still struggling or experimenting with different approaches to this new emerging powerhouse of a sector shouldn’t surprise anybody. I mean, this is something we’ve seen before.

EVANS:
Given that the facts vary across country, it would be odd to have the competition policy lead to the same result independent of the facts.
But let me move on. Arun, unless you were desperate to ask something, let me move on to something else.
Isn’t it a good thing in some ways that authorities are following their own paths and that we have divergence in, in some way? Let me give you one way of thinking about this and get your reaction to it.
If we look at things over a long period of time, did the US really led the way in introducing economics into competition policy? It’s pretty much true wherever you go now, China, India, most of the world, that economics is an important aspect of that. But then the European Union, the European Commission, has really led the way in taking a more aggressive and interventionist approach then than the US has, at least in the last 10, 20 years.
Now, sitting here in the US, we’re considering legislation that’s going to make us even more European. I mean the congressional act may even be written in French for all I know, but we seem to be moving in a more European direction at least in terms of the bills that are in Congress. And then we have China, which is really lots of issues there, but leading the way on regulating big tech and FinTechs and so forth.
In some ways, isn’t that kind of divergence a good thing? Isn’t that like competition and ideas? Christopher.

YOO:
I think that a certain amount of variation is how we learn. It’s essential to doing things better. You know, I’m struck by the way you framed it, David. Imagine we were having this conversation, say in the 1970s, when economics is really emerging under the leadership as the US as you correctly point out, we could be saying, “Oh, is there a problem with variation here? Shouldn’t we have a consistent approach? We should stick with a populist approach. We’ve dominated everything that we’ve had. In that sense, we’d have consistency across the approaches.” If that were the case, we’d never have made the move. We’d never have learned what we have, and there’s a certain amount of optimal experimentation, which is really positive.
I think what people like Deborah will tell us is though, with the countries that are multinationals, facing a wide array of very inconsistent regimes makes it very difficult sometimes to engage to build out your ideas.
The other problem is we need to have a discourse of what kind of variations we’re talking about. If it’s variations within a consumer welfare standard for a good example, and we’ll talk more about that, you and I know, we have a number of economists here. If you have five economists in a room, you’ll have at least five opinions, probably more because there are different contingencies you deal with, and that’s well-renowned, and that’s considered healthy. There is a different kind of inconsistency which you disagree on the goals, the predictions of the behavior, and the like. And that can be very different.
You mentioned China specifically, they have different commitments to state-owned enterprises, a different vision of the relationship between the individual and the state. Geeta mention data. They don’t really understand the notion of privacy the way we do. There is no separate part where the individuals are distinct from the party. The party actually is dominant over everything. The role of private companies, willingness to interface in stock markets, exchange markets, you name it. There’s a very different perspective there that will be very hard to meld. On certain levels, on a more fundamental level, I do think convergence is more helpful towards coherent policy, but a degree of variation on top of that is inevitable and healthy.

EVANS:
Arun, what do you think?


Arun SUNDARARAJAN:
I agree with Christopher that there’s certainly alignment on cartel behavior policy, maybe less on what we should do with monopoly power and predatory pricing. As Debbie said, we’re still making up the rules for digital, but I think we’ll always live in a world where there’s some divergence in tech policy across countries or regions because they have different domestic tech strengths.
The US and the EU are very different on this front. There are different stages in their evolution of the economy. The US and China are very different in terms of where they are in the economic evolution and countries have different political and social philosophies. The cultural issues that Geeta mentioned earlier, China is certainly different from the US and EU.
Divergence is natural, but what I would hope is that every best of breed approach have at least three characteristics; that would be evidence and fact-based, one. That it consider the unintended consequences of regulation carefully, because poorly designed regulation can deter innovation and create inefficiencies, but could also lead to designs that harm consumers in the long run.
And third, most importantly, as an economist, I mean, I’d hope that these policies rely actively on economic analysis. I think the final point is most critical for tech regulation because our understanding of the economics of digital is still evolving. I can give you an example on that final point with platforms that have network effects and the alignment of competition policy, because one often hears a wide array of companies all characterized as network effects businesses. Sometimes people distinguish direct from indirect, or as Geeta mentioned, data network effects from other indirect network effects.
But a dimension that really has to be critical in my mind is whether the benefits of network effects to consumers and the market power that flows from these network effects is geographically local. With the ride sharing foods delivery services, you do have this locality of both benefits and power. In other cases, the user base in each region adds to consumer benefits and grows market power globally, like operating systems. In other cases like advertising and retail and travel, it’s sort of a mix. So one might argue that the more localized the benefits and power from network effects, the stronger the case for best of breed competition policy, and that alignment is more important when network effects are global.
 
EVANS:
I think that’s a great point. Indirect network effects and network effects is a very nuanced and a varied subject. Very, very fact intensive.
The one thing, going back to Christopher’s comment on the 1970s, I just want to observe that as someone who has practiced antitrust economics in a number of places, if I just take you back to around 2000. In 2000, the European Union, there basically was no economics being used in antitrust. China didn’t really have much of a well-developed antitrust law at all, and then the US, of course, was very advanced. That is 21 years ago, but on the other hand, it’s not that long ago. We have made a lot of progress in the last 20 years, at least in my view.
Is antitrust now moving towards a more expansive list of goals globally? I’m thinking about the US experience that some of you can talk about. If that’s right, is that going to create divergences simply because the goals, the different countries decide to layer onto antitrust are going to be different and then I guess the related question is if all those things are true, different goals, divergence, is it necessarily a bad thing? So Geeta.
 
GOURI:
You know, I think Arun summed it up very well. He put it very beautifully. The question that you’re asking really stems from what he said, because what happens in many of these things is the competition policy in a country like India, which was gradually moving towards accepting markets, market forces, has now got mixed up with a very strange feeling of nationalist feeling. Our own country, our own gatekeeper, our own commerce. As a result, there seems to be a lot of contradictions that are pervading, but these are our problems. It has to be sorted out. It’s a sort of a political economy question.
I think, Arun, what you said right in the beginning, even in terms of markets, it’s still not accepted. Ss a competition policy and as a competition authority, it is always secondary to government policies and government involvement. Their politics and what they would like to fly high. I think this is where the sort of contradictions that are going to come up will have to get sorted up. This was there even when in traditional arguments on trade and protection. Do we go for trade? Do we go for protection? And if protection, protection for what?
As a result, you have a lot of contradictory, non-competition policies on taxation, for instance. On direct excise duties, which can go completely against competition and allowing for a global convergence. There are inner layers and layers and layers, which makes it more fascinating to study before we can make any objective assessment.
 
EVANS:
So let me turn to Christopher, but then I want to bring Debbie in after that.
Any comments from you? Any responses to Geeta in particular? Her comment that, well, this is just our problem here in India.
 
YOO:
The pattern she’s see in India is actually global. What you’re seeing increasingly is a look for national champions and the attempt to graft on industrial policy and other dimensions to this. What really struck me when ACCC did its digital markets inquiry, they did not only a competition policy industry, but also wanted, how are we going to save domestic media industries? What you’ll find is those two goals are fundamentally in conflict with one another.
It really goes back to the old days. The whole debate over neo-Brandreisian antitrust has for a lot of us has a real Back to the Future feel to it. We had this discussion in the ’60 and the ’70s. We had this multi-variant, multi-dimensional goals of antitrust, and we rejected them for a lot of different reasons. One is you can’t optimize six things at the same time. And the problem is when you try to, it tends to throw into politics in exactly the way that Geeta is describing. And the other thing is there’s a general recognition, not just that its multi-factored tests aren’t great, but individually the different components were questionable.
“Big is bad” has been refuted in antitrust where we recognize that we’ve rejected the structure conduct and performance paradigm. Things such as Stackelberg price leadership says you can exercise market power with smaller market shares. Things like contestable markets say large market shares do not inevitably lead to that sort of conduct. Tthere’s an awareness of the economies of scale that were important back then,that are probably more important now. We’ve also seen the rise of empiricism and the ability to do things that I think have taught us a great deal.
If I were to sum this up in a nutshell, I think about the fight over the Time Warner merger. One of the areas where many people who advocate this multi-variant approach was vertical integration. Well, there were a lot of people who opposed it. The most telling evidence is AT&T spit out Time Warner not four years later. Obviously, it didn’t yield the kind of economic impacts that the critics feared or that AT&T hoped for. So what I find is that when you look at these different things to step back from them, you will realize that we actually have a lot more learning and a lot more fundamentals.
I think the biggest takeaway is we can’t expect one area of law to do all things to all people. People who want to do income redistribution or industrial policy, we have tools to do that. But to build that into antitrust law is essentially to put that on the back of consumers in a non-transparent, non-democratic way that has not been good for individuals that these are supposed to protect. But also, not good for fundamental values such as economic growth and the different things that really drive society forward and become essential for prosperity.
 
EVANS:
Yeah, on the economic front, I hear what you’re saying. It’s also the case that there is an entry by economists from outside of industrial organization into antitrust, and that’s leading to different points of view being injected, which is a topic definitely for another webinar, and probably not this one.
But Debbie?
 
ELMS:
I would love to have Arun’s three points resonate more with policymakers, especially in and around Asia, because I think it would help crystallize for them some of their slightly muddled thinking. In particular, because they are trying to use competition policy to get, I think as Christopher just said, different objectives. In particular, they’re looking at competition policy as a mechanism to get national champions. Sort of inverting it on its head, but also pulling in pieces of information and particularly pieces of either law or ways of operating or principles from elsewhere and then sort of sticking it into an environment that may or may not be suitable for that outcome.
The net result of that, at least from what I see in Asia, is a bit, frankly, a mess. You have countries that are trying to use different policies, using them badly, or maybe they’re using policies to weigh the outcome they want, but the approach is very muddled.
This leads to the challenge that I see particularly around digital and especially competition in digital, which for me is where this gets really challenging is just the lack of understanding and then sort of trying to pull whatever you can to reinforce an argument that is poorly articulated, often poorly articulated. So, no surprise, you end up with, frankly, a muddled mess. It’s not just big multi-nationals that pay the price for that, it’s also consumers, of course, but it’s also small businesses because small businesses can’t possibly compete when they have such inconsistent rules in different markets that are sort of right next door. I think all of that is creating real challenges and they need to clarify, I don’t know if it’s go back to basic principles, but at least have a better discussion I think is important.
 
EVANS:
We’ve grounded a lot of the conversations so far in the digital world. Everyone has despite any effort to reign in the discussion on digital, we’ve all really been talking about digital.
But if I could just ask this: if we look at other aspects of antitrust and maybe, Vivek, you might want to respond to this or others could chime in. If we look at other aspects of antitrust competition policy, from the standpoint of a multinational, we have merger policy, we also have monopolization and abusive dominance, rules on predatory pricing, retail price maintenance, and a variety of things, the view towards vertical integration, and so forth. Are we confident that the variety of views and approaches that we’ve seen in digital is really fundamentally different than those other areas or is this just more of the same kind of divergence?
 
GHOSAL:
I think it is the same kind of divergence. I think part of what policymakers and others are grappling with is how to define markets in this new era. Because, if you look at these data issues, what’s occurring is that defining the market here: How much data is there? Does it last for one day? Does it have a longer lifespan? Is the data collected from consumers and businesses then more durable? Then the question is how are the companies who are the possessors of the data using it? What kind of behaviors are they demonstrating with it?
For example, Amazon Basics. If you look at retail sector, if you look at pharmacies, they always have store brands and it’s increasing. So every retailer that I see is doing exactly the same thing. But then Amazon, because of its dominant position in the market, is doing this and this is viewed as a problem.
It goes back to really Alcoa, right? If you look at Alcoa and Robert Bork’s critique of Alcoa, the same behavior that Alcoa was demonstrating gets treated differently. Somebody had 1% of the market versus somebody that’s 40% of market. So what you’re really seeing are, I think the issue, if you look at Alcoa’s dominant position and the case against it, it’s not particularly different philosophically than what is going on with Amazon. I think the theories are seriously grappling with how to define markets in the presence of these kind of complex data.
If you look at something completely different, which is cartels, you see a lot of convergence. Cartels are bad, we need to prosecute them. But going back to your earlier point a little bit, if you look at the US and EU, they kind of flipped. The US had pretty strict rules on cartel. They prosecuted lots of cartels. But then EU changed rules and they made the fines more draconian. That is, if you’re a repeat offender, for example, the fines just went up exponentially. The US piggybacked a little bit on that. You see areas where there’s some convergence, but other areas where there is, I think, serious questions about how to deal with this new data-driven market.
 
EVANS:
Arun, let me ask you this from the standpoint of, I’m sure you’ve worked with a number of businesses in this space, so multinationals for a long time have had to deal with the fact that antitrust rules on distribution agreements and other vertical practices really vary quite a bit across jurisdiction, as do other other rules, and they’ve had to deal with that. There are different rules in different places and you have to comply with them and adjust your business. Is this more, or less, or the same problem for the, let me not call them big tech, the large tech companies?
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
Well, you know, I think that the issues of alignment that come up when you’re looking at tech companies have certain similarities, as has been pointed out. There’s a lot of common ground in some areas like price fixing and cartel behavior, but predatory pricing and monopoly power alignment might be different, might be more difficult, because of different philosophies on what constitutes a dominant market position and what behavior is unacceptable.
 
EVANS:
But let me just zero in on the following issue, from the standpoint of a large tech company, is it more or less of a problem that I may face different approaches in different countries?
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
I think the global span of power of tech companies and the fact that they are naturally operating across a wide variety of jurisdictions can actually lead to some benefits from alignment that you may not have seen, like sort of in the pre-digital era, because as we discussed earlier, although the network effects may be localized, the span of operations of a big tech company is naturally larger. Every tech company, I mean if you put aside the Chinese tech companies, pretty much all of the other large tech companies are global tech companies, and as a consequence, the fact that they may be different, on the one hand, the fact that there may be different competition policies in different jurisdictions can be good for the countries because of the different stage of evolution that the economy might be in. But on the other hand, it can be a challenge for the big tech companies.
 
YOO:
David, if I can.
 
EVANS:
Absolutely.
 
YOO:
I actually think digital is more multinational, but has greater ability to customize its outputs for individual countries, to build directly to your question.
I remember back, I think it was in the ’70s, Ford tried to make what they call the world car. To economize on production, they’re going to make one model. It turned out that Europeans wanted a different feel in terms of braking, in terms of shifting gears, and the like, and it just didn’t work. They’re actually doing it now, because what they’ve done is they’ve created software that allows you, with programming, you make one car, you change the way it shifts and the way of brakes electronically.
Digital does that on steroids. When you see, particularly in areas that aren’t in competition law, like content moderation, where you have very different country rules, we have nation specific interventions that tend to be rather effective. Does it raise costs? Yes. Does that have impact on, say, SM, small and medium-sized enterprises? We’re learning from CCPA and GDPR, the privacy regulations, yes. But I do think there is some great ability to customize.
I wanted to mention also something about, Vivek, when you’re asking, is this new or is this old? Vivek mentioned private label. Before I went to law school, I went to business school and was working in Procter & Gamble where private label was A: a branded company’s nemesis and B: consumer’s best friend. I mean, it’s really quite interesting how effective they are.
The other literature we’ve lost is on advertising. Aside from Amazon, there’s a whole broadcast advertising literature, which we’ve lost, so this is very familiar. I wrote an article for CPI talking about this a little in a book chapter a while ago. But what is different is the technological context, which creates nuances that are important and that we still don’t understand.
What I keep thinking about is our traditional rule between per se illegality rule of reason. They say don’t make things per se illegal unless you really have experience and you really understand the phenomenon. The irony is the proposals in the Europe and the US are going to make certain things per se illegal without that level of understanding. And what we’re going to need is to grow organizations with technological expertise and experience in cases before we know can say with confidence that interventions will help consumers.
 
EVANS:
Per se illegal in the sense that there is, in some cases, ex ante regulation which says, this is how things work and you have to do it this way. Per se in that sense, correct?
 
YOO:
That’s the way that the legislation about Europe and the US seem to be going. This is an interesting move that we’re moving from competition law, regulatory law, and from a US perspective, that’s a shift from markets to politics, effectively. And to me that carries with it considerable dangers to consumers.
 
GHOSAL:
Thank God for courts.
 
EVANS:
Well, we’ve gone for half an hour. I think it’s actually time for a commercial break. Following up, Christopher, on what you said, I just want to give a plug for something we just launched at CPI, which is the TechReg Chronicle where we’re really trying to focus on really publishing articles concerning how to regulate, how not to regulate, and so forth. One of the points that a number of us have made is that there’s a long history in the US and other places concerning regulation of other industries and the lessons from that, good and bad, I think, Christopher, have also been lost in the current debate. You don’t really see people referring to that literature, applying the principles, and the learning, at least in at least in my view, so.
 
YOO:
I agree, and we’re participating in that TechREG and we’re actually launching a series of thought papers ourselves at the University of Pennsylvania.
 
EVANS:
Yeah, that’s a great initiative as well.
Okay, so we both got in commercial messages. I’m not sure whether anyone else wants to do that at this point.
Let me move on to a different topic. This is really EU and US, so I’m going to stick with Christopher for now. We have this recent vision of this EU-US technology competition dialogue. Commissioner Vestager and FTC Chair Lina Khan are obviously talking. Is there anything really new here in terms of the interaction between the EU and the US, or are we really just talking about different people running the agencies, at least on the US side?
 
YOO:
There’s always been a healthy coordination dialogue between the two, and I think the more simpatico the different enforcement officials are, the better.
I do think a comment Vivek made offhand is actually really important. He said, “Thank God for courts,” and the reality is, courts don’t play the same role in Europe. What you see is administrative decision-making and deferential review.
There’s been a decision from the European Court of Human Rights that says combining an investigatory authority with decision-making authority violates the right to fair trial unless there’s de novo reviews by the courts. Unfortunately, there are a few in the European courts still is extremely deferential to the administrative decision. What you see there is, I think, the kinds of changes we’re talking about are likely to be implemented in Europe. Just structurally the way their law works out there, the agencies will decide, the courts will defer, that’s it. It will only happen in the US if the enforcement officials convince a court, and given the conservative nature of decision-making, Supreme Court precedent still is based, even if there was a seat change in everyone’s perspective today, lower courts remain bound by the Supreme Court decisions until they get reversed. So by definition, those impacts won’t happen here. So it will be information sharing, coordinating theories, and the like, that may be doing something important, but in terms of actual enforcement decisions, I expect US and Europe to take radically different paths, at least for the foreseeable future.
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
I do agree with Christopher on many points. I think the key questions are similar, but interpretations differ depending on mandate and structure, right? Competition versus competitors, top-down EU versus sort of bottom-up US.
But in this context, I wanted to bring in the proposed EU Digital Markets Act because I find this development of wanting to align, especially interesting in light of the DMA, because it’s placing, or it’s proposing to place many restrictions on integration and expansion on the gatekeepers, these are the matchmakers you wrote about in your book a few years ago, David, and which also takes a stab at defining markets to sort of one of Vivek’s earlier points. It’s interesting because the gatekeepers who are in the crosshairs of this new competition policy, with maybe the exception of Booking.com and Spotify, are US companies, and the question is, is it possible to get greater alignment on tech competition policy between the EU and the US with such an extensive set of restrictions on companies that are primarily from the United States and have just sort of according to that rule, a 10% market share? Because people on one side might argue that it helps smaller competition. It helps smaller competitors when one blocks platforms from integrating services across different verticals, but people on the other side could make the case that impeding integration could hurt consumer value, especially in the digital space, while not really affecting competition. And is competition policy really the lever here?
 
EVANS:
Can I ask one clarifying question? Because I just want to make sure that I’m not misunderstanding something. I thought it was the case that the Digital Market Act had a size threshold, so it’s not just a market share threshold. Isn’t there also a substantial size threshold that really kind of brings in what we now really think of as big tech, or do I have that wrong?
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
Oh no, there is. It’s a combination of two thresholds. I think it’s roughly 10% of the population of the EU and a fairly healthy, from what I recall, 6 1/2 billion dollar a year revenue, or a 65 billion market cap. I’m not sure where the six and the five came from there, but I’m sure that there’s a good logic to it.
But by its design, it is naturally including a relatively small set of companies, which are primarily US-based. So the division’s compelling, especially in light of a desire on both sides of the division of the US-EU dialogue. It’s compelling because on both sides of the Atlantic, you want to sort of reinforce the alignment message after the Trump years.
I’m personally all for greater dialogue between economists and policymakers in general, but differing mandates, differing stages of evolution, and differing domestic tech strength, and differing priorities on competition versus competitor, I think are going to limit long-term tech competition policy alignment across the Atlantic.
 
EVANS:
Vivek, did you want to add something there?
 
GHOSAL:
Yeah, very quickly. I worked at DOJ from 1998 to 2001. There was extensive dialogue. I worked on markets such as mail, Deutsche Post, international trade, for example, various things about aircraft, energy, nuclear. This is not new.
What is new here is it’s kind of in the digital world, round up the usual suspects. What has changed in DC is that the new administration came in with a significantly different posture and mandate to essentially figure out, not just national interest issues, but they’re looking at income inequality for example. Income inequality is a huge issue. Then, of course, you have to round up the usual suspects.
If you look at the big tech companies, a lot of money is being made and there’s complaints in the popular press about how they’re fleecing the workers. The way to address income inequality is fiscal policy, but antitrust has been thrown into this mix as trying to fix a problem. I think this dialogue has been going on for a long time. What has changed in DC is who’s in charge of the agencies now and almost a complete regime shift on priorities, and that’s what’s going on.
 
EVANS:
Does anyone else want to add anything to this topic? Geeta?
 
GOURI:
You know, I’m unable to understand the contradictions of the European policy on its DMA market and setting a cap to it. How have they arrived at that number? It’s something to me that is just not fitting in because you’re talking about big tech, you’re talking about companies which do group, you’re also talking about things that they’re going to be innovative, and come out with products for consumers to understand, and there they’re going to put a cap on it. It’s a total contradictory approach. It may be fine in law, but when you want to put it into practice as a market opening, I am unable to figure out how they decide what should be an appropriate concentration of data. I don’t know if I made my point clear.
 
ELMS:
I mean, typically, if you define it properly, then you only hit American companies, largely, and you ignore European companies. I mean, that’s a simple way to come up with a threshold. But I would say in general to remember that it’s not just about US companies or European companies with a little bit of let’s focus on China, but there are also other, very competitive, increasingly large tech companies that are located globally. There’s a lot of competition policy happening outside of the US and the EU that should be an area of focus as well. We can’t just focus on like what Amazon is doing, because frankly, we have Amazon in Asia, but that’s not the major competitor. So you have to think about, well what is the marketplace look like outside of the US or outside of the Europeans, or I think you end up with skewed discussions about the broader topics and you end up missing some of the, really into my view, more interesting trends in competition, in the digital space, in regulatory responses, et cetera.
 
GOURI:
I agree Deborah. I think there’s entire BRICS countries, for example. There’s a whole thing of competition policy that’s come up, which is very divergent and on which we have written a lot. So between the EU and the US, they can have their little divergence and their little fights, but it doesn’t matter.
 
YOO:
So, Geeta, I can tell you exactly how the DMA thresholds were done, which is actually, Debra, they’ve decided to make sure that at least some European country companies are included for appearances sake. Not because there’s a principle basis behind the numbers, but they need to do it because otherwise it looks like they’re just hitting US companies.
The US statute is getting a lot of criticism because Amy Klobuchar is making sure that the thresholds, which are absolute, not market share thresholds, they don’t have to show dominance, just size. Doesn’t include Target, which is a domestic company for them, and Tom Cotton, who’s sponsoring it, wants to make sure it doesn’t include Walmart. At the day of enactment, even if you grow large enough to pass the threshold, you’re not in.
This is ironic because Amazon perceives Walmart as its biggest competitor. So they’re setting those thresholds through reasons that are arbitrary and more political.
The other thing that’s really striking is a lot of impetus for antitrust reform is coming out of content moderation reform. There’s a statute in the US called Section 230. Everyone agrees it should be changed. Both parties want to change it. They can’t agree on how. They say, well, the one that we hit agree on is maybe antitrust, so if we’re going to hit the tech companies over content moderation, let’s draw the strings on them on antitrust, which is not a good way to make policy. Because if you’re interested in a lever, just hitting a company because you have another cudgel and another arena isn’t helpful.
 
EVANS:
Whoa, so hold on. Just because there seems to be just a uniformity of opinion on this, I just want to see if I could push back a little bit on the, “this is just hitting American companies.”
I mean, we have China that has adopted an aggressive approach to its national big tech companies. We have the US now, which subject to the qualifications you’ve just given are basically going after the American big tech companies, and we have Europe going after the same set of companies. I mean, is it really surprising that we have the EU and the US both targeting what are basically large, highly successful digital platforms? Is that clearly an anti-American approach?
 
GHOSAL:
No, it’s not. I mean, I think it is not, because if you look at what is at stake here, behavior is the thing. So to Geeta’s comment earlier, just to chime in a little bit, yes there are companies elsewhere, but the problem is behavior. What we are seeing is that a lot of the behaviors that are started, being demonstrated, by Google, for example, Amazon’s behavior is being replicated elsewhere. I think what we need to do is to really track these kinds of behaviors and then see whether we are getting uniformity in rules against them.
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
While it may not be explicitly sort of anti-American by design, alignment’s going to be harder and harder because digital leadership is increasingly central to global power, and techno-politics in many ways is as important as geopolitics today. I think different jurisdictions are sort of balancing what is typically the focus of antitrust policy, consumers and competition, they’re conflating in other issues like, as many of the panelists have brought up, worker considerations, income inequality, content moderation, but they’re also sort of balancing that with the EU’s place, China’s place, the US’s place on the global stage. Perhaps the US is not striking as much of a sort of global versus inward looking balance as some of the other places, because some people might argue that if the US is too heavy handed in its regulation, this could lead to it falling behind China in the race for tech leadership.
I’m sure that there are economists in China who are making a similar argument, to, potentially making a similar argument to the Chinese government the opposite way. I mean, on the other side, there are people who might argue for specific kinds of regulation, looking at just national competitiveness considerations, or thinking about sort of the path dependence of today’s outcomes on tomorrow’s economy without taking sort of the long-term global picture into account.
Whenever I look at this dialogue today, I think about a little over a hundred years ago, people studied the political economy. Taking law, government politics, and the distribution of wealth more actively into account in the sort of the economics field. It was only around 1910 or so that sort of the more focused economics field that any of us are a part of began to dominate. To me, it feels like the confluence of digital power and global leadership might take the economic analysis that’s underlying competition policy, sort of back towards taking into account these broader political economy considerations. But the quest for global leadership in digital is definitely a part of the competition policy formulation outside of the United States. I think it’s a detriment to policy alignment over the next decade.
 
EVANS:
Can I turn to Geeta and to Debbie on this topic? Because it seems to me that Geeta, from an Indian perspective, and Debbie, from a pan-Asian perspective, this whole issue of protecting national champions is actually something you guys know quite quite a bit about. So Geeta, you talked earlier about the situation in India, but isn’t India a great example of a large economy that really is actively trying to create and protect national champions and actively trying to discourage the global players?
 
GOURI:
In some ways, yes, that’s true. There’s the recent case that has come up, which the Commission is looking at in terms of Flipkart and WhatsApp and there’s also been a paper on the privacy issue of WhatsApp. But I think there are some things which the global power shifts in a very different way, because when we are talking about platform markets, our entire competition policy is based on what I call as a product market approach in the sense that they’re talking about bigness, they’re talking about size. They define the market, which Vivek mentioned, in a certain framework itself.
But I would like to extend it further and say there are two other markets that come into play. One is that of data markets, and data markets is something that it’ll be new, no doubt. It will be all on the net and it’ll go through. But that’s an advantage a country like India has. It is because data is non-driving, all that is required is that has to be anonymized. This is what the world is looking for because we have all the diversity of all illness in this country.
Who has this data? How is it to be used? We have to look at other markets and with other parts coming. The US could have technology factor, but then we have different other advantages that has to be leveraged on. And then, in an equally important area that is partly technology related is the question of standard essential maintenance.
 
EVANS:
So Geeta, I’m going to stop you there because SEPs, that’s like three more webinars, so let’s hold off on that for this one. Debbie?
 
ELMS:
Thank you. I was going to talk about a competition change in Korea that just took place. The Korean government said that platforms needed to allow additional payment companies to be listed on platforms, and that they needed to have available lower fees to the platform provider for providing all the services embedded in the platform, and so this sounds great. Everybody said, okay, that makes sense, right? We have high fees, we limited payments, at least through the platform, there were other ways to do it, but it was extra steps.
Except that there was already a Korean company, or a Korean designed company, that provided more payment options and lower fees and had been around since 2012, or I think it was 2012, several years ago, and had made almost no traction until they decided it was a competition issue. Suddenly, guess what? That company actually managed to get itself in all of these other platforms.
Again, you have to be careful in my view about this, because it’s not about competition. We had competition, you could have chosen lots of things if you were a firm and you wanted to choose a platform, there are lots of platforms in Korea, it’s about what is it that you want to be delivering in competition?
Often, at least in Asia, we find that the national champion firm or a well-connected firm, depending on the country, manages for competition reasons to end up with a policy outcome that they find much more favorable to their competition. Again, I think we have to look outside of just the US and the EU where this sort of thing may happen, but I think it is much less common for a variety of reasons, and look at how other governments are using “competition” in quotations as a mechanism for getting kind of outcomes that they want that might or may not be justified.
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
This is a great point that Debbie makes, because I think it’s sort of drawing the line between competition policy within one’s country and the use of competition policy to be more globally competitive, I think what makes this an even more complex issue is that digital platforms that may be headquartered in one country, or sort of based in one country, are increasingly having government-like roles in society in other countries. They shape information access, IP divisions, they provide ID, they back currency. We look to them to maintain social order, right? Now, I’m not saying that becoming big means that you’ve done something bad, it’s just sort of the reality of life today that platforms have government-like power, but it poses a novel challenge for competition policy and for global competition. Because our original conception of the social contract was a division of rights between the individual and the state, but now we have platforms that in the US, the EU, many parts of South America and Asia sort of set aside the state in many ways and the societal role and power.
I’ve heard the argument made that competition policy alignment across states can be a countervailing force to the global power of platforms. I think it’s a really intriguing idea and I can see some benefits from alignment across nations, but I wonder if the alignment as the countervailing force should be on competition policy or on some of the other facets of digital policy that many of the panelists have sort of brought up because it’s neither realistic nor efficient to design interventions today on any facet of digital policy without platform collaboration and sort of the adversarial stance or the state regulates the platform stance that we’re taking today doesn’t seem pragmatic because there’s a new societal imprint that has already been laid in which platforms have sort of defacto been given a broader societal role.
 
EVANS:
Christopher, would you like to comment on that?
 
YOO:
Sure, I mean, it’s fascinating. Yes, platforms are incredibly influential. I still remember when the EU tried to coordinate spectrum policy to make 4G work in a certain band. Apple designed to phone that didn’t work in that band. Apple dictated what happened, not the EU.
It’s an interesting dialogue that we see here. In many ways, it’s very familiar. I mean, if we were talking about this a hundred years ago, we’d be complaining about newspapers and the influence they have over their thought. We talked about, if you remember back in the day, supermarket chains. AMP in the early days of antitrust was the devil in terms of commerce and wiping out small merchants and all these other things. And AT&T was a monopoly for the better part of a century. It’s an interesting phenomenon.
What we see is a natural, I think, maturation where things happen. But what we’re seeing with the globalization, individual national regulators are having a hard time actually getting traction. We saw this in the old AT&T case where state-level regulators had trouble, where the federal level regulators have more equivalent scope to deal with that.
The thing that really worries me is a lot of the conversation we’ve talked about is the shift of this towards regulation, instead of away from economic and competition law principles, it’s pretty well understood that modern trade wars don’t happen through tariffs; they happen through regulation now. With where we have plausible justifications that may be really about that they have consumers at heart and security or these different other dimensions, but also have a purely protectionist aspect to them. We don’t really have that filter for separating the wheat from the chaff. In the absence of that, the shift to regulation risks really allowing greater ability for governments to promote national champions in ways that we don’t have the tools to check.
 
EVANS:
Could I turn this to something that’s actually related to this, which is a different aspect of possible protectionism? One of the things that we’ve seen from the history of regulation, not always, but we’ve seen from the history of regulation that sometime it can actually protect incumbents, and that was one of the issues with AT&T.
Is there a risk that as we move towards national and global regulation, that, again, I’ll use the term large tech firms, so we’re not just talking about a particular four or five firms, whether that could actually help preserve their positions? Is that something to be concerned about? That regulation could actually turn out to be protectionist and potentially beneficial to some of the large tech firms? And is that something competition authorities and regulators should do about that? Debbie?
 
ELMS:
I worry less, frankly, about that at the moment, given the incredible churn in the tech space. It’s relatively easy now, still, for firms to be very successful and then go completely out of business. I’m, at the moment, less fussed about that than about other issues. But perhaps, eventually you’ll entrench a tech firm that will be older than 20 years and then we’ll be able to say something about it more meaningfully.
 
EVANS:
Well, I’m thinking, Debbie, of policies like limiting the ability of… Well, okay, let’s leave it at that and let me turn it over to Vivek on that.
 
GHOSAL:
So, David, when you pose this question, the names that first came to mind were people like Stigler and Sam Peltzman and others about regulatory capture, and political economy. Of course, history is replete with industries, industry regulators, such as in telecommunications, energy, electricity, where there’s regulatory capture, and that determined a lot of what went on.
If you look at AT&T, that’s the case. Eventually AT&T got broken up by an antitrust action. I think I’d be more concerned about this if some of the behaviors went into a technology regulatory body and then that was where the capture was, but I think if it’s based on competition law enforcement and antitrust, I am less concerned about captured protection of incumbents, because as we’ve seen through history antitrust competition law and law enforcement is something that can break the regulatory capture. I think it’s potentially a problem.
 
EVANS:
Let me, again, push back on this a little bit and go back to a point that Arun made before. Arun, you were suggesting that well, really the public regulators need to be working more closely with the private regulators in effect the governance system, for these platforms in order to be really effective. If you kind of fast forward the dynamics of regulation, you then have the regulator’s public kind of working very closely with the subjects of that regulation, much as we’ve seen in banking.
I’m simply posing the question of whether as you kind of fast forward this interest in regulation, there’s at least a risk that as we go in that direction versus instead focusing competition policy, one runs the risk of maybe too much collaboration, coordination, between the regulated firm and the regulators. It’s not an unusual question to ask I don’t think.
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
Absolutely not. I think that it’s a very valid concern to have at this point, but I’m glad we’re looking at the history of regulation because you do see this pattern recurring. I’m all for the focus of competition policy being, as I mentioned earlier, evidence and fact based, avoiding unintended consequences, economic analysis, but I also think it’s critical that we approach it with pragmatism.
In an extremely fast moving digital landscape, I think it is hard to imagine regulation and the formulation of effective policy, whether it be competition policy or other dimensions of digital policy, being developed without the active involvement of platforms given the broad role that they have in society, and given that they are in fact going to be the enforcers of a lot of the regulation. Because we often focus on the platforms as the entities to be regulated without also realizing that they’re not always the protagonist. They are also sort of mediating, they are the gatekeepers for a whole host of other companies that are connecting to consumers where they may in fact have to be the entity that is doing the regulating rather than the entity that is being regulated. So it’s a risk, David, but I think pragmatically, it’s hard to imagine policy being formulated effectively without active collaboration.
 
EVANS:
I’m going to close this out by letting each of you just give final words on any topic you want so long as it’s brief. So let me start with Debbie.
 
ELMS:
I think this has been a fascinating conversation and I do wish that we have this kind of discussion more frequently in more places. Because I think there’s benefits for remembering history and thinking about these kinds of policies for the precedents for law, economics, et cetera. I think that is very valuable.
 
EVANS:
Geeta?
 
GOURI:
I think there has to be a lot more discussion, and I agree with Deborah that we share more of these policies, but I am not comfortable because competition authorities do have a tendency to intervene at wrong times and at the wrong places. There has to be a process of having stakeholder meetings. In India, we’ve not had a competition policy. We went in straight for competition law. The one of the good points, which I didn’t realize earlier, but I do go for, is the aspect of advocacy. You know, going out, meeting people, having discussions, because that becomes important because you have to get the stakeholders in and understand what is it that’s worrying and what is it that they want on the ground, and therefore, the competition law has to be very, very active and very upbeat on a lot of matters.
 
EVANS:
Vivek?
 
GHOSAL:
I think there are two issues that are complicating things a lot in terms of the regulatory and the antitrust interface. Increasingly, I think issues about national security are popping up because of where the data is stored, how they’re stored, interaction, and the other thing is privacy rules. Given that these can realistically vary across all kinds of jurisdictions and countries, I think this is a big issue facing regulators and authorities and then competition policy is left in a bind as to what to do with it.
 
EVANS:
Arun?
 
SUNDARARAJAN:
Well, I agree with Debbie that the fears of innovation being suppressed may be overblown. We’ve seen a ton of giants emerge and agree completely with Geeta on the fact that policy should precede the law. To me, the central questions of the debate that have come up seem to be in thinking about alignment. How central is digital power to global leadership? With digital platforms, second point, what is the nature of network effects? We really need to use economic analysis to unpack them before moving forward with competition policy.
And finally, given the breadth of issues that are connected to big tech, is competition policy the right lever to align? Or are there other facets of digital policy where global synchronization matters more?
 
EVANS:
Christopher.
 
YOO:
What I think, you see these companies are going through these enormous growing pains. They began literally as garage innovators, as Debra pointed out, some 10 years ago, some 20. The idea that they are now the establishment with those responsibilities is something they’ve been slow to grow into, but it’s something we’ve seen in other contexts. Unfortunately, I wish it could happen faster, but it’s part of what’s going on.
What concerns me a lot in this space is the tendency to reduce our things to slogans. For example, network effects is thrown around a lot, but the idea that network effects for a business like Amazon’s versus Google’s verus Facebook would be the same is just not likely. They must be pressing, we have to measure the size, the effects, the alternative institutional forms.
We hear things like GAFA lumping companies with radically different business models into a group, or big tech or these other things. That’s an excuse to skip analysis, a detailed analysis of the type Arun talks about.
The last thing I’ll emphasize, David, is the theme that you’ve raised about regulation, which we’re both talking about. There is a wonderful set of studies from the FTC in the 1980s about how incumbents used regulation to protect themselves, and using things like environmental regulation or other mantles to wrap themselves up in it, and we’re seeing that in privacy right now. The problem is, is that that’s a real issue.
I agree with Arun, having industry involved in these discussions is inevitable. At the same time, we’ve tried this through things such as content- negotiated rulemaking and public-private partnerships, which have tended to be struggling with what starts in the way that the privates run the publics and it’s not really been the kind of balance we’re looking for. So figuring out exactly the nature of that engagement and from a US perspective also, making sure the cure isn’t worse than the disease, particularly in speech markets, because the one danger we have is substituting government editors for private editors. The perception here is there are certain circumstances where the risks are just too great and they outweigh the other direction.
 
EVANS:
Okay. This has been really just a fascinating discussion. We could probably go on for another hour, but no one would listening to us for that long. I really appreciate all the really insightful comments that all of you have made. I agree that we need to do more of these. There needs to be more discussion recognizing, of course, that there’s a little bit of a race towards coming up with good approaches before others take it out of the hands of a discussion and actually implement things that might be suboptimal. We should have more discussion, but it would be great to get them more consensus around the solutions for some of these issues, so thanks to you all. ",Google

The Digital Markets Act proposal released by the European Commission on December 15, 2020 will likely become a landmark in the regulation of digital markets. Thus far, the public debate has mainly focused on two unique particularities of the DMA: the novelty of its structure and operation on the one hand, and the complementary role that it will play regarding other regulatory tools on the other. But are there any other characteristics that render the DMA a distinctive, novel type of instrument? This article elaborates on this question and provides a deep dive into the DMA and, in particular, it explores three elements: (i) the DMA’s ambitious design vis-à-vis other regulatory tools, (ii) the way in which the DMA tackles structural issues typically found in digital markets, and (iii) the DMA’s ability to regulate these markets by going beyond precedents.

I. INTRODUCTION
The release on December 15, 2020 of the European Commission’s proposal for a Digital Markets Act (“DMA”),2 forming the “Digital Services package” together with its sister the proposal for a Digital Services Act (“DSA”), has caused a great stir in the competition and regulatory community. Containing a targeted, clearly defined, and circumscribed list of prohibitions and obligations addressed to online platforms that hold gatekeeping positions, the DMA will constitute an ex ante landmark. Its objective is to tackle practices that are unfair and that undermine t...

731,"January 26, 2022",The Birth of Platform Neo-Regulation in the UK,"
Brexit – the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union – has been a spur to new regulatory developments. In recent months, the British approach to dealing with big tech has become increasingly clear and the country is entering a neo-regulatory phase. This is strongly focused on regulating “online harms” and developing a pro-competition approach that engenders innovation. An Online Safety Bill is due to be imminently tabled in Parliament, following recent scrutiny of a Draft Bill by a Joint Committee of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. On the regulatory front, the need to address the wide-ranging challenges of digital dominance has provoked the creation of the Digital Regulators Cooperation Forum – a novel coalition of regulators that aims to share know-how across diverse fields as it grapples with platform regulation.

732,"January 26, 2022","Regulating Digital Platforms: Business Models, Technology Architectures, and Governance Rules","
In recent years, digital platforms like Facebook, Apple iOS and the Amazon Marketplace have grown so big that they have attracted a lot of scrutiny by regulators in regards to their market power. The recent European Digital Markets Act focuses exactly on the market power of these digital platforms by defining a set of criteria for qualifying such platforms as so-called “gatekeepers.” For some analysts and commentators such gatekeeping is reminiscent of the gatekeeping exercised by more traditional utility infrastructures and that, we should, therefore apply similar policies to regulate digital platforms. In this short article, I will discuss where earlier regulation applies to, but also where it becomes highly problematic for, digital platforms. I will conclude with some recommendations going forward.

I. INTRODUCTION
Platforms are based on open innovation and the realization that no internal R&D can ever match innovation that happens outside a firm’s boundaries. Physical product platforms such as airplanes, cars and computer hardware have been around for many decades, enabling different complementors and their supply chains to contribute components and collectively develop stronger value propositions across broader ecosystems. By developing products on a platform (e.g. the Windows-Intel platform), complementors benefit from innovation spillovers, economies of scale and scope while also mitigating some of the risks of innovating...

In this article, we bring the discussion of potential interconnection regulation for digital platforms. By reviewing the lessons from the U.S. telecommunication industry and the distinctive features of digital platforms, the article explores the new challenges of interconnection regulation for digital platforms. With varying degrees of network effects across platform types and market segments and different levels of interconnection preferred by platforms and consumers, a single threshold of regulatory intervention may not serve the purpose of improving consumer welfare and economic efficiency. Given the more innovative business nature and dynamic competition faced by digital platforms, the costs on innovation incentives and consumers’ long-term well-being should be given full consideration when deciding whether and how to establish an interconnection regulation regime for digital platforms.

734,"January 26, 2022",Platform Regulation: Taking Stock of Lessons from the Media Sector,"
Over the past few years, online platforms have almost monopolized discussions in legal and policy circles. Various initiatives have recently culminated in legislative proposals. This contribution examines those proposals against the backdrop of rules regulating the media sector, which has characteristics similar to those of the platform economy. The paper discusses whether the proposals under consideration have taken stock of lessons learnt from the design and implementation of rules applicable to the media. It does so by focusing on the following four areas where useful analogies can be drawn between platform and media regulation: rules restricting concentration through presumptions of market power; the users’ role in controlling market power; mandated access to a valuable input; and merger control rules. Though some provisions indicate that the legislator has made the effort to avoid certain drawbacks arising from the design and enforcement of media regulation (e.g. ownership thresholds), other provisions (e.g. user-centric rules) show that our experience from the media sector is not properly reflected in those proposals.

The rapid growth in digital platforms and information technology are greatly affecting how consumers discover and purchase products, making online markets the most attractive advertising media for firms. The business model of most digital platforms where online ad is sold is that of a two-sided market, where one group has preferences regarding the number of users in the other group. This positive cross-side network effect endows dominant platforms with huge comparative advantages and this “winner takes all” tendency raises antitrust concerns. To present supplemental thoughts on how to enhance competition in digital markets, we study the recent changes involving search advertising related to the EU Commission Google Android case.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development in information technologies, digital platforms have flourished and reshaped the economies. The expansion in digital user base has been further accelerated since 2020, when we all experienced the global COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing rules and lockdown policies during this crisis pushed a large majority of users to switch from in person to online activities, such as online meetings and shopping. Therefore, the proper design of digital platforms, as well as the mechanisms through which they compete, and, also, how competition is realized within the different platforms, is crucial to avoid waste and enhance social welfare.

736,"January 25, 2022",Defining the Market & Assessing Competition Dynamics in the Digital Platform Industry,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Defining the Market & Assessing Competition Dynamics in the Digital Platform Industry. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Ki Jong LEE:
Hello, I am Professor Ki Jong Lee of Sookmyung Women’s University. My heartfelt thanks to Competition Policy International for inviting me to today’s session, which I view is rather timely and important.
Today’s topic is an in-depth analysis of market definitions and competitive dynamics in the digital platform industry. As you are all well aware, most digital platforms have a history of expanding their businesses into multiple markets. This has to do with the fact that once a digital platform secures its customer base or data in one market, it can enter another market easily by utilizing such existing customer bases or data. This is a pro-competitive aspect because it accelerates the platform’s entry to the market. Of course, there are anti-competitive sides, too. In particular, when the platforms are vertically-related, it is said that this could lead to anti-competition. And a platform, upon entering multiple markets, can provide a series of products with enhanced complementarities; in other words, a product ecosystem. This product ecosystem increases efficiency and improves consumer experience. This is also a pro-competitive aspect.
On the other hand, if a platform, while providing its product ecosystem, also plays a gatekeeper role, there could be concern regarding anti-competitive actions. Due to this duality of platforms, we must undoubtedly pursue a balanced approach. However, there is an obstacle to this endeavor. Just as I said, the actions of a platform affect not only a single market, but also multiple ones. However, the methodology to analyze such a cross-market effect has yet to be sufficiently developed. It is because the traditional methodology focuses only on the inside of a relevant market.
Therefore, personally, I have been suggesting a new methodology, which is that if one market affects another relevant market, such a market should be defined as a secondary relevant market. In that way, a court will be obliged to look into the interactions between the two markets, and the parties will be able to freely prove both pro-competitive and anti-competitive elements that exist in this secondary relevant market.
However, today, I will not go into more details about my suggestion. My suggestion is simply a stepping stone to enter today’s discussion. Today’s program has been devised to ask two questions of the best experts in their respective fields.
Firstly, what kinds of challenges has the advent of digital platforms brought to the traditional competition analysis methodology?
Secondly, how can we cope with these challenges?
In order to answer these questions, CPI has assembled a distinguished group of panelists.
Let me introduce today’s speakers. First, Professor Dae-Sik Hong of Sogang Law School. Prof. Hong is the director of the ICT Law and Economy Institute, Sogang University, with many research projects involving the digital platform industry under his belt.
Next, Prof. Sang-Seung Yi of Department of Economics, Seoul National University. Prof. Yi has published numerous papers on competition analysis in competition law. He has also offered his expert opinions in numerous classic cases concerning competition law.
Thirdly, Professor Hak-Soo Ko of Seoul National University School of Law. Prof. Ko specializes in Law and Economics, data privacy, and artificial intelligence law while providing expert advice to the Korean government and many public institutions.
Last but not least, President and CEO Bruce Gustafson of the Developers Alliance. President Gustafson has been the leading advocate for the global developer workforce and the companies that depend on them. He is also the founder of the Loquitur Group, a consulting firm.
Today’s session will be largely divided into three parts. The first part is an overview of overall issues.
First of all, I will ask each speaker to take about 5 minutes to explain what kind of challenges these digital platforms impose on the traditional competition analysis approaches. Then, the second part will be about discussing market definitions among individual issues.
And in the third part we’ll be discussing how to analyze the competitive dynamics in the digital platform industry.
Now we’ll begin the first part. As you will have time to talk about specific issues later, in this first part, please give us an overall picture of what’s going on.
On my screen, since Prof. Dae-Sik Hong is positioned farthest on the left, I’d like to ask Prof. Hong first. What kind of challenges do you think the digital platform industry poses to traditional competition analysis?


Dae-Sik HONG:
Hello, I am Prof. Dae-Sik Hong of Sogang University. Considering many panelists here are native Korean speakers and as I am not so fluent in English yet, please allow me to proceed in Korean. I ask for the other panelists’ and Mr. Gustafson’s understanding. If any meaning gets a bit lost during interpreting, I will make up for it later on. Thank you for the opportunity.
As I understand that the overview should conclude within 5 minutes, I will try to be succinct. Later on, I will be discussing specific issues with this case that was sanctioned by the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Prior to that, I would like to point out that because the KFTC holds an important position on the world map of competition law implementation and handles many important cases, the commission faces the same, common challenges that other countries’ authorities struggle with.
Since South Korea’s fair trade law has differences as well as similarities as compared to such laws of the U.S. or Europe, problem solutions cannot be identical, either. Having said that, for now, I will address how regulations are enforced concerning the abuse of market dominance. EU has already enforced its regulations against Google. I understand that even an interim judgment has been made and regulations are being enforced against very large BigTech companies in another digital economy.
The KFTC also has been enforcing its regulations in a similar manner, albeit slightly lagging behind. However, Korea’s market situation is a little different from those of the U.S. and Europe. For example, there is the Google Shopping case, the first one among all Google cases, which KFTC failed to sanction. It was because Google is not number one in South Korea’s search market when it comes to the market share, the most significant indicator. Therefore, following this logic, South Korean authority targeted Naver, the country’s leading search engine.
What these cases tell us is this; we do advocate changes in competition law analyses based on certain features of the digital economy and we are keenly aware that there are issues. Still, from the enforcement authority’s viewpoint, their tendency is to conduct regulatory enforcement in the same old, path-dependent manner instead of developing a new framework or new methods of proof.
That’s what I want to say.
Such an attitude is also detected in EU’s Google cases. Let’s take a look at the current cases that KFTC is handling. Throughout their processes and in their written resolutions, it is clear that KFTC well understands the characteristics of the digital economy and digital platforms. However, although analyzing previous markets and their characteristics is laudable, I doubt if they have become truly progressive in such areas as analysis tools, analysis results, used indices or proofs, and the degree of verification.
Consequentially, aren’t results derived in the same way as we have practiced in the other economy, i.e. the traditional one, the non-platform economy? KFTC acknowledges there are hidden obstacles against deriving such results. For example, as I will tell you later, there are difficulties in figuring out relevant markets, identifying market dominance positions, and evaluating agreements among competitors. In order to overcome such difficulties, KFTC asserts that they need to apply new methods as follows; defining markets more narrowly; or rather dismissing counter-evidence; or, for example, highly valuing the interaction or correlation between the two sides of a given platform market. However, in reality, these methods are not considered.
Also, as for evaluating agreements among competitors, results of such restriction may not be visible. In such instances, KFTC’s analyses would either state that potential results are sufficient or overemphasize yet-to-be-realized threats. All these might be inevitable choices because competition authorities find it difficult to reach a proper conclusion by inserting the existing frameworks into the platform economy. Notwithstanding, I believe that the authority, being on the forefront of regulatory enforcement, should do more research and develop their analysis tools in order to operate within a persuasive regulation framework that everyone accepts.
Yes, let me finish my first part here. Thank you.

LEE:
Thank you. It seems that Prof. Hong is quite interested in Google Android cases. He has compared the Android cases of Europe with those of South Korea, citing the differences in market positions of Android between Europe and Korea; such differences also need to be considered; though the Korea Fair Trade Commission has in-depth understanding of the digital industry, it is desirable for KFTC to develop a new methodology more proactively.
Next speaker visible on my screen is President Bruce Gustafson. President Gustafson, please answer the same question.


Bruce GUSTAFSON:
Thank you very much, Professor Lee. I’m a little outclassed by the panel here today. Three professors, it’s very intimidating. I am more horizontally integrated. My background is in engineering, business and law, as opposed to sort of vertically into the legal profession.
The Android case is very interesting. I should sort of start my remarks by saying that the Developers Alliance was an intervener in the European courts on behalf of Google in that case and one of our primary commentaries was about characterizing the market and how the European Commission had kind of, we believe, made errors in that space.
But I’m going to talk about four items today. So first off, I’m going to talk a little about digital platforms, which I think have real world analogies, but are different from ecosystems, and ecosystems is really where I think we need to focus.
Number two, those differences will impact competition analysis.
Number three, ecosystems, I think, compete as ecosystems as well as market participants in many cases. I think that’s significant.
And then number four, I think there are policy implications for competition law reform, based on what we have learned so far. My personal viewpoint, I guess, is based on my participation in the industry, alongside those of my members. We have been involved in litigation and I certainly talk to policy makers all the time on how policy can evolve to anticipate the digital market, and it’s sort of different dynamics versus the real world. And so my focus has been, are the current laws adequate? How should they change? And, are some of the options being contemplated by policy makers appropriate, or are they missing some of the nuance?
So first off, platforms versus ecosystems. I think one way to look at digital platforms, facilitating transactions between multiple markets, I think there are some real world analogs that we can kind of talk to. Certainly, you can look at the Amex case and others to be able to see how those markets are characterized.
An ecosystem, rather than just connecting multiple markets, to my mind, creates a stable market by facilitating one way transactions in a market where incentives and the rents are complex and are not necessarily in balance. So markets that would not necessarily form spontaneously without some steward who is driving them. Analogs outside of the digital space would include open source projects, where there has to be sort of somebody who leads and brings the parties together. Standards organizations, where we have competing objectives, and yet they need to come together, sort of in one harmonious group.
Ecosystems then, I would submit, have some attributes that are maybe more analogous to a vertically integrated firm in that they have internal markets as well as outward facing markets. So for each element, an ecosystem owner has to sort of create a market. They have to encourage participants to come in and join, or they have to, as a vertically integrated firm, well, they would have to build those contracts somehow facilitate their action to create a complete system that produces a product for consumers. I think that stewardship role is key.
If you look at a vertically integrated company, there is no obligation for the independent elements inside to be profitable, to behave in sort of any particular manner, and I think when you sort of externalize that in an ecosystem model, it gets a little more challenging.
Android is an excellent case in point. So the role that Google plays is both as a participant in that market, but also as a steward of the overall ecosystem, to make sure that the various parties are able to benefit from the transactions that are sort of being incurred inside the market. So when we talk about competition analysis, a participant in an ecosystem, just like inside an integrated company, could operate below cost in one market and be overcompensated in some other portion of the ecosystem, such that they come out whole. I think that dynamic highly complicates the analysis of the overall marketplace, if the behavior was independent of the ecosystem, it may be seen as anti-competitive. Further, where ecosystems touch non-ecosystem markets or where the stewards compete themselves inside the ecosystem, I think we end up in a very complex space.
I’ll use app developers, who we represent, as an example. An application developer is not directly compensated, typically, for their work, or often is not. They rely on advertising as a monetization mechanism. The advertising ecosystem is part of the larger Android ecosystem. App developers do not produce phones. They don’t produce operating systems, that’s handled by other parties, but nobody buys phones without apps. So there is a web of interactions and inter-reliance that sort of makes the system work.
In the EU Android case, the Commission did a poor job, I think, of identifying those various markets and the activities in each. The context does matter, and we stepped in as representing developers to say that the impact on them, the system on them, was overlooked.
Third, ecosystems compete as ecosystems as well as markets. I think one of the characteristics of the big ecosystem players is they have a competence in bringing market participants together. They have the digital tools, they know how to manage the complexity. And so you will often see the biggest competition with a platform company or a large ecosystem company is another ecosystem company entering into their market, a lot of their competencies overlap.
And so in looking at marketplaces, I think, ecosystem as a whole, is a market or a market function.
I’ll conclude with my thoughts on sort of the policy implications of this and when I talk with policy makers, this is what I try to highlight. Reaching into an ecosystem and trying to identify market failures or characterized behavior is difficult, especially if you only look at one segment of an ecosystem, the market inside an ecosystem. I would submit that there has been more success to date in regulating the inputs and the market externalities that go along with an ecosystem. So regulating privacy or copyright or patents or content is a very effective way to shift the incentives within the ecosystem. And I think that’s sometimes the most direct way to get at behaviors or promote behaviors that are positive for the marketplace as opposed to potentially dangerous.
So, I will leave it with that. Thank you very much.
 
LEE:
Thank you.
President Gustafson also seems most interested in Android cases. According to President Gustafson, this ecosystem itself forms an autonomous order through stewardship; without such an operating system, it is impossible to do revenue-generating business amongst the system’s participants; and when such an ecosystem exists, the market itself becomes very complicated. In short, President Gustafson thinks that though there are separate product markets, there is room for an ecosystem itself to be able to function as another market. So, all these complicated dynamics should be taken into account, which is lacking at the moment. If a given ecosystem is regulated, such regulations for other areas beyond competition law would be quite effective, as he said.
Thank you for your overview, President Gustafson.
Next, I’d like to ask Prof. Ko for his own general overview. Thank you.
 

Haksoo KO:
I’ll make three brief points, perhaps with a broader perspective.
First is about data. I mean, everyone nowadays says data is important. Having access to data or having possession of data is significant and everybody talks about it, but at the same time, it’s very, very difficult to make the assessment as to how data makes an impact on competition dynamics. So it’s, in that sense, it’s a very early stage to have come up with a coherent theory about data’s impact on competition or competition dynamics. That’s the first point.
The second point is related to the data. One major role these days that people talk about data is that, data has a tremendous impact on artificial intelligence; developing a model of artificial intelligence. And if a company has much more data than others, then they can come up with a better AI model or AI algorithm. And in that sense, they are given a competitive advantage. But there, again, having data may possibly be a necessary condition, or even- it may not even be a necessary condition, and combined with data, there may well be many other factors that are required to have a competitive edge. So again, at this stage, talking about data and an AI-related competitive edge, that’s an area that’s very underdeveloped, and we are still a long way to go in terms of understanding how data and AI modeling work together.
The third point is more about platforms. A platform could serve many different functions, and one of the functions that a platform could possibly serve, would be as your gateway, Gateway meaning providing a connection between a platform and their consumers. So large platforms can possibly serve as your gateway between these two; between a service provider and consumers. So for example, there are many platforms, but just as an example in Korea, there’s a service provider named Kakao. Everybody in Korea would know this name and Kakao is basically a messenger app, so people use Kakao for sending and receiving messages. But, at the same time, as a big platform, Kakao serves as a conduit between, on the one hand, consumers or users, and on the other hand, various types of service providers. And here, the service providers include not just private business entities, but also public institutions and even government agencies. And if you live in Korea, you would get messages from government agencies through Kakao, and moreover through Kakao, consumers these days can make a financial payment or do money transfers. And this means that Kakao serves as a main gateway for some types of financial transactions. So overall, some platforms function as a gateway, as we saw through Kakao. But other platforms do not serve as a gateway. And even if some platforms serve as gateways, at this point, it’s really not clear whether they show a significant anti-competitive impact. So there are many scenarios possible in terms of market dynamics. So again, in this area of seeing a platform as a gateway, the analysis is still at an early stage, I would say.
And I’ll stop there. Thank you.

LEE:
Prof. Ko has neatly summarized three points. The first point was that we hardly know either how influential data are or how to analyze data, i.e., the influence of data.
Secondly, data have become the critical key to developing artificial intelligence.
Thirdly, there are platforms who play the role of a gateway and we need to pay attention to such a role. For example, South Korea’s Kakao plays a gateway role in our financial services; from business people and consumers to the government or public institutions, many access financial services through Kakao.
Prof. Ko adeptly pointed out these three issues.
Prof. Sang-Seung Yi, you are next. Please give us your general overview.


Sang-Seung YI:
Yes. I’m in broad agreement with the other panelists that there are many challenges in assessing the competitive effects of the digital platform industry. Market definition, assessing dominance and evaluating potential anti-competitive effects, and balancing them against pro competitive effects.
So first, on the market definition, on the consumer side, we all know that the services are often provided for free. The platform operator typically monetizes his services by selling advertisements. So, on the consumer side, assuming that you defined two separate markets, one cannot apply the common technique of defining the relevant market, that is the SSNIP test, because increasing the price by 5% or 10% has no meaning when the starting price is zero.
So the SSNDQ test, the small, but significant non-transitory decrease in quality test has been proposed as an alternative, as a conceptual framework. I agree that the SSNDQ test makes intuitive sense, but it is really difficult to operationalize the SSNDQ test because often, the data is not available.
And also as many panelists said, the platform operators, or ecosystems, provide many, many different services. And also the services evolve all the time. So it is really hard to come up with a single measure of quality.
Just for one example, think about targeted advertisements. I personally prefer to see targeted advertisement that suits my needs instead of seeing random ads, but people differ in their tastes. So some people may say that, are they surveilling me? Or are they looking at my online behavior? So people have different preferences, so it is hard to come up with a single measure of quality and also, the appeal of the SSNIP test for defining the relevant market is simplistic. You only need the price to increase 5 or 10%, and then how many consumers will switch from your service to the potential competitors. That’s the only information you need, in addition to the margin. But even if you assume that you come up with a single measure of quality, then if you reduce 5% or 10% the quality, you have to come up with the cost reduction. How much cost is reduced when you reduce quality. So it is very difficult to apply the SSNDQ test.
Second, about assessing market dominance. Because these platforms provide multiple services, which evolve continuously and often rapidly, it is difficult to identify who the competitors are and what their strengths are. I think these difficulties arose in the recent advocacy’s lawsuit against Facebook, where the trial judge dismissed, or granted Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case precisely on these grounds. That is, what are the so-called personal social service networks.
In the FTC’s original complaint, the judge pointed that out. In the amended complaint, the FTC now has identified Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe; only four, excluding all other services, which at least some aspects of the personal social network services are provided.
And also, calculating market share is difficult because, precisely for this reason, that is, think about YouTube. Now they have some features of the social networks services, like commenting and so on, following. So then how much time do people spend on YouTube, on the personal social network service? It is really difficult to come up with reliable measures.
And third, on assessing the potential competitive effects, I think there is broad agreement that potential competition and nascent competition should receive far more weight in competitive assessment of the digital platform industry. But again, it is easier said than done. That is, the FTC is currently, in 2020 and 2021, challenging Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. But the natural question is, the FTC looked at all the documents that Facebook submitted on the second request about the internal documents and so on. At that time, the agency approved them, but then it changed and now challenges the acquisitions as an anti-competitive scheme in violation of section two. But then, the FTC has currently been silent on why, what, for what reason did it change its mind. So these are some of the difficulties, and I do not have the answer yet, so I think we should discuss it more.
Thank you.

LEE:
First, Prof. Yi addressed the fact that in market definitions it is hard to apply the SSNIP test, which is based on the traditional pricing, to the digital platform markets. However, he continued that the SSNDQ test does not work well, either as an alternative. He said that, in fact, there are considerable difficulties in implementing the SSNDQ test.
Also, in evaluating market dominance, it is hard to figure out who competes against whom in the digital platform industry. For example, social media and YouTube can be in a competitive relationship, and YouTube also could play a role in social media, said Prof. Yi.
He also pointed out the importance of evaluating potential competitors in the digital platform market, mentioning the KFTC’s recent re-review of business consolidations that it had already approved in the past.
Now we have heard everybody’s overview. Though this first part is essential for today’s discussion, it seems that we went over the originally allocated time. Therefore, I am afraid that we need to spend less time on the remaining two parts.
The second part is about discussing the market definition in detail. I am very sorry but please try to spend only about 2 to 3 minutes per speaker.
Prof. Sang-Seung Yi, since you just spoke about the market definition in such detail, it would be great if you could continue on further.

YI:
Sure, given the time shortage, let me just say that there are two common approaches, one is defining two markets that are interrelated.
Secondly, is defining a single market based on the difference, whether the platform can be characterized as a transaction platform or non-transaction platform. I think this approach makes sense, but instead of spending too much time and energy on the precise boundary of the relevant market, I think we all agree that we should begin with the competitive assessment, that is, we should keep in mind the first principle that we define a market for the purpose of assessing the competitive effects of conduct at issue.
So let me stop here. We can come back to, I think, to the Google case on this issue, but later.

LEE:
Thank you.
Earlier, Prof. Dae-Sik Hong pointed out the problem of defining a market too narrowly in the market definition. Prof. Hong, please speak a little more about the market definition.

HONG:
Sure. Since the time is of essence, I will address a specific case. It is the Google Android case in South Korea. Although it is similar to the Google Android cases in EU, I shall explain it briefly for the overseas audience who are not familiar with this case.
The EU cases involve, firstly, tying of search apps, secondly, certain payments requiring pre-installation of search apps, and thirdly, the anti-fragmentation agreement.
Korea’s case was focused on that third issue, the anti-fragmentation agreement. It was because there was no visible exclusion of competition in Korea even though both the first and second cases of EU were applied to Korea. As the result, the KFTC couldn’t challenge it.
The third case had to do with Google’s imposing its anti-fragmentation condition while package-licensing its own apps pursuant to the MADA, i.e. mobile application distribution agreement. KFTC only took issue with the third case, whose issue was about how to define the market.
In reality, the ecosystem competition is between Apple’s ecosystem and Google’s own. Apple wasn’t investigated as it adopts a closed setting, with no licensing offer. Thus, KFTC said that it had only targeted the ecosystem that offers licensing. As the result, Google’s market share or influence ended up looming large. In this case, everything from the market definition to how to define a market was drawn quite narrowly, which in turn influenced the next analysis.
Another issue arose, which was that, in South Korea, not only smartphones but also other mobile devices became issues. Those devices such as mobile watches, smart watches, smart TVs, and smart speakers also need an OS in the end. Yes, those devices do form a new market.
When South Korea’s OEM manufacturers first developed such products, they utilized Android because it is an open source software. Another related issue was some apps’ claiming difficulty in manufacturing due to lack of coordination with Google. Then, KFTC launched the concept of “other smart device OS market”, saying that Google impeded innovation in such a market.
The question I have about the market definition is this excessive broadness of the “innovation market”, a concept that the KFTC came up with, while defining the mobile OS market narrowly. Other mobile devices refer to such items as watches, TVs, speakers, etc. After all, each of these devices forms a separate ecosystem, however, the KFTC bundled them together, designating the cluster as “other mobile devices”, and then introduced an OS market specific to the cluster.
This constantly fluctuating definition of a market size from narrow to wide by the KFTC seems too unprincipled in my opinion.

LEE:
Prof. Hong is understandably most focused on South Korea’s Google Android case. He’s expressed his frustration regarding the KFTC’s market definition, which changes from too narrow to too wide depending on a case.
In particular, considering Google’s ecosystem is competing against Apple’s ecosystem, he stated how lacking it was that this reality was not factored in the decision.
President Gustafson also addressed ecosystem’s market and ecosystem’s competition earlier. President Gustafson, do you have anything else to add to the competition within an ecosystem?

GUSTAFSON:
I will be very brief.
I think that at a fundamental level, companies know what markets they compete in, and they know who their competitors are. And so for a court to sort of second guess what the participants already know is always a surprise to me when the answers can be determined. But the reality is in an ecosystem, there will be more than two sides to a market. There will be more than one participant. They will overlap. And when it comes time to sort of define how markets are, whether they’re competitive or not, I think you have to look at the impact one market to another behavior in one market, how it affects another market within the ecosystem, or you’re going to get sort of a faulty answer because of the trade offs between the various components.

LEE:
Yes, thank you for your succinct remark.
In fact, President Gustafson already addressed this issue sufficiently; within this ecosystem are quite diverse players as well as multiple competitive relations. However, such diversity is yet to be reflected in competition law enforcement, as he added. Perhaps he could elaborate more later on while addressing competition analysis.
Prof. Hak-Soo Ko, we are discussing market definition. How should we solve the market definition issue in the digital industry?

KO:
Well, that’s a very challenging and difficult question, and I’ll give a couple of examples, which is beyond the competition law perspective, but more from a regulatory jurisdiction viewpoint, I would say.
The first case is the Kakao that I mentioned already. Kakao is the dominant messenger app in Korea and a few other countries. And I was told each DAU, daily active user, the number of DAU is 50 million, that is close to the whole population of the entire country of Korea.
So basically, pretty much everyone in Korea uses Kakao service on a daily basis every time, I mean every day, constantly. So in that sense, Kakao is essential if you live in Korea. And Kakao, obviously as a messenger service, people use the service as a messenger or social media in a broad sense. But as I mentioned, Kakao is being used for purposes of making payments and money transfers. So in that simplified sense, Kakao serves as a messenger app, plus serves as a financial conduit for financial transaction service.
So if you simplify that way, Kakao serves two main different functions. Well, in actuality, there are many other functions that Kakao provides, but depending on how you distinguish, or if you want to categorize Kakao’s services, at least partially, as providing financial services, you’re now subject to, you should, well, at least theoretically, be subject to a whole new set of regulations coming from the financial industry. And financial industry in itself is a very heavily regulated industry. And if you categorize it as the messenger service, then the whole different set of regulations should be in place. So depending on how you categorize your service, you’re in a totally different ball game.
The second example is sbout the my-data scheme. My-data is coming from what’s called, right to data portability. Data portability was enacted, perhaps, first in the EU, under the GDPR, and in Korea, credit information act, which governs financial data introduced the scheme of data portability, and colloquially it’s called “my data.” And my data means different financial services companies can ask their customers to request transferring customers’ data from one platform to another platform. And there are currently dozens of financial institutions that are involved in this scheme, which is still in the very early stages, but depending on how the market dynamics work out, there may well be a significant impact at least within the financial industry. And the problem of delineating the different types of players is out there. And the main difficulty is distinguishing between the traditional market institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, insurance companies, and that’s one group.
And the other group is a new commerce into the financial market. So-called FinTech companies, or BigTech companies. And the question is, is it worthwhile distinguishing between these two groups of companies? And even within FinTech and BigTech companies, is it meaningful to distinguish between these two groups? I mean, FinTech tends to specialize and they tend not to have too many different business lines. And as opposed to that, BigTech companies tend to be large and tend to provide whole different sets of diverse services, and depending on how you view the whole market dynamics, you can come up with different types of ways of delineating market players, and this is an open question and for now it’s still challenging and hard to make an assessment.

LEE:
Prof. Ko spoke about platforms’ activities beyond the market boundaries. For example, Kakao not only plays a messenger role but also offer multiple services including financial one. There is even a system where a user’s data could move from this platform to that platform.
He also asked how we could easily distinguish FinTech from BigTech or vice versa. After all they have a lot in common. Therefore, I think that Prof. Ko pointed out that the dynamics of the digital platform industry makes it harder to lump together businesses within its narrow relevant market and then analyze them.
Regarding discussing relevant markets, I think we should stop here. It is because the panelists appear more interested in competition analysis within a relevant market than such a market itself.
Well, in what order would you like to go? Earlier, I felt bad that I gave too little time time to Prof. Sang-Seung Yi. Since Prof. Yi said, “let’s focus more on competition analysis than on market definition”, I would like to offer him a little more time.
Prof. Yi, please proceed.

YI:
Well, actually I think it’s more productive to focus on an actual case as Prof. Hong mentioned, the Google case.
Let me first disclose that I was the testifying economics expert on behalf of Google before the KFTC, so I’m not a neutral observer, but let me try to update the international audience what the KFTC’s case is about, and what’s the difference between the KFTC’s and EC’s case. So as professor Hong explained, the EC challenged Google’s entire business model on Android, consisting of a web of contracts.
First, the anti-fragmentation agreements, where a smartphone maker agrees that if a smartphone maker installs Google apps, then the maker promises that it will not fragment the Android system by modifying the open source code in an incompatible way.
That is, apps that operate on the compatible devices, whether they are Google apps or non-Google apps, like Kakao, they should work smoothly on all devices.
The second is the distribution agreements where the EC characterizes as time, that is, if he installed one Google app, then you have to install all others, or the certain apps that Google designates.
Third is the revenue sharing agreement, which Google entered into smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, and also all the network operators where by exclusively pre-installing Google search on the mobile phones, then they get a cut of Google’s search revenue on those devices.
Now, the important, I think, point is that the EC’s theory of harm is that, through all these agreements, Google tried to maintain and solidify its dominance on the general search.
It happens that in 2011, Naver and Daum, Daum is the predecessor to Kakao, they filed a complaint before the KFTC challenging these agreements. That is, by pre-installing the, especially the Mada, pre-installing the Google search, Google is trying to extend its dominance from desktop to mobile. The problem was, the story that I heard was that Google lamented that the most searched word on the mobile Google search engine was “Naver.” They wanted to download Naver app because that’s what they wanted to use. And also on the desktop, the Naver share is about 80%. So in 2013, KFTC dismissed the complaint.
Now fast forward to 2021, this fact did not deter the KFTC from challenging the AFA, anti-fragmentation agreements. And what’s remarkable is that the EC only looked at smart devices, like smart phones and tablets, but the KFTC extended them into all smart devices, including smart watches, smart speakers, smart TVs, as Professor Hong mentioned, based on the innovation market theory, but it’s quite, as Professor Hong said, quite vague, so I really look forward to what the court is going to say on the KFTC’s ruling.

LEE:
Our Prof. Yi also appears most interested in the Google case. Well, as the topic is on the table, let me ask Prof. Dae-Sik Hong some more questions as Prof. Hong earlier wanted to discuss the same Google case a little more.
Please understand that I am unable to summarize what Prof. Yi said. It is because we are pressed for time. We ask you to understand our situation.
Dear panelists, please keep your speech short from now on.
Prof. Hong, please go ahead.

HONG:
As Prof. Yi shared his involvement in South Korea’s Google case, I think I should address mine as well. The omission was due to my unfamiliarity with the protocol here. In fact, neither am I an objective observer in this case as I had also submitted my expert report on behalf of Google in the Google Android case. It’s news to me that Prof. Yi provided economic analysis for the case. We appeared to have been unaware of each other’s work… until today.
As someone who was asked to provide a legal opinion on the case, I am not qualified to discuss the case’s factual grounds. That is why I said that the KFTC should make a decision based on certain legal principles and standards.
I’d like to make a few points regarding the KFTC’s decisions; first, in that specific case related to mobile OS licensing, KFTC came to its decision by applying the traditional market foreclosure theory. In the past, the foreclosure theory was typically applied when there was evidence that either a competitor had been ousted from the market or their competitiveness was greatly reduced. However, no such evidence was presented in this case. So, what KFTC brought up was other similar cases raised by the EU. However, KFTC mentioned Amazon’s Fire OS and Alibaba’s Aliyun OS as evidence of market foreclosure… yes, they are indeed Android forks, saying that neither could enter the Korean market properly due to the entry barriers set up by Google Android against its potential competitors.
Some parts in KFTC’s theory make sense, but it is doubtful if Amazon or Alibaba ever tried to enter South Korea’s digital market. After all, South Korea’s ecosystem is Android’s in addition to Apple’s. Within the Android ecosystem, Korean OEM manufacturers such as Samsung were able to pass compatibility tests by making variants based on what Google had provided. That way, Samsung Electronics was able to make their own devices and then inserted their own app market into such devices.
Also, Samsung develops their own apps. In that aspect, you can say that South Korea sees competition among those compatible Android variants. Nonetheless, KFTC excluded the fact in its ruling, saying that there are no such factors that suppress competition amongst such variants. In a way, the ruling by KFTC didn’t sufficiently reflect what people really felt. Even though KFTC only saw certain Android forks, and Mr. Gustafson is with us here, the reason that Google emphasizes compatibility is because from app developers’ point of view, a multiple-fork ecosystem is like a nightmare.
Why? You have to redesign an app to fit the new fork continuously. In that aspect, multiple compatible versions of Android OS do offer clear benefits. However, such an upside was not considered in the KFTC’s ruling, which I find somewhat problematic.
And in the other smart device OS market where KFTC had raised an issue of innovation market, its ruling turned out even more hypothetical. Even though those other smart devices such as watches, TVs, etc. have not seen their own OS markets sufficiently formed, KFTC’s approach is that Google completely blocked emergence of such markets. Therefore, Google impeded innovation, says KFTC.
Speaking of innovation in this context, let’s talk about what’s happened to Microsoft. When regular consumers largely transitioned from PC to mobile devices, MS OS could no longer assert its power in mobile markets because their PC OS’s strengths didn’t transition to mobile devices.
This is a good example of new, utterly disruptive innovation. However, the KFTC views that such disruptive innovation is unthinkable in new mobile devices such as smart watches; only Android variants are possible; blocking development of Android variants is harming innovation. These are how they approach, and I doubt how this attitude could fit in with any concept of innovation.

LEE:
Thank you. Both Prof. Yi and Prof. Hong addressed the Google Android case. I guess that President Gustafson may have something to add to the discussion.
Please be succinct.

GUSTAFSON:
Certainly, thank you.
Apparently, we were all involved in one way or another.
So our testimony in the European Android case was quite clear that, from the developer point of view, fragmented operating systems drive up costs and complicate the market for developers. Operating systems compete with each other, we’ll use Apple and Google as examples for a developer community that is capable of making third party apps. And developers will develop for the platform that is the most profitable for them. And that fragmentation is a factor in that decision. And so, certainly, there is a strong market reason why an operating system would seek to limit fragmentation because of its value in another portion of the ecosystem.
I will make a couple of comments just in response to Professor Ko and Professor Yi. So on data, data portability, data ownership, our view is a little more nuanced from my common law colleagues. We view rights and data as more of a bundle of sticks. There are joint rights by many of the people that are involved in the value chain; the person who collects the data, people who process data, the people who produce the data. And so I think there’s a much more sophisticated discussion will need to take place there before we define a legal framework that is operable.
And then finally on sort of my stewardship comment, there is a cost to an ecosystem to support a brand, and in the consumer’s mind when they are interacting with an ecosystem and all of the participants in it, it is that brand that is foremost in their mind, and so that is a service that is rendered unto the ecosystem, in addition to sort of bringing the parties together. And so what is sometimes termed as a gatekeeper role, I think is also important to protect the general brand value of all of the participants that are in the ecosystem. So we do a service when we make sure that bad actors cannot enter the system when we make sure that there’s a certain quality level. And so that role, likewise, can be a bit of a policeman role. It can be seen as negative, and certainly is painted that way by policymakers, but I think it’s necessary for the ecosystem to function, so that has to be reflected in law somewhere.

LEE:
Though today’s topics are market definition and competition analysis in digital platforms, this session’s focus is specifically on South Korea throughout the entire CPI series. Understandably that our panelists have zeroed in on the in-country Google Android case.
Prof. Ko, you are not directly involved in the Google case, are you?
Prof. Ko, I will be grateful if you have anything else to add to the Google case, or if you can suggest a new direction that competition analysis of digital platform markets should take.

KO:
Yeah, I’d like to make a short concluding remark: I was not involved in the Google case. I feel isolated here, just a joke.
Well, I don’t intend to talk about the Google case, but, and rather than saying there’s a direction for the future, I would say we are currently at a loss as to what the future directions should be. I mean, everyone knows large platforms tend to show a network effect and I mean, network effects naturally would point toward a less of competition. I mean, theoretically, that’s what the textbook says.
What’s unclear is what is really taking place in the marketplace. I mean, some of the large platforms tend to become bigger in Korea, in the US, in the EU, wherever, but that’s not a universal phenomenon in every market segment. So in some markets, some of the platforms are becoming dominant players, but in some other market segments, there’s a very fierce, very dynamic competition going on. And also, platforms, particularly in the past couple of years, some of the platforms are trying to go into the markets that have been dominated by other competitors. So in that general sense, there’s been a tremendous market pressure to go into other fields and become a meaningful competitor.
So in Korea, for instance, there’s a large bit of competition. For example, in the e-commerce market or in the messaging service market or in the food delivery market, in many different markets, there’s a lot of competitive pressure and not dominated by a single player, but several large players that are competing against each other very fiercely. So we’ll have to see what happens in these markets.

LEE:
Thank you.
Due to the network external effect of a digital platform any growth of a large platform is indeed a competition-threatening factor. However, as we can see in the South Korean market, a large number of new entries are made in various markets such as delivery apps, messaging apps, etc. competing ferociously amongst themselves, as Prof. Ko said.
Subsequently, as he observed, it would be interesting to see how these two contradicting forces would interact with each other and what kind of result would come out of it.
Naturally, with our time, we couldn’t expect to come up with a solution in competition analysis of the digital platform market. Nonetheless, I believe that through today’s discourse we were able to find some clues for a future direction.
I wish all the panelists greater accomplishments and contributions in this area in the future.
I wish we had more time, but today’s discussion has reached its end point.
Dear panelists and online viewers, have a wonderful weekend, thank you. ",Google
737,"January 25, 2022","Mobile Ecosystems: Competition, Choice and User Protection","

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Mobile Ecosystems: Competition, Choice and User Protection. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to Japan.

Takako ONOKI:
Hello, I am Takako Onoki. Today I will be moderating the CPI TV program, Mobile Ecosystems: Competition, Choice, and User Protection.
Competition in the digital economy apparently is becoming competition between ecosystems. Joining me today is a panel of practitioners and academics at the forefront of these issues. I have Tatsuya Tsunoda, attorney at Nishimura & Asahi law firm, Yusuke Zennyo, Associate Professor at Kobe University, and Leni Papa, a consultant for the OECD.
We are going to get started with some opening statements, and then we’ll have some interaction and some questions. Let me get started. So first, Yusuke, what do we know about the economics of mobile ecosystems?


Yusuke ZENNYO:
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about this issue. Let me use English first, but I will change and switch to Japanese.
There are two things I would like to talk concerning mobile ecosystems from a perspective of economics. The first one is that a monopoly is not necessarily bad, in some situations, especially when it comes to network goods. The second one is related to the existence of competition across different submarkets of mobile ecosystems.
On the first point, as you know, a very high level of market concentration has become a big issue in recent policy debates. For example, Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store have been criticized to have nearly a monopoly, gatekeeper position, in each mobile OS market. But in terms of economic welfare, a monopoly is not necessarily bad, especially in markets with network externalities.
For example, let me consider the following situation. There are multiple networks competing in a market, and they are not completely compatible with each other. In this case, users are divided into different networks. So this user segmentation makes it difficult for users to enjoy a large network size. In contrast, if a monopoly network exist in a market, all users join the same network, and they can enjoy the largest network size and the network bandwidth.
Depending on the market environment, this benefit coming from the expansion of network size will dominate the negative effect associated with an increase in price. In that case, a monopoly can generate a higher social welfare and consumer service. Of course, this is not the case if the monopolist sets a very high, very expensive price to consumers. This is my first point.
The second point is more important, I think. As you know, the current state of mobile ecosystems is very complex. There are many kinds of different submarkets. More importantly, those submarkets are closely interconnected with each other. This is an interesting feature of mobile ecosystems that cannot be found in other product markets. So, someone can consider that there is competition, not only within each market, but also competition across different submarkets. In this case, even if a monopolist exists in each submarket, we can facilitate cross-market competition between those monopolists across different markets places. So if this is possible in practice, I think we can achieve a very good competitive environment without sacrificing network effects.
This was my second point. Thank you for listening.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Yusuke.
Then how about Tatsuya? What is the state of competition law in Japan on mobile ecosystems?


Tatsuya TSUNODA:
Thank you very much, Takako-sensei. Let me introduce the situation on the perspective of the competition of Japan. As you may know, and Yusuke-sensei mentioned, in Japan, as in other countries, the fundamental layers, or indispensable layers, such as mobile devices, mobile OS, and the applications stores are subject to the oligopolistic by two players, such as Apple and Google. In this regard, recently the Japan Fair Trade Commission has been conducting a market survey on the mobile market and application store market in recent years.
In addition to this, this past September, the JFTC announced that they will be closing the investigation against the Apple once Apple rectifies its restriction on payment methods and revises, or updates, their guidelines on the review of application, which is that it is untransparent for app developers. Moreover, from this April, applications stores became subject to the new, digital platform regulations in Japan, which are called the Transparency Act. This is governed by the Ministry of Trade, Energy and Industry.
As a result of this, the designated application store operators, which means the Google and Apple, are required to ensure the transparency of the terms and conditions of the application stores, and need to provide sufficient, would need to provide a pre-notification when they prompt a change to their terms and conditions. By concerning these circumstances, we should also note that as a starting point, how the mobile ecosystem is designed can be determined at the discretion of each business operators. On the other hand, in light of the current competition situation in Japan, we should also note that, as a general matter, the design of mobile ecosystem could have a big impact on the biggest players in the ecosystem, as well as for general consumers. Thus, for Japan, it is now important to ensure that promoting competition between the ecosystems, and also promoting the competition on the platforms. That is my initial view on the situation.
Thank you very much.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Tatsuya, for updating us on recent developments regarding the Japan situation. The JFTC is communicating with foreign competition authorities, and we are also interested in how- the view from other agencies and other countries.
Leni, if you could share us with your view from non-Japanese perspective, that would be great.


Leni PAPA:
Thank you, Takako.
First of all, I would like to thank CPI for bringing to the table this very fundamental and timely topic on mobile ecosystems.
Let me just backtrack a bit and just give like the economic context for this one outside of Japan. Why it is especially important, especially in times of the pandemic. So, we have seen that in OECD countries, mobile data usage has increased by more than 15% on the average, and that mobile broadband subscriptions grew by 3.6% in 2020 across OECD countries, with the highest mobile internet penetration growth in Japan, with subscriptions of 185% per 100 inhabitants. Mobile ecosystems are particularly important as countries strive towards pandemic recovery, because, as we have seen in Europe, mobile technologies have generated a huge chunk of the GDP. It was 4.6% GDP for Europe, which equates to approximately 2.4 million jobs. And so, many international organizations, many think tanks have seen that mobile ecosystems will play a very big role when we invigorate our respective economies to build a better and more inclusive society.
Given this backdrop, we now look at the different developments in other countries, and I think it is a thing to say that there is a growing trend, a growing concern, that there, as Yusuke mentioned, there is a small number of major digital platforms which have become entrenched in a position of market power. We have seen this in the US where in a 2020 report by the US Antitrust Subcommittee mentioning the four largest digital platforms, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, they mentioned a few points, that number one, these platforms now serve as gatekeepers, having control over key channels of distributions. They have access to markets, and they can pick winners and losers throughout the economy.
This is also a concern in the EU, so as we can see in the EU’s explanatory memorandum for the proposed Digital Markets Act, it was mentioned that while there are 10,000 online platform providers in Europe’s digital economy, most of which are SMEs, a small number of large online platforms capture the biggest share of the overall value generated. This is evidenced by a number of cases which have been decided, or are being pursued at the regional and national levels in the EU. Perhaps one of the most well-known examples that we have is the Google Shopping case, which was most recently upheld by the General Court in the EU. The appeal of Google was rejected by the General Court, and now we understand for our listeners that this case involved Google self-preferencing, so it used its own search engine, which we know exceeded 90% market share in the EEA market, and it abused the dominant position on the market for online general search services in 13 countries in the EEA.
The allegation of the commission there was that it favored its own comparison shopping service over other comparison shopping services. And also very, very recently, it’s literally just hours ago, the Italian Competition Authority levied its highest fine against Amazon for allegedly abusing its market position when it found that the company unlawfully provided benefits to sellers on its online marketplace who have also signed up for its logistics service. Opposite of that is that it prevented its sellers who did not, who did not avail of the fulfillment by Amazon service from availing of the benefits given to Prime customers.
Also, it’s not only limited to the US and the EU, we also have several examples in Asia. In particular, we have in Korea, the Naver case, which involved the biggest online search engine in Korea, and KFTC found there that Naver abused its market dominance when it entered into contract clauses that prevented and penalized contract providers against providing information to rivals of its Naver real estate platform business.
With all these cases, there have been several policy developments across the world. And I will discuss this, probably in more detail, later, but maybe just to summarize the different approaches that have been taken. Some jurisdictions are opting to amend their competition laws on the argument that current laws are not sufficient to address these concerns in the mobile economy. Some would like to amend their merger laws, others are instituting or establishing digital market units to closely monitor mobile ecosystems, while others are preparing or proposing ex-ante regulatory options, like the EU, and the UK. Also being considered, and I know that this has been a discussion for Japan, is the development of a code of conduct as a possible solution for the issues identified in the mobile ecosystem.
Thank you, Takako.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Leni, for sharing your view from various jurisdictions’ perspective.
Now, with those opening thoughts helping me to frame the discussion, I want to move to the first substantive question. The first question, I want to ask Yusuke and Leni, what do you think about cross-market competition that Yusuke just mentioned, for example between app platform and ads platform? I know that Yusuke is an expert in this area, and we would like you to provide your thoughts with us.

ZENNYO:
Thank you.
As I mentioned in my opening statement, I think considering cross-market platform competition can be a good way for the better implementation of good policymaking. Especially today, I would like to talk about the findings from my latest research work. In that work, I tried to explore the complex relationship about cross-market competition between app platforms and advertising platforms. In particular, in the app platform market, as you know, Apple and Google have been criticized to have a gatekeeper position, but I think they are not completely monopolists, because they are competing with another type of platforms, that is advertising intermediaries, or the so-called adtech companies.
These advertising intermediary platforms enable app developers to make revenue through in-app advertising instead of the sales of apps. Actually, over 90% of app developers rely on this business model. In other words, they are distributing their apps for free of charge, and they do not pay any commissions to app platforms such as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, so I think it is very important to look at the cross-market platform competition between app platforms and advertising platforms.
Actually, Apple and Google are now facing social pressures to reduce their commissions. This past year, they reduced their commission rate from 30% to 15% for some apps. In contrast, according to the report by UK government, which is called the CMA Report, at least 35% of the advertising value is deprived by adtech companies. You know, 35% in the advertising platform market, while 15% in the app platform market. They look unbalanced.
So, the advertising commission is now much higher than app commission, okay? These things may imply that recent social pressures on app platforms, such as App Store and Google Play Store, may have distorted the cross-market competition, the balance of cross-market competition in the current state of mobile ecosystem. If so, I think the situations may be going in a bad direction. This is my biggest concern about the current mobile ecosystem.
Thank you, that’s all.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Yusuke, for explaining your economic perspective on competition between platforms.
Then, Leni, if you could share your thoughts on this view, that would be great.

PAPA:
Thank you, Takako and Yusuke, for the interesting point that you mentioned. It’s actually in line with recent studies of the OECD.
In this cross-country study, they have actually summarized a number of concerns involving cross-market competitions involving digital markets. Let me summarize some of these. We can count them into, number one would be self-preferencing, which is that platforms that sell ad inventory and act as intermediaries for publishers and advertisers have the incentive to favor their own sources. There are commentators who have argued that certain platforms in digital advertising supply chains have given preferential treatments to their own business units in respect to access to consumers and data.
The second concern pertains to leveraging. Commentators have raised concerns that vertically-integrated businesses that have market power in one part of the digital advertising supply chain could leverage that market power into other parts of the supply chain. Leveraging is more likely to be successful in situations where a platform with market power is able to increase the barriers to switching on various sides of the market.
Also, another point of concern with respect to cross-market competition is the collection of user data. There have been concerns, more specifically from the CMA, about certain platforms potentially abusing their market power to collect greater amounts of consumer data, which is a key input for targeted advertising, especially for digital display advertising. The CMA found that many consumers do not really understand what information they are sharing when they use the services.
This argument has been the hallmark of the Facebook case managed by the Bundeskartellamt of Germany, where the Bundeskartellamt found that users did not give meaningful consent with respect to the provision of its data to Facebook. I think these, in general, align with Yusuke’s study.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Leni.
Leni just mentioned about the Facebook case, and it’s a specific case, so I was wondering if Tatsuya could share recent Japanese cases with regard to mobile ecosystem or ecosystems.

TSUNODA:
Thank you very much.
When it comes to the recent cases in digital platforms in Japan, as I mentioned, the Japan FTC conducted an investigation against Apple. And although the case concerns only the digital content related application sector, more music, video, and ebook applications, the promise made by Apple may contribute to improving the transparency on their application platform.
As I mentioned, the Transparency Act will also improve the transparency of the application stores as a whole in the future. This approach could be generally in line with international approaches, to some extent, as explained by Leni before, and may improve the competition situation on mobile ecosystems. However, I assume there will remain problems to be discussed in order to address or understand the monopolistic situation with regard to the mobile ecosystems.
This December, the JFTC announced that their investigation against Rakuten, which is a big e-commerce player in Japan, will be closed. In this case, it was alleged that Rakuten unilaterally changed the conditions of the shipping fees in order to request serious shipping fees for certain amount of delivery as free, and that this change constitutes as abuse of a superior bargaining position. On the other hand, Rakuten argued that their change in the conditions would optimize efficiency in their marketplace as a whole, and this could be important for their ability to compete with more of the bigger players, such as Amazon. But regardless of that, the case proceeded until now. This implies that even if application stores ensure transparency and seek to secure total optimization on the application stores, there will still remain in conflict with the protection of the smaller and mid-sized enterprises on their platforms.
In addition, the fact that application stores seek to compete with bigger players would not justify their behavior or conduct, and the priority could be put on the protection of the small and mid-sized companies under the current analytical framework of the Anti-Monopoly Act of Japan. So, I agree that we should focus on cross-market competition and need to conduct analysis and take into account for the assessment under the Anti-Monopoly Act as well. But, based on recent enforcement cases, that implies that the recent framework might not be sufficient, or needs to updated or modernize to some extent.
That is my view on recent situation in Japan.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Tatsuya.
With regard to the Rakuten case you just mentioned, I think it’s an interesting case, and also difficult case. Rakuten wanted to make that plan to compete with others, others means Rakuten’s competitors, but that could have been, the JFTC thought, that could be abuse of a superior bargaining position with regard to Rakuten’s users and businesses. Yusuke, do you have view on this? Maybe I believe that economists can resolve anything.

ZENNYO:
Thank you, Takako-san for giving me this chance to talk about this topic. In my opinion, the current JFTC’s decision about Rakuten’s shipping fee policy has been made according to the abuse of a superior bargaining position, dominant position, of Rakuten over third party sellers. In other words, this decision was made only by the factors relating to the relationship between the platform and third party sellers. The consumer viewpoint has not been considered in this case.
I think there’s another way to consider consumer protection in other ways. But at the same time, I think it is very difficult to identify what conduct played by a platform is beneficial or detrimental to the consumer side as well as seller side. I have no concrete answer to this point, but I think this should be more considered over the world. Thank you.

ONOKI:
Then we’ll move to the next question, and the next question will be mainly to Leni and Tatsuya, and this session is called Mobile Ecosystems: Competition, and Choice, and User Protection. So how can or should user protection be ensured? That’s next question to you, Leni.

PAPA:
Thank you, Takako.
On this point, we have seen, in various jurisdictions, that there are different types of policy approaches which are being explored to protect users of mobile ecosystems. They’re basically divided into three, and first is measures which try to address conflicts of interests between the different platforms, which may give rise to anti-competitive conduct. That’s the first.
Then the second is controlling potential anti-competitive conduct, including self-referencing and leveraging. Then the third is addressing market opacity. For the one, in terms of managing conflicts of interest, there have been different approaches, which involves, number one, a proposal to do structural separation between the different entities involved, and then under the CMA’s recommendation, there was a point to provide the specialized Digital Markets Unit to impose structural separation remedies on mobile ecosystems.
This is also seen on the side of the US where the US House of Representatives’ antitrust report also recommended to the US Congress to consider legislation to allow for structural separation between the lines of business to manage conflicts of interests between the larger digital platforms. Absent a full structural separation, there has been a proposal to suggest that it be managed through Chinese walls, China walls, with conduct and disclosure rules.
The third proposal under that is to implement structural remedies through the competition authorities. On the other hand, there has to be a second proposal, which is to protect against anti-competitive conduct, and this is what I mentioned earlier. There is a growing voice supporting ex ante regulations for mobile ecosystems, and perhaps the most known one in Europe is the proposal for the Digital Markets Act for the EU, where certain platforms, the big online platforms, they call it online intermediation services that are most prone to unfair practices. These would include the big four, so companies which are considered as gatekeepers, and you have to comply or meet a certain threshold and a certain effect in the market. If you are considered a gatekeeper, then you will have to follow certain ex ante standard prohibitions or obligations.
Number one, you need to allow interoperability, provide effective portability of data, and you have to inform the European Commission of any intended concentration involving other core platforms’ services providers.
On the other side is the UK, which has the established Digital Markets Unit and has these rules to identify companies with a strategic market status. These are companies which have a substantial entrenched market power, and if you are considered as an SMS, then you would be subject to a certain code of conduct. But the difference between the UK and the EU proposal is that in the UK, there’s a more tailor-fitted code of conduct, meaning they will fit it out for that specific company.
Similarly though, the SMS firms have the obligation to report all transactions to the CMA. And then lastly, as a way to protect consumer data, this has also been a huge discussion, and for this one, there has been a growing consensus that you need to mine or get synergies from data privacy protection laws, not only on competition laws.
I will discuss it later, but we have to also be careful as policy makers, that when we suggest or propose competition laws to control, or to foster competition in cross-market platforms, then we would also need to consider the implications on data and privacy there.
Lastly, maybe to just to wrap up that point, we need to assess the likely costs and benefits of these policy proposals.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Leni, for sharing a comparative perspective. You mentioned ex ante regulations, and that’s also one of the topics that Japan is already considered and- considering how we could use in the future, and Tatsuya mentioned the Transparency Act.
So, Tatsuya, would you share your view on this?

TSUNODA:
Thank you very much.
As Takako-sensei and Leni mentioned, there could be many or various ways to protect users on mobile ecosystems, and that is a choice for each jurisdiction. On the other hand, when it comes to the promoting competition or innovation, it is important to ensure the predictability or legal certainty for the business players. In that sense, even if competition law or policy address the consumer or user protection issues, then that should be relied, or reflect the baseline, which is drawn by the other specialty acts such as Privacy Protection Act, or in Japan we have the Telecommunication Business Act, and they also protect communications-directed data, like the users’ privacy directly, or regulation.
Also, we also have the consumer protection act, such as the Consumer Comfort Act and misrepresentation acts [that are] relevant. These other regulatory regimes have been developed through extensive policy discussion based on the particular sort or examinations on user protection from a specific aspect or perspective. That’s why these regimes should provide a baseline for the enforcement or application of the Anti-Monopoly Act, and through this, the business operators can get insight, or predict the competition policy and revise their business model and conduct the self-assessment effectively and proactively. That is my view on this topic.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Tatsuya.
Yusuke, do you have anything you would like to share with us with regard to user protection from an economic perspective?

ZENNYO:
Thank you. It’s a tough question for economists like me; economists do not usually consider user protection, instead, we consider welfare maximization, so I cannot answer this specific question, sorry.

ONOKI:
That’s okay, that’s actually helpful.
Then, let’s move to the next question to Yusuke: what choices? Choice is also part of the name of this session, so what is choice and how should it be in mobile ecosystems from the perspective of competition law and policy?

ZENNYO:
Thank you. I am not a lawyer or a researcher of competition law, so let me talk about it as an economist. For better choice to be achieved, first of all, we need to understand the current, very complex landscape of mobile ecosystems. I see this is not an easy task. It’s very difficult. However, another thing we need to address is to make markets more transparent. This is a very important point. I think the lack of transparency is a very crucial problem in the advertising market. As you know, and as I had mentioned before, in the current situation, app commissions are 15% to 30%. In contrast, [an] advertising commission is at least 35%, which is much higher than app commissions. Nevertheless, over 90% of app developers rely on advertising revenue. Why?
This is a super question, why? I’m not sure why it is, but my guess is that this is because the advertising market is very opaque and not transparent.
According to a report by the European Commission, app developers do not know who paid, or how much, for their advertising space. This is a very bad situation. There’s no transparency in the current advertising market. In this situation, I don’t think app developers can make a better choice, a good choice in this situation. To resolve this problem, it is necessary to make advertising, especially mobile advertising markets, more transparent.
These is my thoughts on this topic. Thank you.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Yusuke. You mentioned transparency is important, and as a Japanese lawyer, I expect that the Japanese transparency act would work well, and if it would resolve the issue in Japan, that would be great.
Then, Leni, if you could share your view on this.

PAPA:
Yes, thanks, Takako.
My view is closely related to what Yusuke just said on the issue of transparency. And what we now know as the cases are evolving, is that consumer choice is not mainly reliant on the price, or the quality, or any other factor affecting the product itself. But we now know that it’s impacted by other dynamics in the market. The questions that come to our mind when we analyze consumers having a choice is, number one, how informed consumers choices really are? This relates to transparency and information. Can consumers really exercise their choice, and if they do have the power to exercise that choice, how do they exercise it, and how can a restraint in the ecosystem affect their exercise of the choice? This is not to suggest that we are trying to replace efficiency standards in evaluating consumer choices, but it’s more of an input to when when we analyze that efficiency standard.
What I would really like to explore more in the jurisdictions is to have a more direct recognition of how certain practices within mobile ecosystems affect how consumers exercise their choices, particularly online, and if there are significant or artificial constraints on their ability to choose effectively, we need to analyze them more closely, because incumbents probably fear that competition would destroy this opacity, and so they would like to protect their business models at the expense of the consumers having more informed choices. It’s an issue that we have to tread carefully also in respect to crafting policies in different countries.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Leni. Mobile ecosystems are very complex, and I think everybody agrees that competition is important, and competition should be secure. But how can competition be secure, and what is competition?
We touched upon competition between platforms and competition between platform users and the issues are complicated. Competition authorities, including the JFTC, are dealing with that. But competition law may not be, oh, it should be helpful, but it may not be the only tools that encourage competition, and today mentioned about ex ante regulations, and also transparency. Maybe these two, no, I should say three, but maybe two of the most important key terms, and the situation has been, and also will be, changing probably dramatically. I don’t have any specific view of how that will be, but I’m sure that will be changing dramatically, and I would like to thank you panelists for sharing your views.
At this point, I’ll ask each of the panelists for some closing thoughts. There are so many different things going on in the mobile ecosystems in Japan and around the world that may require us to be thinking more deeply about these issues. So for clothing remarks, may I ask Leni to share your view?

PAPA:
Thanks, Takako.
In relation to this growing international discussion on mobile ecosystems, maybe as part of my closing, I would say that there is indeed a growing voice with respect to closely examining mobile ecosystems, and now there is that question of whether existing regulatory approaches and tools that we have remain appropriate for this fastly evolving ecosystem.
One other point that I would like to mention is that, as you have said, this issue does not only involve competition, it impacts other policy spheres. We have privacy and data protection, we also have consumer protection to worry about. We didn’t discuss it, but it could also impact provision and remuneration of media content. The way that this issue will impact other policy areas, I think there is a need, we should recognize the need to involve other policy experts as well that are involved in privacy.
We do not have the monopoly of the knowledge in this area, and also one more important thing is that because mobile ecosystems are increasingly international, it would be very much a benefit to everyone to have an international cooperation when we are discussing policy options, just like what we are doing now.
Again, I would like to thank you and our colleagues here for this very fruitful discussion. I’ve learned a lot.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Leni. I totally agree with you on everything, but especially the internal cooperation would be important for, especially for the digital area.
Next, Yusuke.

ZENNYO:
Okay, thank you.
As everyone knows, that even for now, the current competitive environment is very complex, and additionally, competition is dynamic, so nobody knows about the future of this complex landscape. But we economists and competition policy researchers have to do our best regarding this point. And actually now, tech companies have been expanding their business areas, so this movement will make the situation get more and more complicated. If so, it would be insufficient to look at individual markets for creating better policy making. We need to have a broader perspective over the mobile ecosystem, and, of course, other related product markets, but this is not an easy challenge. Further discussions are required all over the world, not only in Asia, Europe, and North America.
These are my concluding remarks. Thank you very much.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Yusuke.
Tatsuya, would you please provide your closing remarks?

TSUNODA:
Thank you very much, Takako-sensei.
I would like to mention two points, and the first point is related to transparency. As we observed during this session, transparency has becoming the buzzword in the world of mobile ecosystems. Having said that, as I mentioned initially, ecosystem operators can design the ecosystem in itself, and it might have a big impact on our behavior. Even if there would be more transparency-promoting implementations or measures that will be coming, we should carefully review whether such measures really have the relevancy to promote or protect the transparency.
In other words, whether there is a hidden purpose behind the measures, such as supervising and things, something like that, as Leni mentioned, by referring to the Google Shopping cases.
Another point is, I really think, how the regulatory authority should tackle with these kinds of problem. As a jurisdiction, Japan also has developing a regulatory tool to address competition-related issues on the mobile ecosystem. But these tools are generally based on communication or cooperation between the big players, and not the hard enforcement approach like in the EU, by imposing high amounts of fine. While this is a historical trend in the regulatory regimes of Japan, it is still unclear if this approach can work well, not only for domestic companies, but also the foreign companies. If the Japanese authorities pursue this approach in the future, it is important to ensure transparency on their own side. They have to show reasonable and objective evidence, and plausible argument to the foreign companies that may share our concerns with foreign companies that may have a different culture or background.
That is my comment and closing remarks. Thank you very much.

ONOKI:
Thank you, Tatsuya.
At this point I would like to thank all panelists for a fruitful discussion. I enjoyed this discussion, and let’s keep in touch offline as well, and also thank you, CPI, for providing this opportunity to have such a great chance to discuss a very hot topic.
Thank you. ",Google
738,"January 25, 2022",Mergers & Acquisitions in the Digital Economy: Striking the Right Balance,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Mergers & Acquisitions in the Digital Economy: Striking the Right Balance. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to Australia.

Kirsten WEBB:
Well, hello everybody and welcome to this panel session. Today we’re going to be discussing the fascinating topic of mergers and acquisitions in the digital economy, which is a topic which is much discussed, of course, at the moment, but our focus is going to be on striking the right balance.
The panelists we have here today, to introduce, we have Chris Berg, who’s a senior research fellow at RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub. We have John Yun, associate professor of law and director of economic education with the Global Antitrust Institute. We have Sean Ennis, professor of competition policy at Norwich Business School at the University of East Anglia, and we have Rob Nicholls, associate professor at the University of New South Wales. And I’m Kirsten Web, a partner at Clayton Utz and I’m the moderator for today’s session.
So welcome everybody. We might start off with a broad question, which is an obvious question, given our topic, which is, does there need to be a re-balance of mergers analysis in the digital economy? I might ask each panelist to give a very short reaction to that question, and then we’ll dig deeper into some of the issues that are raised by that question. So in alphabetical order, we might start with Chris. What do you think, Chris?


Chris BERG:
Thank you so much for having me. Look, I think it’s absolutely a necessity that we rebalance the way we think about competition in this space. I come at from a very particular place, which is the study of blockchain and the crypto economy.
What we find uniformly across policy areas is that many of the assumptions that we’ve applied to traditional industrial era economic organization just don’t apply, don’t make sense in the crypto and blockchain space. I think that replicates across the economy as well, as we move from the sort of factory organization of the economy to these platform network de-hierarchical organizations that we’re now seeing. I think that necessitates a fairly deep rethinking, not necessarily of competition policy, but of the way we structure our thinking about what looks like anti-competitive conduct and what looks like, even things like consumer protection.

WEBB:
Thanks very much Chris. John, what’s your perspective?


John YUN:
Thank you, Kirsten and thank you for having me here.
It’s a complicated question, and obviously, we’re looking for short responses here. So to properly address it, we need to really look at two questions, one of which is where we are and where we think we need to be and whether there’s a difference between those two. I think there’s a lot of policy debates about that, but I’m of the view that I like where we are. I do think modern antitrust and its evidence-based approach and the goal of economic efficiency is something that has been very good for antitrust. Doesn’t mean that the enforcement along that objective is perfect. No, it certainly doesn’t mean that. But at the very least, I think the objective is right.
So then the question is, is that enforcement getting there? Does the digital sector present unique challenges that we need to incorporate and are we deviating from what we consider to be good enforcement? That to me is a harder question. I think the evidence is still sort of being developed.
I looked at a series of paper coming out of Europe by Lantham and Lamech, and there’s a lot of good papers out there, and their conclusion is it’s really hard. They say it could be anti-competitive, it could be pro-competitive. We just don’t know. The evidence is really mixed, and it’s case by case. To me, that’s the conclusion that I think makes a lot of sense here. So, absent extraordinary evidence, I tend to think that, well, we are headed in the right way. I think generally speaking, merger analysis is in a good place.

WEBB:
Thanks, thanks very much, John. Sean, what’s your perspective?


Sean ENNIS:
Oh, this is really a hard question. If you were to back up and say, “Have there been mergers that seem to have been problematic?” I think a lot of people would say yes. But if you go a little bit further and say, “What percentage of mergers have been problematic?” If, let’s say there’ve been 400 mergers and people tend to talk about between five and 10 as being problematic, that’s a really small percentage of the total. I think some agencies have upped their game in this area and so, to me, that shows that there is some ability, at least for the agencies, to change the way they act without necessarily having a fundamental rethink of the broad system. So, maybe I’m in the camp that remains to be convinced, but could be convinced.

WEBB:
Thanks, Sean. And Rob?


Rob NICHOLLS:
I think, ultimately it’s the consumer welfare issue, the driver. Why efficient markets? Because that leads to great outcomes from a consumer welfare perspective. So, is there a problem? Is there something that’s going wrong at the moment that means we should have the sort of regulatory angst that we’re seeing across the world from different regulators? Now, I’m not quite sure that we’ve got to that stage yet. Just like Sean, I’m willing to be convinced, but I’m certainly not going to be convinced if it suddenly looks like a very targeted approach to mergers analysis, which has that “not invented here” aspect to it.

WEBB:
Well, thank you very much for those short answers to a very big question.
We’ve got a range of interesting perspectives on our panel this morning. Let’s dig a little bit deeper into your thoughts on some of the issues that underlie the brief comments that have just been made. The first question, I suppose, is is merger analysis—or Chris who’s looking at most broadly, I think competition analysis in the broadest sense—something different to analysis of traditional industries? What should merger analysis in the digital economy look like, do we all think?
So let’s put that out there for discussion or, Chris, if you want to go broad, competition regulations in the digital world. Maybe if we start with something a little bit concrete.
John, would you like to kick off by discussing the CMA’s move to block Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy with horizontal and vertical theories of harm? Having a look at that, and more broadly, what factors do you think agencies and courts should be considering here?

YUN:
That’s a great question. So let me caveat my thoughts by saying the CMA, they obviously have evidence that is not public and that we’re not privy to, and so they might have very, very good reasons that we’re not seeing for bringing it, and so my comments are with that caveat. After spending time at the FTC, often, the non-public stuff is very important.
So with that being said, for their theory of harm to really work on a horizontal level, let me start there and then move to the vertical, they need a couple of key factors. I think the main thing they need is that Giphy needs to represent some differentiated product from others that are similarly situated.
How do you identify that? I think there’s a couple of ways that you can do that. One of which is, let’s look at their history and their product development. So Giphy, I looked it up, there are about an eight-year-old company, and so they’ve been around a while. One of the things I think the CMA should be looking for, and if they haven’t, it’s useful, is that have they differentiated their product in a way that’s different from what they’ve developed previously? Because an eight year old company isn’t quite nascent and potential anymore. They’re a fairly established company. I would like to see some evidence that they are moving and pivoting into an area that Facebook is competing in. I think that would be really important.
The second thing I’d like to see is how differentiated is Giphy from other sort of GIF type companies that offer a similar product? I think that’s really critical. Are they at a growth rate, the different types of consumers are they closely aligned with Facebook users more than others? I think that’s really the kind of stuff that I want to see, rather than, “Oh, they’re something that Facebook uses and they could potentially become a competitor.” I think we need that seed of competition that could potentially grow, and maybe there is that. I think that would be an important thing that I’d like to see. Very briefly for the vertical theory where they could foreclose the GIF input into others. I think if this were relied on, it would worry me more, because if, for example, an upstart, a Tik-Tok or Snap uses the GIF inputs that Giphy provides, and it’s been a very important driver for some of their features and functionalities that compete with Facebook, and then now there’s a potential for foreclosure, I’d be worried.
So I think that type of stuff would be a lot more viable than the horizontal potential stuff. I think you need to see more evidence. Not that it’s not viable, but I think it’s a harder sell based off of GIPHY’s history, at least publicly.

WEBB:
Thanks very much John.
Did anyone else have any comments on the horizontal and vertical theories and factors that you think might be taken into account in merger analysis here?
Maybe we’ll move to a related question or a more specific or a subset of that broader question, which is, killer acquisitions, and John was questioning whether a company that’s been established for eight years represents nascent competition. Killer acquisitions. Rob, would you like to have a bit of a discussion about the effect of merger regulation or merger analysis which tries to identify mergers that might stifle emerging competition and what effect that might have more broadly, for example, on innovation?

NICHOLLS:
I think one of the key issues for potential innovators—I work in a business school, so I’ve got bunches of students who are the potential entrepreneurs of, well actually, next week rather than next year. A lot of them have ambitions, which are pretty much like this: we will set up a business, we will establish it, prove its success, sell to Google, live with the restraint of trade that Google imposes and use that as the seed funding for the business that we really wanted to get into.
So if you get into a merger’s analysis that says every potential acquisition by the GAFAM or some list of businesses has to be reviewed in a particular way, then there’s a risk. There’s a risk of stifling innovation in that, that exit process is no longer available and it’s less not being able to exit the first time, it’s not being able to go on to the next innovation that’s risky.
I think there needs to be a balance. I think that issue of nascent competition is really difficult to define in a way that can be appropriately enforced by mass competition regulators, and to have a rule, which is “I’ll know it when I see it” is entirely inappropriate because it takes away predictability from businesses, it takes away the potential for innovation.
Actually, I think some of the acquisition of Giphy is really, well, it’s that angst I mentioned earlier on; how did we let Facebook acquire Instagram? Well, because Instagram had 13 people working for them, and actually 13 exhausted people who were really just looking to have a mechanism to patch up their servers to continue providing the service to their users.
So, there is a risk of if merger, there’s a shift to merger analysis that says, “Well, actually we require the onus of proof on the acquirer to be such that there is no possibility that there will be a reduction in competition, let alone a significant or substantial reduction in competition.” That risk is that there will be an ecosystem of innovation which is stifled. I don’t think that that risk is, that risk needs to be at least appropriately considered before you start saying, “Well, we don’t have fit-for-purpose merger regulation.”
I think killer acquisition’s is a particular issue and if you say, “It’s only the GAFAM’s that we worry about for killer acquisitions”, that’s even worse. If you really need a theory of harm for killer acquisitions, that actually can be translated from a theory of harm to regulatory guidance, which is not going to stifle innovation in the digital economy, and to be frank, innovation in the digital economy is where the vast majority of innovation is occurring. The risk is really high.

BERG:
Can I just elaborate or expand and support Rob’s point for a moment there? Because I think that’s really important. That exit to a large competitor, to a dominant player in the market, is built into the capital structure of the original innovators themselves. A large part of the venture capital model is built around that, that ultimately in five, 10 years, we will flip so that we can return funds to our liquidity providers as well. When we’re thinking about regulating it, if we’re going to regulate that exit, we’re also going to be starting to implicitly regulate the entry.
Now we’ve seen over the course of decades that it’s increasingly difficult to go the other direction to go to an initial public offering, for all sorts of complex regulatory reasons, and so the exit to a large competitor looks like a lot easier and more attractive path for a lot of young innovators. Just to reiterate Rob’s point, just thinking about what this looks like from the beginning of the innovation process is really important because these are fixed lifecycle firms, fixed lifecycle startups very often.

ENNIS:
Can I just jump in? I agree with John’s point that there’s a backwards logic to this so that if you change the end game you’re going to change the start of the whole process as well. It’s a little bit unclear how they would finish out, though. I’m not convinced that it’s always healthy to have the sellout to the very big competitor versus going to the market and getting the price as the end objective. I think some venture capitalists are kind of concerned actually about the current situation, because they have so few exit options as it is in the way that things seem to be going. But if you were to look for some criteria that a competition authority might use for evaluating nascent competition, it could be related to the price being paid for the acquired entity compared to its revenues or compared to its size of its labor force. I think if you use those criteria, you will end up with most of the mergers that people have talked about as potentially problematic coming out as having at least a yellow blinking light. So maybe there is a way, Rob, to have such a criteria. I’m not suggesting those ones necessarily, but those might be ones to consider.

NICHOLLS:
I agree. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen yet a concrete proposal that actually says, “Well, we think that there might be a potential problem if acquisition prices N times revenue.” Because it won’t be N times earnings, because earnings will almost certainly be zero, but at above N times revenue, then we should be thinking about it. But even then, coming up with a, well, why is N N and not N minus one or N plus one? So that isn’t a solution. It needs to be a much clearer solution, which says, “We’ve come to this. We’ve come to it rationally, and why have we come to it?”
The other issue, I think, Sean, is you’re dead right. It’s an optionality issue. There’s no requirement to sell out to a big company and an IPO as Chris pointed out has difficulties, but it’s an option. It’s the removal of the option that’s the risk.

WEBB:
Chris, you’re nodding. Do you have any ideas as to how to identify with a greater level of certainty, which of these sorts of acquisitions might be problematic?

BERG:
No, and I’m really concerned that if we try to head down that way, we’re going to basically be restructuring the venture market at the beginning. I spend a lot of time working with companies at the very start of their venture process when they’re getting the initial evaluations, when they’re getting the seed or even angel investing, and any of the proposals that we could put up and we could devise right now, would inherently mean that they trade at a discount because we’re just writing off or we’re at least, we’re making quite risky, one of the basic exit strategies. So I’m deeply concerned about that and particularly because if you think about some of the tech acquisitions that haven’t come to the attention of competition regulators in recent years, there aren’t revenues, there’s certainly not profits. Often, these are just acquisitions to buy a team.
For example, I’m thinking of the acquisition of Keybase, the secure chat app by Zoom. Zoom purchased them at the start of the pandemic in order to basically buy their encryption skillset. There was no revenue, in fact there was nothing that we could have looked at to have some objective function that would be valuable from a policy analysis perspective, but that is a perfectly justified exit strategy and that would have returned to the investors of Keybase exactly what they were looking for. Now, I’m a bit disappointed because I really liked Keybase, but having said that, I’m very concerned about the changing of the capital structure of the industry sort of really strange and backhanded way through competition policy.

WEBB:
Thanks Chris. John, you were nodding. Have you got any ideas as to how to grapple with this question?

YUN:
I don’t, but I do want to affirm Rob and Chris’s point and also raise a statistic I find interesting.
I recently read that of all the exits in the US from startups and venture capital firms, big tech represents 4% of that. To me, 4% is significant. It’s still important and I agree that the ex-ante and ex-post influence each other in terms of the exit strategy and the valuation, and I’m a firm believer of that. But it also puts it in perspective, and saying that big tech is not the one buying up all these companies.
There’s this perception that startups are really just getting gobbled up. It’s really a relatively small percent. That doesn’t mean it’s not significant and important, but I think that statistic is quite helpful, and I think both points can be right where the exit strategy influences the ex-ante valuation. I also think that perhaps it could be overstated how much big tech is gobbling up these small startups. I think there’s a vibrant activity out there that doesn’t involve big tech.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, John. As a lawyer, I’m going to ask now a principles based question, which is, I think back to you, John, actually. Which is in the discussion that we’ve just had, we’ve referred to potential competition and nascent competition.
John, do you think there’s a legal and economic difference between those two concepts?

YUN:
I do, and I’m going to argue that it’s important. In the US, potential competition is a doctrine that arose out of the 1960s and 70s in a series of Supreme Court cases. I don’t want to bore the audience with a walkthrough of case history, but very basically, these involved products such as natural gas and beer.
Beer in the 1970s was different from today. I don’t mean to suggest these are the same things. I know craft and differentiation is very important today, but back then, these were very basic products. What the court was wrestling with is whether a firm who hasn’t quite entered a geographic market or a product space, but is thinking of entering, exerts some competitive influence either currently or very soon in a way that it’s disciplining the market.
So a merger between a potential competitor and an actual competitor can result in some harm to consumers. It’s a very viable theory. It’s a well-developed doctrine. The problem is, is that it represented a very high burden of what it meant to be a potential competitor. Many people have been upset about this, and I think rightly so, but I think it’s appropriate for potential competition cases that are very basic commodities and products.
Now let’s move to nascent competition. This is a doctrine that came out in the 1990s, I think for the first time by the DOJ with their Microsoft case. Very briefly that case was involving the operating system of Microsoft and the threat that Netscape as a web browser posed, not for Internet Explorer, but for Microsoft’s operating system Windows in of itself, in that it could develop functionalities and overlaps that could chip away at the monopoly power that Microsoft had over the OS system market.
That actually has come true to a way, right? Because look at Chrome and Chromebook. The functionality of web browsers has influenced the market for operating systems in a meaningful way. The point being is that nascent competition represents, often, a product that is differentiated technologically, but could develop in such a way that it could represent a threat to an incumbent in the future. It generally isn’t a product that’s not in the market or anything. It could be in the market, or it could be in an adjacent market, but it’s really about product development and innovation in a certain manner.
So why does that matter? I think to me, that burden should be lower. We shouldn’t be using the potential competition cases to inform us about nascent competition cases, because then you’re going to require on the plaintiffs, these arguments that we need to see documents at the entry would have occurred. We need to see firm commitments. We need to see business plans. You see this in certain cases: FTC vs Steris. FTC brought this as a potential competition case, when to me it’s really a nascent competition case.
Long story short, I think these are two separate doctrines, and I think the problem that agencies and courts are having right now in the US is they’re using a very high standard of potential competition to inform nascent competition cases, when I think these are quite different.

WEBB:
Everyone’s nodding. Anyone want to add to that? Rob, you want to speak?

NICHOLLS:
I actually want to go off on a deviation, which John mentioned craft beer as being distinct.
Craft beer actually looks like the sort of innovation that you see in the digital economy. In countries like Australia, where that potential competition doctrine isn’t nearly as strong, craft beer is just another beer in the market for beer. Now, talk to any beer drinkers, and they would entirely disagree with that analysis, but it leads to that issue of if you’re going to have a doctrine, if you’re going to have an enforcement approach, you need to be very clear as to how it works and you need to be able to have it be more general than just, “Oh, it’s this part of the digital economy that we’re really worried about.”
Potential competition could arise in the financial services sectors, as Chris’s experience shows. It could potentially arise in the pharma sector. So saying that mergers analysis needs to be specific to the digital economy, I think is problematic. I think that I’m just jumping on an example that John gave to actually make that point.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Rob. Chris, you were nodding vigorously then.

BERG:
Only to fully support everything Rob said.

WEBB:
Well, Chris, while you have the floor, so to speak, we have been talking about the issues that have been raised by some of the high profile big tech mergers that everybody knows about.
But there are some interesting measures in the crypto space, I understand, not having any expertise in that space myself. Would you like to talk about whether, or start off a discussion about whether token mergers raise any antitrust concerns, and if so, what are those concerns and how could that be addressed?

BERG:
Look, it’s a really interesting issue. In the crypto economy, we’ve got a lot of parallel institutions and a lot of assets that look kind of like traditional assets, like shares and various things, but also function in a very different way and imply different governance rights and participation by the community over the nature of the firm or protocol or application or what have you. We’ve got these decentralized networks. The key thing to understand about these crypto and blockchain technologies is that, for the most part, if they are correctly decentralized, if they are properly decentralized, then there isn’t a single agency, there isn’t a single mind that makes decisions about what to do with the protocol or project. There isn’t a management, there isn’t a hierarchy that makes decisions about, well, we’re going to go in this direction or we’re going to go in that direction. It is, in an ideal state, developed by the community. The community tends to both own and use these protocols themselves.
With all that, it looks often a lot like companies, and we’ve got instances of planned mergers and acquisitions by different projects. There’s a project called the Fei protocol, that is proposing to merge with the Rari protocol and proposing to do a sort of token swap, and we won’t get into the details about that, but it’s the users and governors of these two protocols who are debating and trying to decide this.
This creates some really interesting problems just to look at it from a traditional mergers acquisition space. Now, competition regulators haven’t gone into this yet, because, A, it is very difficult. And B, it is pretty marginal of course to the rest of the economy. My prediction is that it’s going to get more and more important and interesting, but the key thing that I think is interesting from our perspective is when we’re blurring the boundaries between who owns the firm and who uses the firm’s products.
If a community decides to merge with another community, even if that might materially harm the competitive landscape of the crypto economy. Well, does that raise competition concerns? I don’t have an answer to that. I’m not sure that you can have an answer to that because the presumptions are so different from the traditional sort of crypto economy, but it is a really interesting thing to think about, and I suspect it’s going to become more and more significant as time goes by and more people are being onboarded into cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Chris. Has anyone else thought of that? Yeah, Rob has, of course.

NICHOLLS:
Sorry, I don’t want to monopolize things.
I think one of the key issues that flows from that is the issue of gun jumping. So, in traditional mergers analysis, one of the issues is unless and until your merger is cleared, you can’t operate as if the merger has occurred. Actually, if you’ve got two communities which are owners and users that are negotiating a potential merger, actually that negotiation is, for example, going to get to adjustments in rates between the exchange values of the tokens. In effect, even those discussions create some of the effects of the merger.
How do you deal with gun jumping is sensible policy. We’ve used it traditionally in mergers and mergers analysis. I think it starts to raise some really difficult issues that look sectorally specific. That takes away from my argument, “No, no, all this needs to be across all,” but I think we do need to start to recognize that once you start to get into these, the complexities, let alone the complexity of the merger analysis itself, then there are going to be issues that flow from the traditional way of dealing with mergers, such as the prohibition on gun jumping once the negotiation process is in place.

BERG:
It’s an interesting point because it would be very difficult to prevent those sorts of discussions, and if you wanted to prevent them, who would you be preventing from those occurring?
The question always becomes in these crypto and blockchain conversations is it’s all well and good to say, “Yes, this regulation applies in this place.” And we can make all sorts of arguments or you might need a license to do something, or you might be prevented from doing something else. It’s very hard to figure out how to enforce it, though, not least because you can’t necessarily identify who has been driving these things, but also because once they’ve been done, so once the merger has been effected between these two protocols, if it is, it’s unwindable. You can’t un-unwindable. You can’t roll it back. We see this across the crypto economy, just as a digression, a lot of people have argued that certain products on the blockchain should require various types of financial services license, in Australia particularly. That’s all well and good, but what if you were to withdraw a license for failure to comply with its terms? Well, what would you do? The thing’s still on the internet; can’t be taken down. It does create this field does create a whole lot of interesting regulatory challenges.

WEBB:
Well, on that note, we might move to our second topic, which is having acknowledged that there are a range of regulatory challenges in theories of harm or in competition policy or underlying analysis, let’s move to whether we think that different rules are needed or are justified for tech businesses or for particular parts of the digital economy, or overall. We might go to Sean to open up this topic.
Sean, do you think it’s just to have a different merger standard only for big tech or only for particular participants in the digital economy?

ENNIS:
I think that it’s commonly accepted in some countries that you might have a different standard for abuse of dominance based on size. I definitely understand the argument. But for mergers, I’m a little more concerned, to be honest, because I think it’s absolutely possible to come up with some economic indicia that would distinguish one group of firms from another. It might be the GAFAM center, it might be GAFAM plus, but you could come up with the indicia. You could have a policy rationale that these are the ones that you really care about, but I’m not sure you get the right treatment, and in particular, a just treatment and a fair treatment if some companies are singled out in merger analysis.
When you have smaller ones who are doing substantively the same type of deal from all the, in terms of gaining, perhaps gaining similar, if you could measure market power precisely, let’s say they were gaining the same amount of market power as the GAFAM plus, why should the GAFAM plus deal be stopped and the others not be stopped? I’m at a loss to figure out what the difference should be. Maybe that’s because I was raised working on a lot of smaller merger cases in which a lot of the concern was to set a standard that would apply to a broader set of merger cases, and so you wanted to establish the principles that would be generally applicable. I think this is moving away from having generally applicable principles, and that’s a concern for me.

WEBB:
John, what do you think? I think there are explicit calls in the US to bifurcate antitrust into two rules, for big and for everybody else. What do you think about this?

YUN:
Yeah, there are calls and you know, my position, I really couldn’t say it any better than what Sean just said. I call it discriminatory antitrust, that may be a little provocative, but we do engage in some of that, right?
If you have market power, or in Europe, abuse of dominance, that means there’s sort of a different set of presumptions and burdens placed on you, and that’s perfectly fine. That’s a market-based approach to analyzing firm behavior. We use a different lens if you have market power relative to if you don’t and that makes a lot of sense.
I think the bigger concern, however, is when you use discriminatory antitrust, not based off of market-based reasons, but size or identity. I think there you run into some issues, and as Sean said, you could have a firm that’s a medium-sized tech company that is the market leader in a certain area engaging in acquisition that would be under a rule of reason, but then you would have a Google or a Facebook who could be a distant second or third and looking to catch up to the incumbent who’s leading the market and that would be certainly a more scrutinized, if not outright banned, and they would have to vertically integrate in order to compete in an effective way. I think that’s really becoming more regulatory than enforcement of antitrust laws. I think that worries me and if we move in that direction, we need a good evidence that that regulatory approach would lead to better outcomes. I don’t think we’re there yet.

BERG:
Sorry, to jump in. Sort of taking that approach also just badly over politicizes the antitrust process, because Sean was talking about GAFAM plus. Here we have, I know it’s not your phrase, Sean, we’ve got a selection of companies and we can just add different ones at a given time. If you are the marginal company. If you are, say, IBM, wanting to stay out of that list of targeted firms, you’re going to invest a lot of funds in influencing the political process and people are going to invest a lot of funds bringing you into that political process as well.
I think it does exactly what we don’t want from antitrust policy, which is re-politicize it; take it away from this base level of analytics that we’ve been talking about here today and push it entirely into the political process. Very dangerous, as I see it.

WEBB:
Rob, what so you think?

NICHOLLS:
I agree and I think it’s that important distinction that yes, if there is abuse of market power or issues which are associated with market power, those are completely different from the mergers analyses.
For example, you might have, let’s take a traditional business, you might have pipeline operator which has pretty much a monopoly in one state. A pipeline operator which has pretty much a monopoly in another state. If the two merge, well, there is no lessening of competition, certainly no substantial lessening of competition, but you wouldn’t prevent the merger just because they’re two big pipeline companies. I think you need to think very carefully about saying, “Well GAFAM is different or GAFAM plus is different.” That politicization, which Chris worried about, I think one of the worries is that the plus bit turns out to be, “Yeah, well you’re a plus if you’re a US domiciled multinational and you’re not plus if you’re a European domiciled multinational,” and that becomes problematic in the analysis of mergers on a global basis.

WEBB:
Well, I think everybody’s agreed that having specific merger rules that apply to entities just because of their size is problematic for the range of reasons we’ve discussed. Everybody’s in favor of a more market-based analysis. That’s been referenced through most people’s responses to the market dominance or abuse or misuse of market power regimes that exist anywhere in the world.
What do you think about a notion that you have different merger rules for someone who has market power?

NICHOLLS:
You could potentially have a reverse onus of proof, but the risk, so that is you have to show that the merger will not lessen competition to whatever threshold your jurisdiction requires. The problem is that that has the effect of slowing down merger processes in a dynamic environment.
The risk is that unless the enforcement, the actual mergers analysis by the competition authority, is very efficient, that the mergers themselves will never occur, and the economic benefits and the consumer welfare benefits will never flow because the signal is, “Ah, well, you’re big, so we’re going to really look hard at you and we’ll spend months and months and months doing it, so please don’t bother,” which is the effective signal that comes from this. I think we’ve seen in other jurisdictions, perhaps the issue that says, well, if there is a sensitive sector, then potentially there is an expectation that merger clearance flows in a different way. But if you’re going to take that sort of approach and have exceptions from a normal or usual process, are the resources to the competition regulator to ensure that that process is expedited, or at least follows a timeline which cannot be, does not have clock stops from the regulator’s side, but might have clock stops from the merger parties’ side.

WEBB:
Anyone else have a view? Sean has a view.

ENNIS:
Yeah, I think there have been some proposals to both flip the standard of proof and reduce checks and balances on the competition authority, and I think if you put those two together, that’s a very dangerous combination, because effectively you might end up with the administrative authorities, the prosecutors, having both a stronger ability to stop deals and less control over themselves to make sure that they were acting in a reasoned way.
I’m really concerned by that type of development. I wouldn’t want to see that, because I think that administrative authorities tend to try to push the line when they can. They may feel like if given this kind of liberty, they might just push the line too far. It might be that there’s a low risk with pushing it too far. That might be the argument they would use. But I think it’s really important to have a backstop that’s demanding accountability from the authorities at all times when they do act and so that must be maintained if there is any change in the standards.

WEBB:
John, what do you think?

YUN:
No, I don’t have anything to add. It’s a terrific response, I’m just listening now.

WEBB:
Well, looking at this from a different perspective, we’ve referred to GAFAM, of course, because everybody does. But let’s take a look at Spotify as an example of the issues, I suppose, that we’ve been tossing around. Tell us what you think about whether or not Spotify should face the same standards of scrutiny, having embarked on a number of acquisitions as we’ve been discussing as a possibility for Facebook and Google, et cetera. What do you think about that?

YUN:
I think Spotify is a really good example of the dangers of what we’ve been sort of discussing in terms of having a different set of rules based simply on the identity of a firm.
I just did some looking into Spotify and they’re a very big company. They’re not part of the elite of the big tech companies, but they are the clear number one leader, in streaming music subscription services which is a big market and Apple, Amazon, and Google are certainly big players, but they’re playing catch up. I looked at Spotify’s acquisitions over the past couple of years, and it was eye-opening how many they’ve made. Just to give you a broad list, it’s Findaway, Podz, Betty Labs, Ringer, Megaphone, Anchor, Gimlet, Cutler.
I would read their actual press releases, and Spotify was very unabashed at saying, “Look, we’re buying this to jumpstart our entry into podcasting, our entry into audio books, we want to be the premier destination for everything audio in the digital economy.” They have a very strong ambition, and good for them.
It actually has worked. Statistically, they were behind Apple and Podcast, but after these acquisitions and obviously other investments they’ve made, they are now, according to Spotify, so this could be in dispute, they are the number one destination for podcasting globally, currently. Here we have acquisitions that have allowed Spotify to compete with Apple in an adjacent market, but some could recast this. What if this was Apple instead of Spotify? I think our lens would be totally different. I think the public pressure would be completely different on the agencies and the courts and our perception of these acquisitions as quote, “Good,” for consumers would be very different.
That’s my concern. Here we’re swapping the identity of a firm simply for actual market-based analysis. I think to me, Spotify is a good example of a very important company, that’s a market leader, that’s using acquisitions in a way that many would accept as pro-competitive, but then we drop those principles when we switch out the identity and I think that’s what worries me rather than, than having a market-based sort of fact-based approach to these types of deals.

BERG:
It does worry me sometimes in the mergers and acquisitions arguments that we don’t fully recognize that these mergers can be extremely pro-competitive, because of course they are taking not just off Apple, but Spotify is moving into audio books. Audio books has been dominated by Amazon, and it’s Audible thing, and it’s actually very pro-consumer as well. If you look at the shape of the podcasting industry, as it was when it was dominated by Apple, it was actually very difficult to sort of expand audiences outside the Apple ecosystem. It was very directed at one particular side of the cell phone markets of the iOS of the OS market and so forth. This has actually massively and quite radically transformed podcasting.
I used to be a podcaster so I’m really, really engaged in this, and I’m super pleased that as both a consumer and producer of podcasts, things are just more accessible, and I think that’s going to happen for audio books as well. That’s an unambiguously, pro-consumer merger story and unambiguously pro-competitive merger story.

WEBB:
All right, just before we move from the topic of whether we need different rules for different types of tech businesses, we’ve spoken a lot about the different merger rules, but, Chris, frontier technologies, do you think that there are different rules necessary to address any potential antitrust problems that might arise in frontier technologies?

BERG:
Look, thank you for indulging me, I’d like to talk about blockchains and cryptocurrency again. Again, I think a lot of things operate in a different, in a lot of different dynamics, but there are some interesting examples of what we’re talking about a lot is digital infrastructure and shared digital infrastructure across multiple firms.
For a lot of the use cases that we think are most exciting about blockchain, say tracking products across a supply chain, it’s very important that you get, if not the whole industry on board a shared piece of infrastructure, certainly a large part of that industry. So a lot matters about, well, we’ve built the shared infrastructure and we’re all going to sign up and we’re all going to use this standard or this smart contract platform, or what have you. How are we going to govern that smart contract platform? Who are the participants in governance going to be?
We’ve seen a number of really substantial infrastructure plays by for example, IBM. There’s shipping; the shipping company Maersk coming together and building out a trade lens product that they’re trying to onboard everybody onto. They’ve found that very difficult because it’s been seen as a sort of pro-Maersk play within the shipping industry. At the same time, if we’re going to get the gains that we’re going to have to standardize. We’re going to have to share infrastructure.
I predict in the next couple of years, that’s going to come really to the forefront of competition and analysis. Certainly anti-competitive behaviors. Some competitors might be working through the governance of these networks to keep out some of their competitors as well. Really interesting area, a lot’s going to ride on what constitutes shared governance, what constitutes genuinely decentralized. But I think everybody in this call’s going to have to tackle this issue sooner than you think.

WEBB:
Yeah, well, that sounds like a huge topic. Rob, go.

NICHOLLS:
No, I was just going to say, Chris says shared governance, somebody else says cartel conduct. It’s a very difficult issue to deal with.

WEBB:
We might move away from that topic, which we obviously would need years to talk about, back to merger analysis and remedies, and the sort of enterprises we’ve been discussing operate across boundaries, of course, there’s, and we all come from specific national regimes, which have some similarities and have some differences.
What do we think about the notion that we might need some kind of global approach; some kind of realignment that might be driven by who? We might start with, we might start with Rob and then move to everybody else to see what they think about it. A non-national based approach to merger analysis or, Chris, broader analysis of these sorts of enterprises.

NICHOLLS:
I think there’s the potential for having a globally coordinated approach. Even though, as you say, Kirsten, that you’ve got jurisdictionally specific legislation, there is the underlying rationale for why there needs to be a merger analysis and merger control is broadly common, at least amongst the OECD countries and almost all countries which have some form of competition law or antitrust laws. So the potential is there. One approach might be to use the leverage of the OECD, but I think the risk of using the OECD is who it excludes, rather than that the OECD isn’t the right place to do it. The OECD’s competition analysis, their support of competition regulators is great. But it is a formal international organization.
I actually think that the more likely way in which you’ll get at least de facto standardization, even if it’s not a formalized standardization, is through organized, I was going to say organizations like the International Competition Network, but there is no organization like the ICN, so I think the ICN has the potential for doing it. The issue there is the ICN can’t make rules. It can’t, but it can get to an approach where actually, if you look at most of the people, most of the competition authorities that engage in dawn raids, you’ll see that actually the learnings that they have, have been shared through the ICN, more than they have through the OECD or any other body. So, if there’s going to be a level of harmonization, having an informal body such as the ICN, seems to me a preferable approach. It will allow jurisdictionally specific legislative changes, if they’re required, without having the, “Well, we’re not going to do it because, just because the OECD says it’s a good idea.” So that actually sounds much more like a blockchain approach. The consensus that you can get through the ICN has the potential for leading to much more efficient outcomes, because the economic rationale can be agreed, but on an informal basis.

WEBB:
Sean, what do you think?

ENNIS:
Yeah, this is a tough question to come. Just for you to know it before I answer, I worked at the OECD for a long number of years, so I’ve thought about this from that perspective, also. Just quickly for Rob, the OECD has bodies associated with it that don’t have exactly the same members as the OECD and the OECD competition committee has an association status, which is equivalent to membership of that committee. So, there are ways that it can work. There are ways that WTO could potentially do something that’s very different from its current process as well.
I think if you really want to have a guarantee of consistency, you do need something more than promises of cooperation. You need an enforcement mechanism that would somehow have laws and procedures that were uniform everywhere. That would be a suggestion that you might want to have some global powers.
On the other hand, I think if you look at digital markets, in particular, there may, there is an argument that remedies can be much more easily customized to particular geographic areas in the digital space than for other types of products. Just as one example, it’s not a merger example, but if you want to disenroll from a service that you’ve signed up to, that’s being provided over the internet, if you’re in California, you can do that often, much more easily than elsewhere.
One of the reasons is that there is a specific law in California that makes the companies have a better process of disenrollment, and that’s the type of thing to think about on the national side. Another one is that if you have national remedies, you don’t move the whole world towards one specific outcome, which might not actually be the best one. You have much more opportunity for experimentation and discovery among regulators before you move, and then perhaps some evidence gathering, before you move to perhaps a common view of what the best outcome is.

WEBB:
John, what do you think?

YUN:
This actually reminds me of when I was growing up in Savannah, Georgia. My science teacher said, “Oh, you better get ready, we’re moving away from this Crown English system to the metric system. It’s going to be outdated and we need to harmonize and science has been held back by this dual system.” Well, here we are today, we’re still in pounds and feet and inches and all that and we seem to be getting by and certainly language is another thing.
I know those are quite different, but, ultimately I do think there is value in having different differentiated jurisdictions trying to get at the right answer. I know there are problems as well, but I think a lot of learning can be developed from each sort of system that’s out there.
I do think that there are problems with harmonization because if you’re a company, they’re not so excited about the marketplace of ideas and all these different rules. It might be intellectually stimulating, but as a practical matter, getting a deal through across all these jurisdictions, or defending a practice in multiple jurisdictions is exhausting and it’s costly and it’s resource intensive.
So, initiatives that Rob and Sean mentioned, the OECD, ICN, I think those are important. How important should they be? Those are obviously different questions. But I do like those initiatives, I do like the sharing of ideas. I do think that there is some sympathy that we should have towards moving to some harmonization. I don’t know how, I haven’t thought about that problem deeply, but I’m certainly open to the thought that we do need better harmonization.

BERG:
Also the politics of this is quite difficult, so it’s interesting viewing this from an Australian perspective. In Australia, there’s a move, certainly on some sides of politics, to assert a sovereign control over the large tech giants. So there’s this drive and we got this from the requirement that Google fund newspapers and Facebook fund news outlets and so forth, but more generally there’s this idea that for things that affect Australians, we should be able to have Australian public policy makers make those choices.
Now that’s all well and good and that sounds really wonderful if you’re an Australian policymaker and maybe it sounds great as an Australian consumer, but often it looks almost comical in practice. I’m thinking particularly of the ACCC, Australia’s competition policy regulator, trying to impose its supervision over Google’s acquisition of Fitbit.
Fitbit, an American company, Google or Alphabet, an American company, and the ACCC was trying to hold it up and check that it was okay under Australian law before it went through. This has got a very much sort of a “we warn the czar” type vibe to it in Australia, and it just really emphasizes to me how in these globalized markets…
Yes, it might not be possible to harmonize competition policy, and we might not want that as intellectuals interested in seeing discovery and innovation in this space, but at the same time, it looks kind of silly in practice if all these sovereign nations are trying to impose their own individual sovereign regulatory frameworks over tech mergers.

WEBB:
Thanks very much, Chris. Well, we only have a couple of minutes left. We could continue this conversation for a really long time, obviously.
I’d like to invite each of our panelists to make some, whatever closing remarks they’d like to make. Might go back to alphabetical, but reverse, so might start with you, Rob.

NICHOLLS:
I think the key message that I have is the one that I’ve made before. It’s really important in any changes to merger control which are looking to be sector specific within the digital economy relating to a small number of businesses within that digital economy, to be certain that any changes don’t stifle innovation. Innovation in the digital economy is the driver of innovation and the driver of productivity in national economies.

WEBB:
Sean?

ENNIS:
I would just say that I think a lot of tools do exist for competition authorities to deal with digital deals. There’s a question of how large one has to be as a country in order to successfully address some of the international deals and to not to be ignored. But I think there’s a lot of opportunity for behavioral remedies that could be reasonable on a national level. The tools are there. They can look at in a very fact specific way at deals. I think some of the deals people talk about were ones that one might’ve been concerned about at the time with the right facts. Just what matters for me is having the appropriate process and a fair ability of both firms and make sure the regulators or competition authorities get the right information and have an opportunity to input before there’s any final decision.

WEBB:
John?

YUN:
My final theme is really that we need to be focused on dynamic incentives rather than static ones. I think this harkens on what Rob said in that innovation is the key driver of wealth in societies. This view that we need to look for short run gains, which I think we often fall into a trap of, and it gets heavily regulatory. It gets to be breaking up companies and various things like that. We need to really look into the dynamic incentive effects of these various policies, and I think that will drive us into the right direction.

WEBB:
And Chris, the final word.

BERG:
Completely agree with all that’s been said. The only thing I would add is that we’re innovating at such a rapid pace, not just on the types of things that we do in the digital economy, but also in the way that we organize economic exchange. We know this. We have now spent the better part of a decade or more understanding and being involved in the gig economy. These restructures of corporate organizations. Looking at the technologies that are coming through and the technologies that we’re going to be considering over the next decade or so, that restructuring of economic organization is just going to become more and more evident and more and more significant, and it’s going to force, I think, a rethink of what do we mean by consumer harm, what do we mean by market dominance when we look at it from a regulatory perspective.

WEBB:
Thanks very much.
Well, thank you all for such an interesting discussion. We’re going to have to leave it there, we’ve reached our hour. A whole lot of interesting ideas and thoughts that can be further developed. A discussion that could go on for a very long time, but we’re going to call it a day now. So thank you very much to each of our panelists.
Thank you. ",Google
739,"January 24, 2022",Big Tech’s Three Biggest Regulatory Threats,"


By PYMNTS
When the Senate Judiciary Committee voted last Thursday to advance the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bipartisan antitrust bill, it set the path for the bill to potentially be adopted by the full Senate. While this is probably the biggest regulatory threat for Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta right now, there are two other bills that may have a significant impact on Big Tech: the Open App Market Act and the Digital Markets Act in Europe. Other regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and Europe also represent a regulatory threat. Here’s a breakdown of the top regulatory threats to Big Tech.
United States Senate — American Innovation and Choice Online Act 
This bill aims at preventing Big Tech firms from favoring their own services over others. This bill would make it unlawful to unfairly preference a platform’s own products, services or lines of businesses over those of another business user and to limit the ability of another business user’s products or services to compete on the platform. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 16-6 to advance the bill, but before it reaches the senate floor for a vote, it will likely be amended. The bill was already amended before the committee vote to ensure that it would be applicable to non-U.S. firms like TikTok. Senators have already offered over 100 amendments, and these will need to be discussed before a vote.

740,"January 24, 2022",The ACCC’s Ongoing Digital Platforms Inquiry: Choice Screens and the ACCC’s Plan for an Ex Ante Regime for Digital Platforms,"
By Jacqueline Downes & Melissa Camp1
 
I. Introduction
This piece builds on our previous articles2 covering the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (“ACCC”) examination of developments in digital platforms through its ongoing Digital Platforms Services Inquiry 2020-2025 (“DPSI”).3 The DPSI follows the ACCC’s original Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (“DPI Final Report”), released in July 2019.4 Under the terms of reference for the DPSI, the ACCC must provide the Treasurer with an interim report on the inquiry every six months until the inquiry concludes. A final report will be provided to the Treasurer by 31 March 2025.5 The services which the ACCC may hold inquiries in relation to including digital platform services, as well as digital advertising services and data services provided by digital platform service providers.6 The terms of reference define digital platform services as search engines, social media, online private messaging services, digital content aggregation platforms, media referral services, and electronic marketplaces.7
Our previous work considered the ACCC’s findings in its second DPSI interim report on app stores (“App Stores Report”),8 as well as the key concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper and public submissions for the third DPSI interim report covering choice screens in search services and default browsers (“Browser and Search Issues Paper”).9
The ACCC has also announced its intention to consult on a broader ex ante regulatory framework as the focus of its fifth DPSI interim report (to be released in September 2022).10 As part of this DPSI the ACCC will examine whether there is a need for sector-specific regulation to address the issues identified by the ACCC in the course of the DPSI and its concurrent Digital Advertising Services Inquiry (DASI”).11
This article summarises the key findings released by the ACCC in its third DPSI interim report on the effectiveness of choice screens in addressing the impact of pre-installation and default arrangements on competition and consumer choice related to the supply of web browsers and general search services.12
 
II. Third Interim Report Regarding Browser and Search Services
The focus of the ACCC’s Browser and Search Report (released October 28, 2021) was on pre-installation and default arrangements in the supply of web browsers and general search services. The ACCC’s report is centered around two key issues: how vertical integration of operating systems, web browsers and search engines limits competition in the supply of search engine services, and how that limited competition may harm consumers.
The ACCC’s decision to focus on these issues for its third DPSI report follows its recommendation in the June 2019 DPI Final Report. There, the ACCC recommended that Google introduce a choice screen for Australian Android users similar to the choice screen rolled out to existing Android users in Europe.13 Following the release of the DPI Final Report, the Federal Government directed the ACCC to monitor the rollout of the Android choice screen in Europe and report back in 2021.14 The ACCC’s Browser and Search Report revisits this recommendation and provides advice to the Government on Google’s rollout of a search engine choice screen on new Android devices in Europe. In particular, the ACCC advised against implementing a choice screen in Australia that is similar to that in Europe, instead recommending that consultation with industry participants and consumers should be undertaken to ensure the efficacy of any choice screen introduced in Australia. The ACCC’s recommendations are discussed in more detail below.
The key concern expressed by respondents to the Browser and Search Issues Paper relates to the role of scale in driving network effects in search services and web browsers, and how a choice screen may address those impacts. Another key concern expressed by respondents is potential consumer harms flowing from pre-installation and default settings in relation to web browsers and search services on consumer devices. This part of the article will focus on these concerns.
 A. The Issues Paper and Submissions in Response
To inform the Browser and Search Report, the ACCC released the ‘Choice Screen Issues Paper’ seeking feedback from interested stakeholders to understand several key issues, including:

how pre-installation or default settings can impact competition and consumer choice in the supply of web browsers and search services;15
the effectiveness of the rollout of choice screens in Europe;16 and
whether there was another form of intervention that may be implemented together with, or instead of choice screens that may facilitate competition and improve consumer choice. Examples include: restrictions on search services acquiring default positions, a requirement for Google to share click and query data with third-party search services, and mandating that Google and Bing provide syndicated search results on fair and reasonable terms.17

The ACCC received a number of submissions in response to the Browser and Search Issues Paper.18 The submissions contained a number of key themes, including the role of scale in driving network effects in search services and web browsers, the efficacy of choice screens in other jurisdictions, and potential additional regulatory tools that the ACCC should consider introducing to promote competition in search services and web browsers. A detailed summary of the submissions responding to the Browser and Search Issues Paper can be found in our previous article.19
 B. The ACCC’s Findings 
The ACCC made a number of important findings which appeared broadly consistent with concerns expressed by stakeholders.
Competition Assessment and Market Power
The Browser and Search Report focuses on the market for the supply of search engine services in Australia, and its interplay with the market for the supply of search engine services with the market for supply of browser services and mobile operating systems in Australia. The ACCC considered that the key avenues for consumers to access search engine services is through browsers on mobile and desktop devices, or through search access points like apps or widgets on mobile operating systems.20
Currently, the markets for the supply of browser services and mobile operating systems are concentrated between Google (through its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system) and Apple (through its Safari browser and Apple iOS mobile operating system).21 Google occupied the position of pre-set default search engine on the majority of web browsers and other search access points on mobile operating systems. The Browser and Search Report considered that Google’s position as the pre-set default search engine on the majority of web browsers and search access points was due to its:

vertical integration with Google Chrome and the Android operating system;
commercial arrangements with competing web browsers including Apple Safari; and
commercial arrangements with other OEMs that use the Android operating system.

The ACCC found that when considered cumulatively, Google’s vertical integration and commercial arrangements resulted in a limited ability for rival search engines to gain access to consumers through default arrangements with browsers or OEMs. In addition to its findings outlined above, the ACCC built on its previous findings in its DPI Final Report, DPSI First Interim Report on search engine services and the DPSI Second Interim Report on the supply of mobile operating systems and mobile app distribution to support its finding that Google is able to leverage its dominant position across multiple markets to foreclose access to important search access points for rival search engines.22
The ACCC concluded that Google has ‘significant market power’ in the market for the supply of search engine services.23 Interestingly, the ACCC did not use the phrase ‘substantial market power’ in its findings, which is a threshold requirement for establishing whether a company has contravened Australia’s prohibition on misuses of market power.24 The ACCC took a similar approach in the App Stores Report where it concluded that Apple and Google each have ‘significant market power’ in the supply of mobile operating systems and mobile app distribution in Australia,25 but did not go so far as to conclude that they had ‘substantial market power’. It remains unclear whether the ACCC has sought to deliberately avoid using the language of the statutory prohibition in its DPSI findings to date.
Economies of Scale and Multi-sided Network Effects
The Browser and Search Report also assessed the how multi-sided nature of browser services and search engine services markets drive network effects. The ACCC considered that access to consumers is particularly important in these markets as they are subject to economies of scale and network effects.26 The Browser and Search Report found that the multi-sided nature of search markets drives cross-side network effects.27 This process occurs in a number of stages:

Vertical integration of web browsers and search engines together with commercial arrangements for default status at key search access points provide certain search services with access to a large consumer base.
The large scale of consumers on one side of the market attracts advertisers on the other side of the market as they generally receive a better return on their campaign investments.
The presence of a large number of advertisers then incentivizes browsers to set default general search services that monetize the best so that they are able to negotiate a share of the advertising revenue.

The Browser and Search Report also found that economies of scale increase the amount of data available to search engines, allowing their search algorithms to learn faster and generally provide better quality results to consumers.28 These cross-network effects demonstrate the importance of gaining access to consumers at key search access points on mobile operating systems and browsers as a mechanism to drive scale and compete effectively.
Impacts on Consumer Choice
In addition to its competition assessment, the Browser and Search Report focused heavily on the potential consumer harms posed by lack of competition in search services. The ACCC considered there may be benefits to pre-installation and default settings for consumers in some instances, however there were also issues with their implementation.29 In particular, the ACCC found that default bias and consumer inertia result in many consumers remaining with their pre-installed browser or default search engine as those consumers may face switching costs such as time taken to research alternative suppliers or learning how to switch to an alternative supplier.30
The Browser and Search Report also considered that information asymmetries between the suppliers of mobile operating systems, browsers and search engine services and consumers may also lead consumers to remain with their pre-installed browser or default search engine as they either lack the technical know-how to switch their browser and/or search engine, or are not aware of alternative suppliers to switch to.31 The ACCC considered that the result of this was a lack of meaningful choice for consumers about their browser or search engine, which may result in them remaining with services that offer weaker privacy protections or less innovative offerings than what may otherwise be available to that consumer.32
Choice Architecture and Dark Patterns
The Browser and Search Report also focused on the use of choice architecture (i.e. the design of the entirety of a display screen) and dark patterns (i.e. the design of user interfaces that appeals to certain behavioral biases) by mobile operating systems, browsers and search engine services to prevent consumer switching. The ACCC considered that choice architecture and dark patterns may impact individual autonomy and be used to limit consumer choice by suggesting consumers make certain choices or by obscuring available choices to make it difficult for consumers to exercise their choice.33
The Browser and Search Report is not the first time the ACCC has scrutinized choice architecture and dark patterns implemented in mobile operating systems, browsers and search engine services. In 2019, the ACCC commenced proceedings against Google alleging that it engaged in misleading conduct and made false or misleading representations to consumers for the way it presented information on its display regarding the collection, storage and use of users’ personal location data.34  The Federal Court of Australia found in favor of the ACCC.
Interestingly, at trial both the ACCC and Google relied heavily on expert evidence from economists specializing in behavioral economics to demonstrate how users’ behavioral biases impact the way consumers navigate through relevant device displays.35 The experts agreed that choice architecture can affect whether, how much and how carefully users will invest the effort to read and understand the content as well as affect the paths they will use to navigate through the screens.36
Effectiveness of the EU Android Choice Screen
Finally, the Browser and Search Report analyzed the efficacy of the EU Android choice screen since its introduction in March 2020. The ACCC considered that there was a lack of any notable impact of the EU Android choice screen on market concentration in the European or the UK general search markets as:

Google’s commercial arrangements with other OEMs that use the Android operating system result in the pre-installed Google widget remaining on the device even when a consumer selects an alternative search engine from the choice screen;
the choice screen currently only applies to new devices, meaning that Google retains its pre-installed default status on all existing Android devices;
the choice screen artificially limited the number of places on the choice screen to four, restricting the number of potential competitors to Google;
Google required competitor search services to participate in an auction and pay to be displayed on the second iteration of its choice screen; and
the use of nudges, negative choice architecture and dark patterns have limited consumer choice.

While the ACCC supported some of the features of the EU Android choice screen, it ultimately did not recommend that the Government roll out a similar choice screen in Australia. The ACCC instead considered that further consultation should be conducted to design and implement a more efficient choice screen in Australia. The details of this recommendation are set out below.
 C. The ACCC’s Recommendations
The ACCC proposed a range of regulatory solutions to address the issues identified in its Browser and Search Report.
Introduction of a Mandatory Choice Screen
In the Browser and Search Report, the ACCC reaffirmed its earlier recommendation from the DPI Final Report that Google introduce a choice screen in Australia, considering that a mandatory choice screen would address the impact of Google’s vertical integration and commercial arrangements outlined above. The ACCC considered that before the choice screen is introduced it should be subject to consultation with industry participants and consumers to ensure its efficacy.  While the ACCC only recommended that a choice screen be introduced on new and existing Android mobile devices, it recommended that it be empowered to mandate the implementation of a choice screen on other devices and operating systems in the future.
The ACCC showed support for certain choice screen features proposed by respondents to the Browser and Search Issues Paper, including:

applicability to both new and existing Android mobile devices;
ensuring the choices presented on the choice screen are in a randomized order to minimize the impact of the display on behavioral biases;
an introductory screen including a statement to make it clear that the selection of a search engine is not binding and can be changed at any time;
periodic display of the choice screen to provide consumers with an ongoing option to switch between search services; and
removal of any nudging or dark patterns that may adversely affect consumer choice.

Search Sector-specific Regulation
Importantly, the ACCC recommended that it be given the power to implement sector-specific regulation beyond choice screens as required to address consumer harms and facilitate competition in search services. The ACCC considered that these measures would apply to a search engine provider who meets certain criteria and could include:

restrictions on tying and bundling search services with other goods or services (e.g. web browser or operating system);
paying for certain default positions;
requirement to provide access to click-and-query data to competing search engines; or
requirement to provide syndicated search results to competing search engines on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

Digital Platform Markets Regulation
The ACCC notes the similarity of the issues raised in the Browser and Search Report with the issues identified by it across the DPI Final Report, previous DPSI interim reports on online search, social media and app marketplaces, and Digital Advertising Services Inquiry Final Report on digital advertising technology markets. The ACCC stated its intention to commence consultation on a broader regulatory framework to address issues across digital platform markets in early 2022 as part of the DPSI. The introduction of digital platform-specific rules would align Australia with other countries that have introduced, or are planning to introduce, digital platform-specific regulation.
 D. What to Expect from the ACCC
As outlined in Part I above, the ACCC has signaled its intention to commence consultation on a broader regulatory framework to address issues across digital platform markets in early 2022 as part of the DPSI. The ACCC has announced that it will release a concepts paper in early 2022, which is likely to draw on elements from similar regulatory frameworks being proposed by international competition authorities. The introduction of digital platform-specific rules would align Australia with other countries that have introduced, or are planning to introduce, digital platform-specific regulation including the European Union’s Digital Markets Act,37 United Kingdom’s Pro-competition regime for digital markets,38 and the United States’ American Choice and Innovation Online Act.39

Big tech’s smart devices may need European Union rules if antitrust probes can’t tackle “systemic” problems on how they may gather data and lock in users, EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager warned.
According to Bloomberg, regulators have concerns about the so-called internet of things after wrapping up a sweeping antitrust inquiry into voice assistants like Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and Apple Inc.’s Siri, she said at a speech in Prague on Monday. An EU report highlighted potential issues with how devices work together, how they gather data and how companies’ practices may keep users within their own product range.
“If we see that things are systemic, this is not enough to find it and fine it and punish it one place when it’s everywhere, then of course, we need to do more. We need to call upon regulation,” Vestager said.
EU antitrust probes of Meta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet Inc. unit Google are “quite advanced” Vestager also said. They are still at an earlier stage compared to other investigations into Apple and Amazon, she said.
The EU is currently in the final stages of discussing wide new rules to curb big tech power, that could also hit voice assistants.
“The goal of the Digital Markets Act is really simple: Keep markets open, contestable for every business out there. And the way to do it is to stop gatekeepers from misusing that enormous power,” she said.

On Thursday, January 20, the US Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would bar tech giants like Amazon and Google from giving preference to their own businesses on their websites, reported Reuters. The biggest technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, have been under pressure in Congress because of allegations they abused their outsized market power. A long list of bills are aimed at reining them in, none of which have become law.
Lawmakers voted on an amended version of a bill introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, a Republican, that expanded the definition of companies covered by the bill to include firms like the popular video app TikTok and specified that companies were not required to share data with firms that the US government considers national security risks.

Klobuchar, chair of the panel’s antitrust panel, noted the deep-pocketed lobbying against the measure.
“We have a lot of support for this bill. We don’t have a lot of money to run TV ads in favor of it like those that oppose it, but we have a lot of support,” she said.
A second bill, led by US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, was on the schedule but was held over. The Open App Markets Act would bar big app stores, like Apple, from requiring app providers to use their payment system and prohibit them from punishing apps that offer different prices through another app store or payment system.
Both bills have a version in the US House of Representatives.

The European Parliament on Thursday, January 20, signed off on a proposal for new rules aimed at US tech giants, paving the way for talks on the plan with member countries and the European Commission, reported Reuters.
The Digital Services Act, a proposal from EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, would force Amazon , Apple, Alphabet unit Google, and Facebook owner Meta to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms or risk fines up to 6% of global turnover.
Vestager’s proposal still needs to be ironed out with EU countries and lawmakers before it can become law, the first of its kind in the world.
The European Parliament adopted the proposal with 530 votes in favor, 78 against, and 80 abstentions. “With a huge majority, the European Parliament adopted the Digital Services Act. A big win, with support from left to right,” Dutch lawmaker Paul Tang wrote on Twitter.

A technology-focused antitrust bill set to be considered by a US Senate committee Thursday, January 20, will be expanded to include China’s two largest social media companies , reported Bloomberg.
The bill’s criteria for a covered platform will be expanded to include companies that have 1 billion worldwide monthly users or US$550 billion in net annual sales, in addition to the existing US$550 billion market capitalization-threshold. These new criteria would capture ByteDance’s TikTok and Tencent’s WeChat.
TikTok is ByteDance’s most popular global service, and has captivated teenagers from the US to Southeast Asia, while Tencent’s WeChat is the go-to lifestyle, payments, and social media platform for upwards of a billion people — mostly in China.
The legislation, which would prohibit so-called gatekeeper companies from giving an advantage to their own products on their platforms, already applies to Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
The US technology giants have warned that the bill would place burdensome restrictions on American innovation, risk user privacy, and security by opening some platform functions to competitors and damage products that are popular with consumers.

Microsoft’s US$69 billion deal to buy video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard is expected to win out with regulators despite vows in Europe and the US to rein in tech titans, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Analysts interviewed by AFP after the merger plan was announced on Tuesday, January 18, said the deal would certainly be scrutinized, but likely less intensely than would an acquisition by Amazon, Google, or Facebook-parent Meta.
“From a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other tech stalwarts,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella “saw a window to make a major bet on consumer while others are caught in the regulatory spotlight and could not go after an asset like this,” Ives added.
The analyst noted that there are bound to be some “speed bumps navigating both the Beltway and Brussels” given the epic size of the deal.

In this paper we consider the proposals in the UK for regulation of the most powerful digital firms. We examine some key areas of debate and possible trade-offs that must be considered in setting up and implementing such a regime. This includes: the test for deciding which firms are within scope of the regime; whether the rules imposed by the regulator should be common across all regulated firms or bespoke; and whether and how efficiencies should be considered.

I. THE UK LANDSCAPE
Digital markets are unquestionably a hot topic in competition policy globally. In the UK, the CMA has a wide-ranging portfolio of work in the digital space,2 reflecting its stated priority to foster effective competition in digital markets.3 This includes: a market study into mobile ecosystems;4 open Competition Act investigations into Google,5 Apple,6 and Facebook;7 and a range of consumer enforcement work.8] The CMA’s Merger Assessment Guidelines were also recently updated, in part to ensure that mergers involving digital technologies would be properly assessed.9 The CMA’s Data, Technology and Analytics (“DaTA”) team continues to grow, improving the authority’s ability to understand and assess digital markets, and engaging in important research such as recent work on how the use (and misuse) of algorithms can reduce competition in digital markets and harm consumers.10
This portfolio of work is designed to use the CMA’s existi...

747,"January 18, 2022",Is Loss of Privacy the Price that Consumers Pay for Otherwise Free Online Services?,"
One of the consumer harms from monopoly online platforms commentators point to is the loss of privacy. That is, privacy is a dimension over which platforms complete, and lack of competition has generated low levels of privacy. However, some view serious difficulties in bringing actions when the anticompetitive effect relate to quality instead of price. Thus, some commentators have argued that loss of privacy should be thought of as a price that consumers pay for otherwise free services. Here I argue that the difficulties in analyzing competition over quality are likely easier to overcome than most think. I show that at the profit-maximizing level of privacy consumers will generally prefer more privacy to less even with the worse advertising matches that would result. I also show in the merger context how to quantify the anticompetitive effects in quality without the need to specifically measure quality.

I. INTRODUCTION
The intersection of online privacy policy and antitrust enforcement has received significant attention recently. Commentators approach the subject from at least three different angles. For some, concerns over privacy should play no part in the enforcement of competition laws. For those commentators, if anything, privacy concerns are primarily consumer protection problem rather than the purview of competition laws.2
Another group of commentators see privacy as a potential concern of competition laws but see privacy as a dim...

748,"January 18, 2022","Data, Privacy, and Competition: Theories of Harm and Data Mobility","
The dynamics of competition in data-powered ecosystems are motivated by user-related network effects and centered around users. Incumbent platforms thus have incentives to build strategies to protect their market, aimed at shielding their user base from contestability by rivals. This includes users from related markets, which may serve as an entry point to the core market of the ecosystem, especially when related markets are data rich. Fostering contestability in ecosystems protected by data-driven network effects and switching costs is intrinsically linked to data portability and interoperability. In implementing such measures, there is scope to learn from past experience in financial services, as incumbents may have incentives to compromise the effectiveness of data mobility regulations.

749,"January 18, 2022",Limited Development of Big Tech Firms in Credit Activity: Lack of Incentives or Barrier to Entry?,"
The limited expansion of Big Tech into retail banking activities in the EU (and the U.S.) is, at first sight, a puzzle.  Big Tech can leverage certain advantages like network effects and control over entire ecosystems to expand and disrupt the retail banking sector. However, the evidence suggests that Big Tech has made limited advances outside of payment systems in the wealthier countries. We advance several explanations for this puzzle. As it turns out, the overhaul of the financial regulatory framework following the 2008 financial crisis has significantly reduced the profitability of retail banking. To survive and adapt, banks have had to increase their efficiency significantly, further reducing the market’s attractiveness for Big Tech. Despite this, Big Techs have likely exerted a beneficial competitive constraint on incumbent banks. This may have led to a period of innovation in retail banking and healthy competition without endangering financial stability. However, competition authorities and banking regulation must cooperate to ensure this balance is not disrupted, and barriers for Big Tech to expand into retail banking are not artificially raised.

750,"January 18, 2022",Steering Digital Markets Towards Development,"
Following a preliminary scoping of South Africa’s digital economy, the South African Competition Commission (“CCSA”) launched its market inquiry into digital markets earlier this year. The purpose of the inquiry is to optimize market conditions for the growth of small businesses and firms owned by historically disadvantaged persons, given the high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality prevailing in the South African economy. Similarly, the scope of the inquiry is limited to online intermediation platforms because of the impact of intermediation platforms on small businesses and firms owned by historically disadvantaged persons. So far, the inquiry has received 134 written submissions from market participants and heard 51 oral submissions to date. The CCSA launched the inquiry because international studies and domestic experience indicated that there were features of online intermediation platforms which could impede, restrict or distort competition between platforms (inter-platform competition) but also competition between business users on those platforms (intra-platform competition). The inquiry is looking to explore these features with a view to understanding market dynamics, recommending solutions and instituting further action where necessary.

This note discusses recent developments at the Brazilian Antitrust Authority – CADE – on handling digital markets and platform cases. It provides a brief view of official reports and jurisprudence, also bringing the perspective for the coming years. Despite the absence of institutional changes directed to digital markets, CADE undertook extensive efforts to properly assess such mergers and abuse of dominance cases. The results are visible and important given Brazil’s position as a developing economy. Considering the BRICS countries, CADE is an early adopter of the concepts and evolution is visible. On the other hand, abuse of dominance case analysis is still in earlier steps and divided in its legal standard. When discussing digital platform antitrust there are many global challenges with no simple answers. CADE is up to the task, with transparency and engagement with the antitrust community.

The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a joint effort to modernize antitrust enforcement, seeking comment on how the agencies can apply current law in cases against tech companies like Meta (parent company of Facebook) and Google, reported Reuters.
The announcement came at a joint press conference from FTC Chair Lina Khan and Justice Department Antitrust Chief Jonathan Kanter, who described the move as a wide-ranging enforcement modernization effort. While the announcement spans markets, it specifically questions how regulators should approach merger approval in digital markets, potentially setting new legal standards around data aggregation, interoperability, and market consolidation that can affect competition.
“The digital revolution has not only impacted the markets of tech but markets across our economy, many of which have been rebuilt from the inside out,” Kanter said during Tuesday’s press conference. “Just think about what happens when you check your weather forecast or purchase your morning coffee. In seconds, whether you see them or not, you interact with dozens of distinct services; many of these services have the ability to exploit and exercise market power.”
Tuesday’s announcement followed new plans in the Senate to push through a pair of bills targeting tech giants like Apple, Meta, and Google. The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to vote on the American Innovation and Choice Online and the Open App Markets Acts on Thursday — bills that would outlaw dominant platforms from abusing their market dominance, allow third-party app stores, and protect software sideloading.
“This step toward Judiciary Committee consideration shows strong bipartisan support for our Open App Markets Act — to stop Apple and Google from crushing competitors and undercutting consumers,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut) said. “Breaking the ironclad grip of these two behemoths on the multi-billion dollar app market is long overdue. This measure has solid momentum.”

Microsoft is buying “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history as global technology giants stake their claims to a virtual future, reported Reuters.
The all-cash deal announced by Microsoft on Tuesday, January 18, its biggest-ever acquisition, will bolster its firepower in the booming videogaming market where it takes on leaders Tencent and Sony.
It also represents the American multinational’s bet on the “metaverse,” virtual online worlds where people can work, play, and socialize, as many of its biggest competitors are already doing.
“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.
Microsoft’s offer of US$95 per share represents a premium of 45% to Activision’s Friday close. Its shares were up 27% at US$83.35 in early trading, still a steep discount to the offer price, reflecting concerns the deal could get stuck in regulators’ crosshairs.
Microsoft has so far avoided the type of scrutiny faced by Google and Facebook, but this deal, which would make it the world’s third largest gaming company, will put them on lawmakers’ radars, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard.
“Microsoft is already big in gaming,” he said.

Facebook must face antitrust litigation over its alleged advertising pact with Google and its alleged strategy of building a social media empire by deceiving users about its data privacy practices, a federal judge in California ruled.

Facebook has also been fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC lawsuit will be allowed to continue with its allegations of monopolization, rejecting Facebook’s dismissal requests.
The complaint also alleges Google manipulated its ad pricing tiers under a secret program called Project Bernanke that removed second-place bids on ad auctions. It allowed Google to pocket part of the difference between first and third-place bids while also harming publishers that rely on ad revenue and who could have made more from higher bids.
Under the agreement with Facebook, Google and Facebook illegally collaborated to decrease prices paid to publishers, cut out rival ad networks, and manipulate ad auctions operated by publishers, the complaint states.

Launching Tuesday, the Tech Oversight Project plans to bring “campaign-style” tactics to push lawmakers to pass competition legislation aimed at the tech industry. The project is primarily funded by the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic venture launched by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar that has called for greater regulation of the tech industry, and the advocacy arm of the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit organization led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has called for the breakup of the social network he helped create.
The project sees itself as a direct response to Big Tech-funded groups such as NetChoice and the Connected Commerce Council, which have been flooding social media feeds and email newsletters with ads defending the industry against regulation, reported the Washington Post.
“Our aim is to be a direct counterweight to those organizations that have been lobbying for the status quo for years,” said Sacha Haworth, the executive director of the Tech Oversight Project.
Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon over the past decade have significantly increased their lobbying forces in Washington as they fight a rising tide of scrutiny over privacy, competition and content moderation. Amazon spent approximately $18 million on lobbying in 2020, while Facebook spent a record-breaking $20 million.

On Thursday, January 13, the Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up a proposal to limit tech giants from prioritizing their own goods over rival products, signaling momentum for proponents of revamping antitrust laws in the new year, reported The Hill.
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act has bipartisan support, co-sponsored by Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) and Judiciary Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (Republican – Iowa).
Senators in support of the proposal say it would mitigate concerns critics have raised that tech giants, such as Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, have engaged in discriminatory behavior by preferencing their own goods and disadvantaging their rivals.
“For too long, tech giants have used their power to suppress their rivals, unfairly put their products first in their marketplaces, and force sellers on their platforms to buy more services from them in exchange for better placement on their site. This has hurt both small businesses and consumers,” Klobuchar said in a statement Monday announcing Thursday’s markup. “A broad, bipartisan group of our colleagues agree and have signed on to our legislation to implement common sense rules of the road for these platforms.”
The proposal is also co-sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (Republican – South Carolina), Richard Blumenthal (Democrat – Connecticut), John Kennedy (Republican – Louisiana), Cory Booker (Democrat – New Jersey), Cynthia Lummis (Republican – Wyoming), Mazie Hirono (Democrat – Hawaii), Mark Warner (Democrat – Virginia), Josh Hawley (Republican – Missouri) and Steve Daines (Republican – Montana).

757,"January 11, 2022",EU Turns The Screws On Big Tech Acquisitions,"


Dealmakers face a reckoning as antitrust regulators across Europe scrutinize the boom in mergers that could see them extract concessions or even block acquisitions, reported Bloomberg.
Those same authorities are wielding new powers or about to acquire fresh capabilities they could use to wrap companies like Apple or Amazon in a regulatory straitjacket that will bring real changes to how they operate.
Globally, companies struck US$5 trillion-plus of deals in 2021, nearly a trillion more than the previous record set in 2007, according to Bloomberg data. But regulators seem less impressed, according to lawyer Michele Davis, and are more inclined to see the downside rather than the benefits of rivals teaming up.
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office kicked off 2022 by ruling that Alphabet’s Google was of “paramount significance for competition.” This new classification makes it easier to act against the company and is weighing a similar ruling for Amazon, Apple, and Meta.
The European Union is also lining up new powers for early 2022 that would let it curb big tech under the planned Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act. The Competition and Market Authority’s Digital Markets Unit, also intended for debut early this year, aims to introduce “strategic market status” measures which would limit how internet giants can expand into new areas.

759,"January 9, 2022",Tech Giants Firms Face New EU Regulations For 2022,"


As the US Department of Justice (DOJ) seeks to end Google’s alleged monopoly of the search and ad sector with a lawsuit, Germany’s antitrust watchdog has initiated new steps to regulate the tech giant.
Bundeskartellamt, the German antitrust regulator, has ruled that Google, a division of Alphabet, has “paramount significance across markets.” The decision puts the tech company one step closer to more regulation or even an outright ban, reported PYMNTS.
Last year, an amendment to the German Competition Act passed that can further regulate or even prohibit firms that authorities allege engage in anti-competitive practices. While the ruling was not a surprise, given Google’s dominance, the agency had to take this first step before adopting further measures against the company.
While an outright prohibition of Google is unlikely, the latest step by the German government could lead regulators to implement the most stringent rules against Google or any large digital company found to engage in anti-competitive practices.
Google’s troubles were not just limited to Germany this week. France’s data regulator fined Google and Facebook for failing to make refusing cookies as easy as it is to accept them, a violation of the French Data Protection Act.

By John Kwoka & Tommaso Valletti1
 
I. Introduction
Many features of antitrust policy continue to reflect strongly held priors rather than good economics and evidence. For a recent example of this, one need look no further than the question of whether policy should view breaking up consummated mergers and dominant firms as a legitimate tool. We are routinely told that corporate breakups are impossible, or too costly and difficult, or counterproductive, and certainly unwise for competition agencies even to consider.
One might expect these arguments to be followed by examples of breakups that proved these points, that is, where breakups were unworkable or disastrous and ex post generally seen as unwise efforts by competition authorities. Paradoxically, the most common references in these discussions are to antitrust cases such as Standard Oil and AT&T. These are truly odd citations because both are considered successful breakups — not perfect, to be sure, but hardly the disasters that breakup opponents forewarn.
Moreover, the historical record includes many other examples of successful breakups by competition agencies. Some of these have been dominant firms, while others have involved consummated mergers. Regulators, too, in various countries have broken up hundreds of firms in major industries, including telecom, electricity, and rail, among others. Beyond that, each year companies themselves initiate almost as many divestitures as they do mergers, further demonstrating the feasibility of breakups. Notably, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and Toshiba have recently announced their plans to break up or spin off major units, following Exelon, Pfizer, and others earlier this year.
Breakups are, in short, not infeasible, not uncommon, and certainly not doomed to failure. To be clear, we are not advocating that any particular firm be broken up, let alone all firms that are large or have certain characteristics. Rather, we argue that competition agencies should view breakups as a viable and useful policy option under certain circumstances.
In this note we will explain the relevant framework for determining the right circumstances for a breakup to be an effective tool. We then evaluate breakups’ actual use in several different settings — the AT&T case among others as relevant examples — and draw from these experiences some lessons and principles that should guide their future use.
 
II. Designing Policy Toward Consummated Mergers and Dominant Firms
Although there has been considerable discussion about breaking up both dominant firms as well as consummated mergers, our discussion begins with the latter. One reason is that a focus on mergers highlights several key analytical issues raised by breakups as a policy tool. These include ex ante vs. ex post policy actions, prediction accuracy, and costs. A second reason is that a great deal of the tech companies’ size has in fact resulted from their merger activity. The five major tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft — have collectively acquired more than 1,000 companies over the past twenty years,2 and many of the competitive concerns surrounding these companies stem from conduct related to these acquisitions. We shall return to the issue of breaking up dominant firms later, but for now, we study merger breakups.
 A. Consummated Mergers
Merger enforcement has almost always been an exercise in prediction. The competition agency, alerted to a merger of some consequence, uses various quantitative and qualitative tools to predict the likely competitive effects of the merger if consummated. But evidence indicates that economic predictions of the outcomes of mergers are too often incorrect, erring systematically toward permissiveness.3 The reasons for the error rate lie with the limitations of economic analysis, which applies theoretical and empirical understanding to each new merger that may well differ from models or past experiences. The reasons for the systematic error favoring “clearance” (approval) of mergers are caution on the part of the competition agency together with a high judicial standard of proof that a merger is likely to be anticompetitive before prohibiting it.
But if ex ante predictions suffer from these unavoidable flaws and limitations, good policy design requires consideration of ex post intervention into those approved mergers that prove to be anticompetitive. Otherwise, erroneously permissive ex ante predictions amount to a permanent license to harm competition. Keys to any ex post policy are the incremental gains in information from observation of post-merger conduct and the relative costs associated with ex post policy action. In most cases, the incremental gains in information are self-evident. At some point, the merged firm will act in a manner that either confirms the original competitive concerns or makes clear that approval was the appropriate policy. This determination can be facilitated by a requirement that approved mergers file basic information on the key variables of concern with the competition agency for a reasonable period after the merger.
The other factor to be considered is the incremental cost of any ex post breakup. Some assert that challenge and prohibition to a proposed merger typically imposes few costs relative to breakup of a consummated merger, which is routinely said or at least implied to be prohibitive, and by itself a reason to avoid breaking up merged firms. There is scant evidence on this question, but what exists does not support that view. One of the few systematic investigations was completed by Bain & Company.4 It studied some forty self-initiated breakups and found one-time breakup costs averaging about 1 percent of revenues, mostly incurred in the year of the breakup and involving administrative expenses. Perhaps more to the point, Turnstall offers an insider’s account of the massive, court-mandated AT&T spinoff of its long-distance operation and breakup of its local service into seven geographical divisions.5 He concludes, “divestiture was accomplished in minimal time, with the least possible impact of the corporation’s constituencies, and with no major disruption in the nation’s telephone service.”6
These studies and experiences underscore two important points. First and foremost, though breakups do have costs, they obviously can be successfully managed. One database of U.S. enforcement actions against consummated mergers reports 41 post-closing divestitures since 2006.7 While most divestitures were completed shortly after consummation and perhaps therefore involved little additional cost, eleven occurred at least three years after closing and more likely after at least some integration. Second, as illustrated by the AT&T breakup, divestiture is facilitated by the existence of natural “fault lines” between a company’s stages and divisions. Mergers often leave similar fault lines between the merging entities. These represent obvious starting points for a competition agency to consider the scope of post-merger divestitures and breakups.
The Bain study focused on breakups that firms themselves decided to undertake. Although some issues are therefore different, these experiences make clear that breakups are entirely feasible and not prohibitively costly. Indeed, one study found a total of 1611 self-initiated breakups by Fortune 100 companies in the 1990s, a number more than two-thirds the number of acquisitions by these same companies during the same period.8
 B. Dominant Firms
Dominant firms that engage in anticompetitive actions raise issues that are in part similar and in part different from those above. As noted earlier, the major tech companies are in no small part constructs built up from large numbers of mergers and acquisitions, and many of the competitive concerns they raise are the result of these acquisitions. These competitive concerns involve matters such as self-preferencing, display bias, and misuse of competitive information. These could in principle be addressed by undoing the mergers using the same method as described above. That method involves identifying the fault lines between the businesses and uncoupling the pieces along those lines.9
Competition agencies have been reluctant to attempt to break up such firms. They have been wary of difficulties and hazards of doing so and of the consequences if a breakup proves unsuccessful. Some caution is appropriate, of course; in industries subject to tipping such as the tech industry, ex ante policy is all the more important in order to preserve any emerging competition. That said, optimal policy design makes clear why strict avoidance of breakups is both unwise and unnecessary. One reason already described is that there are many precedents and examples of successful breakups, while systematic contrary examples are rare. The other reason is that the alternatives commonly proposed to address anticompetitive activity by the dominant tech companies have proven themselves generally ineffective.
What are those alternatives? The basic alternative is a “rules and remedies” approach. This approach does not involve breakup or divestiture, or any structural change to the dominant company. Rather, it imposes rules on the company to prevent it from engaging in the specific anticompetitive conduct at issue. For example, it may instruct the firm to avoid biasing search results in its favor or require it to disclose information necessary to allow for viable competition. This approach, of course, is essentially the same as so-called conduct or behavioral remedies for anticompetitive mergers, with much the same rationale: if the specific offensive conduct can be prevented, structural reform is not necessary.
The problem with “rules and remedies” is that considerable experience now reveals the inherent flaws in this approach, and evidence makes clear its ineffectiveness. The fundamental problems are that (1) these rules and remedies instruct the firm to act against its own interests, that is, ordering it to engage in conduct that reduces its profit; (2) consequently, the firm is incentivized to seek to avoid, evade, or otherwise minimize the effect of the rule; and (3) the firm has advantages compared to the agency overseeing the remedy in terms of informational asymmetries, technology management, and pretextual advantages in succeeding in defeating the restraint.
Two examples serve to illustrate the point. The U.S. government settled its case against Microsoft with a conduct or behavioral remedy that sought to make it stop certain practices and to provide outside firms with certain protocols that would allow them to compete. With respect to the latter, the company immediately claimed it could not comply in the initial three-year time frame, then that it could not do so within five years. Each time, the court “blinked,” unable to assess the merits of Microsoft’s excuses, and extended the deadline for compliance. The necessary protocols were finally provided, albeit in not quite complete form, nearly a decade after the issues were decided and order put in place — and long after they were important for competition.10
In the EU, Google has long been under orders from the European Commission to open up its shopping site and, separately, to untie Google applications and services, such as its Play Store, distributed on Android devices with other Google applications such as its search engine.11 It has repeatedly delayed or undermined compliance, despite billions of euros in fines. As asserted above, these types of orders or remedies generally are ineffective since they basically instruct the firm to act against its own interest—indeed, to weaken its own creation. Such mandates are fundamentally at odds with the incentives of the company, so the company will predictably minimize or evade the intended constraint. And the information, technology, and tools to do so are very much in their hands.12
Faced with these factors, regulatory agencies have often employed structural changes to resolve otherwise intractable competitive problems. Dozens of electricity companies in the United States have undergone both vertical and horizontal breakups. In other countries, dozens of telecoms, hundreds of electricity companies, as well as railroads and other integrated infrastructure companies have been broken up. Regulators often first attempt to address the problems with rules and remedies, only to discover — for the reasons we have described — the futility of those efforts.
In light of this considerable experience and evidence demonstrating the lack of a viable alternative, we conclude that where the essential competitive problem with a company is its structure — in the sense that its anticompetitive behavior flows inexorably from that structure and is otherwise difficult if not impossible to prevent — it follows that the necessary solution likely lies in altering that structure. Efforts to address the competitive problems with these companies through rules and remedies is a deeply flawed strategy, one that may sound appealing because it avoids confronting the hard reality of a breakup, but one that has not worked and does not work. We have run that experiment and know how it comes out.
To be sure, the same structural remedy is probably not the solution for the core platform monopoly that lies at the heart of many tech companies. Fragmenting a platform natural monopoly will not likely produce competing platforms. Unless there is substantial differentiation among the resulting pieces (which can in fact happen), those pieces of the original platform will likely coalesce as network economies and tipping drive reconsolidation. Other measures instead of, or together with, a breakup are likely needed in this case.
 
III. Recommendations and Conclusions
The above analysis makes clear that firm breakups are quite realistic and, indeed, not unusual. In the case of consummated mergers, they represent an essential complement to ex ante policy based on inherently imperfect predictions. In the case of dominant tech companies, breakups address a crucial source of their growth and competitively problematic behavior. Experience with breakups of consummated mergers reveals a record of considerable success, whereas efforts to find alternatives to breakups in both cases — mergers and tech company conduct — have regularly failed.
In this setting breakups represent a viable and effective tool for competition agencies — not an entirely novel one, nor one that should be used automatically, but certainly not one to be avoided due to alleged but unsubstantiated concerns over costs or ineffectiveness.

Google’s dominance in digital advertising has in large part been the result of its acquiring DoubleClick, AdMob and other elements of the ad stack, with new extensions such as Fitbit.

761,"January 3, 2022",The European Union’s Big Policy Bet Against the Tech Giants,"
By: Philip Hanspach & Nicolas Petit (Oxford Business Law Blog)
At a roundtable in Brussels in May, NYU law Professor Harry First described the European Union’s proposed Digital Markets Act (DMA)—an ambitious regulatory proposal aimed at large platforms identified as ‘gatekeepers’—as ‘81 pages of dense, hard to understand language.’ He half-jokingly added, ‘it is written in English … I know it’s written in English … but it takes some work to go through.’ Professor First’s difficulties with the DMA text raise a simple question: beyond its stated ambition to improve ‘contestability’ and ‘fairness,’ what is the EU concretely trying to achieve in digital markets?
The answer lies in the fine print. According to the DMA, access to data is key to business success in the digital economy. The DMA’s prescriptions invite the idea that imposing data access, interoperability, and mobility obligations on ‘gatekeepers’ can improve rivalry, promote entry, and ultimately innovation. And requiring gatekeepers to silo their data can restore a level playing field with existing and new firms.
So far, so good. There is, indeed, some truth to the idea that ‘data is the new oil.’ But the directions taken in the DMA to implement this idea are based on implicit assumptions about the relationship between data and competition. Possible flaws in these assumptions could compromise the success of the DMA in delivering more ‘contestability’ and ‘fairness.’ They thus deserve to be made explicit and carefully reviewed.
The DMA’s Specific Rivalry Policy
The DMA embodies a specific approach to creating business rivalry through sectoral regulation. First, it wants to improve the competitive potential of ‘business users.’ Perhaps, the DMA believes that data sharing obligations can promote competition between gatekeepers and their business. Business users include sellers on Amazon, advertisers on Google and Facebook, and influencers (or their agencies) in the case of ‘online social networking services’ or ‘video sharing platforms’. Second, the weight of the DMA’s provisions leans towards a preference for disruption through substitutes. The DMA defines gatekeepers’ users in ‘core platform services’ (CPS) as the bottlenecks that rivalrous efforts should contest…

762,"January 3, 2022",U.S. Senate Self-Preferencing Bill Offers Perfect Recipe for Regulatory Overreach,"
By: Sam Bowman (Truth on The Market)
Even as delivery services work to ship all of those last-minute Christmas presents that consumers bought this season from digital platforms and other e-commerce sites, the U.S. House and Senate are contemplating Grinch-like legislation that looks to stop or limit how Big Tech companies can “self-preference” or “discriminate” on their platforms.
A platform “self-preferences” when it blends various services into the delivery of a given product in ways that third parties couldn’t do themselves. For example, Google self-preferences when it puts a Google Shopping box at the top of a Search page for Adidas sneakers. Amazon self-preferences when it offers its own AmazonBasics USB cables alongside those offered by Apple or Anker. Costco’s placement of its own Kirkland brand of paper towels on store shelves can also be a form of self-preferencing.
Such purportedly “discriminatory” behavior constitutes much of what platforms are designed to do. Virtually every platform that offers a suite of products and services will combine them in ways that users find helpful, even if competitors find it infuriating. It surely doesn’t help Yelp if Google Search users can see a Maps results box next to a search for showtimes at a local cinema. It doesn’t help other manufacturers of charging cables if Amazon sells a cheaper version under a brand that consumers trust. But do consumers really care about Yelp or Apple’s revenues, when all they want are relevant search results and less expensive products?
Until now, competition authorities have judged this type of conduct under the consumer welfare standard: does it hurt consumers in the long run, or does it help them? This test does seek to evaluate whether the conduct deprives consumers of choice by foreclosing rivals, which could ultimately allow the platform to exploit its customers. But it doesn’t treat harm to competitors—in the form of reduced traffic and profits for Yelp, for example—as a problem in and of itself.
“Non-discrimination” bills introduced this year in both the House and Senate aim to change that, but they would do so in ways that differ in important respects…

By: Fabian Ziermann (D’Kart)
First, what is eSports?
Electronic Sports, commonly known as eSports, represents the competitive playing of video games. eSports has developed over the last decade from a small extracurricular activity, pursued by a niche group of particularly talented players, into an entire industry. For instance, the most successful eSports game, Riot Games’s League of Legends (LoL) has entered the eSports scene only 10 years ago in 2011. What started with small tournaments now includes competitive leagues in all major regions of the world, including secondary leagues for talent development. Whilst eSports may be somewhat comparable to traditional sporting disciplines and as such may allow for the conclusion that eSports’ antitrust relevance stems only from the fact that EU competition law is increasingly active in the sporting sector (ISU, super league), this appearance is deceptive. 
eSports and modern antitrust – relevance? 
Whilst traditional sports are usually regulated by an external governing body which enforces an independent ruleset (e.g. UEFA for football), in eSports, due to the market structure, regulators are effectively unable to establish themselves. However, eSports is not just a sporting discipline that needs regulating, but an ecosystem designed to utilise network effects from several markets, to benefit the respective publisher. These network effects are a product of connecting multiple markets with the underlying eSports game. Both the weak presence of regulators and the winner-takes-all market structure of the eSports sector are attributable to the game publishers’ empowerment by IP law. 
Whereas football is not owned by any one party, eSports games and with that all related markets are controlled by the publisher holding the copyright for the respective game. This means that unlike modern gatekeepers, which “only” have a proprietary business model, for instance Google’s algorithms, in eSports the game publisher has an ownership interest in all markets built on the underlying game…

Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption is facing a new legal test. On Monday, lawyers representing the parent companies of four former minor-league teams (the Staten Island Yankees, Tri-City Valley Cats, Norwich Sea Unicorns, and Salem-Keizer Volcanoes) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court alleging MLB’s commissioner’s office of violating the Sherman Act.
Those four clubs had their affiliate status revoked as part of MLB’s overhauling of the minor leagues last year. That process saw 40 teams in all removed, reported CNBC. 
The complaint, filed by Weil, Gotshal & Manges, spans 33 pages. It states that MLB’s reorganization of the minors was a “naked, horizontal agreement to cement MLB’s dominance over all professional baseball.” 
The plaintiffs allege that the precedent of NCAA v. Alston bolsters their case in that SCOTUS refused to blindly provide special antitrust protection to a sports business. They argue this reasoning favors taking away baseball’s exemption.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Digital M&A: A Flat World or a Region-Specific Issue?. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Luke WOODWARD:
Well, welcome and good day to Dynamic Competition in Dynamic Markets: A Path Forward in the Asia Pacific Region. This is the fourth session in this program. There’s been three prior sessions covering developments across India, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia—and I’m sure I’m missing some places—which have had fantastic panelists and moderators on them.
Today we’re going to focus more into developments in Australia, and we’ve got a great lineup for that, and I’ll introduce them in a moment. Our particular focus today will be around developments and the administration of the merger regime in Australia, and some policy reform initiatives that have been put on the table by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Over the course of today, I think we should explore a range of kind of critical issues that are not just critical in Australia, but that we are seeing play out around the world.
Firstly, what are the sources of concern here in terms of digital transactions? Are digital platforms serial acquirers in a way that increases or entrenches market power? Are there examples of acquisitions which should not have been allowed to proceed? Are digital sector specific merger rules necessary or justified? And we’ll come back to some specific proposals from the ACCC. In that regard, are there good learnings from international proposals? And we’ll have the benefit to get some comparative assessment here, particularly from Joel, in particular, thinking about the UK proposals for bespoke merger control for acquisitions by digital platforms, and what may be the unintended consequences of strict merger controls on innovation. We’ll have the ability to get some real insight into the impact and the importance of innovation within a holistic competition assessment.
So let me introduce myself. I’m Luke Woodward, I’m a competition partner at Gilbert & Tobin in Australia. Then to our panelists, and we’ve got a great panel to explore these issues.
Firstly, if I could just introduce Tom Leuner. Tom is the Executive General Manager for Mergers, Exemptions and Digital. So he’s in exactly the right spot for this discussion. Tom there’s been no issue in kind of merger regulation control and policy development in this country in the last 20 years that Tom has been centrally involved in, but more important and particularly relevant to this discussion is that the ACCC and Tom are very well connected with the international policy debate around mergers. So I think we’ll get both very Australian specific reflections from Tom that will then connect into kind of where the broader debate is going.
Our next panelist is Jacqui Downes. Jacqui Downes is a Senior Competition Partner from Allens Linklater in Sydney, and she’s the national head of their practice in Australia. Jacqui has extensive experience in Competition Law, but particular experience in media and digital markets that I think allows her to bring a deep insight to this issue. And Jacqui will be able to give us, and to the broader audience, a perspective on policy developments and practical administration in Australia.
Then we welcome Joel Bamford. Joel, I think has just recently joined Fingleton Associates, but maybe a week or so ago, Joel was basically the head of mergers at the CMA where he was not just responsible for the case oversight, but actually policy initiatives as well. We’ll really particularly be turning to Joel to get some kind of comparative assessments of developments here in Australia.
And then lastly, and definitely not least, is Professor David Teece from the Haas Business School at Berkeley. I think we’ll turn to David in this discussion to really make sure that we’re thinking about these issues in the right way, that we’re carefully thinking about what’s important, particularly the challenges around driving innovation into the policy discussions as a central part of the discussion, not just as some hopeful outworking from competition policy, but a critical part to actually the analysis, and that will draw very much on David’s work in the 1990s and earlier in relation to the dynamic capabilities of firms and dynamic competition. And, David, there’s probably no time, I think, in the evolution of competition policy, where that work and those insights is probably more important.
I think we’ve got an excellent panel today. I thought it would be useful, just given the breadth of the audience, to maybe just set a little bit of the scene of what’s going on here in Australia in terms of just overview of competition law, administration, and policy development. So it’s a big question, but I’m going to pass over to you, Jacqui, to just set the scene and then we’ll dive in to some of the merger specific issues. So, Jacqui, if I could just pass to you.


Jacqueline DOWNES:
Thanks very much, Luke. And thank you for inviting me to speak at this webinar.
Australia has been at the forefront right at the very beginning of development in competition law and policy looking at digital issues. This started way back in 2017, when the ACCC kicked off a two year digital platform inquiry, a very broad ranging examination of the issues that are facing digital platforms in terms of competition law, and in particular, the impact on media in Australia. This was really one of the first start regulators globally to start a real in-depth look at these issues and certainly kick-started a wave of investigations and inquiries by regulators all around the world over the last four years.
The original report, the Digital Platform Report, or the DPI report, focused on the fact that digital search engines and social media platforms, as digital content aggregators, as well having a media and advertising markets. The report made a series of recommendations for reform, some of which have already been enacted, including the introduction of the news media bargaining code, really the world’s first, which has been largely successful. Even though it’s technically doesn’t apply to any of the platforms yet, the threat of that media bargaining code has been successful in achieving some fairly negotiated commercial agreements between the digital platforms and a number of news media businesses. Other proposals that were put forward at the time are in the process of further consultation, including amendments to privacy laws. The final report did introduce, or recommend, a number of other measures that haven’t yet been introduced, and these include changes to the merger laws to incorporate additional merger factors that target nascent acquisitions and advanced notification requirements by digital platforms. This has now been wrapped up in the merger proposals that the ACCC, the more broad-ranging merger proposals we’ll come to that the ACCC has recently announced.
Following that initial two year inquiry, the government directed the ACCC to undertake a broader five-year inquiry into digital markets, with reports delivered every six months. And this allows the ACCC to do a bit more of a deep dive into various segments of digital platforms. And there’ve been three interim reports in the digital platform service inquiry. First, there was one in relation to online private messaging services, search engines, and social media. The second was into app marketplaces, and the third in web browsers and search engines, including the effectiveness of choice screens. And the ACCC is due to deliver its forth interim report on online retail marketplaces in March next year.
The ACCC was also directed, following its initial inquiry, to take a targeted inquiry into digital advertising services, or ad tech. The final report in this inquiry was handed down in September, 2021, with the ACCC, again, making findings that digital platforms had market power, and that various measures would be needed to address market power issues in relation to those digital platforms, particularly in relation to issues around data and self-preferencing.
The ACCC has now announced that it will be conducting a much broader review of whether there’s a need for specific digital platform regulation throughout the course of next year. So each of the reports sets out a range of findings regarding market power and the conduct of various digital platforms and the resulting competition and consumer issues. It stated that these issues have been broadly similar in nature.
Other than the media bargaining code, I think the ACCC’s view is that many of these issues around self-preferencing, tying and bundling strategies, and strong network effects are broad across a range of platforms, a range of issues, including app stores and ad tech, use of social media, choice screens. The ACCC has indicated that this broader regulation may be necessary.
In terms of mergers, Rod Sims has also recently kicked off the debate and as part of the broader suite of merger reform,. He also proposed to introduce a digital platform-specific regime, and restated the recommendations that he made back in 2019 to introduce new merger factors, to address acquisitions of nascent competitors, and a mandatory notification regime. It’s also suggested, whilst there’s no data yet, there might be a specific test for our digital platforms in the acquisition of nascent competitors.
Outside of the ACCC inquiries, there’s also been a number of significant core proceedings commenced against digital platforms. One of the most significant cases here, as well as in the US, has been now brought by Epic Games against Apple, which will go to trial in 2022. In this case that the guidance it’s alleged that Apple misused its market power by removing the Epic’s app from the App Store after it offered consumers an alternative payment method. A number of other private litigations have been commenced against Facebook and Google as well, alleging misuse of market power. The ACCC has also taken action against Google and Facebook in relation to consumer law issues; for making false or misleading representations to consumers. So, you can see, it’s certainly been a very busy time in the digital platform space over the last four years. I’ll hand it back to you, Luke.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Jacqui.
I’m going to turn to you, Tom, just to give us a bit of an oversight of actually an overview of how mergers administration has been operating to date, and then we’ll talk really around some of those challenges and some of the transactions that you’ve been looking at, and then we’ll come back to kind of the policy reform space.
Just to note, I think that the Commission has actually looked at a number of digital transactions of some varying significance. Obviously there’s Google’s acquisition of Fitbit, that’s ongoing. There’s the media acquisition of the CRM supplier customer, that’s not been opposed. Salesforce’s acquisition of Slack Technologies, and Microsoft Corps’ acquisition of Neurons, also not opposed. And not wanting to put you on the spot, but presumably the Commission is considering, at least in some manner or other, Amazon’s acquisition of MGM Studios.
There’s kind of an active engagement with digital transactions. Tom, if I could just ask you how well do you think that’s going? How well do you think the ACCC can assess and analyze those transactions and the competition issues there? Do you think the issues you’ve been looking at are just global issues, or they’re Australia specific ones, or are there even kind of regional trends or issues that we should be thinking about? Over to you to, Tom.


Tom LEUNER:
Thank you, Luke. First of all, thank you to CPI for hosting this event. I should just say at the outset that any views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the ACCC.
The first point, and reflecting what you said, Luke, we are definitely looking at digital mergers much, much more closely than we ever used to. We did look at them from time to time and there was nothing stopping for us from looking at them more closely in the past, but we’ve certainly ramped up that focus on these matters and that mostly reflects the work during the digital platforms inquiry, which Jacqui mentioned before, which commenced in 2017 and finalized in 2019. That really highlighted the ACCC concerns about the passion of mergers over the years, and that we really needed to focus on these much more. These days we’re much more attuned to a variety of effects that might come about from a digital merger, so things like the impact of the acquisition of data and how that can cement positions of market power. We’re much more focused on network effects, the tipping of markets, but also just the fact that the future competitive constraint on a large digital platform or a large digital player that holds market power might be coming from someone who’s only in a related market at the moment and not necessarily competing with that player right now. This goes to the arguments about killer acquisitions, which I’m sure we’ve all heard a lot about.
The other effect that we’re really focusing on a lot is innovation; what is the impact of innovation on the market? Innovation by the target? Even innovation also by the acquirer. For example, you see the acquirer buying this business rather than innovating it. Now the problem with all of these issues is that they are extremely hard to predict. This isn’t like a market where you’ve got two manufacturers of widgets and you run your upwards pricing pressure model and determine the price impact and therefore determine whether there’s a substantial, less than in competition. The issues are much, much trickier, but I do feel like the ACCC has put itself in as best, as a good place as it can to analyze these issues, and partly it relates to that work on digital platforms that Jacqui took us through. We’ve got a large team now focused on digital platforms issues, and they’re producing those six monthly reports that Jacqui mentioned, and those staff embed themselves in the merger assessment team. And it’s not a fluke that the digital platforms branch is in the same division as the mergers branch at the ACCC. We work very closely together, and I think that connection really helps us analyze these digital issues. But the other really important factor that helps us analyze these deals is cooperation between agencies worldwide. Without that I think it would be a lot harder.
I’ve worked in merger regulation now on and off for around 20 years, and I’ve never seen cooperation between agencies to be as strong as it is now, but there’s also a much greater need for it right now. And that’s because, as we all know, these are very much global deals, and often the issues are common around the world. So we are often having weekly or even more frequent meetings between the merger assessment teams across the different jurisdictions. We have debates between the economists. We share data, we share documents, and I’ve seen, I’m not going to mention matters, but I’ve seen different regulators convince other regulators to adjust their approach. By all means, the ACCC has adjusted its approach in reaction to this coordination that happens between jurisdictions. So that’s a critical tool of the ACCC.
Luke, you asked about whether this is a local issue, regional issue, or global issue? Sometimes they’re local issues. Obviously, not every player is present in every market. There might be a situation where there’s a four to three merger around the world, but one of those players isn’t present in Australia, so in Australia, it’s a three to two merger.
I think we all know that in digital markets, the issues tend to be much more global. Although the ACCC works extremely closely with its peers in the regional area, it is worth highlighting that often the dynamics are quite different in some of our neighboring countries. So if you look at China, for example, the digital sector is entirely different to Australia. Even if you look at countries like Japan and South Korea, the dominant position of Google, isn’t the same as perhaps the position in Australia, so they might take a different approach on, for example, acquisitions by Google, because of that. So often some of the closest coordination can come with countries that are not necessarily in our region, but perhaps have a similar economy in a similar presence of the digital platforms. In particular, in recent years we’ve worked very closely with the UK, Europe, and US, and also New Zealand and other countries in our region as well.
Hopefully that gives you the snapshot you after, Luke, and back to you. Thanks.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Tom. It does, and it’s a really nice segue to come across to Joel.
And, Joel, to just get your kind of comparative assessment about some of those issues that Tom was talking about. And how, to the extent that you kind of see those resonating in your experiences at the CMA. Joel?


Joel BAMFORD:
Thanks, Luke. Excellent Tom. Thank you very much to the CPI for having me today.
I should clarify; I do still work with the CMA, and I look to for a few months, but I will be moving on. So while the opinions I express today, are my own rather than the CMA’s or Fingleton.
I think I wanted to pick up on a couple of points. The first is actually that Jacqui really nicely set out a journey that the ACCC has been on looking at how digital markets work, thinking about how you consider the different types of competition how that might occur. Then Tom talked through the merger space, and I think it’s fair to say we’ve been on a similar journey within the UK.
Back in March, 2019, we had a report from Jason Ferman called Unlocking Digital Competition. That was a report commissioned by our treasury, and it had a particular piece focusing on mergers. One of its points was around under enforcement in digital mergers, and also the types of theories of harm that you might look at. This speaks very much to what Tom has been talking about rather than that kind of narrow focus on current or kind of short-term future competition or a narrow focus on an individual market, actually looking further out into the future, thinking in the ways that digital markets interact in the way that market power can be used to essentially work within different markets and bring them together.
Following that, the CMA actually asked an economic consultancy, Leah, to do an ex post review of some of its digital mergers. Some are familiar to many commentators, things like Facebook, Instagram. And although that report didn’t focus on whether the answer that the CMA come with was correct, it did focus on the methods of investigation. Actually, it’s essentially the CMA being quite narrow in its focus, it had been narrow in the types of information the group requested. It’d be narrow in thinking about the different theories of harms and the way competition it might manifest itself in the future.
Then you go through a kind of a journey of cases, and these were cases which were done by the CMA, but also done by, for example, the USFTC or the USDOJ. We had the Illumina / PacBio, which is about DNA sequencing. The tech market. It’s got a very large incumbent and PacBio is a new company bringing in a very different technology, which the parties argue quite strongly didn’t compete, and were complements. It’s a familiar theme we hear in digital markets; we don’t compete with each other, we’re just complementary products, and actually we’re going to expand the use of those complementary products. We found a concern in that case, as did the FTC, and that started to evolutionize the thinking around internal documents and how companies think about their competitors and the other players in their market.
You move forward to April, 2020, and you look at Saber / Farelogix. Sabre is one of the big airline booking systems, there’s really kind of three players and Farelogix was this nascent competitor. It was coming in, it was offering something different, something new, and it was really kind of fragmenting the market into different, more innovative services. There we went to block that merger, the DOJ went to court and unfortunately lost, but we were appealed only on our jurisdiction, in the end, and not on our substantive analysis. So you came back to kind of research, both case research and general research.
You’ve got new cases coming through, and we’ve got a couple kind of outside of the merger-sphere we had our CMA’s digital advertising market study in June, 2020. We had a digital markets task force, which reported to the government on the way that you might think about digital regulation in December, 2020, and then this culminated from the mergers’ perspective and the task force putting through new policy ideas, which we’ll probably talk about later, but it also in the actual kind of day to day assessment of mergers relate to a new updated merger assessment guidelines being published in the UK in March, 2021. Those guidelines have a much stronger focus on dynamic competition, the loss of potential competition, and two-sided or multi-sided markets.
One of the points around there that I wanted to pick up is when we’re doing that assessment of dynamic competition, often people focus on the likelihood of entry, the likelihood of the event occurring, when it’s going to occur in the future. Just that end point. It’s really about, when are we going to get to that end point? What does that end point mean? One of the things we brought out in our merger assessment guidelines was the process of rivalry to get to the endpoint is just as important as the end point that you’re getting to. That rivalry along the way, that innovation, that kind of tit for tat, that driving each other to produce new products, is some of the most important competition that we can see in digital markets. Often, that kind of driving each other comes from those small firms that are bringing in something new that the big firms are fearing they’re seeing it as something that might come through later on. They might have much more wide ranging outcome, and so that competition is really driving the competition we see in those digital markets. The challenge we have with those, obviously, is uncertainty. Uncertainty on how that is going to relate to each other, and uncertainty on the final outcome.
The CMA has a two types of tests. Phase one, we look at a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition. And phase two, we looked at a balance of probabilities, more likely than not that the competition concern will occur. But, we’ve been very clear in our merger assessment guidelines that uncertainty doesn’t lead to clearance. We can’t just say, well, the world is uncertain. Therefore we must default to clearance. There’s always uncertainty about the outcome of an investment, the outcome of innovation efforts absent the merger, and including whether the investment is being made by merger firms would ultimately result in products or services being made available to customers. I come back to the outcome and the process to get to that outcome. But the uncertainty about the outcome of a dynamic competitive process, doesn’t preclude the CMA from assessing the impact of the merger on that dynamic process. A process of dynamic competition can increase the likelihood of new innovations or products being made available and therefore has economic value in the present, not just in the future.

WOODWARD:
Well, thank you very much, Joel. I think that’s going to tie in neatly into David.
But, David, if I could just frame that; I’ve been listening to Joel and to Tom, and I think the themes that are coming out of that are that transactions involving complementarity, potentially nascent, but not always nascent, uncertain overlap, and significant uncertainty. We get the theme of innovation. I’m not sure whether or not actually the innovation is driving the uncertainty, but that’s a kind of a critical part to that. So, I guess a two-part question, looking at the world as it is now, how well do you think the regulators are dealing with those issues and how do you think we should be thinking about those issues? David.


David TEECE:
I think the short answer is they’re not doing very well. The good news is they’re starting to look at these issues. The problem is they don’t have the right tools to look at the issues.
So let me back up. First of all, the fact that you’re talking about dynamic competition is a great delight to me because I’ve been saying for about 30 years that competition policy should focus primarily on dynamic competition, because it’s innovation which drives competition and most fiercest way, the rest of it is weak tea. But for 30 years, the agencies have been barking up the wrong tree and focusing on the wrong things, in my view. So, on one hand, I’m awfully delighted that now dynamic competition is coming front and center.
But, as Tom pointed out, once you get into this world of deep uncertainty, you have to recognize that things are very difficult to predict. And that’s being augmented by the fact that my profession, the economics profession, has been sitting on its hands for at least three decades around the concept of potential competition. Nothing has been written of any moment about potential competition for maybe even 50 years. We have Sylos Labini’s models of entry, conditions and so forth, but because we economists have turned a blind eye to the literature on capabilities, we don’t know anything. We can’t say much at all about potential competition. We’re just learning the language of business models, despite the fact there’s a literature out there that it’s almost three decades old on business models. So what I’m afraid of is the immense hubris that somehow rather, after sitting on one’s hands for 20 years, I got to come up to speed real fast and get it right in a world of deep uncertainty.
I’m fully in favor of focusing on these issues, and I think when you do focus on them, first of all, you have to recognize the following: these big tech companies compete like hell. The word monopoly gets thrown around, but the old notion of monopoly is that it’s an easy life. Well, I can pretty much assure you, it is not an easy life even if you’re a big tech firm, if you’re not very active in competing with each other, you’re going to lose the game. There’s no inexorable advantage anymore, and the quality of management and systems matters immensely.
First of all, we can’t even think about competition in the standard relevant market context, at least not easily. I think we need to be thinking in terms of ecosystem competition, and ecosystem to ecosystem competition, and we only have primitive understandings of these things. So we’re handicapped in that regard, but I do believe that progress is being made. I think that a lot more work has to be done before one can declare with any confidence that this more interventionist approach is going to do more good than it is going to do harm.
So that’s sort of my opening initial point here, which is great that we’re digging into this, but the problem is not as much with the law as I see it, and there’s great effort in Australia, I think, to change the law, but I’d change economics first. Change economics first. There’s a lot more flexibility inside the law than there is inside economic modeling right now, or at least traditional ways to think about things.
Also, it’s not just about platforms. Joel, I’m delighted that everyone is focusing on platforms, but most of them platforms tends to be blindsided or not paying sufficient attention to innovation. And it’s where economists go, because it’s something they know about. It’s not because it’s necessarily what they should be highlighting.
So in my view, we should school up, understand the innovation process, understand how organizations build capabilities. Only then will we be able to say whether blocking a merger, like with Giphy or even with Instagram or WhatsApp, it’s only then that we’ll be able to talk intelligently about those things. So I guess I’m not saying slow down, but I am saying be incredibly careful and be provisional about everything and put innovation first. When you put innovation first, the agencies have being saying, “Oh, innovation matters,” but they only see competition driving innovation, they don’t see the causation running the other way, which is innovation drives competition as assuredly, as competition drives innovation. So long as we have these half-assed approaches, we’re going to get it wrong, more likely than not. So that’s my deep concern.

WOODWARD:
Well, thanks very much, David. I think they’re important observations.
To move the discussion on now, I would like to turn to Tom to outline what the ACCC’s merger proposals are. I think there’s some significant challenges in the observations of David to thinking about merger administration and merger reform. So if in casting your remarks around your proposals, you think there’s an opportunity to kind of address some of the observations of David, please do so. Anyway, Tom, if you could just take us through what the ACCC is proposing in terms of merger reform. Over to you, Tom.

LEUNER:
Thank you, Luke.
What the ACCC has done is started to base on merger reform in Australia. Ultimately, the direction Australia takes on this will be up to the government and the treasury will advise the government as the policy agency, but we’ve put forward our own proposals, and those proposals relate to both process and the law. Currently we think both the process and the law and how the test is applied in the federal court are biased towards clearance. This is the problem we’re trying to fix.
Many of the audience might be aware that currently Australia’s merger approval system is entirely voluntary. There’s no obligation to notify the ACCC of any merger and any merger can proceed at any time. The only way the ACCC can stop that is to go to the federal court and seek an injunction. Although we’ve built up what we call the informal merger review over the years, it’s still in a sense voluntary, and people can proceed with the merger or threaten to proceed at any time.
We’re proposing a new system, which would be a formal, mandatory and suspensory notification system, so that parties would have to come to us with their merger proposals, and then we would assess them through a process that would be quite similar to various processes overseas. However, we are really keen to retain the benefits of what is currently called the pre-assessment system. You might be aware that over 90% of mergers in Australia are cleared through a pre-assessment approach at the moment, where we have a quick look at it, usually most just on the papers. Sometimes we make a few telephone calls, ask for a little bit of information. Usually within a matter of a couple of weeks, we clear those matters, and that applies to over 90% of them. We want to retain that benefit, that quick and efficient clearance system.
So for the mergers that are above the threshold under the new system, we would have a notification exemption process. You can apply for an exemption from having to notify. Now, the other key element of our proposals in relation to process are that appeals would be to the Australian Competition Tribunal. For those of you who are not aware, in Australia we have a tribunal that is made up of a judge, an economist, and a business person. We think they’re the best appeal body if the merger parties want to appeal a decision of the ACCC.
In summary, just some process, what we’re really doing is moving away from what is a very pure enforcement model for merger regulation where the ACCC has to dis-enforce that section of the act that says you can’t buy something if there’s a substantial lessening in competition towards an administrative decision making model. It would be quite a fundamental change to the Australian regime.
We’re also proposing changes to the merger test, and this is to deal with the challenges we’ve had with proving future events, to the required evidentiary standard before the federal court. Many of you will have heard about the court losses the ACCC has had on merger matters. One of the changes is that we’re proposing to define the word likely. At the moment, to be a breach it has to be a likely substantial lessening in competition, and we’re proposing to change or put in a definition for that so that it means a possibility that is not remote.
The other change we’re proposing is that there would be a deeming provision. So for acquisitions that entrench a position as substantial market power, they would be deemed to substantially less in competition. The thinking behind this is to try and bring the focus more towards the structural conditions for competition and take it away from having to prove the precise effects in terms of a substantial lessening of competition.
So there, at a higher level, are the main changes we’re proposing, and those would apply to all mergers if the ACCC got its way.
In relation to digital mergers, in essence, what we’ve done with digital mergers is say that we think there’s almost a bigger problem there that needs a separate solution, and we’ve pushed that issue into next year. We think there’s all kinds of issues that I mentioned before in relation to buying nascent competitors, the lack of notification of mergers and issues like this. Next year, we’re going to put out papers that put forward a potentially a new regime for merger tests in relation to digital mergers that might try and address these issues. There’ll be an issues paper around March, and then our concluded report with our recommendations in September next year.
This paper is part of and is tied into a broader look at the whole digital platform sector to assess where the new rules are required more broadly. As Jacqui mentioned at the start, the ACCC has been doing these six-monthly reports and did the ad tech report and the digital platforms inquiry a couple of years ago. Building on all of that work, where we have seen issues with market power and consumer harms as well, we’re going to assess whether we think new rules are needed to address those market power and consumer harm issues. We’re going to look at that merger idea, idea for digital specific merger rules in the context of that broader look at potential digital platform regulation.
I’ll just go quickly to David’s points before. I think, David, you were saying that it’s too early to sort of take a more interventionalist approach with mergers, but if we look at that decade from 2010 to 2020, the five main digital companies acquired over 500 companies during that period. Not a single one was opposed by an antitrust regulator, as I understand it. In my view, we actually need to move more quickly to really get our head around these issues and look at them closely. I can see there’s a range of views you can have, and maybe there’s this possibility of over enforcement, but my real concern is under enforcement. Thank you.

WOODWARD:
Thanks, Tom. I’m sure there’s something there for David to come back to, but Joel, I think again I’ll just pass to you to get your kind of comparative perspective from the same. I know the ACCC and CMA have been kind of working closely around merger reform issues. Over to you, Joel.

BAMFORD:
Thanks, Luke. I previously worked in New Zealand, and I’ve seen the Australian system up close and personal, shall we say, and Tom and I have discussed this over many years through the International Competition Network, which is a fantastic forum for the exchange of ideas in the way of doing things across agencies.
The UK system, it’s a voluntary administrative model, so it has the voluntary nature which Tom has discussed. But, when the CMA was born from the merger of two competition agencies into one, merged into a monopoly, the rules around the CMA’s ability to hold a company separate during the review were strengthened.
Those are enforceable ways. We fined Facebook last month, 50 million UK pounds for a breach of those rules during the Giphy case. They are there and they are particularly important in digital markets because we know the pace of change, and we know that when companies come together and all of the interactions and interweavings that occur, it becomes very difficult if you do have a concern at the end of a case to actually be able to unscramble the eggs. That regime for us, our interim measures, our initial enforcement orders, our interim orders, are very important, and they’re a strong corollary of having a voluntary system where companies are allowed to complete during investigation.
The other part of our processes is, as I said earlier, we have a phase one and a phase two, and they’re separate legal tests with separate decision makers.
The phase one is a decision maker such as myself, so a member of the staff team who would decide on whether there is a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition. If a concern is found, that case will be referred to an in-depth phase two investigation. That phase two will be decided by a panel of individuals who are independent of the CMA and independent of the government. They may have a competition law, competition economics, business, or other regulatory function background. There are generally somewhere between three to five individuals who make the decision at the end of the day, and they decide that on a balance of probabilities, or more likely than not, a test, as I discussed earlier.
We have an administrative model with different decision makers at phase one and phase two. So there’s a very strong set of independence for that phase two decision making body and that checks and balances and the lack of confirmation bias that you would get if you necessarily have the same individuals in that separation. We then have a Competition Appeals Tribunal, much to what Tom was talking about earlier. We can be appealed to those within four weeks of their final decision, but that appeal is on a judicial review standard; it’s not a full merit review. We’re not going back into court as such as you would do if you’d be in US or other agencies to go through all the details of the cases. Just whether the CMA was being flawed in a way it’s applied its process in the legal tests.
Again, we’ve had a number of appeals over the years. We’ve had cases where we have had parts of those cases were remitted to us. We’ve obviously had both successes as well, but that has been a strong counterpoint to the CMA in the last five years.
A couple of points I want to focus on. Luke, you’re very kind to forward me Gilbert & Tobin’s review of the ACCC’s piece that they’ve put forward. Having seen a number of the commentaries that came out at the time when Tom and Rob and others put forward the proposals, one of the key discussions, and I’ve seen this myself is in court cases, the reliance on business individuals’ testimony and the force of that testimony, and I have to say some of the things that I’ve read at least have been relatively concerning, and they’re concerning from an experience perspective.
The CMA has looked at a number of cases over the years. As you would expect, merging parties are highly incentivized to get their deal through. They’ve very good sets of advisors, as I’m sure they do in Australia. They put the strongest case that they can forward, as they should. But sometimes what we’ve heard around, for example, firms are flailing or failing, or just not going to succeed without this investment from this large incumbent or that idea that these are going to compete going forwards in that new innovation is going to come. That’s just fundamentally flawed. Some of those, I talked about two cases earlier and they actually quite nicely highlight this.
In Illumina / PacBio, PacBio was a small firm, and made a very strong case that without the purchase from Illumina, they would essentially go bust and they wouldn’t be able to develop. The acquisition price was 1.2 billion. That was back in, as I said, 2019, 2020. Their market cap right now is 4.7 billion. It seems a kind of a long way from a firm that’s essentially on its last leg.
The other point around that was, we had an interaction around what it would be, what would be the outcome if Illumina bought PacBio for the rest of the market? How would it affect others? We’ve talked about killer acquisitions, but there’s also a wealth of literature out on what is described as kills zones around firms and kills zones around technologies when they’re purchased by large incumbents.
In that case, there was a UK firm called Oxford Nanopore, which made strong representations on the merger. They too have thrived in the last couple of years, and their market cap is now at 5.8 billion. You can see that incredible growth within that market. We’re not talking here about platforms, and hopefully we’re not being half-assed in our approach, looking at the innovation that occurs here either, but we’ve seen the outcome there that actually by blocking that merger, we’ve seen the market thrive. This is a market which has been used extensively in the battle against COVID and that next generation sequencing that we’re seeing really come through.
The second one that I wanted to highlight was around Farelogix and Sabre. So at the time, and I’m going to use a couple of quotes here, it comes back to the idea of business people putting forward their precise views about what will happen in the future. We put forward that Farelogix was an innovator in a particular type of merchandising product, and that Sabre would need to respond to that innovation. And they would need to take that forward within the next five years. I’m going to quote from a piece of advocacy that came into us as a submission, and it said that, “The CMA expectation that absent transaction Sabre would develop a credible merchandising solution within the next three to five years and would become a uniquely strong competitor to Farelogix and Amadeus in merchandising is entirely fantastical and fundamentally flawed.”
That’s in February, 2020. After the deal was blocked, Farelogix was purchased by a private equity firm. They continue to thrive now. On an earnings call, the Sabre CEO, the same CEO that signed off that submission said the other piece of the innovation framework.
Again, this really does go into what we’re doing on the merchandising side. We’ll be able to share more with this, but this is essentially a Farelogix replacement and what was taking place there. We’ve gone from fundamentally flawed that entry could occur in three to five years to, and that was November, 2020, to within 12 months we are building a replacement because, unfortunately the Farelogix merger had been blocked. It’s just a highlight of some of those, shall we say, inconsistencies between the perception at the time and the outcome going forward. I think it means that, at least from my side, we really need to get into the evidence behind that. There’s been a huge concentration on valuation models, internal documents, and I think those are very probative in terms of your evidence based going forward, and the kind of advocacy based pieces from business testimony maybe have to be seen in a slightly different light.

WOODWARD:
Thanks, Joel. There’s quite a bit in that as well. There being just two things to kind of call out. I thought the decision-making framework in the CMA and the independence built in at different stages is quite interesting. I’ll just make one observation, which is that, in those difficult cases, when you’re in the facts, I just agree with you that’s a good policy basis to start sort of redesigning our merger regime.
I’ll leave you with one question: I think we all have kind of anecdotal experiences, but one needs to be a bit careful about policy reform would be an overall observation.
What I think I’ll do now is, Jacqui, I’ll just ask you to make some comments about the ACCC’s merger reform case and how well you think that’s made, and then, David, I’ll bring it back again to you to get some observations around this merger reform developments and whether we’re thinking about that also in the right way. So, Jacqui, if I could just go to you first.

DOWNES:
Thanks very much, Luke. I think it’s fair to say that I don’t believe the case for merger reform or the type of merger reform that the ACCC has put forward has been made out. I certainly appreciate some of the challenges in the digital platform context, and I’ll get to that in a moment, but in terms of the sort of broader issues of merger reform, which would apply to all businesses companies doing business in Australia and not just platforms, the Australian regime really does work well, and it has worked well for many, many years now.
The cases that Tom referred to the ACCC has lost in court have been a few in number, only half a dozen. By the ACCC’s own admission, many of those were at the margins in terms of, kind of testing the boundaries of the law, not clear cut cases which were blocked. The ACCC blocks a number of cases that don’t go anywhere near court. I feel I should say that the ACCC is a very vigorous enforcer and the Australian merger regime works well. The vast majority of mergers are notified to the ACCC. There may be a couple of anecdotal examples where that hasn’t happened or where mergers have completed prior to the ACCC finishing its review, but in the vast number of cases, parties are well aware that the ACCC is a vigorous enforcer. They do notify the ACCC and they do wait for the ACCC’s decision before pressing on with the merger. In those few cases, if that doesn’t happen, the ACCC does have powers to go to court and take injunctions and divestitures as well.
I also strongly believe that the court is the right place to properly test all the evidence, not the tribunal. Judges in our federal court are highly skilled in assessing evidence. Those concerns that Joel has raised as well as Tom around executives and what may or may not be believed, that can be put obviously to executives and judges are skilled at assessing evidence on both sides; the ACCC’s evidence and also the evidence of the merger parties.
In terms of the substantive test, our test is consistent with tests around the world; likely substantial lessening of competition. This has a long history of jurisprudence and is consistent with the overseas position. I have a strong concern about the change to the threshold for likely. I think this is way out of step with overseas approaches and really will tip the balance way in favor of blocking mergers and many mergers which should not be blocked in a healthy economy are likely to be blocked.
In terms of the sort of digital provisions, we haven’t seen a lot of the details yet as to what’s been proposed there. We know there’s some potential changes of merger factors, and I personally don’t have a particular concern about adding in some factors to make it clear that the court should consider the aggregation of data and the fact that this might be a nascent competitor. I think, though, if there are to be changes to the substantive tests for digital platforms, that causes more concern.
If all these merger reforms get up, there will then be three tests for mergers, which would make the Australian regime probably the most complicated regime in the world. There would be the substantial lessening of competition test, the deeming provision in the sort of digital platform test, a minefield for lawyers, but not so great for business and the economy.
And, Luke, in terms of David’s comments, if I can make a comment there, I thought I was going to disagree with David, but then it turns out, I think now we’re on the same page. Again, I think our merger processes are equipped to deal with digital platform reform, digital platform mergers. I accept that they raised complex questions and there are some evidentiary issues, but they are largely traditional questions around vertical, horizontal, conglomerate mergers, and I think the ACCC, and other regulators around the world today, have dealt with them very well.
I think some recent examples we’ve had in Australia with Salesforce and Slack acquisition, Measure and Customer, Microsoft and Nuance are examples. The ACCC took a hard look at some potential vertical and horizontal issues and cleared those mergers. And then we had other examples, for example, the Google Fitbit decision where the ACCC took a different view to the EU on the viability of undertakings, and also was looking at Meta Giphy, which is obviously being strongly opposed in the UK. I think there’s work to do, I agree. There’s education and learning to do and perhaps the economics can assist us, David, in understanding these mergers, but I don’t think it requires any change to the law.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, Jacqui.
David, I’ll turn to you with the last word I think, but you should give us a full, a sort of the full perspective on those observations. Some things I think would be particularly interesting to hear from what we have is a proposal to clearly reform the merger regime to address issues around uncertainty, so we can expect that a reformed merger regime would be applying and leading to blocking more transactions than now. That seems to be the essence of the proposal.
Then we have a proposal, or at least contemplation, for a sectoral specific regime for the digital sector. I’d be interested in your observations overall about the need for that in light of kind of your comment, that the issue is not so much the law, but the economics. Also, if we are moving into a policy reform space, as Tom was rightly pointing out, this is the ACCC calling out these issues, but ultimately there’ll be Treasury and other people who are doing, will have to take these issues forward. If we’re moving into that policy reform space, what are the kind of the key things that you think we should be really paying attention in that policy reform space? So, David, if I could just pass it to you.

TEECE:
Oh, well, thank you. These are all very interesting and important comments.
Tom, to begin with your first observation that we let too many mergers through, so therefore we’re going to right the wrong by maybe being too strict going forward. That really doesn’t make any sense to me. We should obviously correct what the flaws are if they’re really flaws, but to go from pillar to post is not good economics, as far as I’m concerned.
I think the real criteria is that you mentioned that we’ve got to move quickly. There has to be at least some reasonable emerging consensus in the scholarly literature if you’re going to get good policy, otherwise you’re going to have a very ad hoc system that’s unlikely to be evidence-based and is unlikely to be palatable in the longer term and could hurt not just innovation in Australia, but innovation worldwide. So there are a knock-on effects there as well.
Now, Joel quite rightly pointed out that well. Sometimes companies put forward advocacy positions that are not well balanced, and I know that occurs and I think there should be some accountability for that. If a company has a reputation of coming forward and overclaiming and the evidence builds, then that should be a part of the reputational damage. You should raise the bar a little bit higher, at least informally, against such companies. So the remedy is not to assume that whatever the company claims or whatever it is put forward is not fundamentally correct.
But let’s not just dwell on this issue. The elephant in the room here is that the enforcement agencies need a reasonable theory of potential competition. If they’re going to assess whether a merger is going to essentially nip in the bud, a potential competitor. Let’s be honest. There is no theory of potential competition in economics that’s of any use, so what’s happening is agencies are, in an ad hoc fashion, pitching together doing their best. Well, that’s not good enough. I know that economics professionals let you down, but I think it does speak to the need to focus on a number of things that agencies haven’t focused on in the past.
One is organizational capabilities. There’s a field called organizational economics, so it’s not like it’s a huge leap to get from market analysis to organizational analysis. As part of organizational analysis, you’ve got to get really, really sharp around business models and the viability of business models. This is going to require that the agencies actually take on some of the skillset that a venture capitalist has.
Now, the very fact that I’m saying that speaks to the difficulties and also the uncertainties that are here, and it should lead to a dialing back in hubris, I think. That you can actually get this stuff right all the time. I’m willing to forgive mistakes, both type one and type two mistakes here, because of deep uncertainty. To aim for precision is going to lead to regulation on top of regulation and probably lead to actually harming innovation in competition.
My plea here is for a number of things. One, let’s focus on a different set of criteria rather than the consumer welfare criteria. Let’s, as a proxy, use the merger: will it likely enhance or detract from the innovation in the ecosystem because it’s the health of the ecosystem, and in the long run it’s going to deliver benefits to consumers. So point one is focus on ecosystems.
Point two, put innovation first.
Point three, take a longer term view.
Point four is build a robust understanding of organizational capabilities, because otherwise you do not bring any apparatus other than your intuition to the business of merger assessment, if the issue is, are you buying a potential competitor? The other thing I think to bear in mind is to recognize that this is international; the actions of any individual agency have implications elsewhere. We didn’t talk much about big data, but there is some benefit from aggregating data, and there’s actually benefits, not just the consumer, but it enables AI systems to be tuned and to be better. There are global implications to all of this. The Western democracies need to stay ahead in AI, otherwise, there are certain existential threats.
I think competition policy has to begin to connect to industrial policy, technology policy, certainly questions around privacy have to also be taken into account. You need a more holistic approach. Certainly, China has a holistic approach to this stuff. Australia doesn’t seem to. The United States doesn’t seem to. We’re at the point where, I think, we’ve got to look with a wider lens at these issues. If we don’t, then I’m afraid not just for innovation, I’m afraid for not just the loss of innovation, I’m afraid of the loss of even criteria and values of even greater weight.
That’s my plea. Put innovation first, but recognize that innovation is a primary driver of competition. Recognize also that these big tech companies are spending more and more every year on R&D. If you look at where innovation is taking place and where R&D is being spent, these large companies are the primary driver, at least in the United States, for the increases in research and development expenditures. I think we really have to take a macro perspective and a micro perspective at the same time, if we’re going to have a chance of improving things rather than hurting them.

WOODWARD:
Thanks very much, David. I think that’s a good place to leave this discussion for now. We know that it’s going to continue on next year, that it’s a critical discussion. I think to put it within that broader context, I think is important. We’re not just talking about one particular transaction being approved or blocked. We need to think about the broader implications of our overall merger reform system, and I know the ACCC is absolutely doing that. They are definitely right to put these issues on the table, but having a broader discussion around that and having kind of more reflection and thoughts from different perspectives, I think is going to get us to a better place.
I really think that it’s been a wonderful discussion. I’d like to thank you, Tom, for taking us through the ACCC thinking. And Joel for an excellent sort of comparative assessments. Some real insights to hear. And thank you very much, Jacqui. It’s always great to be in these fora with you and to get the depth of your insights in Australia.
I think we could probably all on this panel say, in particular to you, David, I think this has been, an environment in which critical insights that you put on to the public agenda 30 years ago. I really at the fore now, and it’s been great to get your perspective on that. So I’d like to thank you all, and I’d like to thank CPI and I’ll bring this live session to a close. Thank you.

766,"December 17, 2021",Privacy as a Parameter of Competition Assessment,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Privacy as a Parameter of Competition Assessment. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Samir GANDHI:
Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have you on this panel discussion. I think that, over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen tremendous growth in the digital sector, and its massive growth has played out across the world, including more developing jurisdictions, such as India. Along with the great growth, there has been a significant debate. That debate is the subject of our conversation today, which is the role of data privacy laws and its intersection with competition law, more specifically.
I’m mindful, of course, that we have a very illustrious panel, some of whom are not entirely focused on just antitrust or competition law, but are more practitioners of privacy and related issues, but I think this is going to make a compelling discussion even more interesting.
Competition regulators across the globe have identified the use of data as non-price competition factors and have indicated that data collected from users by an enterprise may be used to the competitive advantage by some other competitors. I think in India we’ve seen some of that play out within the competition authority, the Competition Commission of India, has noted in recent comments that network effects large results from large amounts of data which are collected, that allows companies to compete on a level that does not necessarily relate to pricing, and creates a system of winner-takes-all. This is from a recent CCI e-commerce market study.
Of course, our conversation today is far broader than just India. It includes various other jurisdictions, but given that that’s the jurisdiction I know and come from, and that it’s part of the topic today, I just take that as one example.
Today’s panel will discuss several factors surrounding privacy and competition law and the implications of using privacy as a parameter for competition assessment, which is a debate that is alive and kicking, for sure. But I think the contours of this debate are far from clear.
With that brief introduction, given our stellar panel of speakers, I don’t want to take more time on dwelling on the topic itself, and we’ll move very quickly to introduce our panelists.
We have Daniel Sokol, or Danny, as many of us know you, Danny. He’s a Professor of Law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, and an Affiliate Professor of Business at the Marshall School of Business. Danny serves as the faculty director for the Center for Transnational Law and Business, and the Co-Director for the USC Marshall Initiative on Digital Competition. Additionally, as if there wasn’t enough on his plate, Danny also, in a part-time capacity, serves as a Senior Advisor at White & Case.
Henri is the Vice President of French Competition Authority, who we are delighted to have on this panel. Henri was, in an earlier start, the former Adviser to the Deputy Director General for mergers at DG Comp at the European Commission. Both at DG Comp and in the private sector, Henri has dealt with pay-for-delay cases in the pharmaceutical case industry, conduct and merger cases in the energy industry, payment systems, IT, and so on and so forth. Once again, pleasure to have you on board, Henri.
Maureen Ohlhausen, of course, is our third panelist, who honestly requires no introduction, but joined Baker Botts after leading the FTC as Acting Chairperson and Commissioner. She has directed all aspects of the FTC’s antitrust work. Many years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Maureen at an ICN conference here in New Delhi, and I know her work includes merger review, conduct enforcement, and she’s steered all FTC Consumer Protection Enforcement, with a particular emphasis on privacy and technology issues. Maureen has received numerous awards, not surprisingly, including the FTC’s, Robert Pitofsky Lifetime Achievement Award. And in private practice, she heads the FTC practice group- in private practice- earlier, she’s headed the FTC practice group at a leading telecom firm representing and counseling telecoms and technology giants.
Rahul Matthan is our fourth speaker, and he’s part of the technology, media, and telecoms practice at a leading Indian platform, Trilegal. Rahul has advised on some of the largest TMT transactions in the country. He’s worked with companies across all sectors of the industry. From big telecom operators, to internet service providers, and manage data service providers, and advised on all sorts of matters, ranging from regulatory, to ongoing business issues. Rahul is a trusted advisor, and is also an esteemed alumni of the same university that I went to many years ago.
That is a quick and brief introduction to the panel, and without further ado of what we could potentially jump into, are a few questions.
We’ve decided as a panel to structure the conversation in a somewhat question / answer format, if that’s okay. So, without further ado, having introduced the panelists, I think what we’d like to do is to jump into our conversation and use our time productively. We’d like to model this conversation and keep it as open and fluid as possible.
Perhaps we’ll start with a question to our first panelist, Danny. Danny, welcome to the panel and thanks again for being on. Just to kickstart this entire conversation, I can think of no better person than you, and, Danny, there has been an active discussion about how, when, and whether companies should be using user data. How people can be empowered to make meaningful decisions about that data, and what laws and regulations? Should it be antitrust? Should be privacy? What laws and regulations should actually apply? There have been some suggestions that competition regulators should solve for violations of privacy. To what extent do you think that’s a viable solution? When do you think privacy can become a competition issue? Danny.


Daniel SOKOL:
I’ll start by stating the obvious, since I’m the first speaker, which is that competition law works when it involves competition issues. Sometimes privacy may work in tandem with competition, so that greater privacy leads to more competition and vice versa. Sometimes it’s neutral, sometimes the two may be at odds, but these are distinct areas.
As a law professor, let me just say this; if we say that, “Oh, these things are the same,” then you might as well tell me that torts and contracts are the same, and we should have a single, legal regime for that. And that’s not quite right. There are going to be areas that are distinctive to a particular doctrinal area, and there will be areas of overlap.
The question then becomes when should we be concerned about privacy? And it’s when it impacts the competition. When might we see that? We might see it in one of two potential ways. In one way, we might be using privacy perhaps as an excuse for anti-competitive activity. Of course, we would want competition authorities to intervene when that’s the case.
Similarly, it could be that overly strong privacy protection, going the opposite direction, may be entrenching incumbents. The answer with so much of competition law is that it depends on the facts. But to say that the two are the same, isn’t quite right. It’s really about thinking about the interaction when there’s going to be something specific on the competition side we can do. Actually, I think the authorities that have really understood this the best, recently in a joint 24, 25-page paper, was the UK’s CMA and ICO, where I probably could summarize it in one line, “Which is when there’s an intersection, both of us care.”
I think that’s probably the right approach.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Danny, that makes a lot of sense. I think for all of us lawyers, we at some point have to draw a line between two subjects, which clearly seem to intersect at so many different points. The answer, as they say, is truly blowing in the wind.
But, Maureen, if I can move on to you, how has competition law traditionally assessed privacy and personally identifiable data issues? How do you do that in just analysis? And what are the changes that you see that are being proposed to this somewhat traditional approach that has been taken thus far across different jurisdictions that you have experienced and worked on?


Maureen OHLHAUSEN:
As we look back at cases over time that involved personally identifiable or consumer level data, frequently merger cases, the assessment was, is this combination creating market power in some identifiable antitrust market, such as for consumer home records? The FTC had some cases that involved combinations of land records about whose house is whose. Things like titles, or consumer credit data. They then said, “Okay, does this cause an overlap that will give competitive concerns stemming from having market power after the combination?” and imposed remedies to address that.
So, the idea that competition law has never had to deal with these issues and that we need to change everything, just isn’t correct. I think one of the issues that has come to the fore, however, is this idea of, “Well, because we care about privacy, are we concerned that even apart from creating any sort of market power in an identifiable antitrust market, does a combination of data through a merger going to reduce privacy somehow?” Or on the conduct side, there’s concern that a company has, through its own organic actions and not necessarily through acquisitions, gained a lot of consumer level data, and somehow that has given it an advantage, and we want other competitors to have access to that data, so we’re going to have some sort of forced sharing of it.
I think those are some of the issues that are kind of coming to the fore now. One of the things that I think is very interesting is as you look at traditional antitrust analysis and say, “Well, does the combination of two data sets after a merger actually create an efficiency that allows the merged firm to then compete even better, or create new products, or something like that?” That seems to be a negative in today’s analysis, if it involves consumer data, where previously it would have been a positive.
The other thing that’s kind of being focused on, is what is the identifiable antitrust market? Frequently, it is the market for online targeted advertising. I think it would really be beneficial to say, “Well, how many players are actually in that market?” A lot. Has supply been going up in that market? I think it probably has. Have prices been going up? I don’t think they have.
I think those are the kind of questions that we need to ask to determine are these issues about access to, collection of, or use of consumer data, actually competitive issues?
You mentioned in my introduction my other hat as a consumer protection and privacy former enforcer and current practitioner, where I actually think, at least in the US, a lot of these concerns would be much better addressed by adopting a federal privacy law that laid out the groundwork. Rather than trying to kind of distort antitrust law to deal with what are essentially privacy concerns.
I wrote a paper called, “Competition and Privacy: Friends, Foes, or Frenemies?” because it does create some real tension between the values in antitrust, and the values that we’re trying to protect through privacy law.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Maureen. I think you’ve hit on several thought-provoking issues, including one that we should come to, which is, is it time for more ex ante kind of regulatory review by a separate standalone regulator?
In your case, you mentioned a federal privacy watchdog, or something of that nature. Not to say that one doesn’t exist, but perhaps that would help draw the lines, which we also heard Danny say are somewhat blurred today, and would kind of help to create some sort of a distinction between these two areas.
But I want to pick up on something else that you also mentioned, Maureen, and that’s this somewhat vexing question of efficiencies. Sometimes transactions which have privacy aspects to them could actually result in inefficiencies, and I guess that’s where I could perhaps turn to Rahul, given his role as a privacy lawyer.
Rahul, look, does the existence of healthy competition in and of itself show greater privacy protection to consumers and to end users? To pick up on Maureen’s thought regarding efficiencies, would greater privacy restrictions be efficiency enhancing? In other words, would it result in a greater consumer efficiency? Or efficiency to the market, and actually promote competition in the market? So, Rahul, over to you.


Rahul MATTHAN:
Samir, framed in that exact specific way, I think the simple answer is no. Because in and of itself, neither of those are going to be a yes. Picking up on what Danny said, and I think what Maureen elaborated on, is that you get a bunch of lawyers and you ask them a simple question, it’s never a yes or no, it’s always a maybe, it really depends on the circumstances.
If you say, “Does the existence of healthy competition in and of itself ensure greater privacy protection?” there are always circumstances where you will find that that is actually not the case. So if you are saying that if there is healthy competition, we will always have greater privacy, I will point to a number of sectors wherein the sectors themselves are extremely healthy, but privacy is not one of the factors on which they compete.
Just to pick up what Danny said, when that becomes an issue that you compete on, that’s when the existence of healthy competition is going to ensure that the market participants are going to fight with each other to become more privacy preserving, more privacy-enhancing.
So once again, let me just caveat in this room full of competition lawyers; I’m the one who doesn’t even understand the jargon and the lingo, and I’m going to comment on it as a privacy lawyer. And let me add another nuance to this: India does not even have state privacy laws. It does not have a federal privacy, and we don’t even have state privacy laws. We have no privacy legislation in this country, so after 20 years of doing this, I can keep asking myself, what are you doing being a privacy lawyer in a country without a privacy law?
But having said that, the nuances of privacy are now being picked up, as you yourself said in the introduction, by the competition regulator. In a sense, the solution for this situation is to have, as Danny mentioned, the two regulators that talk together and find a way in which the two competing interests can be addressed.
And just to pick up the second point on efficiencies, just the fact that there are greater privacy restrictions being imposed on the market, does not, once again, in and of itself, promote a competitive market. We have many examples of this.
Apple recently introduced this app-tracking transparency module. Which any privacy lawyer looks at it and says, “That’s a huge win for privacy,” because no longer can apps track your behavior and your actions without being transparent about what they are doing.
And yet, we know the implications that will have on the market, because Apple is a dominant operating system provider. There are these tensions between the steps to improve privacy and competition, and vice versa. I don’t think if it’s framed as you framed it, in and of itself that one is ever going to equal the other.

GANDHI:
Thanks for that, Rahul.
I’ve got to say that, despite your admitted shortcoming in understanding the jargon or lingo, I think you’ve made that point very soundly. I think that’s loud and clear. I think also that in jurisdictions such as India where you have a virtual spaghetti bowl of regulators, I think the point you made about regulators needing to speak with each other is absolutely imperative in being able to deliver better outcomes for the public at large.
Speaking of regulators, Henri, if I can bring you in right now, in the digital economy, we’ve often spoken of this. Would you consider access to data as being essential? Or in some sense, if we use competition terminology, an essential facility, and therefore find it necessary to impose access type obligations where everyone has somewhat equal access to this essential facility owned by companies that possess these vast volumes of consumer data? How would you look at that?


Henri PIFFAUT:
That’s a very interesting and good question. Access to data has been looked at essentially, at least in Europe and the Merger Control Review.
The question being asked, when there’s these big data-based companies, like Apple or Microsoft, which is acquiring a smaller rival in an adjacent market, the combination of the two data sets create a data set which is indispensable for others to compete, and not replicable, should there be a mandate to provide access to data? That question has a reason in the merger control, and in Europe, it has never led to the conclusion that the data set was not replicable, and therefore that the access should be provided.
The answer regarding the merger control has not been provided to your question. It’s true that taking the criteria that I’ve just mentioned, they look very much alike, and with the criteria you find it to be an essential facility doctrine in Europe, the so-called Bronner criteria, but, when you look at it from a kind of business or economic perspective, I would argue that access to data sets is a very different animal from the animals that you would find that the essential facility lab train.
Why? Because initially, at least in Europe, when it was developed, the doctrine looked at physical facilities, like a port or a network infrastructure for gas transportation, for instance, where if somebody has access, others do not have access. In other words, it was asset that would create rivals, whereas with data, if you have access to data, that’s not rivalrous. If I access it, you will be able to access it afterwards or at the same time. I have not exhausted the data sets. In that sense, economically speaking, it’s a very different animal from the old fashioned facilities with the label natural facilities.
There’s another difference, in that data sets are dynamic animals. Whereas a harbor is something which doesn’t move, or every 20 or 30 years you have to drag it and then do other works, et cetera, a data set is highly dynamic. It depends on the number of instances, which are not necessarily under the control of the backbone which possesses the data sets. At the same time, if you would provide access, in a way, it wouldn’t be really access, it would be interoperability, to one data set from another one, the very fact that you would provide interoperability would change both sets of data sets as well.
This is, again, kind of an amorphous animal which is very different from one that you would find in an essential facility doctrine. My short answer to you would be, no, it’s very dissimilar. But the doctrine as to how and when access should be provided or interoperability should be provided has not yet been fully blocked. You can find some interesting precedents into gathering and sharing of information by insurance companies to assess risk. At the same time, it’s also true, but there is a level of appropriation when you have credible data set to run a platform on, and it’s a technological innovation, which is underlying it. The provider providing access to that data set may diminish incentive to invest for other such platforms. But at the same time providing access might be very problematic as well, so there’s a fine balance to find, and the work for that has not been yet completed.

GANDHI:
Got it. Thank you for that, Henri. The fine balance is truly elusive, I think not just in Europe, but in other jurisdictions, including India.
I think that kind of is a nice segue to my next question, which is, if use the term appropriation, and perhaps, Rahul, given that you are the one true privacy lawyer, if I can say that amongst all of us, would you consider access data? I mean, just the very fact that you’re collecting excessive data, perhaps disproportionate, or stacking more than what you would necessarily need.
Of course, the debate on what constitutes excess data is in itself is a separate question, but would you consider excess data collection to be problematic from a privacy perspective? Some have suggested that such data collection could result in consumer exploitation, but again, going back to a recurring theme that we all brought up in the first part of this conversation, are we ignoring the potentially obvious, the immense benefits that data aggregation may yield for consumers? Rahul?

MATTHAN:
Excellent question. I think, even if you look at the traditional basis for privacy law, which harkens back to the FIPS in the US and eventually picked up by Europe, which then eventually evolved into GDPR, and that’s sort of what everyone bases privacy on. The way we protect privacy is by only collecting as much data as is necessary to serve a purpose, and by the very definition, anything in excess of that would violate privacy. If you collected data to an extreme level, that could even amount to exploitation.
If you look at privacy law, we have principles of purpose limitation, use limitation, data minimization, data retention restrictions, all geared at ensuring that behavior is guided towards collecting only as much information as is absolutely necessary and no more, and you’ll be punished if you do more than that. But as you said, this was perhaps useful and relevant in the FIPS era, and even during the database directive era in Europe, but once we had the big data moment in technology, we started seeing that there was value to be gained out of aggregate data. Vast amounts of data handled carefully in an ethical manner, could result in almost magical results.
We thought that computers could never beat humans at chess, but computers beat humans at chess. And then Gary Kasparov said we create a cyborg, human plus computer, and we will beat computers, and now they beat the cyborgs at chess. We thought that go would be an era we would never cross, but computers are beating humans at go without breaking a sweat.
But forget about that. Radiology. Today there is no radiologist who can compete with an AI driven radiologist. Why is all of this possible? Because of aggregated data. We’ve got vast amounts of data that have been able to train machines to do things that humans are not capable of doing.
In India, the example that I like to talk about in this context is financial data. Today India has maybe 300 million customers in financial services. We believe that an additional 300 million could be brought into the financial sector, but they don’t have the collateral that the current banking system requires them to show. It doesn’t mean that they are bad investments as far as loans are concerned, it just means they can’t prove it.
But, if you can use data, you can actually bring them into the system because you can analyze the history of their transactions. Based on that, you can say they’re good creditors. I mean, this is another 300 million people that can be brought into the financial services net only using data. You absolutely cannot ignore this.
Now, how do you enable this? Obviously, you’ve got to rethink the privacy principles of minimization, rethink the privacy principles of keeping things small, because we need this information to be able to train our analysis, and if you do this, we need to realize that there will be bad actors who will take this and misuse it, and that’s really what we’re concerned about. We’re not concerned about all the good uses of aggregated data, we’re concerned that there are some people who will misuse it, and it’s been done.
We know about Cambridge Analytica and what they did with the US elections, and we’ve seen this time and again. We’ve got to rethink the way we think about this minimization principle.
One of the things that I proposed as a solution was a sort of an accountability framework. I know that there are some senators in the US that came up with that sort of a model, an accountability framework. I know that Europe is thinking about accountability as a framework, which says that you need to establish a rights-based framework, and then punish for harms that are caused, regardless of the consent that you obtain, and things like that.
This is one solution. There are many other solutions that people are working on.
In India, we’re working on something along the lines of a techno-legal solution, where we actually get this aggregate data and put it into confidential clean rooms so that the data resides within the confidential clean room (CCR). Privacy is ensured, but artificial intelligence models can be run in those CCR environments so that you can just get the results. You can train the models without actually getting access to the private data. There aren’t many such solutions, and I strongly feel that we’ve got to start thinking along these lines in order to be able to unlock the value that aggregate data has without causing any of the harms.
That was a very long, non-competition related statement, but I’m just playing to my strengths. Sorry for that, Samir.

GANDHI:
Not at all, Rahul, and you’d be amazed at how these non-competition law issues, as you term it, are actually invaluable as far as this larger debate is concerned, because I think that’s the crux of today’s conversation that we have about, ostensively, two disciplines, if you can call it that, moving in tandem, or at least very closely in parallel, and there are multiple points of intersection.
Speaking of intersection, because I do hear, Rahul, from your comments as well, that there is this understanding, at least amongst privacy lawyers, this concept of almost utilitarian, which is that there could be a greater need in certain circumstances for data to be shared, and there are, therefore, in the competition world at least, efficiencies to be extracted which could lead to greater consumer benefit, so on and so forth.
Taking up or taking cue from that, perhaps I can move to Danny and ask, we’ve looked at privacy so far as being the dawn on price competition type of parameter in competition assessment, is there some sort of a merit in viewing privacy as a price parameter as well? Apart from the so-called exploitation, which could be a result, but there is also a price aspect to it. Is there something that we could explore further also as competition lawyers?

SOKOL:
If we think that the monetization of anything is possible, then there’s going to be some price related aspects. Part of it might be to step back and think about what are the business models of the people who are involved in data.
Lots of products generate data. All your apps, many of your smart devices, ISPs, you have data managers who have access to data, you have data aggregators. If you think about each of these different buckets of business models, including those who, just like us, are giving all kinds of data, it may not be big data.
I say this because we’re now in season 16 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” There’s a lot of data that we get, and not all of it is pro-competitive. The larger point is that we are able, across a number of areas of law, primarily contract, to figure out how much that data is worth. In some ways, it reminds us of IP discussion of what is the value of any kind of intangible good like IP, whether copyright, or trademark, or patent, but in some ways it’s different, because unlike IP, much of data is non-exclusive and non-rivalrous. I say much of, because there may be some unique data sets, for example, certain areas of digital health or upstream industrial data, where you just don’t have any kind of way of replicating it.
Could we give it some kind of financial value? Yes. Do we have a consistent set of metrics outside of arms-length business transactions across areas of law? The answer is no. We have certain confusion, let’s say, as to trying to figure out the value. That, I think, is going to become much clearer in the next few years across areas of laws as cases play out.
But, from a competition standpoint, we’ve had cases that I can simply describe as odd. The German FCO case against Facebook, for example, couldn’t be brought under European competition law, but because of the uniqueness of the German law could be brought there. But the idea that simply collecting data might somehow lead to competitive harm, again, so much of law is drawing analogies, whether it’s privacy law, contract law, or competition law. I’ll draw another one. If it’s simply about amassing something, we don’t have a law that says, it’s bad to amass cash, right? If you’re saying that we can monetize data, then we say, okay, if it’s priced, let’s just say it’s cash. We don’t, from a corporate governance standpoint, say that if you sit on too much cash, that somehow this is a competition abuse. And this gets to a larger point, at least in competition law. It’s not what you have, it’s what you do with it. That’s true, whether it’s data or any kind of other tool that you might have that is an input to some kind of outcome. That’s where I think competition law plays a particularly strong role.
Again, let me also note, in the United States, we don’t have exploitative abuse, so the German case couldn’t have come up in the US context, but the idea of some kind of exclusionary conduct, aha, now we have conduct. The conduct may have a basis with some kind of data, but where we’ve had those cases, we haven’t seen that.
We have a case involving the auto industry and data sharing, CDK, that went before the Seventh Circuit. A Section 1 case: no competition abuse. In much the way that Henri discussed, for example, that this is not quite the same as an essential facility, the court there was actually quite explicit: data is not an essential facility for competition purposes. There are other cases like this.
Samir, I think in short, what I would say is that this is an area where we’re going to see a lot more action across jurisdictions in the next few years, as we sort of work through these kinds of concepts.

GANDHI:
Thanks, Danny. That sounds ominous: lots more of action. As you said, there is some degree of confusion, right? Is simply collecting data a competition law issue when most of us have grown up at least thinking that it’s not. As you said, it’s not what you have, but what you do with it.
Perhaps, Henri, you’re the right person to direct this question to, assuming that this is really an issue. What is the typical kind of evidentiary standard that regulators would need to follow in order to enforce cases where privacy is asserted as a competition concern? If you reach a situation where competition regulators across the globe are using privacy as a parameter in their competitive assessment, do you see that happening? Is that something that you believe is imminent? And what do you think, if that were to become the case, would be the most viable remedy? What is it that a competition regulator can ultimately do about a situation like this, should it pan out? Henri?

PIFFAUT:
It’s a very wide question. Let me try to give a meaningful answer. I think to give an answer, first it is required to make a kind of taxonomy of the cases under antitrust rules that may involve privacy. When looking at the decisions of the cases that have been taken in Europe, to me there are four groups of antitrust cases that involve privacy. The first one is when the last platform, let’s say a dominant platform, when implementing a legal obligation in terms of privacy protection, we’ll have different options to do that, and we’ll choose one option, which would mean raising barriers to entry to a much higher degree than the other options available. So that’s one.
A second category of case is when actually the platform is already fulfilling its privacy legal obligations, but has decided to increase the protection. It’s where privacy becomes a parameter of competition. Beforehand, it was just a legal obligation, but now it becomes a parameter of competition. One instance would be the Apple ADT window that we just mentioned earlier in our discussion. That could lead to raising barriers to entry, or to self-preferencing issues, et cetera.
The third category is actually in a case where devising a remedy to a competitive harm would involve access to data, and that access to data may actually lead to privacy issues.
For instance, for all the infrastructure companies like Mobilier, the old monopolies in electricity or gas in France, there was an issue of how do you enable potential competitors to get into the market? They need access to the identity, and the addresses and telephone numbers of the customers of the old monopoly if they want to do so, but otherwise it’s privacy issues.
And the last category is the infamous German-Facebook case, where when you face a manifesting infringement of privacy laws, it could be labeled as an exploitative abuse. That’s not something which is absurd because I actually find that in an intersection of the IP law and competition law where manifestly, say fake patents, could be addressed in the competition law if it’s manifests. But in all of these, to go back to your question about the burden of proof, you will find different features in terms of burden of proof. In some instances, you need to interact with the privacy regulator, but we provide the Competition Authority with a kind of an assessment of what the issues are. To some of us, it’s obvious now for the Competition Authority to make some determination. It all very much depends on the category of case in which you are.
Now, to come to the second part of your question, let’s mention, by the way, there would be a case involving privacy at a global level. It all depends on what you call privacy. If it’s about the legal obligation, that may get a bit complicated, because all jurisdictions have different meanings, definitions, and obligations for privacy protection. If it’s about moving beyond and privacy as a parameter for competition, you may think of the Privacy Sandbox of Google, for instance. There, one ciykd imagine it can have cooperation on their mechanisms that exist for that kind of cooperation between the various competition authorities, because obviously from a business perspective, if there was a need for any remedy, such a remedy would need to be the same for across jurisdictions, otherwise the running of its business would get a bit complicated.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Henri, that is immensely useful. Just to pick up on that very last point, which I could not agree more with personally, which is remedies need to be consistent. In some sense, for these are multinational corporations which work across various jurisdictions to have a spaghetti bowl of remedies would perhaps not be as efficient an outcome as a one would want.
But I think moving over to you, Maureen, if you would continue in this vein of look of looking at what is it that we can do about situations when they arise? What are the kinds of remedies that a competition lawyer can look at? I guess we’ve spoken about this briefly in the past, but, if I can ask you, how do proposals regarding data portability forced obligations in some sense to share data? How do they comport? How do they sit with competition and privacy values? How do you accommodate all of this in literally the same sentence?

OHLHAUSEN:
In the extent some of the proposals particularly, in some of the privacy laws that are proposed legislation in the US would give consumers the right to port their data, to get it and import it to another user. I think, in that instance, you could see privacy law and competition law kind of in concert, in harmony. The consumer gets to decide and gets to exercise his or her market choice, and gets to decide whether he or she wants to share with someone else.
I think more concerns are raised when you have this forced sharing of personally identifiable data not subject to the consumer’s consent, the idea that I share my data with one player, but another player wants to get in the market, and therefore there is an obligation to just port that data over. That really puts privacy law and competition law in conflict.
That was my “frenemy,” or “foes and frenemies” part of my article.
One of the things that we’re seeing, and I have concerns in some of the proposals in the US law for some of the, particularly the big platform companies, is this idea that basically any business user, whoever that may be, it doesn’t really have to be a competitor, can ask for access, ask for the data, ask for interoperability of systems, with the idea that perhaps this will lead to more competition. They don’t have to justify it. It’s not up to them to justify the entity asking for access. The idea of some of these proposals is that maybe that’ll lead to more competition, but that really kind of flips the approach that we’ve had in the US to privacy and data security, which is to put the obligation on the holders of the data to say, “Who are you sharing it with? Why are you sharing it? Be sure you lock it down.” All the things that the FTC has said to many companies.
Some of these legislative proposals, what they do is actually kind of flip that, so that the entity holding the data is at big risk. If it says, “Well, I’m not sure you’re a reliable partner to share this data with. I’m not sure you’re a safe entity with whom to inter-operate,” under some of these proposals in the US, there is the provision that the company narrowly tailored to protect consumer privacy or security of their systems. They could say, “Well, I’m not going to share it,” but if they don’t get it right, if it’s not narrowly tailored enough, they have to kind of meet this higher burden. All the risk is on them. There are all these penalties that they may face, and kind of a huge hammer brought down on them.
We know the benefits through privacy regulation to consumers of making sure that their data isn’t shared as freely, and that we respect consumers’ choices, their sovereignty, and that data security is provided to them. We’ve kind of embraced those values through privacy law, and we’ve seen that throughout the world. We’re sort of moving away from that to reduce that to say, “Well we’re going to open this up, and let’s hope that it leads to more competition.” I think that really puts antitrust—if you can call these proposals antitrust, because they have much more of a regulatory bend to them than the traditional antitrust bend—that really puts our traditional notions of how you protect privacy and how you protect consumers’ data at odds with these ideas that forcing this and putting the whole obligation on the holder of the data to justify whether why they’re withholding it. This sort of puts those two things, I think, in a great tension. It’ll be, I think, in a very difficult position for those companies that would be subject to these proposals, should they pass.

GANDHI:
So, in serious “frenemy” territory, I’d say, Maureen.

OHLHAUSEN:
Yes.

GANDHI:
That’s absolutely intriguing, because I did want to pick up on, and get your thoughts on one further point, because you did say that some of these proposals have a regulatory bend to them, right? I want to just start on that. There is a significant conversation happening, perhaps in India as well.
Rahul, maybe you’d be in a better position to comment, but, Maureen, the conversation that I refer to really is, would we be better off? When I say we, I mean would the consumer, would the state, would consumer interests, which clearly lies at the heart of all of this, be better off by some form of predetermined, clear regulation, so ex ante regulation. Something which clearly says here are the key do’s and don’ts, mindful of the overlapping or the linkages between privacy and competition law. Let’s do this upfront. Let’s remove the uncertainty from the process because ex-post kind of conduct-based evaluations as competition regulators love to carry out, also lead to uncertainty. So, I guess this is the question that I wanted to bounce off each of each of our panelists: is ex ante privacy regulation with all, or some, of the various factors that each of you have pointed out the way to go, or the way to resolve this in a way such that there are at least certain outcomes which benefit the consumer? If there are roles for different agencies over there, how do you ensure that these agencies actually speak with each other to ensure that there is some sort of a uniformity and outcome?
Maureen, if I can start with you?

OHLHAUSEN:
Certainly, happy to start on this.
I think that having a generally applicable, in the US, federal privacy law that lays out the consumer rights and the corresponding obligations on the holders of data would really be a great contribution. First, of all, the legislation that I mentioned, the way it’s been drafted, only applies to a handful of companies. That creates some competitive distortions. If you have a generally applicable law, and one of the other things that I found as a privacy enforcer, it’s not necessarily the big companies that are causing the greatest privacy damage. Small companies have sometimes very sensitive data. Think about this; we brought the case against Ashley Madison, where when that data was released, there were reports of people committing suicide. I think having a generally applicable law so that companies know where the boundaries are and can plan accordingly.
I also think it’s very difficult to have this sort of, “Well is this allowed, not allowed?” Five years later we decide, “Oh no, the line should really be in a different place,” and you’re on the hook for something where when we made these decisions, and we had these in place, it wasn’t really law. It was more the practice, the expectation, or something like that look different.
I think having generally applicable, economy-wide, privacy law with clear enforcement tools. My recommendation would be that those enforcement tools go to the Federal Trade Commission. I think that would really be kind of the path forward here.
I think all the panelists have touched on this: where you draw the lines for privacy, because that will have an impact on innovation and competition. Any privacy law also needs to take that into account, because regulation that’s poorly done can have negative competitive impacts. You’re always going to have some trade-off, but you kind of want to make that trade-off as sensible as possible.

GANDHI:
Thank you, Maureen.
Henri, maybe I can check in on you on this one, mindful, of course, that you’re a competition regulator, but equally I think Maureen makes a pretty compelling point, which is ultimately interests are best served if there is some degree of certainty. So perhaps a clear regulation upfront is welcome. But naturally, they would be areas where this could have some sort of impact on innovation and competition, and that’s the slightly hairy line that we are talking about. Is that’s where we start to wonder, what’s the role of a competition regulator, even if there is an ex ante privacy law? Is it solvable by the regulators speaking with each other? Is it better solved, as I think Maureen tends to indicate, that perhaps have the competition regulator also be the one who enforces this ex ante privacy regulation? Maureen, I’m not sure if that’s what you meant by when you said that, “Give those paths to the FTC,” but Henri, your thoughts on this?

PIFFAUT:
So there’s clearly a need for communication. You know that the situation in Europe is a bit different from that in the US also. We have an ex ante regulation. I hate the word ex ante, but at least behavior obligations are pretty clear. What is perhaps a bit less clear, because it’s still a baby, it’s something like three years old and so the teeth are getting out, the implementation of privacy law in Europe is country-by-country. It’s a European regulation, but it’s country-by-country, and there’s a need to know who has jurisdiction, and then to make sure that the privacy regulators understand each other within Europe, and apply some of the rules, and put them in a consistent way.
Perhaps one other point is really important, privacy as understood in Europe is, in a way, a pro-competitive regulation. Why? Because it provides choice. Informed choice to consumers and to customers.
And second, into the GDPR, there is a provision for the portability of data, which, when implemented, could lead to decreasing the costs of switching our customers from one platform to the others.
To come back, there’s always friction. As I was saying, there’re four points of contacts, four categories of cases, that may involve both privacy and competition law. For that to be resolved, you need a lot of interaction and discussion, whether at the structural level, or at a more informal level between the regulators for competition and for privacy. In Europe, that has a horizontal element within a country, but there’s also a vertical element because there is also discussion that needs to be done between one country and the European Commission, or one country and another; one applying the privacy law and the other one competition law. It’s a little bit complicated to implement.

GANDHI:
Sounds familiar, honestly, Henri, complicated to implement.
I think, Rahul, moving over this very quickly, if I can get your thoughts. India as a country abounds in complications. When Henri was saying you have to be consistent, there’s a country-by-country approach, we’re obviously mindful of the various contradictions within the federal India as a board. How do you see this playing out within a jurisdiction such as India?

MATTHAN:
Just to make things slightly more complicated, maybe I can talk about what India is doing with regard to portability, and I mentioned briefly techno-legal approach.
India has built a framework called DEPA, Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture. Essentially, this is a technology layer on top of the consent-based privacy layer that Henri just spoke about. It allows us to do a lot of the things that I think Maureen was concerned about, which is, if you allow portability, you’re opening up a fire hose; competition is going to suck information. How do you protect user privacy? The DEPA architecture essentially implements portability with user consent, but in a micro-portability way.
When I spoke about financial benefits of portability in the Indian context, in the DEPA context, does, is it will allow a user to say, “Look, I’ve got information in my bank, but another lender wants this information. I, with my consent can allow that lender to take that information.” And so, in a sense it’s a marriage of the two. It improves competition because it allows new-to-bank customers. People with whom the user does not have an existing relationship can actually offer services to that user, improving competition. At the same time, it does not allow that person to misuse that information because all of the information passes with consent.
I think that as lawyers and as regulators, we tend to think that solutions lie in regulation, ex post or ex ante, but I spend so much time with technologists that I think that it is possible, particularly since ultimately we’re regulating tech companies, bringing regulation to a tech company is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. If you want to really regulate them, bring technology in to regulate the technology companies using the power of technology. I think India has done that neatly with the DEPA architecture.

GANDHI:
Thanks a ton for that, Rahul. I guess a final word, wrapping up comments, whichever way you look at it, given that we have probably overstayed our welcome with our hosts.
Danny, as an academic, perhaps you can give us an overview as well, regulation ex ante/ex post. Henri told us of his discomfort with the term ex ante to start with. Rahul has very kindly characterized this as being bringing a knife to a gunfight. How exactly do you see this? Is it time for us to regulate or ex ante? Or are our competition law tools adequate? Is the current status quo with both of these things running parallel adequate? Or do you see some sort of a need for change?

SOKOL:
Very quickly, the enforcement tools work effectively for purposes of enforcement. If there are issues of regulation, then we ask the basic questions: what is it we’re trying to regulate? How do we make sure that regulation is as least distortive as possible, but still reach the goals of competition that we want to have? There’s a lot of complexity here. Unlike a traditional utility in a static market, let’s say a provision of water utilities, here there are real dynamic effects, and we have to be very careful about making sure we calibrate properly. Is there a role for some area of regulation? Quite possibly, yes. What exactly that means in practice requires careful thought.

GANDHI:
On that happy note, careful thought and calibration is where we will leave the conversation. Thank you, once again.
I don’t think that I’m well-positioned to, nor do I need to, sum up anything or any of the comments that the speakers have made today, so I’m going to end here. We’re also out of time.
I need to thank all our panelists once again. This has been, at least for me, a tremendously informative and fun conversation. Maureen, Danny, Rahul, Henri, a big thank you from me, but also on behalf of the other panelists. If we did have a live body audience, this is the point in time where you would hear much applause. Thanks a ton again for your time, and have a good remainder of the day or a remainder of the evening, depending on where you are. Thanks again.

767,"December 16, 2021",Self-Preferencing and Online Platforms: A Universal Theme?,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of our panel discussion Self-Preferencing and Online Platforms: A Universal Theme?. Read below to see the timely discussion where a panel of experts deepened the discussion regarding this topic, and how it specifically relates to South Korea.

Frederic JENNY:
Well, good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, and welcome to this CPI panel discussion on Self-preferencing and Online Platforms: The Universal Theme? This is a very timely discussion, as the Google Shopping judgment of the European General Court was delivered last week. And as the discussions on the relative merits of ex-ante regulation and ex-post competition law enforcement to reign in the alleged abusive practices of large tech firms is going on in many jurisdictions.
We have a wonderful panel, and let me very briefly introduce the panelists.
Reiko Aoki, who’s commissioner of the Japan Fair Trade Commission since 2016, and was Professor of Economics at Hitotsubashi University.
Marcus Bezzi, who’s the Executive General Manager of the ACCC in Australia since 2009. Tsuyoshi Ikeda who is a very prominent antitrust competition law petitioner in Japan with the law firm of Ikeda & Someya. He was previously an investigator of the Japan Fair Trade Commission, where he participated in many dawn raids, leniency programs, and investigation of cases.
We have Michael Jacobides, who is the Sir Donald Gordon Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Professor of Strategy at the London Business School.
And we have Madoka Shimada who’s a lawyer with the law firm Nishimura & Asahi, specializes on competitional matters, and also a member of the subcommittee on Unfair Trade Policies and Measures of the Industrial Structure Council at the MITI since 2013.
My name is Frederic Jenny. I’m the chair of the OECD Competition Committee, and a Professor of Economic, at ESSEC Business School.
Now, if we get into the topic, there are sharply divided views among competition authorities, economists, and courts over whether self-preferencing by dominant firms is always unfair and anti-competitive, or whether it can be pro-competitive, and how it should be dealt with. Those different views are partly the result of the fact that competition laws are different in different countries. For example, whereas in Europe, dominant firms have a special responsibility to ensure that they do not act in a way which could impair the competitive structure of markets. Firms with monopoly powers in the U.S., or market powers, do not have a duty to help their competitors, as we were reminded in the Trinko Decision.
Furthermore, while some economists are used to self-preferencing, as a normal business practice, and may in fact promote innovation and increase competition, and they refer, for example, to the self-preferencing of private labels by supermarkets, which is seen as a sign of increased competition in products, others are of the view that self-preferencing by large digital ecosystems is unfair and can deprive consumers from the benefits of innovation.
One question, of course, is whether digital markets and ecosystem are different from other markets, and I’m sure that we will discuss this. Now, with respect to courts, let me mention two cases with strikingly different results. The first case is in the UK, the Streetmap Decision by the High Courts from February, 2016. In this case, Streetmap, who was a very early mover in the online mapping space, accused Google of abusing its dominant position to promote its mapping service within its general search results, thereby having a knock-on effect on the traffic to Streetmaps own service. The argument of Streetmap was that the inclusion by Google of a map at the top of the search results, displaying results from Google Maps, promoted Google’s own maps more favorably than its rivals. And hence, the claim of anti-competitive behavior by Google.
Justice Roth, from the High Court, dismissed Streetmap’s argument, ruling that the inclusion of the Google Map box at the top of the search result, was, and I quote, “Not reasonably likely appreciably to affect competition in the market for online maps,” and that Google’s conduct was objectively justified.
Now, Justice Roth agreed that preferential promotion by a dominant company to its power on the markets where it is dominant of its separate product on a distant market where it is not dominant, may constitute an abuse if it has the effect of strengthening its position on that other market and is not otherwise objectively justified.
However, to do so, and in application of the jurisprudence of Tamra in Europe, all the relevant circumstances of the case have to be taken into consideration. And in this case, the questions were, did Google intend to foreclose competition by introducing Google Maps one-box? Justice Roth concluded that it had not. Its main purpose was to improve its general search engine by remedying its perceived deficiencies in comparison with the offering of its competitors.
The second question was, did Streetmap establish an actual and appreciable effect, rather than merely a potential effect, on the market for online mapping services? Mr. Justice Roth found that they did not.
And the third question was, could Google objectively justify any possible abuse on its part? There were two issues or two sub-question to this. First, whether any exclusionary effect could be outweighed by advantages that also benefit consumers, and was the conduct proportionate? Justice Roth found that, yes, indeed, the Google map system was far superior to its competitors, which meant that consumers benefited from the Google Maps service which was offered. Second, that it was proportionate because any alternative would have been very impractical and overly burdensome.
Now, altogether, the court held that Google Maps was successful in its own rights because of a number of technological innovations, which provided a better product than Streetmap, and therefore, these developments were pro-competitive and demonstrated competition on the merits. Now Google was, of course, very pleased with this and made a statement to the fact that the court made clear that we’re focused on improving the quality of our search results. This decision promotes innovation.
Now it’s interesting to contrast this decision with last week’s decision by the General Court of the EU. When the General Court upheld the Google Shopping Decision of the EU Commission, which found that Google had abused its dominant position by self-preferencing its own specialized comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, over that, of its competitor on its general search pages. I will only quote two paragraphs of this judgment.
One of them, which is paragraph eight, states that, “It is uncontested that Google began providing internet users with a Comparison Shopping Service in 2002. And that this initiative was in recognition of the fact that the processes that had either to be used by search engines did not necessarily return the most relevant results in responses to specific searches, such as those relating to news or shopping.”
In other words, the court says, “Yes, there was an innovation there. And this is one of the reasons why Google started its shopping service, it’s comparison-shopping Service.” And the results were not the result of the ordinary general search algorithm, but they were specific to try to get the best possible, the most relevant offers possible.
The second paragraph I want to quote is the heart of the reasoning of the General Court’s decision, I think. It’s paragraph 177, and it says the following: “The rationale and value of a general search engine lie in its capacity to be open to results from external third-party sources and to display these multiple and diverse sources on its general results pages, sources which enrich and enhance the credibility of the search engine as far as the general public is concerned. And enable it to benefit from the network effects and economies of scale that are essential for its development and its subsistence in a market in which by their very nature, few infrastructures of that kind can subsist given those network effects. A very large number of users is needed to reach the critical mass capable of compensating for the service being free of charge on one side of the market, and generating advertising income on its other side. Accordingly, for search engine, limiting the scope of its results to its own entails an element of risk and is not necessarily rational, save in a situation as in the present case, where the dominance and barriers to entry are such that no market entry within a sufficiently short period of time is possible in response to that limitation of internet users’ choice.”
So, the court says, basically, that self-preferencing is not a rational behavior, at least for a digital platform, unless the benefit is to restrict competition if there are high barriers to entry and no possibility for competitors to compete. It does find that this is not competition on the merits.
Now, we have two very different visions there, and I think that it’s interesting to ask our panelists to discuss two sets of questions. The first one is, where do they stand on this issue: is self-preferencing by dominant digital platforms always anti-competitive? Or if they believe that it may not always be anti-competitive, under which conditions should self-preferencing be considered to be a competition violation?
Now, sub question to this is, of course, what to do with self-preferencing by dominant digital firms, whether the self-preferencing by dominant digital firms of their services, when those services are more innovative or better quality than the services offered by competition. Is this a relevant issue or not?
Now, let me turn first to Reiko Aoki, as an enforcer. How should we define self-preferencing? And what are the limits of the concept? And once we’ve defined it, what are your views about whether self-preferencing by digital platforms is usually or presumptively a violation of competition law? Reiko.


Reiko AOKI:
Thank you, Fred, for inviting me to participate in this exciting panel.
First of all, I want to say that I am participating in this panel in my private capacity, but I am aware I’m a Commissioner of the JFTC, so let me just first mention that the JFTC has looked into self-preferencing. And, our view, the JFTC’s view, is that it can lead to foreclosure, exclusionary behavior, or unfair competition, is mentioned in two reports of fact-finding surveys that were done on app stores and digital advertising. You can find them by going to the JFTC’s English webpage, which you can find by Googling, or Duck-Duck-Going or accessing directly.
Under quick link in JFTC webpage, you can find “Approaches to Digital Markets” tab. And you’ll find the fact-finding survey reports in English there.
Self-preferencing, as Fred just mentioned, is hard to define. I’m first going to talk about why I think self-preferencing is anti-competitive. And I’m thinking of self-preferencing mentioned in Google Shopping in the UK, also the Amazon Buy Box, and Google’s ad exchange bidding algorithm, which is included in the JFTC’s digital advertising survey mentioned before.
I think self-preferencing is a type of c leveraging akin to tying. It can leverage between vertical affiliates, but also unrelated affiliates of the digital platform. The mechanics of leveraging and its effect is very unique to digital platforms with an ecosystem, particularly when involving data. And self-preferencing may lead to more data, but necessarily no more sales in the short run. So, in the short run, there may be no immediate effect, but will give the platform an advantage in the long run, allowing it to reach into and define future markets. And this avenue of advantage is not available to platforms without an ecosystem, which Google and the two cases that Fred mentioned would be an example.
In the long-run, competition is about innovation, which was also included in the argument. And self-preferencing used for *innovative service* is always going to be a suspect, and I’m almost tempted to say that self-preferencing by a digital platform with an ecosystem should be per se prohibited for this reason. If the new service is so good, it should be introduced under the same condition as rivals. Maybe new service is good or is innovative only because it was introduced through self-preferencing.
I also note that self-preferencing is akin to tying, but it’s different from the old tying known in competition. It’s not uncommon for a once innovative firm, not necessarily digital platforms, that start leveraging their legacy patents or established network base in order to enter or foreclose a new market, typically by tying and bundling, including rebates. An ecosystem can leverage for advantage effect in an affiliate product or market without innovation, and it is going to be detrimental to long-run competition. So traditional tying was used to compensate for lack of innovation in the past, which is relevant in the current market, but self-preferencing by an ecosystem digital platform is going to replace innovation NOW affecting the FUTURE market. And there have been arguments in the past that bundling resulted in a new innovative product. Unbundling (result of antitrust action) led to entry of new innovative firms, and it’s very ironic that some of these new innovative entrants are now resorting to self-preferencing.
I’ll stop there, thank you.

JENNY:
Well, thank you very much, Reiko, for this pretty strong statement. One a very interesting aspect of what you were saying was the fact that you see the danger as being a danger to long-run competition. Now it is sort of- the competition authorities are usually a bit more concerned with short-run price effects and less with a long-run effects, but you come out very strongly by saying, well, presumably it is an anti-competitive practice because it may have long-term effects.
Let me turn, maybe as a contrast, to Madoka Shimada, who, I think, has a more lenient view of the practice. Madoka.


Madoka SHIMADA:
Thank you very much for this great opportunity to be participating on this panel. And thank you very much, Ms. Aoki, for your really interesting and insightful views.
As Fred said, I think that self-preferencing should not be deemed as presumably anti-competitive. And it should be illegal probably only in some kinds of specific cases. There’s a simple idea, as Frederic said in the beginning, that self-preferencing, if we define it as any promoting of one’s own business, it’s a kind of natural thing, natural behavior for every business who sells their products or services in a good way. And of course, it’s related to vertical integration and that could produce enhanced innovation and efficiency. This is a very simple things that I think.
Of course, if we look at the digital platforms, probably there are some like in different factors than if we compare to the non-digital platforms, the basic economic idea should be the same. As Fred said, let’s look at that. The grocery store has various things, and it’s a very natural thing to get their own brand, their own private labeled things on the good shelves.
Now why is this kind of grocery store marketing is not seen as anti-competitive? Probably because there are a lot of other shops out there. You can go even though it is very big chain store like Walmart, you can find another store where you can shop. And this is really a kind of analogy for the marketplace for things like Google Shopping.
Of course, we need to look at that. If there’s no other choice, if there’s only one shop in the world, of course it should be problematic. We need to really carefully see that- really the shop is in a dominant position. In Japan, probably the legal structure is a little bit different from Europe. We don’t have a kind of dominant position that are basically the same. So, from that point of view, I think that not all the self-preferencing should be allowed, of course. Only for specific cases.
And the next question is what should be those specific cases? Well, as a practitioner, I will look at the JFTC’s recent surveys and fact reports and fact findings. And how they categorize self-preferencing, in specific legal theory. They find that one of the categories of conducts in the Unfair Trade Practices, which is interference with competitors, and that interference with competitors category is, let’s say that this is kind of a basket clause that is used when no particular other theory of harm could be applicable. Well, maybe, this is questionable.
Let’s look at that, the precedents of this interference with other competitors. The cases where the intentional exclusionary conduct against the specific competitors, that case can amount to things, of course, that could be anti-competitive. Also, the second type should be the refusal to trade type of thing. The platform is an essential facility, an indispensable service. In that case, and if there’s refusal of trade, refusal to provide services as a basis of service competitors, the competitors should be in a very difficult position to continue to business.
This is kind of an extreme case, I believe. So well, looking back to the Japan case. Still, there are a lot of cases that the JFTC has already looked into the kind of digital platform mergers, but not pure self-preferencing without these factors, not being kind of seen as kind of violative. I think we need to draw the line in the very simple idea of self-referencing. It’s a really intrinsic motivation of business people. But, of course, only limited to specific cases, maybe some kind of extreme, only those maybe anti-competitive.
Thank you.

JENNY:
Thank you very much, Madoka, for this. A more nuanced view. You associate the possibility of anti-competitive effect, particularly to market power, and you say that in the extreme cases where there’s a very strong market power, nearly an essential facility, there is a case against self-preferencing. But on the other hand, self-preferencing is a normal business practice in many sectors and should not be treated differently in the digital sector.
Now, let me turn to Michael Jacobides, because I think that one of the themes that you want to touch upon is a difference between the digital sector and the non-digital sector when it comes to self-preferencing. So, Michael.


Michael JACOBIDES:
Absolutely and thank you very much. I think that this is also the difference in my mind between what we heard from Reiko and what we heard from Madoka.
Let me just also start from a very personal note, which is that Madoka Shimada told us what is normal in the course of business. And I agree that trying to attain profit and leverage your position is exactly what we would teach in business school in terms of what firms should do.
Now, the problem is that, as someone who has both researched and advised on the corporate side, I think that I got so concerned about the potential for abuse in the digital sector that I started looking at regulation. And there we go to what we heard from Reiko Aoki.
I would also venture to suggest that the difference between the two judgments that Frederick Jenny told us 2016 and 2021, is also that 2021 is not 2016. One of the differences, and I think that that has weighed in how the court decided in 2021, is the understanding of the fundamentally different economics, both in terms of the platforms and in terms of the ecosystems that Reiko Aoki mentioned.
I should also mention by way of blood, perhaps, but really to address to what are the underlying economics of it that there is a special issue coming out in Industrial & Corporate Change that I co-edited with Ioannis Lianos, the chairman of the Hellenic Competition Commission. Frederic has the leading article in that, and many other of the known suspects are contributing to that special issue looking at the specificities of what happens in the digital context.
Again, I think that it is extremely important to consider what are the differences, not only in terms of degree, but also qualitatively in the digital context and what are the economics. I think that the difference between 2016 and 2021 also was 2019, and I’m referring to that because three important reports started outlining the underlying economic issues that emerge in the digital context.
And with due respect, I do not find any correspondence between Walmart cases and Google cases. They’re very different kettles of fish. Also, the idea that self-preferencing, now this is a very important one, we are not speaking about banning Google from making maps. We are not speaking about banning anyone from creating anything that is innovative and pro-competitive. I honestly cannot, for the life of me, see what could be pro-competitive for having either an exclusion or a self-preferencing, i.e, not allowing competition in fair terms.
By the way, when we speak about self-preferencing, if anything I’m concerned that the label is too narrow, because when you look at the digital issue, one of the main concerns is interoperability. The Australian Commission has done a good job in that, speaking about some of these issues in terms of the APIs and comparing that and I’m sure that we’re going to hear from the investigation they did in the function of the app economy in a little while, but I’m just pre-staging it a little bit.
The problems that we have in these digital contexts, which is what Reiko Aoki described, is that the nature of power is wholly different, and what we are also appreciating is the behavioral propensities that lock customers in.
The word pro-competitive is very tricky here; why? Because we are increasingly understanding how behavioral propensities of what customers do are locking them in to default positions.
Richard Taylor, speaking about someone else between 2016 and 2021, got his Nobel Prize in 2017, partly in showing part of these behavioral predispositions. I think that for anyone reading any newspaper, you understand how these are assiduously and often egregiously used by some of the digital platform firms for their own advantage.
If I go back to the comparisons, why is it that there could be something taken in the Walmart case of a pro-competitive effect if Walmart starts having its own label in addition to having things from Proctor Gamble or Unilever? Fundamentally, it is a rebalancing of the power from the power of the FMCG producers and their position in the entire consumption chain, and shifting it a little bit to the distribution channel, so that the power of the brands gets diluted.
What do we have in the digital context? Not only have we gotten a remarkable concentration of power of these digital firms, the other thing that we have is precisely the topics that Reiko Aoki mentioned in terms of the way that those that own the platform have information advantages and the creation of the ecosystem lock-ins that are particularly relevant for a given type of digital firms. Now, within the universe of digital firms—I’m referring to something that I developed in another paper that you can find in the www.devolutionlimited.net website, which is on what is positional power—I think that the problem becomes rather different. You can say, okay, in the digital context, power works in different ways. And there are some firms, very few firms, as I think we will all agree, that are becoming the essential gatekeeper between us and the environment. I think that within this universe, there are characteristics, and we are using in terms of anti-trust the term of gatekeepers in a very loose term.
The European Union created something which I intellectually abhor, which is if they are really big, probably American also, if they are more than 65 billion, or they have X number of customers. I think that all of this reliance on numbers is unhealthy and also academically entirely unjustifiable. I think that what we should do is have some criteria to say, “ah, I’m going to tell you what is the nature and the exercise of power in some firms.” And for them, provided that they have these criteria, I will say that any self-preferencing should be, per se, not allowed. Again, per se, we are not speaking of you not creating a tight connection. We’re speaking about two things. We’re speaking about you not unduly pushing others out.
I cannot, for the life of me, understand how that would ever increase competition and choice for the customer, especially given the lock-in dynamics, and especially given the way that these multi-product and experienced ecosystems lock customers in. And the second thing is that I think that we should really be striving for mandatory, and as common as it can be, interconnection. And again, in the digital economy, I think that the question of how interconnected and interoperable these services are will significantly promote innovation. I do think that in the case of digital platforms, and in particular, when you have gatekeepers, who are the gatekeepers? Just to give you one example, you have gatekeepers when you have firms whereby the competition between two of them does not resolve the issue of the competition within.
I don’t want to abuse the time, perhaps I will need to return to the definition of gatekeepers and self-preferencing in another comment in our talk. Should be mandated to not have preference, not exclusion, this is a much narrower definition. I think self-preferencing should also be mandated to have those that can provide similar service the same right of interconnecting. Why? Because they benefit from inherit economies of network economies and economies of this behavioral capture that reduces competition. And what regulators should be doing is trying to redress all these issues that Reiko mentioned.
A few more things, but let me park it there because I’m afraid of expanding too much in my response.

JENNY:
Thank you very much, Michael, for pointing out that important difference between the digital sector and the other sectors, and the relevance to gatekeepers.
I want to turn to Marcus Bezzi because, as we’ve already heard, the ACCC has conducted a number of market studies on those issues. And I’m under the impression that those markets studies suggested that some forms of self-preferencing might be objectionable, but others not necessarily so in the digital sector.
Marcus, you have the floor.


Marcus BEZZI:
Thanks very much, Fred, and as Michael was talking, I was reflecting on your question at the beginning, on the difference between the two cases. I think Michael does have a point. In 2021 competition agencies, and perhaps also the courts, have a much deeper understanding of the important role of data and network effects in empowering digital platforms.
As you’ve said, we’ve done a number of market studies now. And our market studies power is a very strong one. It enables us to get access to a lot of confidential information that’s held by market participants. We have found that self-preferencing is common, and it’s identified in each of the reports that we’ve done, including reports on app marketplaces—the one that Michael was referring to—choice screens, and ad tech.
There’s been self-preferencing in all of those circumstances. We found what we’re dealing with, and digital platforms are vertically integrated firms with a huge amount of influence on the consumers and businesses that rely upon their services. We’ve found that there’s dominance in ad-tech and in search in Google, Google dominates those markets. In app marketplaces, it’s Apple and Google. In social media, it’s Facebook. For each of these dominant firms, there’s a degree of vertical integration, and there’s evidence of considerable anti-competitive self-preferencing when the firms favor their own interests over downstream rivals in a number of different ways, but that depends a bit on the market. It can include things like pre-installation and default first party services using algorithms to favour first party services. By that I mean services of the business that is engaging in the self-preferencing, or using information collected as a service provider to benefit the services of that service provider over rival services.
We’ve really seen the important role of data, and what Reiko described as the need for long-term access to data flows as a way of entrenching a strong market position, and that, we think, over time is creating significant barriers to entry and expansion.
There’s also a lack of transparency between platform operators and users in the operation of many digital markets that we’ve studied, and the users, being both businesses and consumers, really have no idea about what is going on much of the time. We’ve identified patterns of behavior that we’ve described as dark patterns. Where users are manipulated in many ways to favour the interests of the platform operators. We don’t say that self-preferencing is always a problem. We do conceive that there may be circumstances where self-preferencing by these businesses is not a problem, but we do start from, I suppose, a presumption that if these firms [with market power] are engaging in systematic and widespread self-preferencing in the course of their business, that it is likely to be a problem.

JENNY:
Does that mean that you don’t see a problem if there’s no market power by the firm engaging in the practice, or are there others…

BEZZI:
If the firms are dominant, and we’re looking here at four or five different dominant firms within their particular markets, we do start from the presumption that there is a problem, yes.

JENNY:
But it’s a rebuttable presumption?

BEZZI:
If there’s no market power, if it was a different firm and it had no market power, yes, we fully conceive that there may be no competition issue.
I should add one further qualification, and that is that in our system there may be a justification. We don’t look at it from an efficiency perspective, but we can take the view that there may be a public interest justification in some form of self-preferencing. So, for example, if privacy concerns or security concerns are favored in order to promote a stronger ecosystem for consumers, that may well be an argument for which there is a strong public interest and which in our system, we may recognize.
But as I said, we start from the strong presumption that if these dominant firms within the markets that are identified are engaging in self-preferencing, then it’s likely to be a problem. But we do want to have a closer look.

JENNY:
Okay, very good. Thank you very much.
Let me finish by turning to Tsuyoshi Ikeda. As a former competitional enforcer, and as a lawyer now, how do you look at those issues?


Tsuyoshi IKEDA:
Thank you, Fred. It’s my great honor to be here with the excellent colleagues, and as an ex-official and a current private practitioner, I have to have, maybe as expected, a balanced view.
In Japan, we didn’t have any precedents that specifically the JFTC code mentioned as a self-preferencing case. Yet when I looked back at the precedents, maybe there are some cases which can be classified as the self-preferencing. For example, the mechanical parking lot case. The manufacturer of the mechanical parking lot offered repair parts, but when it came to the process offering the repair parts to third-parties, not the manufacturer itself, it delayed those orders so it would take months for the third-party to get repair parts.
This can be self-preferencing, maybe in a very traditional industry.
Also in the past, the JFTC gave a warning, not a formal cease and desist order, against an internet service provider—the biggest internet service provider—NTT East. In that particular case, the JFTC specifically mentioned that the NTT East could take advantage of information it had obtained through third-party internet service providers. Because the third parties had to negotiate with the NTT East to obtain the internet connection, which could be offered to the end-users, NTT East’s conduct may also be regarded as self-preferencing under recent theory.
These cases are not, of course, judged by the theory of self-preferencing, rather these cases were justified by the traditional, private monopolization or unfair trade practices. So the question would be, especially under the context of Japanese law, whether we should the define self-preferencing as a special antitrust violation apart from the traditional ones.
Of course, I have to admit that self-preferencing in the online market is more serious and more problematic, as other colleagues have already mentioned, the network effects under the work of the data, and also, maybe the speed of business, sometimes makes the situation much worse than in the traditional markets. Of course, competition authorities have to tackle with the difficult situation, but when it comes to Japan, as Madoka mentioned earlier, we have a relatively broad tool, especially recarding interference with competitors’ transactions, which is one category of the unfair trade practices, which is capture regulation, and that covers a lot of the potential illegal conduct. Not even a dominant position is required to apply this provision.
In this context, I would rather emphasize that we have to mind the risk of over-enforcement rather than under-enforcement, because the regulation is so broad. And that we also have to mind the fact that the Japanese law doesn’t have a per se aspect, even for the very obvious price-fixing cartels or bid-riggings. So, we have to prove anti-competitive conduct around the competitive effect in the relevant market. That’s the basic theory under the Japanese Law.
First, I have to admit that it’s very difficult to claim on which occasions, self-preferencing is illegal under the antitrust law, but I would suggest that we use self-preferencing as a kind of tool to evaluate the conduct. When we analyze the interference with competitors’ transaction case, we have to prove the illegal conduct or behavior, and also the anti-competitive effect in the relevant market.
Again, the anti-competitive effect is a case-by-case analysis, not a per se rule applied, so we have to take into account the various factors, including the market share and the size of the network effect and even among the Big Techs, the situation is quite different. For example, for the app store, there are two companies, but when it comes to search engines, Google is dominating the market. In the social networking field, Facebook is, of course, strong, but there may be alternatives. Even among the Big Tech companies, the situation is different, so we have to have a case-by-case analysis for proving the anti-competitive effects.
But when it comes to the illegal conduct part or element, of course we have to consider or take into account the pro-competitive effect toward innovative aspects of the self-preferencing. Self-preferencing is often associated with the offering a new technology, a new service to the consumer, but the fact that the big companies have unequal treatment to third parties in the peripheral treatment of their services, but the treatment against the third-party sites. That may lead to the kind of a presumption that their conduct does not have any justification when we evaluate the conduct element of the Big Tech behavior. In that sense, self-preferencing has a special meaning in the context of the antitrust law enforcement. That is my thinking and suggestions here. Thank you.

JENNY:
Thank you very much, and thank you very much for introducing, in fact, the second part of our discussion.
I’m going to ask each speaker to be rather short because we’re running a bit out of time, but I want to know what the implications of your views on self-preferencing and the dominant views being that there are concerns, at least in some cases, but for some of you in nearly all of the cases where there is self-preferencing by a very large ecosystem.
Is this an argument in favor of ex-ante regulation against those practices, or should they be dealt with as was just suggested a moment ago by Mr. Ikeda? Should that remain a case-by-case analysis within the general context of competition law enforcement? This question is quite interesting because, as we know, there are discussions in many different jurisdictions about whether one needs ex-ante regulation as a complement to competition law enforcement.
Let me turn to Reiko Aoki. First, you came out very strongly against the self-preferencing. Can you explain the reason for that? Does that mean that we should have an extended regulation that would prohibit self-preferencing by other gatekeepers or by dominant firms?

AOKI:
Personally, I don’t think so, because I am very skeptical of ex-ante regulation in general. Economics has taught us that with things like mechanism design and new market design models you can regulate an industry or firm, but it also tells us about the limits. It is very important to have very good information in order to have successful ex-ante regulation. And exactly because digital platforms and ecosystems are very new, I think it’s very difficult to have successful ex-ante regulation. Even with self-preferencing, which is a suspect, we need to apply the existing antitrust laws to keep it from having anti-competitive effects on the market.
Another thing I want to add about regulation, particularly in context of innovation, is that it’s very easy for the regulator to be captured by the incumbent technology, old technology, and that would be another reason against having ex-ante regulation and making self-preferencing per se illegal.

JENNY:
But isn’t there a slight problem? I mean, you explained originally that self-preferencing today may not have any effect on the current market, but will have an effect on the future. That this is a long-term concern that one can have with self-preferencing. Now, it doesn’t that mean that it has to be stopped immediately, which competition law enforcement is not really able to do because we have a quasi-judicial process. From that point of view, isn’t there an advantage from regulation? Regulation prevents the thing right from the beginning, from existing, and therefore, we don’t risk those long-term difficulties that you were concerned about.

AOKI:
Well, that’s a very good point. First of all, antitrust does deal with innovation and long-term effects, so we have the framework to do it. In terms of speed, to have effective regulation, you need to define exactly what the self-preferencing is. As Michael told us, it is a problem when it is done by a gatekeeper, and the definition of a gatekeeper is going to be very difficult, although Michael started to tell us what it was.
If we look at what’s going on in Europe, they had the Google case first, and now the regulation system is just beginning to run. It’s basically taken a similar amount of time precisely because it’s a new industry and a new way of thinking. Thank you.

JENNY:
Thank you very much.
Now, let me turn to Madoka Shimada. For some reason I believe, particularly given what she told us originally, that she’s not so keen on ex-ante regulation. Is that correct?

SHIMADA:
Yes, you’re correct. Really, as Aoki said, ex-ante regulation can be very difficult to craft, design effectively and update that in a very timely manner to catch the ever changing, fast-changing digital platforms businesses. It’s simply very difficult for a government to consider and catch up with the movement in the private sector, digital platform and various technology. That’s one reason.
And the other thing is, with respect to the self-preferencing, as I said before, I am a supporter of the case-by-case competition law enforcement type of approach, not ex-ante. Because that only gets specific cases with specific facts and evidence to be regulated. That’s a simple reason that I support ex-post regulation. Well, not regulation, probably ex-post law enforcement.
And, of course, more industrial, best market practices kind of things. It is a good idea to have people’s hand in pro-regulation and have the industry itself consider what is the best way, as a code of conduct, to make their business fair and better. That is scaled up social responsibility of the subject. The company plays big power, but I don’t think that the government can do that role. It’s too complicated, too fast-changing and too innovative to catch up.

JENNY:
Okay, thank you very much.
Let me turn to Michael Jacobides. You told us that you couldn’t think of any case where self-preferencing would be anything but anti-competitive by a very large ecosystem. Isn’t that a clear argument in favor of ex-ante regulation?

JACOBIDES:
Let me reflect also on the answers that we got so far. I’m a strategy guy who works now on regulation, as opposed to regulation guy who looks at strategy. I was a little bit perplexed by the concern of how difficult it is. And with all due respect, it ain’t that difficult to say that you will have forced interoperability. It really, honestly isn’t. And it doesn’t take someone to redesign the entire industry.
Saying that the interoperability that a company gives to their own subsidiaries will need to be given to other companies as well. I.E., forcing greater openness, is not hard. We would not have Telco if in the UK, NTT East—which was doing mightily nasty things in terms of long versus short-term interchanges—was not forced by the federal government about 70 years ago to open up.
Again, that was not terribly complicated.
So, I think that there are things that are doable. I’m a little concerned that we overintellectualize. The number of the papers that they’ve recently seen, most of them funded by Big Tech, do overintellectualize the argument, so let’s be real. A, can you easily say, will I force interoperability? You absolutely can.
B, can you define, provided that you are a gatekeeper, and I think that there could be some criteria. Let me give you one example or at least the current pitch that I have. I have four to five simple questions. Does the platform have exclusive access to large body of consumers? Is difficult for users to multi-home or switch platforms? Are sellers substitutable? Do users benefit from network effects requiring sellers to multi-home across platforms? And does the platform have an established network or ecosystem of multiple different products that create lock-ins that increase barriers of entry? Now if the answers to all of the above are yes, and again, that is not terribly complicated, then I think that you should be able to have some ex-ante rules.
The two ex-ante rules that I would say are forced interoperability and no self-preferencing. To give you an example of that, consider the differences between large platforms. You can think about Apple, for instance, that is pretty much guessing most of them, and Uber, that is no in most of these. Why is this relevant? Because if you say that I have two platforms where the answers are yes, I have Apple and I have Google, or Android, then the fact that there are two does not mean that there is sufficient competition.
Think about yourself as a dating platform that has networks nowadays, match.com. Now, if match.com is told by Apple, “Give me 30%, or I’m going to go out.” You can’t say, “Oh, well, that’s fine because I’m going to go with Android.” Why? Because you won’t want your customers to miss the dates of the people have only one phone, and it is an Apple.
What does that mean? It means that this is a gatekeeper, unlike Uber and Lyft, where both the drivers and the sellers can move around.
I think that these basic qualitative differences between that different types of platforms mean that there is a subset of platforms for which we should have a higher bar. And this higher bar for me is that we complement the ex-post with the ex-ante.
By the way, when you look at the ex-ante, there are also ways to do it reasonably. How do you do it? You say no self-preferencing. I, as a competition authority, either look at it myself, or I can have others who report to me. If I see self-preferencing, I then have within, 60, 90, 120 days—again, I’m not a regulator, so I wouldn’t be setting any of these limits—to have an explanation of why this is not anti-competitive.
What are the merits, arguments for the maintaining it, or the absolute integrity managed for determining it? And only if the competition authority is satisfied and says fine, I’m going to waive it. But there should be a default, and the default is no, because we know that this is not defensible given the economics of digital platforms.
What do I think? Limited, targeted ex-ante. Ain’t that difficult, let’s not overintellectualize. We’re not speaking about us rethinking business models. And then, this combined with ex-post investigations, which I favored the stuff that the CMA does which look at business models and tries to identify the harm and also allows you to go outside these massive platforms, and then see whether there are platforms that create problems.
I’ll give you an example in Greece. Ioannis Lianos and I put together a new article, which may or may not be voted as a result of corporate pressure, in the new law for competition, which would allow, for instance, to challenge things like, booking.com, like the Germans have done in terms of their request that nobody else has a price that is lower than what is offered there, which is a clear exercise of power.
I do believe that there is a role for focused, ex-ante rules. I honestly cannot think of, having looked at some of the strategies of these firms, that this is rocket science. I think that there should be a presumption with the possibility of the firm making the argument of being exempted. That would be on the discretion of the authority. And then that the authority can say no, and that can be challenged to court. But on the other hand, in such a fast-moving market, you would not have a lock-in. This is a complement, as opposed to a substitute, to the traditional ex-post, which I think needs to be a little bit more subtle and needs to be less rules bound, which is my concern with the DMA Compliance, with what I’ve seen, the Competition Market Authority in the United Kingdom do by way of general example.
I don’t want to speak much about APAC as I’m not a specialist in the area.

JENNY:
So much more of a bespoke system in fact, that’s what–

JACOBIDS:
The bespoke system, but you see, again, we are overintellectualizing the ex-ante versus ex-post. And I think that the ex-ante and the ex-ante with the possibility of some regulatory dialogue, which is a reasonable thing, precisely because the world is changing, is the way to go. I think that once we create that, once we put that in place, we can do the necessary refinements. But there was a lot of scope, I think, for productive innovation in that regards.

JENNY:
So limited and focused ex-ante as a complement to competition.

JACOBIDES:
Absolutely.

JENNY:
Now, let me turn to Marcus Bezzi, because I understand that the ACCC has recommended ex-ante regulation for some of the self-preferencing practices.
What are those practices, and why did you recommend ex-ante regulation?

BEZZI:
I should start, Fred, by saying that the ACCC is a very keen enforcer of our laws. We are enthusiastic enforcers. I personally am a very enthusiastic enforcer, but I understand the limits of ex-post enforcement action, and indeed I think the Google Shopping case is a very strong argument against ex-post enforcement as a way of dealing with market conduct. It’s now really of historical relevance. It deals with conduct that happened in, the complaint, I think, was made in 2010. An [EC] decision was made in 2017. We now get the first level Appeal Court decision in 2021. Who knows when we’ll get a final decision on the matter? It could easily be 15 years after the complaint. What is the value of that to the businesses that made the complaint, who actually don’t exist? A number of them have gone out of business.
You’re right, we at the ACCC do believe that there may need to be carefully crafted ex-ante regulation to deal with specific problems that are identified, and, picking up on Reiko’s point, it should be done very carefully on the basis of thorough evidence which can be gathered.
Competition agencies have got the capacity to make a case and prepare a very sound foundation for it. The UK proposal is very interesting. I think that’s essentially the model that they’re putting in place. Coming up with something limited, fair, targeted on the competition problem, proportionate.
I agree with Michael, it shouldn’t be difficult. We know that as a tool ex-ante, regulation works. We’ve seen it in the telecommunications market.
I remember myself as an enforcer 20 years ago taking cases in the telecommunications market, which were all about trying to break down the power of vertically integrated monopolies. Why would we ignore such an effective tool [as ex ante regulation]?
We have a limited amount of time to deal with the power of these digital platforms. We’re moving onto the next technological development. We’re moving into the Metaverse, we hear, a virtual reality version of the internet. We really need to have proper rules in place to ensure that the very powerful firms that dominate the markets at the moment, don’t completely dominate markets going forward and exclude any possibility for competition, and in the long run, exclude innovation and choice for consumers. That’s really what it’s about at the end of the day.
Look, on my side, one final point: down here in Australia, were a long way from the rest of the world, but we do see one thing very clearly. The greatest possible alignment between jurisdictions is really desirable when it comes to any ex-ante regulation. Now, it may not be complete alignment in terms of the exact regulation, but we need to be aligned about our objectives, aligned about what we’re trying to achieve, to the greatest extent possible. That really means that organizations like the OECD are very, very important in the task that faces us in coming up with some form of [appropriate] ex-ante regulation.

JENNY:
Thank you very much for this.
Let me ask you just a very quick question for a very quick answer, a subsidiary question: who should be in charge of enforcing this ex-ante regulation with all the desirable properties that you’ve mentioned? Should it be the Competition Authority, or should it be a sector specific regulator?

BEZZI:
It might depend on what the regulation is focused on. If at its heart it’s focused on competition, it should be the competition authority, but we’ve done some market studies where we’ve recommended ex-ante regulation, not focused on self-preferencing, focused on other problems where it was entirely appropriate for other regulators to take on that task.

JENNY:
With self-preferencing, would be-

BEZZI:
Self-preferencing, it’s a competition problem, yes.

JENNY:
Okay.
Mr. Ikeda, do you have anything to add? You started this discussion already, but you may have some further comments.

IKEDA:
Yes, thank you.
Again, I am a great supporter of the careful case-by-case analysis as ex-post regulation. But also, at the same time, I have to admit that there are some benefits of ex-ante regulation.
First of all, the enforceability. Speaking of the two cases Fred mentioned at the beginning of our discussion, perhaps Google had the same understanding when they introduced Google map and Google Shopping, but in the latter case, they are perhaps losing billions of Euros in fines, which may be a surprise for them.
Also, as Marcus mentioned, the speed issue. Of course the recent judgment will be a very big contribution to the competition law society, but at the same time, the European Commission needed years to get here, and also they may need some more years until the final decision by the European Court of Justice.
In order to have a proper remedy, the competition authority may take too many years, despite the fact that the online market is so quick and the changing. In that sense, I would echo the conclusion of Michael earlier mentioned; I think it may be a good idea to have a tailored, narrow, limited scope ex-ante regulation, which may enhance enforceability for some Big Tech companies.
Of course, the scope of the company subject to the regulation will be limited to those with the huge market share. Perhaps the those who we call the essential facility in our society. Also, the conduct subject to litigation is limited to some obvious self-preferencing conduct, which is not any part of the debate about the divisions of the conduct. Again, self-preferencing is often associated with the introduction of new technology, so we have to rule out any possibility of the kind of chilling effect caused by the introduction of new technology. Overall, we may introduce some ex-ante regulation in the near future in the competition community, but we cannot expect too much from the ex-ante regulation. That’s my thinking right now.

JENNY:
Well, thank you very much to all of you for what has been a very rich debate in a very compressed time period.
A few things came out, I think, from our discussion. The first one is that we will all learn as we go along. And we know probably know more now about the economics of digital platforms than we did four or five years ago, and people like Michael Jacobides, for example, have contributed hugely to the development of the knowledge of what is specific, what is special, how do ecosystems work, and therefore what are the competition issues which were raised.
The second point was that there was general agreement on the fact that self-preferencing because of the specificities of the digital sector has to be distinguished from the traditional approach to self-preferencing, which is much more threatening in the long-term and could possibly block innovation, which is a very important dimension.
There was a feeling that regulation is useful to complement competition law enforcement because competition law enforcement is rather slow. It’s a very detailed and interesting analysis, but sometimes it is too slow. With the possibilities which were evoked that ex-ante regulation would be finely tailored to a few extreme cases of gatekeepers or central facilities, the possibility that there could be a rebuttal on the part of the firms explaining why in their case, it was absolutely necessary to have self-preferencing, and a question mark on whether it should be competition authorities that should be in charge of assessing whether the rebuttal was correct or not, and justified an exemption from the ex-ante regulation.
I want to add, finally, that Marcus Bezzi’s comment on the fact that all the jurisdictions are faced with exactly the same problem because we are talking about a-territorial behavior by a-territorial firms, and that therefore, there would be a huge benefit to the international community coming to some kind of a basic agreement on what ex-ante regulation would be both something that would promote legal predictability, but also legal and economic convergence, and would be very useful.
And certainly, Marcus referred to the OECD. That’s certainly one of the things that we are interested in at OECD. We have been so far trying to develop our understanding of the issues, and we’ll continue to do so with the hope that we can bring together, at least the OECD members, to agree to some kind of a common understanding of what the solution to the problem could be.
Thank you very much to all of you for participating in this debate, and I hope to see you very soon, either in your country or in some other conferences that I’m sure we will have over the next few years on the same kind of topics.
Thank you very much to all of you.

On Tuesday two US government agencies said that they and the European Commission have launched a dialogue focused on competition policy and enforcement in the technology sector, reported Reuters. The US Department of Justice Antitrust Division, the US Federal Trade Commission announced the latest initiative, after Washington and Brussels in September launched the US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC).
The council aims to deepen transatlantic cooperation, strengthen semiconductor supply chains, curb China’s non-market trade practices and take a more unified approach to regulating big, global technology firms.
With the United States and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, such cooperation has become vital to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic who want to make it harder for the US tech industry to fight new rules.
The latest effort, called the EU-U.S. Joint Technology Competition Policy Dialogue, was launched on Tuesday by Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager of the European Commission, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of DOJ’s Antitrust Division.
It will “include sharing insights and experience with an aim towards coordinating as much as possible on policy and enforcement,” the statement said.

769,"December 7, 2021",Skating on Thin Ice: Why Canadian Competition Policy Should Not Be Determined by U.S. Antitrust Enforcement,"

By Navin Joneja & Matthew Prior1
 
The Biden Administration’s approach to aggressive antitrust enforcement is by now well documented, and serves as a stark reminder that U.S. policies can swiftly follow changing political administrations.2 Each new administration appoints leaders of the U.S. agencies who, while insisting they are applying the law, have enforcement inclinations that mirror and emphasize the objectives of the political winds of the time.3 By this token, the outcome of the next U.S. Presidential election in 2024 could again alter the course of U.S. antitrust policy.
What is surprising is that the Canadian Competition Bureau seems keen to track the current political trends in the United States. Public reporting suggests that the Canadian Commissioner of Competition is arguing for a U.S.-styled makeover of Canadian competition laws.4 This would be short sighted: adopting any changes to Canadian competition laws without independently and thoroughly analyzing whether they are well suited for the Canadian economy is ill-advised.
For decades, Canadian competition policy has been appropriately tailored to unique facets of the Canadian economy, recognizing the fact that Canadian industries start from a smaller economic base relative to jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union, and need to remain competitive in the global economy while adapting to longer term economic trends. These are important considerations for Canadian competitiveness, efficiency, and adaptability, and would result in better outcomes for Canadian consumers.
 
Recent Trends in U.S. Antitrust Enforcement and Policy
In the United States, there has been a growing chorus of calls for a shift in antitrust policy to address perceived increases in the power of large companies. These calls have focused on large technology companies whose businesses have changed the American competitive landscape.
President Biden has actively pushed for antitrust reform and aggressive enforcement. In July 2021, his office issued a wide-ranging executive order which focused on encouraging greater scrutiny of mergers in the technology space as well as other issues such as competition in labor markets.5 The Biden Administration supported these policy shifts with personnel changes at key U.S. enforcement agencies, including the appointment of Lina Khan as Chair of the FTC and the nomination of Jonathan Kanter as lead of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division.6
Both Khan & Kanter have clearly suggested the direction in which they intend to take antitrust enforcement in the near term. In a September 22, 2021, memo to FTC staff and commissioners, Chair Khan laid out the her enforcement priorities for the FTC, which include reducing concentration and dominant firm power in U.S. markets by addressing dominant intermediaries and extractive business models including the growing role of private equity and other investment vehicles and contract terms perceived to be abusive.7 In a similar vein, in remarks during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 6, 2021, Kanter expressed skepticism regarding the use of economic analysis in antitrust enforcement, arguing that this approach is inconsistent with U.S. antitrust legislation as written.8
Several recent actions by the U.S. antitrust agencies evidence more aggressive and rigorous antitrust enforcement. Over the past year, the FTC has changed course on four policies that had provided more clarity for merging parties. In each case support or disapproval proceeded along party lines, with the two Republican commissioners opposing deviation from prior practice.
In February 2021, the DOJ and FTC announced a pause on the use of early termination, thus requiring that all mergers subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting requirements wait out the full 30-day9 waiting period before closing, even where transactions are highly unlikely to raise any competitive concerns.10 The change appears to impact approximately half of all deals filed with the antitrust agencies, creating greater uncertainties for merging parties and particularly those engaged in transactions which do not raise serious antitrust issues.
In July 2021, the FTC voted to rescind its 2015 policy statement concerning “standalone” Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.11 Section 5 provides the FTC with certain enforcement authority because the agency is not authorized to bring cases violating some of the “traditional” antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Act, which prohibits collusive conduct and monopolization. Section 5 declares “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce” to be unlawful and is widely viewed as encompassing the traditional antitrust laws, as well as other undefined conduct that contravenes the spirit of the antitrust laws. The 2015 policy statement had established that, when interpreting standalone section 5, (1) the Commission would be guided by the public policy underlying the antitrust laws, namely, the promotion of consumer welfare; (2) the act or practice would be evaluated under a framework similar to the rule of reason, that is, an act or practice challenged by the Commission must cause, or be likely to cause, harm to competition or the competitive process, taking into account any associated cognizable efficiencies and business justifications; and (3) the Commission would be less likely to challenge an act or practice as an unfair method of competition on a standalone basis if enforcement of the Sherman or Clayton Act is sufficient to address the competitive harm arising from the act or practice.12 The prevailing Democratic majority believed that this policy statement unduly limited the FTC’s ability to rely on this section both by tying enforcement under Section 5 to the Sherman Act and by requiring a rule of reason analysis, which the Democratic majority considered toothless and “unwieldy.”13
Also in July 2021, the FTC rescinded its quarter-century-old policy statement that established that the agency would no longer require companies subject to consent agreements to obtain prior approval from the FTC for certain future acquisitions.14 On October 25, 2021, the FTC issued a new policy statement on prior approvals,15 which was issued simultaneously with its first consent decree requiring prior approval.16 Notably, the press release issued in conjunction with publication of the consent decree emphasized that the order “extends the coverage of the prior approval beyond the markets directly impacted by” the transaction.17
In September 2021, the FTC withdrew its approval of the 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines, which had been issued jointly by the FTC and the Antitrust Division,18 and, at least for now, remain in place at the Antitrust Division.19 The Democratic Commissioners voted to rescind on the basis that the guidelines both were based on a flawed economic theory regarding the procompetitive effects of mergers and included an approach to vertical merger review based on an efficiencies analysis not contained in American antitrust law (in line with Jonathan Kanter’s recent testimony, discussed above).20
On the legislative side, high-profile politicians have been advocating for stronger antitrust enforcement and policy changes for some time, including expanding antitrust policy to address a wider range of issues like privacy and income inequality, breaking up Big Tech companies, and amending legislation to better address digital platforms and markets.21 Perhaps the most significant recent proposal in Congress is the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act of 2021, introduced by Amy Klobuchar in February 2021.22 Legislative reform proposals have not been limited to the Democrats; Republicans have put forward reform proposals such as the Tougher Enforcement Against Monopolies Act (proposed by Republican Senators Mike Lee and Chuck Grassley).23 Other proposals have also emerged, such as the legislative agenda offered by various House members, referred to as A Stronger Online Economy: Opportunity, Innovation and Choice.24
The antitrust legislative and policy environment in the United States is in flux and potentially heading into uncharted territory.25 It remains uncertain which legislative proposals will ultimately be implemented or have the most impact and how drastic the antitrust laws will be changed. Recall that in 1977, in what was previously viewed as the highwater mark of U.S. antitrust policy confusion,26 the head of the FTC announced that U.S. antitrust policy should work “to bring the American economy more into line with the nation’s democratic and social ideals,” in part by addressing social and environmental harms such as resource depletion, energy waste, and environmental contamination, as well as worker alienation, and the “psychological and social consequences” of the marketplace.27 Fast forward to 2021, and arguably a new highwater mark of antitrust policy confusion has emerged. The antitrust laws of today, according to some in the current Administration, may be used to address a wide range of issues not traditionally seen as core to antitrust, including economic liberties, democratic accountability, the welfare of workers, farmers, small businesses, start-ups, and local newspaper content.28 At a more basic level, the recent actions by the U.S. agencies (including those described above) have garnered significant criticism and have even caused some to question whether basic norms such as due process and the rule of law are being respected.29
 
Canada Should Not Simply Copy the U.S. Approach to Antitrust Policy or Enforcement
Leaving aside the fact that the future of U.S. antitrust policy remains uncertain, Canada would be better served by not following the United States down this proverbial antitrust rabbit hole. The United States remains Canada’s largest trading partner and closest geopolitical ally. Indeed, recent developments in the United States and other jurisdictions are frequently cited as evidence of the need for change in Canada, most recently by Canada’s Commissioner of Competition.30 However, it is imperative that Canadian policy makers think carefully about which aspects of the current antitrust policy discussion are in fact important, relevant, and applicable to the Canadian context. Adopting specific policy changes simply because they are being considered in the United States risks causing significant harm to Canadian businesses, consumers, and taxpayers, as well as upending the delicate balancing of these stakeholders embodied in the Canadian Competition Act.
Canada’s Economic Priorities Are Not the Same as the United States
Effective competition policy is informed by a country’s economic priorities. Canada’s economy is significantly smaller than the U.S. economy — approximately one-tenth the size — and smaller than Europe’s largest national economies. Germany’s economy is more than twice the size of Canada’s.31 It is important to ensure that Canada’s economic policies support efficiency and innovation to ensure Canada’s global competitiveness. This was made clear in Prime Minister Trudeau’s December 2019 mandate letter to Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, stating that one of the Minister’s priorities was to “[c]ontinue to support Canada’s traditionally strong industries…to increase productivity and innovation, especially as we transition to a low-carbon economy.”32
Unlike U.S. antitrust law,33 Canada’s legislators have articulated clear objectives for Canadian competition policy: the overarching “purpose” clause in the Canadian Competition Act speaks to Canadian economic priorities including promoting competition in order to achieve efficiency and adaptability, expand opportunities for Canadian participation in world markets, support opportunities for small and medium businesses and provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices.34
These priorities are delicately balanced in the existing Competition Act and reflect a defined set of policy goals. The legislative framework of the Competition Act carries out this balancing of objectives and interests throughout its various parts. For example, Canada’s highest judicial body (the Supreme Court) has noted that, with respect to mergers, the need for efficiencies is a paramount objective,35 and the efficiencies exceptions in the Competition Act (section 96 and 90.1) permit mergers and other forms of collaboration that may have anti-competitive effects but create significant efficiencies that outweigh those anti-competitive effects.36 Similarly, Canada’s codified regulated conduct defense also permits certain behavior that would otherwise carry legal sanctions if such conduct is specifically authorized or mandated by a law or regulation.37 Mergers in designated sectors of national importance (e.g. finance, transportation) cannot be blocked if they have been approved by designated Ministers in the Canadian government.38 More generally, Canada’s economy is also generally subject to greater regulation than the U.S. economy. This has served Canadians well in the past (for example with respect to prudential regulation of financial services during the 2008/2009 financial crisis)39 and generally means that Canada has historically used a variety of methods to address competition-related concerns or other forms of market failure. These features of Canada’s competition law regime reflect a balanced approach to competition policy and recognize Canadian-specific economic priorities.
Canada Is Taking a Different Approach to Big Tech
Many jurisdictions are wrestling with the complex and interrelated aspects of antitrust, privacy and data, particularly in relation to social media. In the United States, under the current Biden administration, this has in part led to confusion about the appropriate scope of antitrust policy.40
Canada has taken a more compartmentalized approach by separately proposing legislation (outside of the competition law area) specifically dealing with privacy law and the regulation of internet-based media companies. In November 2020, the Honorable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, introduced Bill C-11, the Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020, which would have overhauled the federal government’s approach to regulating privacy in the private sector.41 The bill would also have enacted the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act (“PIDPTA”) and established an administrative tribunal, which would hear appeals of certain decisions made by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada under the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and impose penalties for contravention of certain of its provisions. Also in November 2020, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-10, An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts.42 This legislation, which would have updated broadcasting legislation and broadened its scope to require digital media broadcasters to contribute to Canada’s broadcasting system, was introduced with a view to supporting Canadian content producers and creators. The legislation was specially designed to bring social media and other online platforms into the fold broadcasting regulation.
While neither piece of proposed legislation has been enacted, dealing with privacy law and social media companies in separate, standalone legislation may very well address many of the policy concerns being raised by antitrust reform advocates in the Untied States and elsewhere such that drastic and untested changes to Canada’s competition laws are not necessary.
It is also not clear that competition law reforms targeted at the digital economy in Canada will be significantly impactful. Large multinational tech companies tend to view the United States and Europe as the key competition regulators when making business decisions. Accordingly, significant competition law enforcement initiatives in those jurisdictions are likely to have a much more significant impact on Big Tech behavior than any changes to Canada’s laws. Rather than introducing sweeping legislative changes that may not be appropriate for the Canadian economy, there are a variety of other more practical mechanisms that Canada can use to ensure it meaningfully contributes to the international competition policy conversation (e.g. sharing of information, coordination on merger remedies). It is also worth noting that the Bureau’s two active merger challenges currently before the courts relate to grain elevators and oil and gas waste disposal services, not firms participating in the digital economy.
Finally, changes to Canadian competition laws (premised on a supposed need to address concerns related to global internet platforms and social media companies) would have significant unintended consequences for a wide range of other industries, including those that are the primary drivers of the Canadian economy. Other industries with a large Canadian presence — manufacturing, oil and gas, financial services, aerospace, agriculture and transportation, to name a few — each have their own unique characteristics that would need to be taken into account.43 Indeed, a review of the industry sectors that make up the bulk of merger transactions reviewed by the Bureau shows that the merger laws in Canada are more relevant to manufacturing, real estate, mining, and financial services companies, rather than technology companies.
These industries are facing their own challenges, including remaining relevant in a global economy and adapting to transformative climate change policies. A thoughtful discussion about competition policy in Canada would more appropriately focus on these industries and their challenges. In contrast, global internet platforms and social media companies are by and large not based in Canada; their presence in Canada is a by-product of their global reach rather than any uniquely Canadian features. Amendments to the Competition Act that might be designed to address concerns regarding the digital economy are bound to have unintended and unforeseen knock-on consequences given that the Competition Act is a framework statute of general application.44
Need Objective Evidence to Warrant Changes
Canada has experience in emulating U.S. antitrust rules, with mixed results. Most prominently, in 2009, Canada’s merger review laws and laws relating to competitor collaborations were both significantly amended in order to “modernize” the regime by replicating the existing antitrust laws and polices in place south of the border. Canada’s merger review process is now essentially the same as the HSR merger review process in most respects (30 day waiting period which can be extended by the agency information request until 30 days after such information request is complied with). Likewise, Canada’s law regarding competitor collaborations now includes a per se offense for hard-core cartels while maintaining a rule-of-reason approach for other types of joint ventures. The driving rationale behind these amendments to Canadian competition law in 2009 and 2010 was in fact the integration of the Canadian and U.S. economies.45
Commentators have long suggested that these reforms do not actually suit Canada’s interests.46 For example, the merger review process is often criticized by both the Bureau and private parties, albeit for different reasons.47 The Bureau, which advocated for the U.S.-style merger review process, now suggests that the already extended timeframes do not provide it with enough time to assess any efficiencies created by a merger, in the event that merging firms intend to rely on the efficiencies exception contained in the Competition Act.48 Many private parties take the opposite position, arguing that the current merger review process already leads to undue merger delays.49 In actuality, of the thousands of transactions reviewed by the Canadian Competition Bureau since 2009 (when the merger review laws in Canada were last reformed), only a handful have been cleared on the basis of the efficiency exception.50
In any event, is not clear that the merger landscape has changed significantly since the Bureau’s last review of the Competition Act such that significant reforms are warranted. As recently as 2018, the Bureau studied the suitability of the Competition Act for the new digital economy and found that “there is little evidence that a new approach to competition policy is needed.”51 Since this review, the percentage of files classified by the Competition Bureau as “complex” has remained largely unchanged and the total number of files has remained fairly constant as compared to pre-pandemic levels.52
A shift towards the aggressive U.S.-style of antitrust enforcement now taking place would unnecessarily bring about even more uncertainty, delay and confusion for companies doing business in Canada, as the U.S. policies have already had this effect on companies doing business in the United States. As a smaller economy, the effects of this business uncertainty may be more glaring. Canada has a greater need to attract foreign investment and capital. Canada can attract such foreign investment and capital by showing that its regulatory environment supports efficient, productive companies able to compete on global terms. Creating uncertainty, delay, and confusion for companies doing business in Canada will have the exact opposite effect.
Canadian Competition Law Has Not Been Static
As the United States and other countries consider changes to their antitrust laws, Canadian competition law enforcement also has been evolving in line with recent trends and developments (in typical Canadian fashion, with little fanfare).
The digital economy is a centerpiece of the Bureau’s Strategic Vision and the Commissioner of Competition has described the Bureau as being “at the forefront of the digital economy.”53 In addition, the Competition Bureau has been incrementally increasing its competition law enforcement efforts. For instance:

The Competition Bureau has enhanced its intelligence gathering efforts to review non-notifiable transactions that fall below the current financial thresholds that would trigger mandatory pre-merger notification.54
The Bureau is making more public information available regarding ongoing merger reviews and conduct cases, with a view to obtaining more public input.55
A new Digital Enforcement and Intelligence Branch has been created to centralize expertise on tech and data issues and provide an early warning system for potentially anti-competitive behaviour.56

Most importantly, the Competition Bureau recently secured a significant increase in its budget with over C$200 million in additional resources available over the next 10 years. This is likely to bring about significantly enhanced competition law enforcement in Canada for the foreseeable future and further calls into question the need for significant reform.
  
The Road Ahead for Canada
From a public policy perspective, the Canadian Competition Act is a balanced and complex framework law. It is considered one of the most economically sophisticated antitrust regimes in the world.57 It would be a marked step backwards for Canadian competition policy if significant changes were made simply for the sake of change. Canada’s Competition Act was extensively modernized in 2009 after a comprehensive assessment of Canada’s competitiveness in the Compete to Win report.58 The report considered 155 submissions by a wide range of stakeholders and contained 65 recommendations.
Canada’s competition policy should focus on Canadian economic priorities. Identifying those priorities should be subject to debate and change, but what should be avoided is reflexive emulation of policy developments in the United States and elsewhere that do not translate well to the Canadian context. Over-reliance on the larger jurisdictions as a guiding light for Canada could easily result in the adoption of policies that do not reflect Canadian economic realities.

770,"December 6, 2021",What Lessons Can Be Drawn For Digital Platforms From The Regulation Of Traditional Networks,"
Traditional investor-owned network industries in communications, energy, transport and water have been regulated for more than a century. It is therefore timely to ask if this experience has any lessons for digital platforms. One key issue is whether standard competition law suffices in either case. The answer for traditional networks is a resounding no, and the conclusion is gaining ground that sector-specific regulation, with its more interventionist traditions and specialist delivery, is required for the largest digital platforms too. In traditional networks this often involves a combination of price controls of activities where market power allows excess profits, and the promotion of competition across the value chain where it is feasible, via divestment, inter-connection, or entry based on access to residual monopoly assets. In the case of major digital platforms requiring interoperability between the largest platform and its rivals seems the most promising route, but it will require major regulatory effort to put it into effect.

By Martin Cave1
  
I. INTRODUCTION
Privately-owned traditional network industries – notably in communications, energy, and transport – have been around in the U.S. at least since the 1880s, and in Europe in their post-nationalization form since the 1980s. The industries exhibit the twin characteristics of natural monopoly, especially in their local distribution network, and provision of a service essential to human survival, and this has made them the subject of intense regulation, which invariably goes beyond the generic competition law in the relevant jurisdiction.
Large digital platforms are a 21st century phenomenon. By virtue of being untethered to a physical network in a specific place, and hence global, they can aspire to span, and have spanned, the world almost instantaneously and a very low cost. By 2021, firms strongly reliant on such platforms occupy five of the top six slots in global financial market valuations.
The question addressed discussed in this article is: what lessons can the regulation of large digital platforms draw from these earlier experiences? There is no denying the significant difference between the characteristics of each – notably, the universal, essential and stable nature of the demand for the services of traditional network industries, as distinct from what may prove the more transient demand for digital platforms; the crucial role and speed (often measured in weekends) of inventiveness in determining the fate of digital platforms, contrasted with the time taken (measured in decades) in network industries to embody technical change in highly capital intensive processes; and of course the wildly different back stories in the two cases of some of the firms and their founders. Not for many years will it be possible to compare the achievements of Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, with those of Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg.
In the meantime, what both varieties of network sectors exhibit is the notional or practiced ability to exert a high and conspicuous degree of power in their respective marketplaces, maintained over a substantial run of years. This fact alone, combined with the nature of the services supplied, gives them a social and economic importance which inevitably attracts political and public attention.
Answering the question here involves first a look at what has happened in traditional networks, and then an attempt to draw lessons for platform regulation. The second part is more conjectural, especially for an author whose primary experience has been in regulating traditional networks, but it is timely when major changes in the public policy approach to the largest digital platforms are now in urgent contemplation.
  
II. WHAT ARE THE DEFINING FEATURES OF TRADITIONAL NETWORK REGULATION? 
A. Who Needs Sector-Specific Regulation Anyway? 
At the start of the post-privatization period in the 1980s, the need for regulation of traditional network industries was tested in a natural experiment in New Zealand, a country then in the throes of radical pro-market reforms. It chose to rely on its then new generic competition law, rather than the more intrusive regulation used elsewhere, to deal with its energy and telecommunications sectors. The result is almost universally agreed to be a failure. Years elapsed before an entrant’s attempts to use competition law to gain access to the incumbent’s “essential facilities” were finally decided. A commentator has written: “this laissez-faire approach failed to generate a socially optimal outcome, as the general competition rules proved inadequate to address exploitative behavior by incumbent firms, such as price-gouging, which in other jurisdictions is controlled by sector-specific regulators. From the late 1990s onwards, the New Zealand government began enacting sector-specific regulation for the telecommunications, electricity, and gas industries, which moreover has been progressively strengthened over time.”2
B. Controlling Persistent Natural Monopolies 
The core of traditional network industry intervention has been output price controls set by a sector-specific regulator, either of the whole value chain, when the monopoly is vertically integrated, or at the least of the local distribution network, which strong economies of density have in most cases made a highly capital-intensive natural monopoly.
The traditional method of doing this is to use a so-called “building blocks” approach to calculate and allow recovery of the network’s costs of operation, including its operating costs and its capital costs (for which purpose a valuation of capital and an allowed rate of return are required). Cost-plus pricing schemes of this kind exhibit almost no incentive for efficiency, and coincident with the European privatizations of the 1980s, an alternative known as incentive or price cap regulation came into use. Both processes suffer from asymmetry of cost information between regulator and firm, and by gaming behavior by the latter; accordingly, in many jurisdictions levels of return have persistently exceeded the cost of capital by a significant amount. Any incentives for innovation have generally not worked well.
C. Developing Competition Across the Value Chain
Suppose investment is taking place in a new suburb in which new local distribution networks are needed, or a new electricity transmission line is required. It would be quite possible to create competition for the market, by putting the provision of the service out to tender. In principle, this could extend to all investment projects, both new and replacement, ultimately turning network regulation into a process in which a public agency juggles a set of locationally and temporally over-lapping contracts, with the resulting co-ordination costs. But it may work better if confined to projects which are new, large, separable, and not too time-critical.
A more widespread and fruitful approach is to seek to introduce competition in the network industries market, by starting, say, with a fully vertically integrated monopoly, and then examining the scope for allowing entrants to compete with the incumbent in the activities which are most hospitable to entrants. Assuming – as is usually the case – that the retailing activity is potentially competitive, an entrant there can invest in the skill of acquiring and billing customers, and buy upstream monopolized physical services from the incumbent, on terms set by the regulator – which will have “unbundled” them for this specific purpose, and set an “access price” for them, using one of the price control mechanisms noted above. The entrant is then emboldened progressively to duplicate further network products, in order of their amenability to entry. This may be accompanied by rules requiring some form of separation into vertical components of the historic monopolist, in order to prevent it from leveraging its market power from monopoly into competitive arenas.
In the EU’s fixed telecommunications sector, this process achieved a transformation such that while in 2000 competition was almost entirely confined to the retail function alone, undertaken by firms which simply “resold” the incumbent’s products, in 2021 in some member states competitors now rely on the historic monopolist solely for access to ducts and poles which carry their own fibers, and themselves supply everything else or buy it competitively. Correspondingly, the competition problem in the sector is increasingly taking the form of collective rather than single firm dominance.  
D. The Role of Network Externalities
A particular factor operates in a communications network. It arises from the fact that your willingness to pay for access to it depends on the number of people you can contact on it. In 1880, Alexander Graham Bell said of his invention: one day every American city will have a telephone. If that had been it, voice telephony’s impact would have been limited, because it is clearly the ability to make and receive calls to and from numerous different people or organizations which gave telephony its value: the more people connected the better.
As competing networks arose in telecommunications, first in fixed and then much more quickly in mobile telephony, regulators quickly intervened to limit this risk of monopolization by requiring all network operators to interconnect – i.e. to pass on to, and (for a fee) accept for completion, any call from any other operator. We see below that a supercharged version of network externalities may operate in digital platforms.
D. The Telecoms Precedent 
Finally, we consider specifically the implications for platform regulation of what has happened in the telecommunications sector. Beyond interoperability rules, EU regulation in that sector over the past twenty years has operated in a manner which straddles the two spaces of traditional network regulation and competition law. More particularly, a single underlying and consciously pro-competitive regime, adaptable in its operations to changing circumstances, has been successful in shifting the whole sector towards a much lighter touch. The same regime has operated in both mobile and fixed telecommunications – much less obtrusively in the former where network duplication is easier and the burden of regulation is largely shared between application of the standard merger regime and the insertion into spectrum licenses of rules and obligations designed by national regulators both to prevent the monopolization of that key natural resource, and to ensure that network coverage is equitable. A lynchpin of the regime is that all of the more intrusive regulatory remedies are subject to sunset clauses: they can only be renewed in any market if a firm is found to be exercising, and expected to continue to exercise, significant market power.3
Thus, as in other areas of economic regulation, competition law and regulation are complementary, not substitutes. The key design problem is to get them to work together in combination, with the contributions of each shifting over time: in telecoms towards competition, in digital platforms now towards regulation.
Casual observation suggests also that in many jurisdictions competition law and regulation are practiced by different communities. The competition law community comprises a few public officials and very many private sector lawyers, and focusses heavily on supporting and maintaining competitive processes. Regulatory activity is more economist-dominated with a focus on maximizing some form of social welfare function, employing the dark arts of social cost-benefit analysis, and applying more robust instruments. When additional economic regulation is required, it makes a difference which community is entrusted with it.
 
III. LESSONS FOR THE REGULATION OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS
A. Why Can’t Existing Competition Law Cope with Digital Platforms? 
Firms which provide intermediation between separate groups, now christened two-sided platforms, ante-date competition law itself by thousands of years, and in most of competition law’s century or so of existence have attracted relatively little attention. This is no longer the case, now that they dominate the top of the “most valuable corporation” lists.
This is not itself a reason for throwing the existing rule book away and starting again. At present competition authorities have no choice but to apply existing competition law to them. They are helped in this by guidance provided by such organizations as the OECD. Most of this work goes on under the radar. My own experience includes conducting a competition inquiry in the UK into a merger between two food-ordering platforms with non-negligible market shares, which were pure intermediaries.4 The process involved defining markets and analyzing likely competitive effects. Data on single- and multi-homing were collected. The presence of multiple local markets permitted some inferences to be drawn on whether the indirect network effects continued to multiply as firm size grew, or were quite soon exhausted (as the data suggest was the case). These analytical tasks were more or less accomplished.
But a case of this kind is a million miles away from the persistent dominance of gigantic companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, which conduct businesses of major social prominence and controversy. Within the framework of competition law and policy, a number of changes have been proposed for such companies, particularly within the merger framework. These include a tougher restriction on potential “killer acquisitions” or a reversal of the burden of proof in a merger inquiry, shifting it from the relevant authority onto an acquirer falling into a specified class. More radically, review and possible reversal of past merger decisions have been proposed. But in many jurisdictions, the focus has shifted to choosing the complementary form of regulation.
While traditional network industries are inherently local, in the sense of providing service in particular areas, and can be regulated nationally, major digital platforms are global, and hence will most effectively be regulated in a fashion which will be determined largely by legislators and regulators in Brussels and Washington and a few other countries.
B. The Role of Market Tipping
Digital platforms exhibit an additional form of network effects than telecommunications network. When a subscriber to a social platform is joined by a friend, they both benefit directly. But an advertiser will now pay more for their attention of both of them, and this allows the network to raise its production values. So, indirectly, a third person will join, and so on and so on. These combined network effects help the biggest network the most. In the end the market might tip into a monopoly. By then it would be too late. So should we adopt a “predict and forestall” strategy?
Market tipping is thus a specter at the feast in this discussion. But there is a risk of a contagious moral panic over tipping. A few years ago, concern was quite widely expressed that the ride-hailing market was on the point of tipping into a monopoly in many jurisdictions. Instead in many city markets in the US, for example, it seems to exhibit a fairly stable and sedate duopoly.
There would also be the issue of how to make an appropriately graduated regulatory response to the expectation of market tipping. In the case of ride-hailing, this might vary across a spectrum beginning with obligations on the largest firms to share some of their data with rivals, which allow the regulator to monitor market developments, (possibly) license restrictions clipping the wings of the largest networks, (if better data are the source of the network externalities) an obligation on large firms to share such data. The final stage – pretty much equivalent to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted – might be controlling the price of the service.5
C. What is to be Done? Some Comments on Possible Interventionist Remedies for Regulating Large Digital Platforms, Inspired by the Experience of Traditional Network Regulation
There are many more or less well-developed proposals for how to regulate large digital platforms, some in the form of draft legislation. The aim here is not to present a coherent set of proposals but to identify discrete parallels with, and possibly learnings from, more traditional network regulation.

Selectivity in application. As noted above, from its birth in 2003, the EU telecoms regulatory regime, inspired by competition law, has focused its full force on a small subset of network (and other) firms, using as its criterion an extension of the competition law conception of dominance. Regulatory proposals for digital platforms typically do not piggyback on a similarly hallowed concept, but confine their application to the largest two-sided platforms, christened in the EU “gatekeepers” producing “core platform services.” These platforms share an affinity in terms of size, business model and the digital and data technology they use, rather than are based on something akin to a standard industrial classification. This seems not only justifiable but even necessary.
User protection. The essential nature of the services provided by traditional network industries, together with in many cases the monopoly status of the supplier, has led in many jurisdictions to higher-than- normal levels of protection for customers, particularly domestic customers. For example, firms regularly have universal service obligations, and it may be unlawful for an energy or water supplier to cut off service for non-payment of bills, except under the strictest of conditions.

Digital platforms provide a variety of services, from communications to shopping to a great deal else. One aspect which they have in common with traditional network industries, however, is their collection of vast amounts of user data. Access to a family’s ongoing electricity consumption can disclose its absence from the house as reliably as holiday pictures posted on Facebook. Hence an equivalent need to regulate for data security and the protection of privacy. It is worth noting that, since data are the currency in digital, data protection rules such as the GDPR provide an incidental brake on those platforms’ profits. But other communications platform issues – mendacious content, damaging communications with juveniles, unlawful political meddling, etc. – have no equivalent in traditional network regulation.

Control of monopoly profits. Regulation of traditional utilities almost invariably revolves fundamentally around controlling the use of the firms’ market power which would otherwise lead to excess returns. The way this operates in practice through price control has been described above. It may be useful to ask how in principle a similar regime to limit profits might be applied in the case of a major digital platform.

Several of them – notably Facebook and Google – make services available to users at a price of zero, yet remain fabulously profitable from digital advertising revenues. To eliminate such profits by regulation rather than taxation (or price control in digital advertising markets), prices would have to go negative. The negative price could be accomplished by the platforms paying a fixed fee to their users, set by the regulator. Alternatives could easily be constructed which inserted more incentive for the platform to reduce costs or increase revenues. The existing and widely discussed regulatory remedy closest to that described here is to require payments to users for the data which platforms monetize when selling those users’ attention to advertisers. In the version above, these payments would be designed to transfer excess returns to users. This would give the activity some of the characteristics of a co-operative in which users would be the residual legatees of any surpluses. It is clearly not fanciful to suppose that this would have an adverse effect on innovation on the platform, with a consequent effect on its life expectancy.

 It is a standard remedy in competition law to require a firm to divest itself of certain assets, in order to remedy the anti-competitive effects of a proposed merger, after a finding of abuse of market power, or following a market investigation. Thus under the UK competition regime, disposals have been required after a finding of adverse effects on competition from firm co-ordination in the cement industry. The same outcome flowed from market investigations in the regulated airport and gas sectors. Specific sectoral regulatory proposals have been brought forward in several countries which would allow airports to keep unified control of runways but divest, and introduce competition in the provision of terminal facilities. As noted above, in the USA there are calls to use competition law to revisit and undo acquisitions made some years in the past quite far in the past by Facebook (of WhatsApp and Instagram) and by Google.

In the case of traditional networks such cases it is relatively straightforward to value the total mostly tangible capital and divide it equitably among several firms. But intangible capital in the forms of intellectual property, organizational know-how, and data and data-handling capability would be harder to value and separate, especially if these attributes had already been scrambled over several activities by a firm anticipating such a remedy. Also, benefits from any such action would be counterbalanced by the loss of beneficial network effects.

 The problem of direct network effects was elegantly solved by telecommunications regulators – by simply requiring the interconnection of networks. Thus Art 4.1 of the EU’s 2002 Electronic Communications Services Access Directive simply states: “Operators of public communications networks shall have a right and, when requested by other undertakings so authorized, an obligation to negotiate interconnection with each other for the purpose of providing publicly available electronic communications services…” The phraseology relied on the common understanding reached by then of what was meant by interoperability and interconnection.

In the case of digital platforms, the work must start from scratch. A possible early example might be that, via agreed application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and standards, a user of Facebook might receive a friend request from someone on a rival network; then content would flow back and forth between the two networks. Other examples are provided by data interoperability. Thus a search engine rival to Google might have right to obtain an organic search result from the latter and integrate it into its offerings.6 This would be separate and additional to obligations relating to the portability across of customer data. But whereas interoperability in a telecommunications context involves a fairly uniform generic application, each species of regulated digital platform will pose different problems, each fought over by the relevant parties.7
These remedies share with the unbundling remedy in traditional network regulation the notion that another way of dealing with market power than price control is to require the monopolist to share its resources with competitors. The natural arena in which such an outcome might be accomplished is a regulatory one, since regulators inevitably have continuous, rather than episodic, relations with the firms they regulate, and years’ experience of corralling firms to find solutions to technical issues in consumers’ interests. Legislation would set out the principles to be adopted in deciding where and possibly how to mandate interoperability. The actual regulatory decisions would require difficult trade-offs – already made in telecommunications over the regulation of fiber networks, for example – between immediate benefits for consumers from competition and longer-term benefits from greater innovation inspired by higher rewards for successful investors. They would also be subject to an appeal regime.
  
IV. CONCLUSION 
The focus proposed in many jurisdictions on confining regulation to a small number of the largest digital platforms seems both sensible and probably inevitable. I see no special awkwardness in defining this group in a way which is based on the likely scale of consumer detriment rather than a criterion used previously in a different context.
It looks as if a major foundation of traditional network industry regulation – direct price control of significant parts of the value chain – is not very likely expressly to be reflected in the economic regulation of digital platforms. Nor does there seem to be much value in another stand-by remedy in that field, the horizontal (or vertical) separation of the dominant firm.
The most promising affinity with traditional network regulation lies with the mandating of interoperability in telecommunications, where such interoperability was able to counteract what would otherwise have been insuperable disadvantages for fledgling entrants, arising from direct network effects. In the case of digital platforms the same remedy looks able to counteract a dominant firm’s advantages arising from both direct and indirect network effects. This option looks to me to be by far the most practicable read-across from traditional regulation, although one which will require an immense and varied amount of expertise and labor.
Finally, for this option to be successfully realized, the mind set and experience of those individuals performing the task, in whatever institutional framework it were done, would ideally be those of a regulator, preferably with an explicit goal of furthering consumer welfare, and accustomed to conduct a long-term and technical relationship with a fairly small number of regulatees, rather than those versed in the activities of a competition authority, generally having episodic and non-technical relations with many firms.

771,"December 6, 2021",What Should We Do About The Big Tech Monopolies?,"
In this essay, I pursue two paths. In the first, I revisit the beginnings of U.S. antitrust law to emphasize that that law has long had a policy of permitting firms to grow organically into dominant market positions. The Sherman Act created an anti-trust policy, not a broad anti-monopoly policy. And that remained true even as U.S. antitrust law moved in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act with The Federal Trade Commission Act and The Clayton Act. I then turn to the second path. The history described in the first section suggests that, by design, there are fundamental limits on how U.S. antitrust law can respond to firms that have achieved great, legitimate success. But firms can stray and that brings them within antitrust. Case settlements move faster than litigation and put on the table many of the tools that we associate with regulation, such as nondiscrimination obligations, access rights, and line-of-business restrictions.

Sue them? Regulate them? Both? The rise of the big tech firms has created a moment of possible change in how those firms are regulated. You really do need a scorecard to keep track of the pending antitrust suits and investigations of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. (Microsoft, so far, seems to be mainly below the radar). The same is true of pending bills in the U.S. Congress. It is easier in Europe, where both the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are under consideration, though as soon as we turn to the member states possible responses grow quickly, where Germany has been an early mover. If we switch to Asia, South Korea has moved to regulate app stores. This is platform regulation organized around the gatekeeping positions of the big tech firms.
Antitrust and regulation are different approaches to possible controls over these firms. U.S. antitrust laws are organized around ideas of fault, market definition, and market power. Litigation in the U.S. is a slow path to change and the same is true in Europe. New laws offer the promise of a quick regime change, though the lessons of regulatory statutes like the Telecommunications Act of 1996 make clear that vague statutes can also lead to litigation timelines measured in decades over the language of new statutes.
In this essay, I pursue two paths. In the first, I revisit the beginnings of U.S. antitrust law to emphasize that that law has long had a policy of permitting firms to grow organically into dominant market positions. The Sherman Act created an anti-trust policy, not a broad anti-monopoly policy. And even as U.S. antitrust law moved in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act with The Federal Trade Commission Act and The Clayton Act, leading voices of that era — soon-to-be-Justice Louis Brandeis and soon-to-be-President Woodrow Wilson — made clear that even though they opposed the trusts, they were not opposed to firms that achieved their market positions though legitimate competition and organic growth.
I then turn to the second path. The history described in the first section suggests that, by design, there are fundamental limits on how U.S. antitrust law can respond to firms that have achieved great, legitimate success. But firms born through innovation do not necessarily always stay on the righteous path and that, appropriately and again by design, brings them within the grasp of antitrust. Case settlements can be powerful tools in part because they can move faster than full-tilt litigation with trials and appeals and in part because settlements put on the table many of the tools that we associate with regulation, such as nondiscrimination obligations, access rights, and line-of-business restrictions.
As that suggests, there is some overlap between how antitrust can operate and how new platform legislation is likely to be framed. The AT&T cases in the U.S. provide a useful touchstone here, as antitrust and legislation moved in parallel even as they pursued similar ends with many of the same instruments. Right now, in Europe, the momentum behind legislation there almost certainly reflects frustration over the inability of the competition policy authorities to achieve more on-the-ground competitive changes even as they have, so far at least, issued a series of fines and rulings against Google and in an earlier era against Microsoft. In the U.S., the public cases against, so far, Amazon, Facebook and Google are still quite young and possible legislation seems to have more momentum as both Republicans and Democrats express often different frustrations with the big tech firms. That said, the big tech firms have achieved their positions by providing products valued by the public and regulation, via antitrust or through new statutes, should ensure that the value of those products is not lost through new clumsy rules.
  
I. LEGITIMATE MONOPOLIES IN EARLY U.S. ANTITRUST LAW
The best place to start to understand what Senator Sherman hoped to accomplish is with the text of the legislation he introduced. On August 14, 1888, Sherman introduced S.3445 into the 1st Session of the Fiftieth Congress and the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance. The title of the bill — “To declare unlawful trusts and combinations in restraint of trade and production” — gives a good sense of Sherman’s central goal. In the first session of the next Congress, Sherman once again introduced his bill, now as S.1. On March 18, 1890, Sherman introduced a revised version of the bill to navigate possible objections that had been raised regarding the constitutionality of the bill.1
But the core of Sherman’s approach had not changed between 1888 and 1890. Sherman was focused on joint activity, not single firm activity. His bill targeted “arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between two or more citizens or corporations.” Which of those were declared “to be against public policy, unlawful and void?” Those which were made with a view to, or which tended “to prevent full and free competition” relating to imports or in “articles of growth, production, or manufacture.” In addition to those limits, Sherman wanted to declare unlawful “arrangements, trusts or combinations between such citizens or corporations” “made with a view to or which tend to advance the cost to the consumer of any such articles.” Sherman was looking to ban joint activity that interfered with competition, or which raised prices to consumers.
Sherman clearly was targeting the rise of the trusts, hence the characterization of this proposed bill as “anti-trust.” The trusts represented an effort by capitalists to bring competing enterprises together in a single great organization. Unsurprisingly, trusts had their defenders and Samuel Dodd, the lawyer for and brains behind the Standard Oil Trust, offered a spirited defense of trusts in the New York Daily Tribune on February 2, 1890. But Dodd was running against the popular tide.3
Sherman lost control of his bill in the Senate and on March 27, 1890, it was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. A week later, on April 2, 1890, Senator Edmunds came to the full Senate with an amended version of Sherman’s bill. The amendment struck all of Sherman’s language — really all — and the new language would become what we think of as the now-familiar language of the “Sherman” Act when it was enacted on July 2, 1890. And as is probably clear from the discussion so far, Sherman’s original bill did not use the word “monopoly” or “monopolize” and only pursued joint activities and not those by single firms.4
On April 8, 1890, the Senate turned to consider the Judiciary Committee draft. Sherman himself had exited the debate, saying that he would vote for the new draft deeming it “the best under all the circumstances that the Senate is prepared to give in this direction.” But even as the Senate was moving to vote, Senator Kenna raised a question about the meaning of the new language in Section 2. Kenna posed a hypothetical involving someone who “by his own skill and energy, by the propriety of his conduct generally, shall pursue his calling to in such a way as to monopolize a trade.” As Kenna continued to talk, he ran at the hypo again, focusing on someone “who happens by his skill and energy to command an innocent and legitimate monopoly of a business.” The proposed new statute would be a criminal statute and Kenna wanted to know if this behavior was a crime.5
Senator Edmunds who had brought the revised draft from the Judiciary Committee assured Senator Kenna that his hypos were outside the scope of Section 2: “Anybody who knows the meaning of the word ‘monopoly,’ as the courts apply it, would not apply it to such a person at all; and I am sure that my friend must understand that.” Edmunds would quickly take a second run at his answer: “It does not do anything of this kind, because in the case stated the gentlemen has not any monopoly at all. He has not bought off his adversaries. He has not got possession of all the horned cattle of the United States. He has not done anything but compete with his adversaries in trade if he had any, to furnish the commodity for the lowest price. So, I assure my friend that he need not be disturbed upon the subject.”6
The byplay on the floor of the Senate between the two senators gave a sense of what was excluded and included under the new language of Section 2. Legitimately obtained monopoly was outside of Section 2 and of course Section 1 only addressed joint activity and so would not cover single-entity monopoly. Monopolization required more, such as buying off adversaries or some other illegitimate business act.
Jump to the presidential election of 1912. The trusts had continued to be the subject of inquiry and possible legislation. And in its 1911 ruling in Standard Oil, the U.S. Supreme Court had resolved a key interpretative question regarding Section 1 of the Sherman Act in concluding that that section barred only unreasonable restraints of trade. Louis Brandeis, who would join the Supreme Court on June 1, 1916, was then a private lawyer in Boston but he was a central participant in the discussion about what to do about the trusts.7
Brandeis drew a clear line between the trusts — a tool that typically brought competing businesses together to limit competition — and what Brandeis sometimes termed “natural” monopoly. Those were firms that had achieved their position not through combination but rather through natural, organic, internal growth. Firms that had succeeded through legitimate competition in the marketplace. Brandeis was skeptical that the latter really existed, but he was clear about how more efficient firms should be treated: “There is nothing in our industrial history to indicate that there is any need whatever to limit the natural growth of a business to preserve competition. We may emphatically declare: ‘Give fair play to efficiency.’”8
Brandeis’s framing gives rise to an obvious question: if we were to focus on the large industrial enterprises of his era, what was the mix between the competition-limiting trusts and firms that had achieved their position through organic growth? I do not know the answer to that question, but even as Brandeis was speaking and writing, there was one prominent example of Brandeis’s so-called natural monopoly: the Aluminum Company of America. On May 19, 1912, The New York Times offered an update on five recent cases: The Powder Trust; The Standard Oil Trust; The Tobacco Trust; The Electric Lamp Trust; and what it termed The Aluminum Trust. Even as it described — almost certainly mistakenly — Alcoa as a trust, it explained why the government had not moved to dissolve the company: “That company is not a combination of former competitors but has obtained a practical monopoly of the business through its own growth, with valuable patents and almost complete control of known deposits of bauxite, the base of aluminum.” A business built on government patents to be sure but built on its own internal growth and success.9
Woodrow Wilson would win the 1912 presidential election. One of the issues that he campaigned on was the trust issue and he would subsequently publish a book of those speeches, framed in the overarching vision of what he called The New Freedom. In Chapter VIII of that book, Wilson addressed Monopoly, or Opportunity?. Even as Wilson highlighted the risks posed to society by the trusts, especially in his view the money trust or what he said really was the credit trust, Wilson repeatedly distinguished his views on the trusts from those of big businesses that grew organically through legitimate competition. Wilson announced that “I am for big business, and I am against the trusts.” Wilson did not fear big businesses: “I admit that any large corporation built up by the legitimate processes of business, by economy, by efficiency is natural; and I am not afraid of it, no matter how big it grows.” And Wilson closed the chapter by returning to those ideas: “I know, and every man in his heart knows, that the only way to enrich America is to make it possible for any man who has the brains to get into the game. I am not jealous of any business that has grown to that size. I am not jealous of any process of growth, no matter how huge the result, provided the result was indeed obtained by the processes of wholesome development, which are the processes of efficiency, of economy, of intelligence, and of invention.”10
  
II. THE INTERSECTION OF ANTITRUST AND PLATFORM REGULATION
There are a few takeaways from that brief look at the origins of U.S. antitrust law. It was, first and foremost, anti-trust law. The trusts were artificial combinations that limited competition and restoring that competition was the goal. And government-created monopolies bestowed by kings and queens were condemned. But there was no general condemnation of monopoly as such as is clear in the through line from the 1890 Senate floor debates over the draft bill to Brandeis and Wilson during the 1912 election. A firm could compete legitimately and grow to dominate its market. Size as such was not the issue, but how the firm behaved mattered for whether liability would be found.
That suggests that there was a core limit on what antitrust can do against firms that grew to dominate their markets. But, at the same time, successful firms could overstep and face antitrust suits, and while winning those suits would usually require a showing of fault, settlements can be powerful levers for changing market competition. Take one prominent example: the U.S. government’s settlements with AT&T in 1956 and 1982. Both of those were consensual settlements cut between AT&T and the U.S. government, and, given that, neither required a full-blown finding of fault. It was enough that a finding of fault was possible and that both sides saw a deal as the way forward to resolve the situation.
In both situations, it is worth paying attention to the timelines of the settlements. On January 15, 1949, the U.S. government brought an antitrust suit against AT&T seeking to split up AT&T and to force AT&T to license certain of its patents on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. Seven years later, on January 24, 1956, the government and AT&T settled the case. Seven years for a settled case. The 1956 AT&T final judgment had two core provisions both of which are of the sort that we often associate with platform regulation. The first was an access provision that opened AT&T’s patents on extremely favorable terms, while the second was a line-of-business restriction that boxed in AT&T in communications markets and excluded it from other markets, particularly the young computing market. Both of those provisions almost certainly had important consequences. The patents licensing regime boosted innovation, while barring AT&T from computing almost certainly made it easier for IBM to build up its market position.11
On November 21, 1974, the U.S. government once again brought an antitrust lawsuit seeking to break up the firm. As that suit continued to run, Congress considered new laws to address telecommunications competition. On October 7, 1981, by a 90-4 vote, the Senate approved a draft bill that would have resolved many of the pending competition issues and if the House of Representatives had move forward, it was likely the government would have dropped the pending lawsuit.12
But on January 8, 1982, the U.S. government and AT&T announced a settlement of the pending antitrust suit, this time one that would breakup AT&T. AT&T would eventually be split into eight large firms: AT&T proper as a long-distance company freed of most of the restrictions of the 1956 final judgment and seven regional Bell operating companies (“RBOCs”) providing local telephone service. The settlement created nondiscrimination obligations to boost long-distance competition while also imposing line-of-business restrictions on the RBOCs and much more limited ones on AT&T.13
The AT&T case frames the current situation with the big tech firms nicely. The U.S. government and the various states have antitrust suits pending against Amazon, Facebook and Google. There are private antitrust suits against Apple and rumors of a possible government suit against Apple. The European Commission has investigations pending against Amazon and Apple and ongoing appeals of decisions regarding Google. Full litigation of these cases will likely take years, though as the AT&T timeline makes clear, even settlements of cases may come slowly.
Just as was the case with AT&T, legislation is a natural alternative. In many ways, as was the case with AT&T, negotiated settlements and the likely legislative outcomes might run along similar lines. The pending bills in the U.S. Congress and their counterparts in Europe suggest the likely tools are the traditional tools that we use to regulate network industries, including a mix of nondiscrimination rules, access rules and business line restrictions. As I have argued elsewhere, getting this right is tricky and depending on how it is framed of course, legislation could be quite disruptive to the world that consumers currently live in.14
I have not gone through the pending antitrust cases with enough care to assess the merits of the claims against the big tech firms. But the positions of these firms — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google — reflect in many ways the type of innovation and efficiency that the framers of the Sherman Act and then subsequently Brandeis and Wilson believed should be free of antitrust liability. That of course is not to say that those firms have not violated the antitrust laws — again, I have not expressed a view on that here — but rather that there is core there that we should be sensitive to, whether changes are pursued through antitrust remedies, imposed or agreed, or through legislation.

Before Sherman introduced S.3445 in 1888, on July 10, 1888, he introduced a resolution that called for the Senate Committee on Finance to investigate the issues at stake in the legislation that he would subsequently propose. The resolution was framed around tariff policy, but that resolution, which paralleled in many ways S.3445, did use the word “monopoly” but that language was dropped in S.3445 and S.1. See 19 Cong.

Technology, in all of if its many forms, is a tool to implement policy, not a substitute for it. Before a technology can be chosen to implement a policy, the policy or, at the very least, the underlying objective must be identified. Using the example of the struggle of the United States to formulate a coherent national approach toward cryptocurrency, this article suggests that the technology in need of updating is the nation’s core governing charter — i.e. the Constitution.

By Tom Brown 1
 
In truth, virtually any noun could follow the ellipsis in this article’s title. The core institutions of our Constitutional structure are not working according to the design of our founding document. Nothing in the text of the Constitution or the immediately contemporaneous commentary suggests that the Framer’s imagined that the President would need to arbitrate a dispute between a small group of Senators and Representatives in order to move his legislative agenda forward. The Constitution does not mention the functional elements that have given rise to the current legislative quagmire — political parties and the Senate filibuster. Indeed, the fact that the founders did not contemplate the rise of political parties has led at least one prominent scholar to suggest that our Constitution has never really worked as planned.2
 
I. TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLEMENT TO POLICY, NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR IT
It might seem odd to start a piece that sits within a volume devoted to the promise that technology has for solving regulatory problems with a nod to the latest example of the degree to which our government is falling short of the platonic ideal. But technology is simply a tool to further a defined end. Before regulators can harness technology to make their lives easier, they need to identify the core objectives within a specific regulatory domain, write rules to channel the behavior of market participants, and then deploy technology to ensure compliance and monitor the overall consequences.
Take speed limits as an example. Setting speed limits involves a myriad of factors. The short list includes the convenience of drivers, the safety of drivers, the safety of pedestrians (and bike riders), and the interests of downstream consumers both in the goods and services delivered via roads but the by-products of the use of those roads (e.g. emissions and noise). Regulators might resolve those concerns purely in favor of the convenience of drivers and not set speed limits, or they might do as the U.S. has done and create a context specific regime — e.g. 15 miles per hour when kids are present near a school but 70 miles per hour on highways in unpopulated areas.
The technologies necessary to implement different speed limit regimes will vary. A no limit regime might not require any technology, though one could imagine regulators wanting to track accidents and monitor regimes to measure the effects of the no limit regime. The context specific regime will, on the other hand, require technologies for ensuring compliance. And the optimal technology to implement a particular regime might change over time. Today, the U.S. largely relies on humans armed with portable radars to track the speed of particular vehicles. When those humans spot a violator, they literally chase them down and issue a ticket. Soon, that might mean passive monitoring systems such as drones equipped with radar sensors and cameras. In the more distant future, it might mean technologies embedded in vehicles and roads that actively limit how fast vehicles can go. In short, the technology used to give effect to a particular regulatory regime follows the design of the regime itself.
The visible struggle of Congress to make laws and the President to execute them has made setting priorities difficult and translating those priorities into clear, stable rules virtually impossible. As a result, major segments of the U.S. economy are subject to complex regulatory regimes that seek to advance multiple objectives simultaneously. The introduction of new technologies compounds the problem as different regulators with different agendas then vie with one another to bring the new technology within the scope of their regulatory domain.
 
II. THE BURGEONING CRYPTO INDUSTRY COULD BE A PROVING GROUND FOR GOOD POLICY (OR NOT).
The U.S. regulatory approach to crypto currency provides a recent and particularly salient example of the challenge it faces in developing coherent policy priorities. The crypto industry found itself at the center of U.S. regulatory attention this summer. Within the span of a few mid-summer weeks, Congress attempted to invent tax policy for the industry on the fly;3 the Chairman of the SEC, asserting that the industry was completely unregulated, claimed dominion over it;4 and the President’s working group on Financial Markets took on the job of recommending how one type of crypto currency, fiat backed crypto currencies, should be regulated.5
Three months later, there has been motion but little progress. The tax proposal that Congress made up on the fly is part of the infrastructure bill that the House has passed and that the President will (presumably) sign.6 The SEC has not initiated (much less concluded) a rule making to define what kind of instruments, digital and otherwise, constitute securities, preferring instead to let the issue percolate in the courts.7 The Working Group on Financial Markets issued its report on stablecoins and managed to document the status quo. The report notes that stable coins may present certain risks and calls on Congress to arbitrate the dispute between the SEC and CFTC about which agency should regulate them.8 There is little point in thinking about how to apply technology to address policy issues where the underlying policy does not exist.
Washington needs to resist chasing headlines in pursuit of more authority at the level of individual agencies and, instead, build a process to develop a foundation for a more coherent policy that would cover the entire government. This process necessarily starts with some humility. Regulators need to accept that they may not know all the answers. Indeed, they might not even be able to ask all the right questions. At this point, it is more important to get the right stakeholders in the room and identify the key first principles than design the optimal regulatory framework.
Again, crypto provides an example. Although the U.S. does not have a single regulator responsible for the industry, a number of agencies within the Federal government have regulated or could regulate certain aspects of it. The process of building a coherent policy for the industry should begin by canvassing all of the following for their views:

FinCEN. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an agency within the Treasury Department, is responsible for defining what types of businesses are considered financial institutions and what responsibilities different types of financial institutions have with regard to ensuring that their services are not used to facilitate crime or terrorist financing. It first exercised that authority over the crypto industry in 2013.9
CFTC. The Commodities Fair Trading Commission has authority over spot markets for commodities as well as markets in which futures and other derivates related to commodities and other assets are traded. It has exercised that authority over the crypto industry, bringing a series of enforcement actions against market participants and licensing several exchanges to support the trading of derivatives based on crypto currencies. It brought its first case in 2015.10
SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates the issuance and sale of securities, the exchange of securities, and the business of providing investment advice. It has brought numerous cases against firms that have promoted or sold digital assets that the SEC believes to be a security.11 It has provided guidance to firms that certain kinds of digital assets are not securities. It also has broad rule making authority to define what a security is.12 As noted above, it has not exercised that authority regarding digital assets, preferring instead to fight that battle in court. 
OCC. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates banks, including trust companies, that are chartered under the National Bank Act. In that capacity, it has the authority to determine the types of activities in which such entities can engage, including whether they can hold or issue digital assets. It has exercised that authority.13
Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve Board regulates bank holding companies and certain other entities which are members of the Federal Reserve system. Congress has given it other regulatory and supervisory authority, too, including over payment systems.14 It is also a market participant in that it runs the largest settlement system in the United States.
CFPB and FTC. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission have the ability to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The FTC has used its authority to protect consumers against get rich quick schemes involving crypto currency.15 The CFPB also has the authority to protect consumers against abusive practices, and the authority to interpret various existing laws that regulate retail financial services. Of most direct relevance to the crypto industry is the Electronic Funds Transfer Act.16
The States. Ours is, of course, a Federal system, and the powers not explicitly granted to the Federal government are reserved to the states.17 This includes the plenary authority to regulate any individual or business doing business within the physical bounds of a particular state or with the resident of a state. The states have been very, very active in the crypto space led by the New York Department of Financial Services.

Having canvassed Federal and state governments for their views on the industry, the next task is to engage the industry and the public. The ultimate goal is to build a foundational policy framework that is tailored to the risks of the industry, that is flexible enough to allow for continued evolution, and that people will accept. Building that framework begins by asking some foundational questions:

What distinguishes a crypto asset that is a commodity from a crypto asset that is a security from a crypto asset that is a payment instrument from a crypto asset that is a derivative?
Assets and liabilities are the accounting versions of matter and anti-matter. You can’t have one without the other. Who or what owns the liability associated with a given digital asset? Does the answer matter for purposes of informing how a given digital asset should be regulated?
Could crypto currencies or a crypto currency emerge as an alternative to the dollar as a global reserve of wealth?
What gaps exist in the current regulatory regime that could be exploited by people bent on defrauding users of crypto currency?
Should a single Federal regulator have primary authority over the crypto industry? What role, if any, should the States play in regulating the industry?
Is crypto more susceptible to use by criminals and terrorists than other technologies? If so, why?
What should regulators try to avoid as they seek new authorities and establish new rules?
What fundamental question about crypto does not receive enough attention?

Different answers to these questions will point in different directions about what the country’s policy priorities regarding crypto should be. Take the third question on the list above — whether crypto currencies might emerge as an alternative to the dollar as a reserve of wealth. At first blush, the question might seem silly. The dollar has served as the world’s reserve currency since the end of World War II, and the rate currently demanded by investors for bonds issued by the U.S. government and by U.S. banks largely capitalized by those bonds suggests that people are not seriously worried about the end of that era. But people as diverse as Sen. Rand Paul and Matt Harris of Bain Capital Ventures have begun to wonder whether the era of dollar hegemony in on the wane and whether crypto currencies, specifically Bitcoin, may emerge as a viable alternative.18 If that is even a remote possibility, the entire discussion of crypto currency takes on a different cast. The challenge at the moment is that policy makers do not appear to be engaging in a serious way with any of these issues.
 
III. CONCLUSION
The Constitution conceives of a duet between Congress and the President. Congress takes the lead in making decisions about whether and how to act, and the President follows closely behind ensuring that Congress’s will is translated into action. Over the last two centuries, that duet has become a solo as Congress has receded into the role of cheerleader (when the White House and the relevant chamber majority are held by the same party) or scold (during periods of divided government).19 That is a problem for a host of reasons, but two issues loom particularly large. The President is not equipped to hear from, let alone balance the interests, of the many constituencies that make up the United States. And the volatility inherent in the U.S. political system ensures that the Presidency passes back and forth between the parties and when the shift happens, the new President invariably reviews and seeks to reverse the rules enacted by his predecessor.20
The larger point, here, is that technology is a tool to serve defined regulatory ends. It is not a substitute for the ends themselves. And that brings the discussion full circle. The Constitution is, itself, a technology.21 It was devised and enacted to solve a particular set of problems at a particular moment in time. The Founders convened in Philadelphia in 1787 because it had become apparent that the pre-existing mechanism for coordinating the interests of the various states that had waged the War of Independence was not up to the task of “establish[ing] Justice, insur[ing] Domestic Tranquility, provid[ing] for the common defense, [or] promot[ing] the general Welfare.”22] The recent struggles of our leaders to achieve any meaningful amount of sustained consensus on virtually any policy dimension suggests that it might be time for a refresh.

What does existing data regulation tell us about data regulation in tech industries? Basically, that shortcuts do not exist. Data is not a commodity. The strategic value of a specific piece of data differs from one industry to another, varies over time, and depends on the level of aggregation and on the combination with other data. This implies that data regulation is necessarily a case-by-case exercise and requires specific solutions to well-defined specific problems. The current EU proposals for data regulation (the European Data Strategy and the Digital Markets Act) ignore this fact and attempt to regulate data through generic principles. A more flexible evidence-based approach to data regulation is likely to be more workable and effective in solving potential market failures in data intensive industries.

By Juan Delgado1
 
I. OPEN BANKING: DATA REGULATION AT WORK
Three years after its adoption, the UK competition agency – the CMA – has recently proposed to update the UK’s Open Banking regulation.2 Open Banking – broadly speaking – enables consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) to share their bank and credit card transaction data securely with trusted third parties,3 through common and open standards. Although the concept of Open Banking was born in the context of retail banking, it is currently evolving as an instrument to drive competition in payments and the broader financial sector. Open Banking regulations are in place in the UK (since 2018), Australia (since 2020), and the European Union (after the adoption of the second Payment Services Directive, known as “PS2”).4
Open Banking shares a number of features with data regulation in tech industries. Incumbents’ data ownership constitutes a barrier to competition in retail banking. Open Banking initially aimed to promote competition in retail banking by mandating data-sharing and has recently evolved as an instrument to foster competition and innovation in the payments and fintech sector. Likewise, in the case of retail banking, data constitutes an important source of market power in many other tech markets (advertising, retail trade, health, insurance, etc.). The regulatory principles governing data in tech industries should in principle respond to the same motivation and structure as data regulation in other data intensive industries.
If we look closely into Open Banking, we can identify different relevant elements of the regulatory process: the detection of a market failure, the design of a regulatory instrument to address the market failure and the potential conflict of the regulatory instrument with privacy and data protection regulation.
First of all, the regulator had detected a market failure following a market investigation into retail banking:5 bank customers faced high switching costs that prevented them from changing banks. As a consequence, competition between retail banks was limited.
Those switching costs were related to the fact that the receiving banks did not have sufficient information about the new clients (e.g. income history, credit records, payments record…) and therefore the new clients could not benefit from banking products, prices and benefits adapted to their characteristics. Switching banks implied resetting your financial history and, thus, it was not an option for “good” customers. Switching costs reduced competition in retail banking.
Second, on the choice of regulatory instruments, the regulator concluded that competition law was not a well-suited instrument to remove the existing obstacles to competition. Thus, the regulator opted for a specific ex-ante regulatory instrument. The new instrument established the command of sharing clients’ bank and credit card transaction data so receiving banks could rely on the new clients’ banking history to design and price the products offered to them.
Data-sharing obligations reduces switching costs and promotes customer switching and competition. The target of the regulation were the nine largest current account providers in the UK. The regulator considered that limiting the obligation to the largest banks was a proportionate measure that would suffice to remove the barriers to competition identified. Open Banking regulation was implemented by the Open Banking Implementation Entity (“OBIE”), which was paid by the target banks. Compliance and evaluation were entrusted to the CMA.
Finally, the regulator faced the problem of how to promote competition without compromising privacy and data protection. The Open Banking regulation thus included a number of safeguards in order to achieve its aims while preserving privacy and data protection, such as:

Open Banking requires the individual consent of bank customers through an opt-in system. In 2021, more than 3 million UK bank customers have given their consent. Bank customers hold the property rights over their data and should grant their explicit consent to participate in the scheme.
Open Banking specifies the type and format of the data exchanged, providing direct access to financial data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.
Open Banking guarantees that the exchange of data occurs in a secure and trusted environment.
The ecosystem is only open to authorized financial service providers (around 330 service providers in 2021) and the use of the data is restricted to the provision of authorized financial services.

In summary, Open Banking provides an example of the complexity of effective data regulation. Data regulation requires identifying and delimiting the underlying market failures it aims to solve, incorporating the characteristics of the industry and the role of data in the competition dynamics into the remedy design and taking into account the privacy and data protection concerns derived from data use and regulation. In particular, in the case of Open Banking:

The underlying market failure, i.e. the lack of competition, is properly identified and delimited, and a proportionate remedy is specifically designed to solve such market failure.
The design of the remedy is limited to the sharing of certain data which is essential to compete and foster innovation: receiving financial entities needed information on new clients’ bank and credit card transaction data to be able to develop new and innovative products and to compete with incumbent banks on a level playing field. The remedy specifies in detail the type and format of the data exchanged, which is limited to the data necessary to address the market failure, and who the target of regulation is (i.e. the nine largest banks). A specific implementation entity is designated to enforce the regulation and the competition authority is entrusted with monitoring its effectiveness.
The remedy incorporates privacy and data protection safeguards, recognizing the sensitive nature of the data exchanged. The safeguards mainly concern the customers’ consent for the use of their data and the requirement that data can only be used by “trusted” third parties, limiting the scope of the use of the data exchanged.

  
II. WHAT DOES EXISTING DATA REGULATION TELL US ABOUT DATA REGULATION IN TECH INDUSTRIES? 
The Open Banking experience provides a number of insights about data regulation in tech industries.
First, data regulation should have a purpose and such purpose should be normally linked to one or several market failures that justify imposing such regulation. In the case of data, there are three main data-related market failures: innovation externalities, market power and lack of competition and data privacy concerns.6
Tech products, such as fintech, online advertising, online retail trade, online entertainment, health, and insurance services, are data-intensive. The extensive use of big data is essential to compete and to innovate through new products better suited to meet customers’ needs. For example, credit data allows financial institutions and fintechs to offer personalized financial products to their customers and health data can help the health industry to better diagnose health issues and adopt effective treatments. Proprietary data might limit the societal benefits of data. Mandating data sharing may allow the full exploitation of positive data externalities, fostering innovation.
Simultaneously, data plays a very relevant role in the dynamics of competition in data intensive industries. Data might confer firms a competitive advantage and create barriers to entry that can be insurmountable to new entrants, which either do not have a sufficiently large customer base or have not been long enough in the market to gather the necessary amount of data to compete on equal grounds. For example, data on consumer characteristics and behavior is essential for personalized ads and the lack of it can constitute a barrier to entry in the ad industry. Data can thus create market power. Data sharing may help to dismantle obstacles to market entry and unlock competition.
Data sharing also has drawbacks: the storage and sharing of unlawful personal data and the abuse or unauthorized disclosure of such data may cause harm to consumers. Thus, whenever personal data is gathered or exchanged, regulation should guarantee the protection of privacy and personal data.
Second, data regulatory design should serve the identified purpose. There is however no general recipe for this. The diversity of products, industries and business models framed within the so-called tech industry makes that a single remedy does not fit all circumstances. For example, an obligation to share bank and credit card transaction data will not foster competition and innovation in the video streaming industry.
Data is not a commodity. The strategic value of a specific piece of data differs from one industry to another, varies over time (instantaneous versus historical data), and depends on the level of aggregation and on the combination with other data. Data is not a “uniform, generic and static raw material.”7 This variability on several dimensions makes it complex to design generic data regulation and calls for a case-by-case analysis. As concluded by Crémer et al in their report on digital markets for the European Commission, “the significance of data and data access for competition will always depend on an analysis of the specificities of a given market, the type of data, and data usage in a given case.”8]
In the case of the tech industry, there are several dimensions that determine the role of data in competition and innovation. The nature of the data with strategic value varies from industry to industry. The same data will not be equally valuable to online retail traders than to online insurance providers. The same data will affect differently to the competition and innovation dynamics in different industries. This implies that, for example, a data-sharing obligation would have to identify for each industry which type of data substantially affects competition and innovation and how sharing such data can foster competition and innovation. For example, the recent acquisition of the digital wearable devises manufacturer Fitbit by Google, approved by the European Commission on December 20, 2020,9 generated a heated debate on the effects of the combination of the data gathered by both companies on competition and innovation.10 Google and Fitbit gathered different type of data that was relevant in their respective markets. One of the main questions during the analysis of the operation was whether the combination of the data gathered by both companies could have market foreclosing effects and a negative impact on innovation.
But even within the same industry, data might be a strategic input for some competitors and not so for others, depending on their business models. For example, ad-sponsored business models rely substantially on big data. In the pre-Android decision market for mobile operating systems, Google’s Android used to be an ad-sponsored business while Apple’s IOS was sold integrated within Apple’s hardware.11 That implied that users’ data was essential for Android’s business model while not so relevant for Apple’s. Data sharing obligations can affect in an asymmetric way to competitors in the same market.
Finally, several market failures may coexist in data intensive industries. In particular, it is frequent that privacy and data protection concerns coexist with innovation externalities and market power. This implies that, as in the case of Open Banking, regulation should provide safeguards to preserve privacy and data protection. Data-sharing obligations might entail privacy risks that must be internalized within the regulatory instrument design. Addressing separately competition and innovation market failures and data protection and privacy concerns may result in suboptimal regulation.
  
III. THE EU PROPOSED STRATEGY FOR DATA REGULATION
The EU (proposed) data regulation broad strategy is structured around the three above mentioned market failures:

The so-called European Data Strategy, recently announced by the European Commission, deals with the innovation externalities of data-sharing.12 The strategy proposes, amongst other measures, a “cross-sectoral governance framework for data access and use” and “common European data spaces in strategic sectors and domains of public interest” through pooling European data in key sectors, with EU-wide common and interoperable data spaces.
The proposed Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) deals with market power (derived, amongst others, from the accumulation of data) and its effects on competition and innovation. The DMA proposes a number of generic obligations for the so-called “gatekeepers” (vaguely defined as “providers of a core platform service”), which constitute the main target of the regulation.13
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), that entered into force in 2018, deals with privacy and data protection. The GDPR is a far-reaching regulatory instrument that imposes obligations on privacy and data protection onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The GDPR is a complex piece of regulation which enforcement has been progressively more effective but slow.14

The European Strategy for Data has not yet been adopted. It proposes a regulation on data governance that aims to increase trust in data sharing, strengthen mechanisms to increase data availability and overcome technical obstacles to the reuse of data. It also anticipates the creation of a “single market for data” where data can flow within the EU and across sectors, subject to privacy and data protection, and to competition law. The regulation establishes a general framework for data sharing but, since such framework is constrained by privacy and data protection, and by competition law, its implementation will require a case-by-case analysis to guarantee compliance with EU law.
The DMA is currently under discussion. The DMA is presented as an ex-ante regulatory tool to deal with market power of large technology companies, complementing the enforcement of EU competition law. The DMA designates the target of the regulation according to arbitrary quantitative criteria (annual EEA turnover above €6.5 billion in the last three years, average market capitalization above €65 billion in the last year, active in at least three Member States, over 45 million monthly active end users in the European Union, and over 10,000 yearly active business users in the last year) that seem to refer to the big tech players and a few other firms.
Without having delimited the nature and scope of the market failures it aims to address, the DMA proposes a list of generic obligations for all gatekeepers (that include requiring gatekeepers to “refrain from combining personal data sourced from these core platform services with personal data from any other services offered by the gatekeeper or with personal data from third-party services, and from signing in end users to other services of the gatekeeper in order to combine personal data”) and a second list of obligations susceptible of being imposed on digital gatekeepers under certain (undefined) circumstances (which refer to general obligations to provide data portability and data access and interoperability). The design of such obligations is vague and not linked to specific industry characteristics or business models, which makes them not fully operational and difficult to implement.
Both the European Data Strategy and the DMA constitute generic declarations of principles that would probably need to be further developed in order to be operational and effective. Given the diverse nature of data and the diverse role of data in the dynamics of competition and innovation across different industries and business models, general principles might be useful to guarantee a coherent approach to data regulation but risk not being fully implementable in practice. Landing the principles on specific cases would probably require hundreds of data- and sector-specific regulations and/or detailed investigations under a vague regulatory framework.
Adding that the enforcement of the European Data Strategy and the DMA must be compliant with the GDPR makes the need for more concrete and clearer implementation guidelines even more pressing.
  
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Open Banking shows that data sharing regulation needs to be carefully designed in order to be workable and effective. Open Banking shows how the solution to a “small” competition problem in a financial submarket requires a carefully designed regulatory instrument that mandates the sharing of specific competition-relevant data, specifies the conditions under which such data should be shared and establishes the appropriate provisions to comply with privacy and data protection regulation.
Addressing data-related market failures requires a deep evidence-based analysis of the market failures and the implementation of remedies specifically designed to solve such failures. Generic remedies might be useful to guarantee a coherent economy-wide approach to data regulation but risk not being fully workable in practice.
Both the European Data Strategy and the DMA might be useful to provide a general framework for regulating data in the EU but, in the absence of detailed operational instruments, they might end up being ineffective.
Concrete instruments such as market investigations and regulatory sandboxes, that enable a direct testing environment for innovative products and are widely used in financial markets, could constitute useful instruments in tech markets to make sure that data regulation promotes competition, fosters innovation, and ultimately works in favor of consumers.

774,"December 6, 2021",Towards A Dynamic Competition Approach To Big Tech Merger Enforcement: The Facebook-Giphy Example,"
This paper explores how to elevate the importance of innovation and dynamic competition in antitrust enforcement. It explains that neglect of innovation stems from the employment of static frameworks and equilibrium models, when disequilibrium is characteristic of the competitive environment. The prescription advanced to remedy this lacuna is a focus on evolutionary, capability, and complexity economics. However, the adoption of new mental models, while obviously necessary, will not come easy because of the catch-up work that the enforcement agencies and scholars must do to operationalizing new enforcement methodologies. It requires de-emphasizing narrow efficiency and incentive issues while focusing on the impact of business conduct on innovation, capabilities, and ecosystems. Competition agencies will need to clear out the clutter of unhelpful and distracting constructs that are the residue of industrial age and neoclassical thinking. Fresh insights and better societal outcomes and a deeper understanding of digital platforms and digital transformation can result. Attention (albeit cursory) is given to the Facebook-Giphy acquisition as an example of how one might begin to look at dynamic competition issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
Dynamic (Schumpeterian) competition is engendered by product and process and service innovation. Such competition is extremely powerful. It does more than bring about price reductions. It also brings innovation and service improvement that customers enjoy. A better understanding of dynamic competition in general, and of organizational capabilities, business models, and ecosystems in particular, would result in better competition policy frameworks and tools to analyze Big Tech behavior, including merger and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity.
I have endeavored (with co-authors) to advance a dynamic competition paradigm for the last 35 years.2,3,4,5,6,7 It is heartening that enforcement agencies, most notably the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), and some scholars are now recognizing the need to abandon static concepts of competition in favor of dynamic ones. However, because law and economics scholarship has studiously avoided this concept for at least a generation, there is much work to be done in order to operationalize it in a policy useful manner. In this paper, I begin to outline how this might be done by endeavoring to embed recent developments in evolutionary economics and in capability theory into antitrust analysis.
Core to the dynamic competition perspective is a belief that competition policy must prioritize innovation as a policy goal and adopt analytical frameworks that calibrate dynamism and innovation. Moreover, in order to support and advance innovation, it is critical for competition policy to embrace an intermediate to long-term orientation. Short termism is not only the enemy of good management; it is the enemy of good competition policy. A new (operational) framework will require less reliance on the traditional tools of antitrust economics such as market definition and more reliance on the assessment of the business conduct and the impact of M&A transactions on the robustness of innovation in and across business and platform ecosystems. New ecosystem specific metrics can become a good proxy to inform for what is traditionally thought of as “competitive effects.”
The goal here is to advance a conceptual competition policy framework that (I) is undergirded by a systematic (and not ad hoc) theory of innovating digital firms; (II) recognizes that capabilities, not market positions per se, undergird business performance; (III) understands the origins of rents in the digital economy; (IV) offers operational welfare criteria; and (V) provides predictors of long-term competitive effects under uncertainty. However, to bring about improvements in mental models, we must first understand how we got to where we are.
 
II. DYNAMIC COMPETITION PARADIGM: IGNORED IN ECONOMICS BUT ACCEPTED IN TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
A. Intellectual History
The theory of dynamic competition has prestigious intellectual origins, but it is also one of enduring scholarly and policy marginalization. Schumpeter stands as the father of theories of dynamic competition. Schumpeter observed almost a century ago that dynamic competition is much more effective at improving consumer welfare than is static competition. He analogized static versus dynamic competition to the difference between bombardment and forcing a door. Dynamic competition is so much more important that “it becomes a matter of comparative indifference whether competition in the ordinary sense functions more or less promptly; the powerful lever that in the long run expands output and brings down prices is in any case made of other stuff.”8
The “other stuff” Schumpeter referred to is innovation, which, through the introduction of new products and processes, embraces a more powerful form of competition that both erodes and destroys existing profit streams.9 Unfortunately, Schumpeter did not make his perspective operational in any meaningful sense. Nor did he draw distinctions between types of technologies. And it remains open to interpretation whether the “creative destruction” that Schumpeter talked about is a “continuous” process, or one that occurs in “perennial gales,” leaving open the question of what should be done in the interim.
Hayek and other Austrian economists did not fare better than Schumpeter in terms of policy influence. The essence of competition within the Austrian school is the dynamic pattern by which competition arises and proceeds, not the equilibrium never attained. Because this perspective was inconsistent with optimization and equilibrium models that economists favor, it was largely ignored by the mainstream and has therefore had almost no impact on public policy formulation and implementation.
An opportunity for dynamic competition to receive attention by competition economists occurred at the time when the Chicago School bequeathed to the world the field of law and economics in the 1960s; but the opportunity was missed. Chicago made a magnificent intellectual contribution to policy by injecting economics into the law. Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase’s “The Problem of Social Cost” was perhaps the beginning of that new field.10 Insights and methodologies spilled over to the emerging subfield of antitrust economics. Microeconomic theory was employed to provide new and valuable insights.
Unfortunately, microeconomic theory, both back then and now, affords little room for incorporating technological innovation. In my own research I complained bitterly about this beginning in the late 1980’s. When considered by Chicagoans and post-Chicagoans alike, R&D and investments in innovation were just costs with uncertain benefits. Efficiency, not innovation and growth, was seen as the pathway for the business enterprise to maintain competitiveness and deliver benefits to consumers. The standard tools of micro-economics under perfect or oligopolistic competition were often employed. Firms were viewed rather primitively as “production functions.” Along the way, Robert Bork urged the antitrust community to use the model of perfect competition “as a guide to reasoning about actual markets,” and to illustrate allocative efficiency.11 Table 1 outlines the underlying features and theoretical structures.

The post-Chicago antitrust revolution of the 1980s did little to change the direction of travel. Competition policy continued to rest heavily on neoclassical economics, and was heavily theory driven.12 Stylized models of competition were embraced that left little room for innovation. When innovation was considered, the focus was always on how competition drives innovation. How innovation drives competition was ignored.
As competition policy became more theory-driven, the analytical tools used have tended to oversimplify still further hard-to-model empirical phenomena, such as the impact of innovation on competition. Game theory, for example, supplied general explanations to empirical regularities found in oligopoly markets but has failed to give predictions reflective of the complexity of marketplace competition because it is dependent upon unattainable exactitude in the specification of firms’ strategies and timing of actions.13
The well-known, and elegant, modern theory of multisided markets has similar shortcomings. Multisided market theory has produced multiple efficiency and inefficiency possibility theorems, without however supplying clear policy guidance to real-world decisionmakers. And when economists have tried to be more empirical and moved to consider technological change, then, innovation has been measured by proxies like patent counts and R&D expenditure, which give at best crude insights and occasional clues about the complexity of the processes involved in innovation-led dynamic competition. While there has been some limited progress, static competition perspectives still dominate the analytical models employed in competition policy. Despite the explicit recognition of dynamic competition by the UK CMA, we are still far from the coherent paradigm change called for by some agency officials, as discussed below.
B. The Temptation of the Dynamic Competition Paradigm
The need for competition policy to consider dynamic competition has been apparent long before the advent of Big Tech firms and the emergence of the current debacle in competitive policy globally. In 1985, the former head of the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, William F. Baxter, wrote “the contribution of technological advances to our economic well-being is very substantial when compared to the damage that could be caused by restrictive behavior the antitrust laws seek to halt.”14 In 1988, antitrust legal scholar Phil Areeda predicted that whether antitrust can meet the challenges of the next century depends on “It’s receptivity to the principles of efficiency, growth, and innovation.”15
25 years later, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Commissioner Thomas Rosch found that circumstances had not changed very much. Attempting to explain why the enforcement agencies had failed to embrace dynamic competition, his candor was both revealing and concerning:
Antitrust enforcement has historically focused on static [rather] than dynamic analysis…for a number of reasons. First the antitrust community… both lawyers and economists…have far greater familiarity and comfort with static analysis rather than dynamic analysis. Second, there is less incentive for parties to take the time to develop arguments based on dynamic analysis. Third, there is the perception – right or wrong – that dynamic analysis is less well developed and less measurable than static analysis.16
Almost a decade later, Commissioner Christine Wilson of the FTC lamented again that frameworks that incorporated dynamic competition had been neglected noting that “the economic literature also acknowledges that innovation over the long run will deliver very large consumer welfare gains.” She went on to note that competition policy authorities “routinely struggle to account for dynamic effects.”17
Finally, about 5 years ago, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) stressed that “the methodology of competition authorities should move from a focus on static competition towards dynamic competition” without, however, lessening their “commitment to the rigor of evidence-based enforcement.”18 And in Beijing in 2018 Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim noted that:
“With an eye to promoting dynamic competition, I humbly submit that competition law enforcers around the world must give careful consideration to the interests that drive innovation, including by allowing innovation to reap the full rewards of their investments in research and development.”19
Areeda’s, Baxter’s, Rosch’s, Wilson’s, the OECD’s, and Delrahim’s calls to integrate innovation and dynamic competition  into policymaking have, with minor exceptions (such as the initial steps of the UK CMA), remained unanswered.
Models of innovation driven competition have nevertheless been developed and understood outside of the field of economics… in the innovation management literature. Clay Christensen’s “Disruption” model is outlined in The Innovator’s Dilemma. He sought to answer two main questions: (a) why is durable competition advantage so difficult to maintain? and (b) is innovation really as unpredictable as many believe? His model was built from close observation of the disk drive, mechanical excavators, and integrated steel industries.
Management plays a key role in Christensen’s model of dynamic competition. The dilemma he saw was that “the logical, competent decisions of management that are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership.” 20 He remarked that:
“Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition… generally disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technology are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and frequently more convenient to use.” 21
He noted that some companies tend to offer customers more than they would prefer to pay for. This overkill opens opportunities for new entrants to enter with lower price and quality products, and then improve their performance in a manner that undermines the incumbent.
His model is akin to Schumpeter’s, and it provides insights into some of the mechanisms of Schumpeter’s creative destruction. Christensen showed that incumbent firms often fail to respond to competition from new entrants with low priced or quality products because doing so would cannibalize existing revenue and profit streams. Christensen, however, underplayed high end disruption i.e., some new entrants come in with high price points and migrate to lower prices, the opposite of Christensen’s bottom up entry narrative. And whereas Kenneth Arrow assumed impenetrable entry barriers shielding a patent monopolist22, Christensen pointed to the soft “underbelly” of incumbents because of the cognitive blind spots of the incumbent’s top management team. New entrants are not saddled with conventional managerial wisdom, established value networks, or existing technological performance trajectories to follow. That is why they often overturn the incumbents.
Interestingly, some version of the above are commonplace understanding in the field of (technology) management. These regularities appear to turn the standard model of static competition and industrial organization on its head. While established competition policy analysis tends to treat incumbency as a benefit, the (technology) management literature more often considers incumbency as a liability.
It should be noted that the (industrial) economics that informs competition policy puts far too much weight on incentives as an explanation for everything. While incentives are critical, they are not the only consideration that drives outcomes with respect to investment, pricing, output levels, etc. One can have heavy incentives to engage in certain actions and behaviors; but incentives alone do not dictate outcomes. Capabilities matter too, and these are shaped by the resources and assets at the disposal of the enterprise, as well as by an organization’s history, its business model, and its strategy. These are among the considerations agencies must begin to examine.
At their core, many popular and accepted strategic management models embody a number of assumptions and propositions that are characteristic of dynamic competition. Some are rooted in evolutionary theory. And most accept some version of an organizational capability theory of economic change, along with a behavioral theory of the firm. These models and others like them can no longer continue to be ignored by so many competition policy scholars and agency employees.
 
III. ENTER EVOLUTIONARY, COMPLEXITY, AND CAPABILITY ECONOMICS
Dynamic competition implicitly rests upon a theory of the innovating firm which is markedly different from the simple microeconomic models of firms which populate introductory, intermediate, and advanced economic textbooks. Textbook theories caricature the business enterprise as we know it. In this section we explore whether research in evolutionary economics and strategic management can help fill the void that exists (in the field of industrial organization/antitrust economics) with respect to the theory of the firm and its likely future evolution. Such a framework is necessary if one is to have any hope of doing meaningful “but for” or counterfactual analysis to assess potential and nascent competition, identify potential competitors, and otherwise give substance to a dynamic competition framework where innovation is the driver of competition, and where efficiency must take a back seat to efficacy.
A. Evolutionary (and Complexity) Economics23
Concepts of competition are fundamental to both ecology and economics.24 Notwithstanding, members of species sometimes cooperate in competing with other species e.g., killer whales herding seals in preparation for a kill. Meanwhile, the traditional economic view (e.g., Stigler) stresses rivalry, not cooperation. Nicholas Kaldor25 and Teece26,27 among others have stressed the importance of cooperation and complementarities to the competitive process, and to innovation in particular.
Ecological theory is, however, not a perfect guide. It is perhaps better to think of the business organization not as a biological system evolving naturally, but as an economic entity guided and shaped by management, what one might call “evolution with design.” Evolutionary processes are the “blind” result of past events, not necessarily making species/organizations well suited for the future.
What makes an organization well suited for the future is not just its evolving ordinary capabilities, but also its dynamic capabilities, i.e., the ability to sense, seize, and transform and to shape the business environment, and not just be shaped by it.
With the above in mind, and as already noted, the basic notion of the advantage of incumbency in industrial economics must be turned on its head in many circumstances. The business firms that have been successful in the past are not necessarily best suited for the future where the business environment will be different. Indeed, with digital transformation, quite the opposite is likely to be true. So those that have survived today are not necessarily the fittest for the future, even if they are the fittest for the moment. Whether they stay fit depends very little on market structure and market power.  It may not even depend that much on organization structure. However, it can depend critically on their (entrepreneurial) management, or lack thereof.
In biology, evolution is closely linked to reproduction and continuation. However, this is not necessarily so in business and economics, especially since business environments change much more rapidly than biological ones. The fittest in an evolutionary sense need not be the most efficient (optimizing a particular subgoal) but those balancing being fit for the present and being fit for the future. This balancing act requires strong dynamic capabilities. As the biologist Marian S. Dawkins notes “an animal that gathers food optimally… is so intent on feeding that it gets eaten by a predator.”28
Optimality and efficiency are the concern of (static) competition; innovation and change are the focus of dynamic competition. Thus, evolutionary economics along with complexity economics29 eschews a single-minded focus on market equilibrium in economies and refocuses instead on dynamic processes (that include irreversibilities) that effectuate economic change. Dynamic processes emerge from actions by diverse agents that are boundedly rational, and who learn from experience. Firms are guided by their past and by entrepreneurial leaders, not by internal shadow prices.30 Market structure has little to do with outcomes.31
B. The Capabilities Perspective 
Evolutionary and complexity economics has significant overlap with the capabilities perspective. The capabilities perspective improves  the explanatory and predictive power of evolutionary and complexity theories by making these approaches more operational. Capability theory respects basic principles from evolutionary and complexity theories while at the same time recognizing the role of management (and boards of directors), business models, and strategy. Evolutionary thinking has been influential in strategic management and has helped undergird the dynamic capabilities framework, particularly in its first iteration.32,33 In that early version, the capabilities perspective focused on the role of history in shaping the degree to which a firm can reconfigure its assets. Recognition depends on asset redeployment and managements ability to orchestrate assets. It’s not just about incentives. Capabilities matter, and they can be either strong or weak; and a firm’s “evolutionary path … is often rather narrow” 34 particularly if it has strong ordinary capabilities… but weak dynamic capabilities.
Note that the accepted definition of dynamic capabilities (“an organization’s ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions”) stresses the need to “integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (italics added).35 This has important ramification for M&A policy as it indicates the importance of strategic alliances and M&A activity to the maintenance of firm level competitive advantage, and hence to dynamic competition.
The dynamic capabilities framework recognizes that some firms can effectuate discontinuous organizational transformations.36,37 Entrepreneurial managers can search not just locally but widely for new opportunities and introduce routines more distant from existing ones than are typically contemplated in the evolutionary literature. Call it evolution with design — or even better, evolution with design, purpose, and strategy. Such (entrepreneurial) managerial behavior is the engine of dynamic competition. Figure 1 summarizes some key parameters that impact the speed and difficulty of change.38
Figure 1. Three dimensions of “distance” impacting enterprise transformation
The trade-off between the cost and speed of change can be mitigated to some extent by advanced preparation in the form of creating a culture of innovation and resilience. An open, agile culture cannot be created overnight. Like absorptive capacity, it builds over time and lowers the cost – and expands the range – of future strategic choices.39 Imposition of radical change in an organization that is not suitably prepared is likely to create problems that can potentially undermine strategic renewal.40
Dynamic capabilities animate dynamic competition. The key clusters of activities that constitute dynamic capabilities can be categorized as sensing, seizing, and transforming.41,42 See Figure 2.43 These activities are the domain of the organization, under the guidance of top management and boards of directors. This highlights the fact that the actions and behaviors of management and boards can no longer be ignored. If competition policy is to embrace dynamic competition, it will now have to review the action and proclivities of management teams and boards of directors.
Figure 2. Foundations of dynamic capabilities and business performance
Sensing, in the dynamic capabilities context, is the ability, under Knightian uncertainty, to either recognize opportunities before they are fully apparent or, in some cases, create new ones.44 While there are underlying routines, the signals that feed into them should come from near and far, leaving it to the relevant decision maker(s) to make sense from them, as a prelude to making strategy.
In the dynamic capabilities framework, seizing involves execution. That in turn involves the implementation of business models, the orchestration of assets including data, the achievement of strategic alignment, and the setting of firm boundaries, and the making of investment commitments.45
Dynamic capabilities allows and requires proactive managers to effectuate organizational transformation in anticipation of environmental change, not waiting to adapt to changes after they occur. The development of firms is not by any means completely path dependent or limited to best-practice or equifinal routines. Instead, distinctive, higher-order routines, rules of thumb, and/or managerial approaches lead to distinctive evolutionary paths. Excellence not only in search (“sensing” in dynamic capabilities terms) but also in sensemaking (Teece, 1998) affords the firm the opportunity to stay ahead of competitors and to animate dynamic competition in multisided marketplaces. When other factors are not decisive, the dynamic capabilities of the top management team may need to come into focus in the merger review process. Antitrust/competition  economics needs to embrace capability considerations, difficult as this may be. The headlong rush to learn and apply platform economics will fall very short if its not coupled to an understanding of capabilities, how they develop, how they evolve, and how they matter.
 
IV. THE POTENTIAL COMPETITION DOCTRINE AND ITS (LIMITED) EVOLUTION
A. Introduction
The UK CMA notes that “unilateral effects may also rise from the elimination of potential or dynamic competition.”46 It goes on to note that “existing firms and potential complementors can interact in an ongoing competitive process, and a merger could lead to the loss of dynamic competition.”
Antitrust analysis in the tech sector has struggled for almost a century to develop a robust theory of potential competition and it is encouraging to see the CMA grapple with the problem. It has become an important topic because of allegations that some competition agencies have allowed mergers of companies that were nascent or potential competitors that could have become actual competitors to established platforms. Of course, if one accepts the notion… and I do not… that path dependency and first move advantages lead inexorably to dominance… at least once the market has tipped… then there is little value to preserving the independence of a potential competitor, at least not post any supposed tipping point. The reason is that it would be irrelevant as nothing could stop the incumbent platform juggernaut. However, the notion of inexorable dominance is not empirically valid in the platform economy as Evans & Schmalensee47 and others have demonstrated; so potential competition can still be effective. In the context of platforms, this means that new entrants/small firms can siphon off users; it also means that their very presence can help condition the behavior of incumbents.
In the United States, Clayton Act Section 7 applies not only to mergers between actual competitors, but also mergers with potential competitors. This is true especially when there are few or no other potential competitors “waiting in the wings.” With the 2010 U.S. merger guidelines, it was recognized that mergers between potential competitors raise horizontal, not conglomerate concerns. The guidelines recognize that if there are plenty of potential competitors waiting in the wings, the elimination through mergers of one such competitor is of no moment.
As noted, there has been almost no development or advances for a century to the theory of potential competition despite the obvious importance of the topic, not just to entry analysis but to the understanding of new enterprise development. The topic is poorly developed because the field of economics ignores the capabilities of firms (or assumes they are all the same… though perhaps they may have different costs and likely future trajectories of development). Neoclassical Economists prefer to frame the impact of potential competition merely in terms of limit pricing. This is very much an industrial age perspective and a highly stylized and very limited view of potential competition that once again ignores innovation and disruption. Furthermore, it ignores the capabilities of individual firms… both incumbents and new entrants.
The capabilities of firms are clearly relevant to the assessment of potential competition but as noted are generally ignored. A firm specific inquiry is required. The OECD’s assessment of the status quo is that: “Competition agencies do not know the probabilities, nor the possible actions.” The agencies nevertheless somehow supposedly make an assessment. Hopefully they look at internal documents, but without some type of framework for assessing capabilities, it is hard to image that any kind of sound analysis takes place.
What is required is a framework for counterfactual analysis: but for the merger, would a potential competitor emerge and enhance competition in the industry? The fundamental question to answer is “What is the strength of the competitive threat that the nascent rival would pose?” To answer this question, a new set of concepts and tools are needed, and this is the focus of much of the rest of the paper. The analysis is done from a dynamic competition perspective.
B. Current State of Play on Potential Competition
The long and short of it is that the potential competition doctrine is hollow, and the courts have not put weight on it. Competition economists have not yet been able to put substance into it. Looking just at the incentives that a rational new enterprise faces is insufficient. Capabilities and their likely future evolution matter. The absence of such considerations in the theory of potential competition is not the result of Chicago School economics, as some might claim, but of the dominance of static (neoclassical) economics in which the firm is still largely a black box.
Being bereft of any helpful theories, courts have quite sensibly generally tried to conduct factually oriented inquiries concerning whether firms had the ability and incentive to enter a market. They have tended to look at (1) competition in a relevant market and trends (2) business attributes of the alleged potential entrants and (3) decisions and actions that the identified potential entrant has taken in the recent past. The focus is very rarely (perhaps never?) an investigation of the attributes of the potential competitor nor an assessment of the likely evolutionary path of the business or of the development of their capabilities. This is not because such an assessment is irrelevant. Rather, it is because it is difficult. There is no help from mainstream economic theory and few academic or agency economists have studied the business and managerial literature where important clues can be found.
A new and better approach would require assessing the organizational capabilities of the potential competitor along with its financial wherewithal and the basic economics at work (e.g., scale, scope, and network effects). These issues are important enough that the enforcement agencies and competition policy scholars must now begin to rise to this challenge.
 
V. OPERATIONALIZING A DYNAMIC COMPETITION/DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES PERSPECTIVE FOR ASSESSING POTENTIAL COMPETITION AND PLATFORM MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
In general, technology driven businesses and marketplaces are fundamentally different from low tech companies. The rate of technological and organization change is high, and entry is common. Capabilities can be augmented through R&D and through acquisition. Data lakes and data pools often matter a great deal.48
A. Relevance of Big Data Orchestration Capabilities
Platform mergers and acquisitions are often driven by the ability of a platform leader to bring deep data orchestration capabilities to other circumstances. Economics of scale and network effects are also important considerations. All three together along with strong dynamic capabilities are needed to create winner-take-most situations. With access to data and advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, user/customer data stored, analyzed, and combined and recombined can be used to enhance services and provide more tailored or personalized services, and better matched services to other users on the platform. In economic terms, these technologies help enhance economies of scope. As I noted elsewhere,49 in order to be able to access economies of scope, integration (i.e., common ownership) is sometimes required. If contractual arrangements are possible, and the target entity is otherwise viable, a strategic alliance may suffice.
However data driven economies of scope are obtained, they enrich platform ecosystems because they enable further platform expansion. Insights gleaned can be utilized horizontally (in adjacent markets) and vertically. With respect to horizontal, it can enable “broad spectrum competition” i.e., projection into complementary marketplaces. With respect to vertical issues, data can be used to compete with upstream producers. As Parker and Van Alstyne  note, “mobile operating platforms have entered lucrative upstream applications such as music streaming, mapping, news provision, and fitness. Amazon frequently enters the markets of its suppliers.” 50(p3)
Network economies and economies of scope mentioned above are also augmented in the platform context by economies of scale because of the fixed cost nature of information services. The marginal cost of supplying another customer is often close to zero, once the digital goods are created. These three potential economies can advantage established platforms, but only so long as they are adept at managing the platforms and the associated business.
B. The Blurring of Structural Distinctions51
Structural analysis still matters in the digital economy; but it is no longer just market structure. A structural analysis of digital markets is incomplete without both an analysis of all the structures (e.g., ecosystems, markets, institutions) and capabilities that matter.
In digital industries, products that are imperfect substitutes or complements often compete against each other dynamically for user demand.52 Much anecdotal and empirical evidence shows that competitive pressure arises from non-substitute products, services, and business models that modify the relative preferences of users, raise the opportunity cost of present product consumption, and shift the demand curve for existing products inward. For example, users experienced lower relative utility from consumption of (i) desktop computers with the introduction of mobile phones; (ii) web portals with the development of search engines; and (iii) comparison shopping websites with the growth of merchant platforms. Unfortunately, conventional market definition methods that focus on actual (static) patterns of user substitution between rival products tend to discount that potential (dynamic) constraint.
In short, not only are traditional distinctions between horizontal and vertical blurred in ecosystems; the distinction between complement and substitutes is also blurred, rendering typical competition analysis of very limited value. A misplaced focus on static patterns of substitution has been clearly in display in the EC Google Android decision. Here, the EC held that Google did not compete with Apple in smartphone operating systems (“OS”) on the ground – among other things – that Apple’s iOS was not licensed to third party OEMs. The EC market definition is inconsistent with historical evidence showing that Android entry stole smartphone users from Apple despite their distinct business models, and with contemporary evidence suggesting that both ecosystems compete for users by product differentiation on choice variables like privacy.53 The EC market definition in Google Android also leads to curious implications such as the idea that a merger between Apple and Google in smartphone OSs would be prima facie unproblematic, absent actual horizontal overlaps.
The problems of static market definition might be mitigated by a revamped doctrine of potential competition. The term “revamped” is used because the conventional assessment of potential competition determines whether firms located in other markets or industries have incentives to repurpose assets to compete deploying close-to-perfect substitute products with established firms. In digital industries, firms compete by indirect entry.54,55 The dominant mode of competitive attack consists in supplying differentiated products,56 complements, or “new combinations.”57 In particular, competitive pressure might be exercised by products relying on different technological infrastructures or supported by distinct business models, or supplied through specialized vendors. Head-to-head entry with very similar products is often difficult, or even completely unwise. Non-rival competition is the rule, not the exception.
The reason for the greater ease of leveraging complements to produce competition than substitutes is easy enough to see. There are limited switching costs to complements on the user side. Users benefit from adding additional functionality to an existing product. By contrast, there are often switching costs to substitution on the user side due to the loss of sunk experience, learning, convenience, etc. (all the more when multi homing is not possible). A rational supplier thus quickly understands that there may be more short-term user surplus to extract from complements than substitutes.
Moreover, in the mid to long term, value can shift from the core product to the complement, as incremental improvements are introduced. A complement supplier can thus adopt a two-stage strategy that consists in breaking first the entry barrier of an ecosystem with a complement, and then attacking the insulating barrier that protects the core product. The end game may be one in which all the value is siphoned away from the core product. Accordingly, one should view ecosystem competition from a 360° perspective. There are a certain amount of rents. Competition is vertical, lateral, and horizontal. Competition is for rents, not users, per se. Through this lens complementors compete along with direct competitors.
With this in mind, the correct approach to potential competition and entry analysis more generally consists in putting more weight on Schumpeterian factors that keep nominal “monopolies” under competitive pressure. This has two consequences, one on market definition, the other on potential competition predictors. To start, because technological competition requires a longer time period to unfold than price competition, the boundaries of any market assessment must comprise all entrants with a potential entry path over a 4-year period (when applying the SSNIP test58). In assessing products and services that are likely to gain traction in the next few years, one must look beyond the traditional domain of substitutes  and examine new services which might leverage complements or entirely new technologies. Market definition is no more than a tool, a method, and is not always a necessary step. As one court noted, “A market definition should ‘recognize competition where, in fact, competition exists,’ and should include all significant competition even though that competition differs in form or nature.”59
Second, potential competition should not focus just on supply side substitution possibilities, but on technology “peers.” The inquiry should in particular focus on the magnitude of the technological capabilities of competitive peers, the disciplinary effects of the R&D programs of competitive peers even if new products are not yet in the market, and the magnitude of other competitive peer’s  time horizon and cost of capital.
C. Ecosystems (versus Relevant Markets) as Linchpin of an Operational Dynamic Competition Framework
I now turn to the difficult task of assessing capabilities and the viability of entry by a firm not currently a competitor, but which might nevertheless be (provisionally) thought of as a potential competitor.
It is sometimes alleged that incumbent (pharmaceutical) firms acquire innovative targets with the goal of shutting down their innovation projects and preempt future competition leading to “killer acquisitions.”60 One study showed that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed after being acquired.
The comparison with pharma is quite inapposite. The nature of competition is quite different with technology platforms and there is far less clarity as to the evolutionary path of a technology firm. With the FDA process, it is very transparent to incumbent pharma companies what the potential new entrant will be putting into the market.  
In the context of platforms, competition can no longer be meaningfully assessed with the help of relevant (antitrust) markets. This is not only because multiple markets may be implicated (in the context of n-sided markets) but also because platform business models often result in certain sides being provided “free” (e.g., Google search) while other sides pay.  In the case of search, it is the advertisers. The various sides are of course deeply interconnected, upsetting traditional market analysis. Furthermore, the innovation that takes place and the dynamic competition that results is not just the result of the efforts of the platform owner/leader/conductor, but is also of the results of the efforts of many third parties such as app developers. Hence, adopting dynamic competition as the standard requires that one focus on the health of the ecosystem.
An ecosystem enables complementary products and services through collaboration with other companies or business units. Uber began with ride sharing but then added Uber Eats, Uber Health, Uber, and Jump Bike. Ecosystem expansion benefits both providers and consumers as it is more convenient to order services on a platform. With ecosystems, data is often shared between the platform leader/conductor and ecosystem partners. In strong ecosystems, partners do not just transact; they interact. Data is sometimes shared even beyond the ecosystem to external partners that can help improve the customer experience. 61
With ecosystems, standard upstream/downstream distinctions blur. As Parker and Van Alstyne note, “users create value for other users, as in the case of user generated content, and suppliers create value for other suppliers as in the case of shared developer files.” 62
A fundamental question which can help guide competition policy is to ask whether the merger/acquisition improves the health/robustness of the ecosystem by augmenting the business/technology/skillset of another ecosystem member/participant. Even if it is the dominant ecosystem which is doing the acquiring, having it improved with respect to innovation and expansion will help all constituencies in the ecosystem, unless the ecosystem leader extracts “too much” of the rents. In assessing this question, it is necessary to ask whether the rents at issue are Schumpeterian, Ricardian, or pure monopoly (Hicksian). This is a conceptual distinction made by Teece and Coleman and now needs to be operationalized.63   If value capture goes beyond Schumpeterian and Ricardian, it may weaken the ecosystem. Accordingly, it is somewhat important to have assurances with respect to the stewardship of the ecosystem; and with respect to an established platform, that is best assessed by examining the past stewardship (or lack thereof) behavior of the platform owner/leader/conductor.
Thus, a prelude to assessing the impact of M&A transactions on innovation and competition, one must ask whether the ecosystem will be harmed… harmed in the sense of reduced innovation, and/or whether the experience of users (convenience, choice, etc.) is compromised, or whether the opportunity for complementors to add complementary services is impaired in some way.
D. Distorting or Improving the Allocation of Venture Capital?
Various theories have also been raised about how M&A activities impact the venture capital funding of new entrants. The availability of lucrative exits conditions the flow of venture capital and stimulates the availability of funds and advice for new enterprise development in the ecosystem. On the other hand, platform leaders can also “hollow out” startups through predatory behavior of one kind or another, including certain types of acquisitions… particularly ones that simply shut down the new technology… or just put it on the shelf.
Yet another argument lurks in the background. It is the argument that even if the incumbent platform does not undertake any traditional anti-competitive actions, the reduction in prospective payoffs to entrants creates a “kill zone” where entry is hard to finance because the upside is somehow taken away by technology acquisitions.64 The claim is  that market entry rates and the supply of venture funds… decline in what is the “target” or kill zone for the platforms. A popular narrative is that once the big tech firm has made one such acquisition, it is unlikely to make another. Some claim evidence a “drop off” in venture capital investments in startups in sectors where Facebook and Google make major acquisitions. The implicit accusation in this narrative is that the founders’ discount rate is too high, due to a variety of factors. Systemic underpricing of IPOs is one of them. Taxation also plays a role. Big tech incumbents’ market power might be yet another factor.
Tim Wu has amplified this killer app narrative with his use of the “Kronos effect,” which supposedly hurts innovation, efficiency, openness, and decentralization.65 However, without a theory of dynamic competition, it’s not clear that Wu’s prescription of “overregulation” to prevent practically all M&A makes any sense whatsoever. Wu believes that AT&T pre the 1984 divestiture was suppressing innovation when it was, in fact, actively driving it with tremendous innovation stemming from Bell Labs. His account is lopsided there, and is likely wrong elsewhere.
None of these theories carry much weight unless combined with an assessment of the “but for” likely growth trajectory of the target potential competitor. Needless to say, this is a difficult challenge that even venture capitalists and management teams often have difficulty fathoming. However, it’s not an impossible task; but error must be accepted as likely. Enforcement agencies can no longer shy away from it; it will undoubtedly take time to develop expertise, and some form of burden shifting in the analysis may well be required, at least initially.
  
VI. SOME SPECIFIC CRITERIA AS APPLIED TO ASSESSING M&A
Competition is a means to an end; it is not the end in and of itself. This is particularly true in the platform context. Evolutionary, capability, and complexity economics teaches us that equilibrium analysis is likely highly misleading, suggesting that a good deal of standard antitrust economics needs to be thought about much more carefully. Mergers and acquisitions are an inevitable part of asset orchestration, which is enabled by M&A. M&A is not primarily about efficiencies but about innovation and capability enhancement. The language of efficiency needs to be expunged in the context of innovation. Innovation and (static) efficiency are usually at odds with each other.66
The fundamental question to ask when assessing an acquisition is whether it will harm dynamic competition (and innovation) within and across ecosystems. The answer to this can be illuminated by recognizing that:

The ecosystem (not the “relevant market”) should be the domain of inquiry;
Efficiency is decidedly secondary; innovation ought be the primary welfare criterion. 67
If there are multiple sides to the platform, benefits to all sides should be evaluated; and because pricing is not the only parameter that constituents care about, then access to services, integration of services, value of services and efficiency of ads, etc. should also receive limelight. This is necessary because horizontal and vertical distinctions are blurred anyway. In assessing the market power of Big Tech, recognize that they all compete across traditional (relevant) market boundaries; so traditional HHI market thresholds are meaningless.
Distinctions between vertical and horizontal markets are no longer meaningful as lateral firms (complementors) can become competitors too, and they must be assessed when calibrating the strength of potential competition.
Enquiry is necessary into whether the acquired entity be (i) shut down (ii) left alone (iii) integrated All but (i) are good. After an M&A transaction, capabilities are not lost to the ecosystem (assuming no shut down). If the acquired entity remains in the ecosystem, and is better integrated into the platform, it likely makes the ecosystem more robust and competitive. If multihoming exists prior to acquisition, will it continue post acquisition?
The higher the degree of alignment between the acquiring firm and the target, the greater the scope for benefits. Capabilities are more easily integrated when they are similar. The younger the target, the more malleable and more easily it is likely to be integrated, thereby improving the performance of the ecosystem.
If the platform leader/conductor is the acquirer, what is their track record with respect to nurturing innovation in the ecosystem. If it has a good track record, that helps. If it buys companies and snuffs them out, the agencies are entitled to be skeptical. If it predates against competitors, that is not good. Does it respect other companies’ (startups) intellectual property rights or not? Since intellectual property is an important way for new entrants to compete with incumbents, this is an important consideration. While static analysis (in principal) pays little or no attention to history, evolutionary approaches recognizes that “history matters.”
In the case of mergers and acquisitions of new entrants, consideration ought to be given to the unique positioning of the target and the positioning of other potential entrants too. However, uniqueness should not be overplayed, unless it is a firm that has been around a while, because new enterprises can pivot.68 Most startups pivot several times before they find their footing. And often, even after they find their footing. As recognized by the dynamic capabilities framework, the key lies in recognizing when it is time to pivot. History matters, but it is not determinative.
Since conventional structural analysis is not meaningful, the analysis of competitive effects is still the way to go… but we must get more flexible about it and introduce ecosystem robustness as the key metric by which to assess competitive effects. Reversions to yesterday’s structural thresholds is not the way out. Nor is the trotting out the analysis of traditional competitive effects (price and output) all that meaningful anymore.
Diversification via M&A that builds upon or extends existing capabilities is a form of diversification that a capabilities-based competition policy would view as meritorious.69,70,71 Missing capabilities can often be remedied by M&A activity; blanket prohibitions in mergers are therefore likely damaging to innovation.

 
VII. THE GIPHY ACQUISITION – HARMING DYNAMIC COMPETITION?
An issue that the CMA is actively considering is whether Giphy was or would (or could) become a realistic potential and/or actual competitor to Facebook with respect to display advertising. 72The concern is that the removal through merger of such a competitor (removal from the markets as an independent entity but not from the Facebook or other ecosystems) would harm dynamic competition. 
To assess “competitive effects” it is useful to focus on “innovation effects” as a surrogate. To do so, we must also consider the role of Giphy in the Facebook ecosystem. If it remains in the ecosystem… even if under the control of Facebook… then if it is still innovating, it is still impacting competition and generating consumer benefits, and it is even possible that Giphy could continue to bring competition to other parts of Facebook, although its ability to do so would be at the discretion of Facebook management.
Giphy is an online database and search engine that allows users to search for and share short looping and sometimes loopy videos with no sound.  It was founded in February 2013 as a website with a search engine. By August 2013 it had expanded beyond a search engine to allow users to post, embed, and share Graphics Interchange Format (“GIF”) digital images on Facebook and other services. Users can search the Giphy website using keywords to choose a GIF from among displayed search results. More commonly, however, services like Facebook, Snapchat, and text messaging allow users to add GIFs, including GIFs provided by Giphy via the Giphy APIs.
Giphy was recognized as a top 100 website in 2013 by PC magazine. Three months later, it also integrated with Twitter. Access to Giphy GIFs is often embedded in apps, allowing users to instantly find and share the right GIF. Giphy is now broadly integrated into other products and services, including on the iOS keyboard. The purchase by Facebook in 2020 was reported at about $400m, whereas the last venture money was raised at $600M. Ownership of Giphy by Facebook enables it to enhance its user engagement.
Before the Facebook acquisition, Giphy was a leading search engine for 6-second videos, but Giphy had and has direct competitors such as Tenor. Tenor was purchased by Google in 2018. At the time, users were searching for GIFs on Tenor’s keyboard 12 billion times per month.73 Other competitors include Gfycat, Imgur, Holler, and Vlispy. There is also a recent entrant – Heypster.
Whereas Giphy was started with 15000 GIFs but now has more than 1 billion; it also has several hundred million daily users via its website and API access from other services. However, its business model was not proven at the time of the Facebook acquisition. One can define a business model as follows:
“A business model articulates the logic and provides data and other evidence that demonstrates how a business creates and delivers value to customers. It also outlines the architecture of revenues, costs, and profits associated with the business enterprise delivering that value.”74
It appears from a distance that none of these elements had been well thought out and properly developed/implemented by Giphy.
At the time of the Facebook acquisition, the 7-year-old company had raised over $150.9 million in venture capital, but it still had a rather clumsy and unproven advertising model. It would host GIFs for brands and let them pay to promote them in search returns. This generated a very modest (experimental level) income from advertising.75
Giphy apparently tried to line up licensing deals with media producers and music companies to become a content distribution company. This approach to monetize its services was not sufficient to develop a robust business for Giphy. The fundamental business model problem the company struggled with, but never solved, lay in using someone else’s original content. Such usage undermines a copyright owner’s ability to control derivatives of their work, and where and how their work is shared, and their right to receive proceeds. This does not impact individuals, but it is an issue where commercial use is concerned. Furthermore, Giphy was not positioned to monetize its services through consumer use or providing advertising to its users. Though its search engine may have hundreds of millions of daily uses, these are mostly through users of other services accessing GIFs through Giphy’s APIs. When accessed via Giphy’s APIs, the users are not Giphy customers, but rather are customers of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or the other services being utilized by the consumer. Giphy may know little about its individual users,76 and it is difficult for a provider like Giphy to monetize its service when users are not its customers and it knows little or nothing about them. In addition, users add GIFs to pictures to personalize them and do not expect to see advertisements within their personal messages.77
Social media platforms like Giphy and Facebook develop services they hope will attract a critical mass of users. They then seek to attract a second ‘side’ to the platform… usually advertisers. Advertisers pay to display ads to those users. A large user base and resulting attention from advertisers also spurs activity on a third side i.e., content publisher, who use the platform as a distribution system. Content publishers then share advertising revenue with the platform that steered the traffic. The user does not pay cash but provides attention to the platform and allows the platform to collect personal (behavior) data about the user that assists in selling advertising targeted to that user. Targeted advertising is a good thing… users find it informative. Because it serves results to users via other services that access its APIs, Giphy is not positioned to develop a second side to its platform.
In short, Giphy had a defective business model, and there was no easy way to repair the lacunae. It was a company that had not found its footing. It had very limited capabilities. Its only asset was a user base; but that was hardly a user base that could be used to take on Facebook. Its product was useful across multiple platforms, making it an asset that Facebook had used – Facebook represented a large fraction of Giphy’s overall traffic – and that traffic could grow.
In terms of effects analysis, Giphy’s performance pre-merger  did not establish that providing ads in GIFs was a viable substitute that would divert advertising business from Facebook. It is not enough to simply assert or hypothesize  that Giphy might be a potential competitor to Facebook.
A dynamic competition analysis would consider whether Giphy had a credible capability to develop a competing advertising business but-for its acquisition. In the absence of a viable advertising business model and a capability to develop an advertising business, an acquisition of Giphy by Facebook would not have the potential to harm advertising competition. Furthermore, Giphy’s acquisition will not likely harm dynamic competition if innovation in the ecosystem is not harmed by the acquisition. This would follow if: (a) there is plenty of existing competition and (b) there are other likely or possible competitors and (c) Giphy left alone would not be a viable competitor to Facebook (d) Giphy stays viable in the ecosystem, albeit as part of Facebook. Innovation overall benefits if Giphy remains active and innovating, and in competing entities like Google’s Tenor continues to innovate in response. In addition, it is not appropriate to consider a “but for” world where Giphy will be purchased by someone else unless there is clear evidence that there is an active and viable alternative purchaser.
Absent an acquisition, Giphy would most likely have failed, resulting in its potential future innovations being lost. It is not evident that there were other qualified bidders… or that any alternative buyer would have been able to maintain Giphy’s independent status, let alone grow its capabilities to be able to take on Facebook. In short , it is not enough for there to be an alternative buyer for Giphy. For Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy to harm dynamic competition, any alternative buyer must likely be able to enhance innovation employing Giphy’s assets more than Facebook could.
If the threshold to compete with Facebook is as low as Giphy, there are no doubt scores of companies that are equally qualified as potential competitors. Giphy’s products/services are still in the market; so there is likely an improvement in the user experience across all ecosystems/platforms.78 That improvement is maintained/sustained by the acquisition.
Put differently, for the competitive effects of the acquisition to be negative, Giphy would, in the “but for” world, have to have:

Found additional venture capital resources and designed and implemented a viable business model.
Pivoted to something quite different from what it was… at least with respect to its business model.
Developed a management team with the audacity and skills to not just survive, and grow nicely, but take Facebook head on.

There is not much information available publicly, so my assessment is highly provisional; but at a first glance the chances of (1), (2), and (3) were close to zero in my judgement. There was very little chance Giphy would become an advertising giant that could take on Facebook. Instead, Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy maintained Giphy’s assets and furthered its innovation in Facebook’s ecosystem, strengthening that ecosystem in competition with others; and via Giphy’s APIs, strengthening the ecosystems of other service providers as well.79
What is new and challenging with the dynamic competition paradigm is that we are going where competition economists haven’t gone before, and opening up the black box of the firm. By not taking up this challenge 50+ years ago, learning has not occurred. As a result, antitrust analysis is not only static. It is silent when it comes to understanding the essence of what makes a potential competitor a viable entrant. It is not appropriate to say that the Chicago School got it wrong, and that the Neo-Brandeisians have it right. What is needed is a new dynamic competition-based set of rules that would refashion the assessment of competitive effects in the manner indicated here.
 
VIII. CONCLUSION
A new science of innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition has been emerging for some time. Our knowledge of venture capital, entrepreneurship, enterprise capabilities, business models, innovation, and complex systems is such that we are now able to look inside the firm and gain insight. It is not just about understanding platforms and network effects. We must also renovate the potential competition doctrine by creating frameworks that require and enable us to understand and assess organizational capabilities. There is now a field of organization economics, and there are also vibrant literatures on innovation and strategic management. The work of economic historians is also relevant,80 as is the work on complexity economics cited earlier. Tapping into these literatures, integrating them, operationalizing them, and focusing them on competition policy issues will at minimum give economists and lawyers a better perspective on the Facebook-Giphy transaction and other M&A activity in the tech sector.

23 Certain branches of economics have influenced evolutionary theory. This is widely believed that the economist Malthus influenced Darwin’s “origins of the species” and the role of natural selection. Before reading Malthus, Darwin apparently believed that living things reproduced just enough individuals to keep population stable. With Malthus he came to understand that populations could breed beyond their means, leaving survivors and losers in the effort to exist. Darwin then understood that the variety he saw in the wild would leave some individuals better able to survive and reproduce.

45 Aspects of these activities can be found by reading between the lines of the evolutionary literature, but they are certainly not given the full attention they merit in terms of their strategic importance. More importantly, evolutionary economics gives too little attention to the dimension of time, particularly the urgency needed for effective seizing.

75 According to Facebook: “Absent the Transaction GIPHY would only have received reduced funding from investors sufficient to continue in survival mode. […] the circumstances dictated a requirement for scaled-back GIPHY operations thereby making it highly unlikely that GIPHY would have had the means to grow its revenue business, including by expanding into the UK. The record shows that GIPHY was considering substantially reducing, or even eliminating, its revenue-generating activities absent the Transaction.” (para 5.3a) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/616022d6d3bf7f55fd843b10/Facebook_GIPHY_Parties_Response_to_PFs_2_September_202.pdf.

77 The CMA’s summary of its interviews with advertisers and investors notes that “Finding a way for advertisers to get their messages into GIFs, given that users do not anticipate seeing adverts within their private messages, and ensuring that the content is sufficiently creative” is one of the “challenges” facing Giphy’s advertising services. It lists other challenges to these services and notes advantages as well, including the ability to reach consumers in a messaging context, which is more difficult for advertisers to access. “Completed Acquisition by Facebook, Inc. of Giphy, Inc.

775,"December 6, 2021","Regulating New Tech: Problems, Pathways, And People","
New technologies bring with them many promises, but also a series of new problems. Even though these problems are new, they are not unlike the types of problems that regulators have long addressed in other contexts. The lessons from regulation in the past can thus guide regulatory efforts today. Regulators must focus on understanding the problems they seek to address and the causal pathways that lead to these problems. Then they must undertake efforts to shape the behavior of those in industry so that private sector managers focus on their technologies’ problems and take actions to interrupt the causal pathways. This means that regulatory organizations need to strengthen their own technological capacities; however, they need most of all to build their human capital. Successful regulation of technological innovation rests with top quality people who possess the background and skills needed to understand new technologies and their problems.

Technology brings with it great promise for improving the quality of life. But it can create problems too. And when it does, society usually turns to regulators for help.
Although many of the problems with today’s newest technologies are themselves new, they still have much in common with the types of problems that regulators have long addressed. Moreover, even in this era of new tech, the main strategies available to regulators in the past will generally remain the same strategies available to them today. Regulators will continue to need to focus on understanding problems and the pathways that lead to them so that they can take action to shape the behavior of those in industry to avoid or reduce the problems that technology creates.
Most of all, regulatory agencies need to strengthen their organizations’ capacities to oversee new tech firms vigilantly and efficiently. Toward this end, regulatory organizations need to strengthen their own technological capacities. But most important of all, they need, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, to focus on building capacity in terms of their people. The key to the successful regulation of technology is to find, train, and retain top quality people to fill the ranks of regulatory agencies, people who have the background and skills needed to understand the technologies they oversee and to regulate them effectively.
 
I. NEW TECH’S “PROBLEM” PROBLEM
Traditionally, the problems that regulators address have been defined in terms of market failures, such as imperfect competition, insufficient consumer information, and harmful spillovers. In addition, regulatory problems emanate from other normative concerns, such as fairness and equity. The problems created by technology still tend to fit within these longstanding categories of regulatory concern about market failures and other social values.2 As a result, the lessons learned in the past from both regulatory practice and scholarship can offer insight about overcoming the regulatory challenges created by technology today.
Yet one of the major challenges today stems from the diversity and dynamism inherent in an era of rapid innovation in technology and its application. The problems with today’s technologies are themselves highly varied, changing, and often ill-defined.
“New tech,” after all, is not a single, homogeneous product or process. It comprises a broad range of distinct technologies and applications that each in its own way may be transforming economic transactions and other activity — and each that comes along with its own social and economic concerns.3 This variability might be considered the “problem” problem with new tech.
You can choose your own label, but innovations today constitute what has been variously called a new “digital economy,”4 “networked economy,”5 “sharing economy,”6 “platform economy,”7 “optimizing economy,”8 or even “zero marginal cost economy.”9 The range of innovations today is stunningly broad, including cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, social media, fintech, gig labor, autonomous vehicles, online retail, bioengineering, the internet of things, precision medicine, biometric identification, and more.
As varied as they are, today’s technologies admittedly bear certain common threads. To different degrees and in different ways, they have all been made possible by advances in digital computing. These advances, for example, allow for the processing of large quantities of data using powerful algorithms that can be highly effective at finding patterns in data — often at remarkable speeds. The analysis of big data can allow for existing tasks to be automated, distributed, or organized in new ways, and these new techniques allow for altogether new forms of economic and social activity.
But from the standpoint of what is needed to regulate new tech, these broad commonalities will rarely be enough to bring them under a common, unified regulatory strategy. The heterogeneity and dynamic nature of new tech makes for a diverse, and at times vaguely defined, set of problems to be solved.
Consider that computer scientists and statisticians, for example, do not even always agree on precisely what they mean by terms such as “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning.” Even when they agree on the scope of these terms, what travels under their banners can be extraordinarily varied: distinct categories of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms, with many different types of algorithms and data architectures falling within each of these categories.
Moreover, although it is true that a certain broad set of concerns with machine-learning algorithms have been commonly characterized in terms of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics, how these general concerns manifest themselves and exactly how they should be operationalized in specific contexts have yet to yield any widely accepted precise definition.
The resolution of the problem definition question for new technologies will undoubtedly vary widely from application to application. The regulatory problems raised by an algorithm used in a voice activation function in a smart phone will differ from those presented by an algorithm contained in life-support equipment used by hospitals. And these problems will vary altogether from the problems created by algorithms used in social media platforms. Even when it comes just to social media, the range of problems is highly diverse, including concerns over privacy intrusions, the propagation of misinformation, the facilitation of hate speech and cyberbullying, and various ill effects on children and teens.10
In Europe, there appears to be some effort to recognize such differences, as the EU’s proposed regulation on artificial intelligence distinguishes between high-risk and low-risk uses of the technology.11 But risk itself can be a slippery notion.12 Even when understood squarely as the probability of harm, the probabilities and the harms are often not yet clearly understood—an inherent problem with anything new. Even when the harms are known, they can vary widely across different applications. The harms that can arise from fintech, for example, are hardly the same kind of potential harms presented by precision medicine, even when they both are driven by machine-learning algorithms.
Moreover, with most types of regulation, risks are only part of the equation when it comes to defining the regulatory problem. The risks of new tech need to be considered in light of the benefits of these technologies. Autonomous vehicles, for example, will present risks of accidents, some of which might not have occurred with human drivers; however, autonomous transportation also promises to reduce the overall level of accidents and to decrease energy usage. Regulators need to take account of all these effects—the bad and the good.
Other technologies promise improvements too, even while they also create other potential side effects or spillovers. Part of the process of problem definition demands some appreciation for how tradeoffs should be made, such that a sufficient reduction in the harms from new technologies can be achieved without unduly undermining the beneficial effects of these innovations.
These are tough issues that, to be sure, have long vexed regulators in other settings. What is distinctively difficult about the regulatory challenges related to new tech, though, is that the definitions of the ultimate problems remain unsettled, if not even changing as technology changes. And those problems are highly varied. Regulating new tech means not merely recognizing that a one-size-fits-all regulatory solution will prove elusive; rather, it demands acknowledging that the nature of the regulatory problems are themselves varied and changing, both across and within different technologies and applications.
What we might consider new tech’s “problem” problem, then, is simply the fact that regulators face a plethora of diverse problems and that societal expectations about regulatory goals are often still emerging at the same time as new tech continues to evolve, with too little guidance over priorities and tradeoffs. Some of the problems with new tech also cut across existing regulatory jurisdictions and even at times may fail to fall within the ambit of any current regulatory body’s authority. And for many new tech problems, there exists too little understanding of the causes of regulatory problems nor of the potential for unanticipated consequences from regulation itself.
 
II. SOLVING NEW TECH PROBLEMS
The heterogeneity and dynamism of new technologies does not mean that nothing can or should be done today to regulate new and emerging technologies. Problems need not be defined permanently, fully, or with complete precision for government to intervene in markets. But the diverse, changing nature of new tech’s problems does certainly pose challenges for regulators and ultimately it may drive their selection of regulatory strategies. The strategies that have proven workable and effective for older technologies and more static, better-studied sectors are not likely to work nearly as well for new tech.
A. Markets as Regulators?
One response to varied, and even vague, conceptions of new tech’s problems would be to seek to leverage market forces. Rather than have a government regulator need to define the problems with new tech, and then put in place regulations to solve them all, the basic regulatory function could be left to consumers who could pressure firms to reduce potential harms. Consumers could freely choose from among competing firms and products those that they think best address their harms.
The desire to leverage market forces is certainly part of the impetus behind calls for greater antitrust scrutiny of big tech firms today.13 The thinking is that, if companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google faced more vigorous competition, then they might do more to protect consumers’ data or guard against other social and economic harms arising from their tech products and services.
This way of thinking certainly has some merit. Monopolists have less reason to deliver everything that consumers want. Market pressures from consumers and investors, on the other hand, can indeed lead companies to reduce certain types of problems that concern both consumers and regulators.14 And in some instances, self-regulation or “soft law” professional norms may well help moderate firm behavior.15
Yet in the face of genuine market failures or other regulatory problems, there seems little reason to be optimistic that market pressures by themselves can entirely eliminate the need for regulatory interventions.16
For one thing, for competitive pressures to work, the market actors — such as consumers and investors — need relevant and credible information on which to base their decisions. And yet information asymmetries — a classic market failure problem — surely exist with new technologies and will necessitate regulatory intervention to ensure, if nothing else, adequate and accurate disclosure of information to consumers and investors. Determining exactly what information needs to be disclosed, and then auditing to make sure disclosed information is accurate, will demand that regulators define problems clearly and assess how well disclosed information captures those problems.
But in addition, there is little reason to think that just the disclosure of information will always drive new tech firms to design and deploy their products and services in a sufficiently socially responsible manner. After all, with respect to other problems of information asymmetries, information disclosure is often not enough. Many consumers do not read the fine print or otherwise pay attention to the compelled disclosure of information — even when the disclosure is simple and readily available.17 With respect to modern technology, the relevant disclosures might well need to be complex or technical, making it difficult for consumers to base their decisions on the information. The regulation of pharmaceuticals, for example, is justified as a solution to an information asymmetry problem but it does not rest solely on the disclosure of information. Instead, an entire system has been developed to test drugs for safety and efficacy that essentially relies on sophisticated regulators and their advisors to stand in for consumers.
Moreover, even if consumers did act on complete information, a competitive marketplace is not likely to prove sufficient to achieve the socially optimal resolution of all the problems with big tech. For example, when these problems are ones of true externalities — such as, say, with systemic risks to the economy that might conceivably be created by certain types of algorithmic transactions, cryptocurrencies, or fintech products — then by definition consumers are not going to put sufficient pressure on companies. In short, since a regulatory problem is inherently one that markets by themselves will not solve adequately, then some kind of regulatory intervention will likely be needed even in a more competitive tech environment.
B. The Problem-Pathway Framework
A regulatory intervention seeks to change the behavior of firms and their managers so that it reduces targeted problems. In seeking to shape the behavior of those who design and deploy new technologies, regulators can certainly take advantage of new technologies themselves to improve their work.18 But even with the use of automated forms of regulatory oversight, regulators will still need to rely on the strategies upon which regulators have drawn in the past for shaping human behavior — although with some different emphases.
These strategies can be distilled to their essence. By either commanding action or results, regulators can seek to orient the behavior of regulated individuals and entities toward either (1) solving an ultimate problem themselves, or (2) adopting behavior that will interrupt specific causal pathways that lead to an ultimate problem.19
The first of these approaches demands, at a minimum, that the regulator be able to define a problem with sufficient clarity or know that it has arisen and caused someone harm. The second demands both clarity about the problem and a sound understanding of its causes.  By understanding the causes of problems, the regulator can identify the major pathways that lead to their generation and then impose, and monitor compliance with, rules demanding actions or results aimed at blocking off those pathways.
Take, as a simple example, the problem of injuries and fatalities from automobile accidents. The first approach focuses on the accidents themselves—such as by imposing an overall obligation on drivers to drive safely and holding them liable when they cause injuries to others. The second approach comprises various vehicle safety equipment standards and traffic laws, such as speed limits and stop signs, that can block the pathways leading to accidents and injuries in the first place.
The dichotomy between regulations directing attention at ultimate problems versus those directed at pathways to the ultimate problems helps reveal the basic strategies available to regulators in an era of new tech. These are the same strategies that have long been deployed by regulators; they are not necessarily mutually exclusive and can be combined when regulating the same or different problems that they create.20 And as in any regulatory domain, and with respect to any regulatory problem, each of these strategies will have both advantages and disadvantages, especially relative to the others.
In the case of new tech, regulatory strategies that mandate action or results along specific pathways may be the least appealing option, simply because these pathways are still being understood and are likely changing as technology changes. Moreover, too much interference on the pathways may also risk stifling technological innovation, which could have its own ill effects.
C. Problem-Based Liability
A natural starting point, then, would be simply to impose liability on tech firms when problems develop from their technology—just as negligent drivers are held liable when they injure others. This is one of the oldest strategies for shaping behavior and solving regulatory problems as it can help focus firms’ attention on avoiding an ultimate problem that causes harm. Such liability can be imposed either through general products liability rules or through what regulators sometimes call the general duty clauses within legal codes.21
No matter the source of liability, under this strategy tech firms would have an obligation to avoid an ultimate problem, whether fatalities, the loss of funds, or other harms. When the ultimate problem manifests itself due to a firm’s actions (or inactions), the firm needs either to compensate for the harm, pay a penalty, or both. These financial costs can be imposed on the firm automatically whenever the firm causes harm, or only when the harm arises from the firm acted negligently by failing to exercise reasonable care. Either way, because firms know that they can be held liable after the fact when their products or services cause harm, they have some incentive to focus on avoiding that harm — a greater incentive than if they were not subject to the background risk of problem-based liability.
Of course, many new tech firms are in fact already exposed to problem-based liability. This shows how liability is a relatively tractable strategy from the standpoint of the regulator, for the problem need be stated in only the most general of terms. Once harm occurs, the problem has not only manifested but also practically defined itself — rather than the regulator needing to do so ex ante. As a result, in terms of feasibility for the government, the notion of ex post liability would seem a viable strategy to deploy in the context of new tech, where problems are varied and changing.
Businesses often balk at being held to such liability and they would certainly prefer to avoid it. Indeed, social media and other platform companies have successfully won immunity from much of this liability under Section 230 of the federal Communications Act.22 Others have suggested that autonomous vehicle manufacturers should similarly escape from normal liability rules.23 But as much as businesses may bristle at being held accountable after harms do occur, there is also the argument that such liability may actually treat them too softly.
Liability does have its limits as a regulatory strategy. It ultimately takes on faith that firms’ managers will sufficiently internalize the possibility of being held liable at some future time and then will be motivated to change their firms’ current behavior in ways that sufficiently address the underlying regulatory problem. But for several reasons — including cognitive biases, insurance coverage, and bankruptcy — these future risks of liability are often not enough to induce sufficient behavioral change in the present.   
D. Regulating Pathways
Because the backdrop of liability is often perceived as delivering less than the socially optimal level of protection, regulators have traditionally spent much effort seeking to identify the causes of regulatory problems and then imposing rules that seek to impede these causal pathways.
The longer a technology has been around, and the more stable it is, the more feasible it is for regulators to target pathways. Building codes, for example, are grounded in extensive general knowledge that has been developed over centuries, as well as on specific engineering research which justify mandates that builders use fire-resistant materials and install fire suppression technologies. These mandates target the multiple pathways that lead to property damage and injuries and fatalities from building fires. Much the same can be said for other regimes regulating older forms of technology and economic activity. As noted, traditional automobile safety regulation puts in place rules that address the multiple pathways that can lead to vehicle accidents: driver errors, vehicle malfunctions, and roadway hazards.
As much as it is feasible to target pathways when regulating buildings or automobiles, the same will not always be true when it comes to regulating new tech. New tech’s “problem” problem means that regulators will often be behind the curve in understanding the causes of regulatory problems and in being able sufficiently to target their pathways. This does not mean, of course, that regulators will never be able to impose pathway-related obligations on new tech firms. For example, it almost surely makes sense for regulators to consider imposing a requirement that all technology firms use differential privacy techniques to protect sensitive information contained in datasets that they use. Similarly, when it comes to cybersecurity risks, regulators can likely identify specific security measures that firms ought to implement, such as multi-factor authentication.
The more that regulators learn about a technology, the more able they will be to identify pathways to target with regulation. As such, regulators can and should invest in substantial research to learn more about the technology they oversee, and the causal pathways leading to their problems. Still, even with additional research, new tech will likely always present distinctive challenges for regulators when it comes to understanding pathways and regulating them. Regulators will know less than firms do about their technologies — and thus regulators will always be relatively disadvantaged when it comes to knowing what measures to require or what outputs to measure to interrupt the pathways to their problems.24
E. Mandating a Focus on Problems
Regulators can seek to leverage firms’ informational advantages for the public good through a type of regulatory strategy known as management-based regulation.25 Management-based regulation requires firms to engage in the study of their own operations, products, and services, all to get firms thinking harder about the risks they create and then identifying measures they can take to manage these risks better.
The management-based approach to regulation is used around the world to address problems where it is difficult to define or measure outcomes or where pathway prevention does not come neatly organized in a one-size-fits-all package. For example, management-based regulation has been applied to address issues of food safety, chemical accidents, toxic pollution, financial fraud, and the safety of offshore energy development—all regulatory domains with considerable heterogeneity in regulated entities and where outcomes, such as risk, are difficult to assess on a routine basis.26 For these same reasons, management-based regulation seems likely to be an oft-desired approach to regulating new tech given the diversity and dynamism within most technology markets today.
The aim of management-based regulation is to induce firms’ managers to address their own technologies’ problems. Rather than telling a firm exactly what measures to adopt to solve a regulatory problem, management-based regulation compels firms to assess how their own products and operations contribute to the problem and then to develop their own internal plans, procedures, and other steps aimed at solving the problem. This regulatory strategy does not by itself require firms to take any specific actions beyond the managerial actions of planning, analysis, and the establishment of internal procedures. In fact, some management-based regulations only require firms to identify internal actions to take to control risks, not even to implement these actions or the required internal plans and procedures that they develop. The threat of ex post liability, of course, gives firms a reason to implement the plans they develop.
Management-based regulation, which sometimes called mandated or enforced self-regulation,27 has been shown to work in practice. One study compared toxic pollution from facilities in U.S. states with and without management-based pollution prevention laws, and it found that facilities located in states with these laws reduced their toxic pollution more than facilities in other states, at least for the first six years after management-based regulations had been adopted.28 Another study demonstrated a reduction in foodborne illnesses associated with the adoption of management-based food safety regulations.29
A management-based approach to regulation seems well-suited for new tech because, when different technologies can lead to different problems, this approach takes some of the pressure off regulators to identify and define problems with precision. It places more of an onus on firms, while keeping the regulator working at arms length to oversee the industry’s management efforts. It also gives firms flexibility to find the most cost-effective ways to solve the problems that they identify. Admittedly, it is not entirely flexible, as it is mandatory regulation; it does require compliance with specified management steps — often characterized under the quality management rubric of “plan-do-check-act.” But other than the required management steps, management-based regulation imposes on the firms themselves the responsibility of identifying their own specific risk control measures, procedures, and responses.30
When it comes to new tech, this flexibility that management-based regulation affords is important because it allows firms to innovate. It is thus hardly surprising to see proposals for requiring certain kinds of new tech firms to conduct algorithmic audits — an idea that fits well within the framework of management-based regulation.31 Similarly, it is not surprising that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has recommended that manufacturers of automated driving systems (ADSs) adopt management-based “safety assessments” that are designed to ensure that their engineering teams are more fully focused on the ultimate problem of accident avoidance.32
The suitability of a management-based regulatory strategy for new tech does not mean it will not face some challenges. The regulator needs to ensure that firms take their required management responsibilities seriously. Especially with the passage of time, management-based requirements risk turning into empty paperwork exercises rather than serious attempts to identify, analyze, and manage problems.33 Access to information and ongoing vigilance by the regulator is thus necessary.34] Regulatory agencies must have auditors who know how to distinguish between firms that engage in meaningful management efforts and those that treat managerial requirements as simply a box-checking ritual.35 In short, regulating new tech via management-based regulation requires having the right kind of regulatory resources in place — especially the necessary human capital.
 
III. PEOPLE ARE KEY, EVEN WITH TECH
Finding the right kind of people should be a running theme in any discussion of the regulation of new tech.36 To regulate well, agencies need analytically sophisticated staff members. These staff members must work constantly to keep abreast of developments in their fields, especially if they hope to regulate any of the pathways to problems.
Even though management-based regulation leverages the information advantages of the firms, regulators still must know enough to be able to gauge how seriously firms take their management obligations. This requires personnel who know more than just how to check boxes on a checklist or inspection form. Regulatory staff members need to have strong skills in risk analysis as it applies to the technology they oversee.37
Given the pace of change with technology, regulatory personnel need to find ways to monitor and analyze innovations no matter what kind of regulatory strategy they adopt. To regulate well, they must understand technology markets and the pathways to the problems that different technologies create. And if regulators are themselves to rely on certain technologies — so-called regtech tools — their organizations need the right kind of people who can design and deploy those tools successfully within their specific regulatory settings.38
Unfortunately, government confronts serious shortfalls in its technology-oriented talent pool at present — and the competition with the private sector for technically sophisticated staff will remain fierce. The federal government currently faces a dramatic turnover in due to an aging workforce — a trend that is problematic for the regulation of older technologies, where experience can be a premium. But perhaps this turnover affords an opportunity for building regulatory staffs capable of overseeing new tech markets. Regulatory agencies need to develop channels for bringing in new talent with the analytic capabilities needed to oversee today’s innovative market environment.39
Of course, government’s own technological infrastructure needs upgrading as well. Too many federal computer systems in the United States remain woefully out of date. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported as recently as five years ago that three-quarters of federal spending on information technology supports old “legacy systems” which “are becoming increasingly obsolete” due to “outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported.”40 In addition to updating antiquated hardware, steps are needed to build a robust, usable data infrastructures, such as by creating common identifiers that can link disparate datasets, building adequate data storage capabilities, and ensuring effective cybersecurity protections.41
With new and better technological capacities, regulatory agencies can then allocate their human capital more optimally. Machine-learning algorithms, for example, can help regulators improve the targeting of regulated firms to inspect or audit.42 Regulators may find that they can improve their performance by leveraging firms’ own data for analytical purposes too.43
In addition to possessing technical sophistication, the people who staff regulatory agencies also must have skills needed to interact productively with other people in their orbit, particularly the managers and employees within regulated technology firms but also with various interested members of the public and with legislative overseers.
Successful regulation is ultimately more relational than technological. It is about changing human behavior, building credibility, and displaying the fairness and empathy that promotes trust. It demands a workforce that is steadfast in its commitment to public service and eager to remain vigilant in seeking to solve problems and thereby making a meaningful, positive impact on society.44
 
IV. CONCLUSION
The present era of rapid innovation in technology promises to deliver improvements in both economic productivity and the quality of daily life. But just as with any type of change, innovations in new tech bring with them the potential for problems. Regulators will inevitably be given responsibility for solving these problems, and when they seek to intervene in the technological marketplace, they will need to draw on a toolkit that regulators have long used to change behavior and reduce harms.
That toolkit contains strategies that seek to induce firms to focus on the underlying problems their technologies create, as well as strategies that target specific pathways to these problems. Because new tech is new, the pathways will not always be well-understood, which will limit the ability to regulate in traditional ways. This means that regulators are increasingly likely to look to strategies such as ex post liability and management-based regulation. These strategies will seek to shape firms’ incentives and steer their managers’ attention toward the ultimate problems associated with different technologies, rather than forcing them to comply with discrete prescriptions aimed at the pathways to these problems. In this way, regulating new tech is likely to look a bit different, and provide regulated firms with more flexibility, than older domains of regulation.
No matter whether they regulate in ways oriented more toward ultimate problems or their pathways, though, regulatory agencies need to strengthen the skills and knowledge of their workforces. Even when agencies themselves rely on modern technologies to help with their work, they will need staffs with the technological sophistication to design and use these tools well.45 Perhaps ironically, the most important ingredient for success in regulating new tech will not be technology. It will be people.

776,"December 5, 2021",Vestager Hints At Further Big Tech Scrutiny,"


Margrethe Vestager, EU competition and digital policy head, said the European Parliament and European Council had to move quickly to approve legislation regulating Big Tech because “it is best to get 80 percent now than 100 percent never,” per the Financial Times.
In recent weeks, the European Union has slapped hefty fines on some of the world’s largest technology companies while putting in place rules to limit how Big Tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft stifle competition with anticompetitive practices.

“This is another way of saying that perfect should not be the enemy of very, very good,” Vestager added, adding that “another 20 years” won’t go by before the legislation is evaluated.
On antitrust concerns, cloud giant Microsoft could face a legal battle after self-hosted productivity platform Nextcloud, backed by a coalition of about 30 European companies, filed a complaint with the EU and German antitrust authorities over Microsoft’s bundling of OneDrive with Windows.
In the complaint, the Berlin-based software maker said that Microsoft is aggressively bundling its OneDrive cloud, Teams, and other services with Windows 10 and 11 which could lure users to the Microsoft 365 cloud without considering alternatives.
Related: EU Parliament Approves The Digital Markets Act
Meanwhile, the European Parliament Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has approved another piece of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which imposes unprecedented restrictions on big social media platforms and increases surveillance on major platforms that have “unfair terms and conditions” that lead to unfair competition.

777,"November 29, 2021",The Rise of the Labor-Antitrust Movement,"
By Eric A. Posner1
 
Magicians frequently perform tricks by drawing audience members’ attention to an unimportant but visually arresting object so that they miss the crucial sleight of hand. This technique is known as misdirection. Something similar is happening in the world of antitrust.  While people are distracted by the colorful and exciting crusade against Big Tech, they overlook an even more significant development: the rise of the Labor-Antitrust Movement.
The Labor-Antirust Movement seeks to use antitrust law to improve the functioning of labor markets, so that workers are paid a competitive wage. It is the biggest innovation in antitrust in decades. Yet its roots are as old as antitrust. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith observed that “masters” (employers) have an incentive to cartelize markets just like sellers.2 Employers suppress the wages of workers by agreeing among themselves to pay below-competitive rates. Smith referred to this behavior as “the natural state of things which nobody ever hears of.” That is as true today as when he wrote these words in the late eighteenth century.
The fault does not lie entirely with the law. The common law in Britain and the United States recognized that employer combinations to restrict wages were illegal “restraints of trade.” And the U.S. courts would later recognize that they therefore fell under the prohibitions of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Meanwhile, the British economist Joan Robinson coined the word “monopsony” in 1933 to refer to buyers (including employers) who exercise market power,3 and by the second half of the twentieth century, textbook economics incorporated the insight, formalized by Robinson and her successors, that employers can suppress wages in the same way that sellers can suppress prices — either through domination of markets or collusion with competitors. U.S. courts have used this term, and antitrust cases involving labor markets have made it to the courts.4 But the courts, antitrust authorities, and even plaintiffs’ lawyers have traditionally paid little attention to antitrust violations that harm workers.
There is no justification for this neglect in economic theory. The harms of labor monopsony are the same as those of monopoly. Firms with monopolies have “sell-side” power in the product market: they raise prices by reducing output. A firm may have “buy-side” market power as well: large retailers like Walmart are often thought to exercise monopsony power against their suppliers. When suppliers sell to a dominant buyer, they can be compelled to agree to prices below the competitive rate, resulting in lower supply, and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Workers sell labor rather than goods, but the principle is the same.  Employers that are labor monopsonists push down wages by limiting their employment of workers who are willing and able to work for them. Not only do workers suffer; so does the economy generally because fewer employed workers mean less economic output. Many people reflexively assume that labor monopsony must help the economy because it reduces labor costs. This is a confusion.  Where labor costs decline because of an increase in the supply of labor (for example, through immigration), economic output will increase. But because the labor monopsonist reduces labor costs by hiring fewer people, output declines. Because of the decline in production, consumers normally pay higher prices for goods and services sold by labor monopsonists. While commentators sometimes argue that only egalitarians should care about labor monopsony, labor monopsony is in fact an equal opportunity villain and should be feared by the right as well as the left, by economic libertarians who care about markets and those who focus on the plight of workers.
The symmetrical harm of monopoly and labor monopsony, which is well established in economic theory, underlines a major historical puzzle: the neglect of labor markets by antitrust law throughout its long history. In the United States, only a handful of labor-antitrust cases have been brought over 130 years, even though there is no doubt that the law formally applies to labor markets. The latter point was made by the Supreme Court in 1926, in a case involving a cartel of ship owners who fixed the wages of sailors through an organization they established for hiring them.5 But even after that case, workers rarely sued employers for antitrust violations, and were even more rarely successful. Many antitrust claims were tacked onto run-of-the-mill employment disputes and were summarily dismissed. A few hospitals were caught fixing wages. A handful of successful cases involved sports leagues, where teams agreed on limits to compensation. In an unusual exception to Adam Smith’s observation about the invisibility of wage-fixing, the teams could not as a practical matter conceal these rules, and that exposed them to litigation.6
But in the past ten to twenty years, a gradual reassessment of labor-antitrust has taken place. If a turning point needs to be found, a useful year is 2010, when the Department of Justice Antitrust Division sued Google, Apple, and other top Silicon Valley tech firms for agreeing not to solicit each other’s software engineers.7 The defendants settled with the government and agreed in a follow-on class action to pay victims more than $400 million. The collusion was blatant and occurred at the instigation of CEOs like Apple’s Steve Jobs. If the conspirators had fixed prices rather than wages, they would probably have gone to jail. But perhaps because of the prominence of the defendants, or because of the unusual nature of labor-side collusion, the penalty was merely an agreement not to collude again.
Still, the case spurred further official action. In 2016, the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission issued a joint guidance document warning companies that labor market colluders henceforth would face criminal penalties.8 That same year, the Obama White House issued a statement about the dangers of labor market collusion and labor monopsony, indicating that these types of antitrust violations would become a priority for antitrust enforcement and reform.9 The Antitrust Division subsequently launched several criminal investigations and has so far brought three criminal indictments, the first just this year.10
Meanwhile, a quiet revolution took place in the field of labor economics. Although economists knew their Smith and Robinson, and understood that labor markets can be cartelized, research was oriented toward other matters, such as the role of unions in labor markets. With a few notable exceptions, economists tended to assume that labor markets were highly competitive.
British economist Alan Manning, who wrote an influential book on labor monopsony in 2003,11 is one such exception. Manning’s insights had to await empirical validation, and the necessary data would not become available for many years. Finally, in 2017, a paper arrived that reported results of a survey of labor markets across the United States, based on a new dataset (the paper was published in 2020).12 The authors found that more than 60 percent of labor markets exceeded levels of concentration that set off alarm bells under American merger law.13 Later that year, another paper found similar numbers using a different dataset.14 The significance of these papers lay in their demonstration that concentration in labor markets was not anomalous but ubiquitous, not a theoretical curiosity but a major problem for public policy. Since then, numerous papers have confirmed that U.S. labor markets are extremely concentrated. A meta-analysis by Sokolova & Sorenson, published in 2021, identified 53 studies on monopsony of labor markets, and found a statistically significant negative correlation between concentration and wages.15
It is possible that a negative correlation between concentration and wages could arise if larger firms employ workers more productively than smaller firms do. If so, concentration would not be an antitrust problem. A number of papers have tackled this ambiguity. In a study of hospital mergers, for example, Prager & Schmitt found that when hospital mergers substantially increased labor market concentration, wage growth declined for employees whose skills were tied to the medical profession (e.g. nurses) but not for those with options to work at other kinds of employers (e.g. cafeteria workers), as one would predict.16 Because these patterns occurred after mergers concentrated health-related labor markets, they went some distance to showing that causation moves from concentration to wages. But even if productivity differences account for some of the empirical results in the studies, the issue can be directly addressed in antitrust litigation.
Labor market concentration can occur either naturally (as competitors drop out because of their higher costs) or through deliberate behavior that may be anticompetitive and illegal (such as mergers). Antitrust violations can take other forms, of course, and growing evidence suggests that abuse is common. Starr, Prescott, and Bishara found that almost 40 percent of American workers have at one time or another been bound by covenants not to compete, which are associated with lower wages.17 Moreover, millions of low-skill, low-income workers are bound by noncompetes that are likely unenforceable but operate through an in terrorem effect, enabling bosses to threaten workers with unemployment if the workers announce their plans to quit and move to a competitor. Krueger & Ashenfelter found that 58 percent of large franchises subjected franchise employees to no-poaching agreements, preventing employees from moving from one venue to another within a franchise.18 Anecdotal evidence and suggestive work indicate that parallelism and possibly collusion are common in many professions, including law19 and finance.
Some of the academic work has spurred legal developments. Krueger & Ashenfelter’s paper launched a wave of lawsuits against franchises by state attorneys general and affected workers.20 Most franchises settled the state suits by agreeing to abandon their no-poaching agreements, and are now facing follow-on private litigation. An FTC filing in a state proceeding on a hospital merger drew on the empirical work on labor monopsony.21 Other cases arose independently. Duke University and the University of North Carolina recently settled a case challenging a no-poaching agreement aimed at university faculty.22 And a major price-fixing case against large chicken processors led to a wage-fixing case against them when plaintiffs’ lawyers asserted that the organizations the defendants allegedly used to fix prices were also used to fix wages.23
The labor antitrust movement germinated among academics but it has had a surprising and growing impact on public policy. The 2016 White House statement on labor monopsony was followed by an announcement in 2018 by Trump appointee Makan Delrahim, the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, stated that the Division had begun criminal investigations of employers who engaged in labor market collusion.24 Earlier this year, Senator Amy Klobuchar proposed a major antitrust reform bill that tellingly adds the word “monopsony” to the antitrust statutes, likely to encourage antitrust authorities to take labor monopsony (as well as other forms of monopsony) more seriously than they had in the past.25 Congressional committees have separately convened hearings on antitrust and labor markets. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will hold hearings on labor monopsony and antitrust law in December.
Among all this activity, the most significant was President Biden’s executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” issued in July 2021.26 This blockbuster order drew public attention because of its forceful language attacking Big Tech, but its most consequential effect may be on labor monopsony. Noting that “[f]or workers, a competitive marketplace creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs or negotiate a higher wage,” the order singles out labor markets as a focus for antitrust authorities—the first time any U.S. president has publicly taken a stand against labor monopsony. Noting that federal “inaction” has contributed to labor market consolidation, the order goes on to assert that “[c]onsolidation has increased the power of corporate employers, making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work conditions.” The order also directs various agencies to study and address anticompetitive labor market practices, including the overuse of covenants not to compete.
In Europe as well, some moves have recently been made to address labor monopsony, with leadership coming from the Portuguese Competition Authority.27 The OECD has also begun an inquiry into the matter.28
In the United States, the major question is how receptive courts will be to the labor-antitrust movement. Biden’s executive order will affect enforcement priorities but does not bind courts. While momentum is growing for Congress to amend antitrust laws so that they are more receptive to claims by employees, Congress usually moves slowly. That means that if the labor-antitrust movement is to make progress soon, it will need to draw on existing law.
Although antitrust law does apply in principle to labor markets, courts so far have reacted to claims with uncertainty and sometimes hostility.29 One problem is that there are few judicial precedents, and so judges must grapple with many concepts and issues for the first time. Labor markets are similar to product markets, but they are more complicated because relationships between employers and employees are often highly individualized. The source of employers’ bargaining power is also more complex: search costs and other frictions play a larger role in constraining employees than consumers.  Some judges seem to think that any business practice that reduces labor costs must be socially desirable. Attempts to cobble together classes of workers for class action lawsuits have run afoul of procedural requirements that were developed for the simpler case of consumer class actions, which are also larger and so more likely to justify the risk and cost of litigation. The recent wave of cases has become bogged down by doctrinal puzzles, as courts have spent far too much time trying to decide whether noncompetes and no-poaching agreements are vertical or ancillary restraints, or subject to the rule of reason or quick look, rather than trying to understand the underlying economics and appreciating the difficulties of proof faced by workers.30
Whether and how these problems will be worked out remains to be seen. In the United States, the Antitrust Division and the FTC benefit from large staffs of economists and enjoy credibility before courts. If they can move quickly to revise merger and human resources guidelines to address labor-antitrust issues with more clarity, they may have a positive influence on the development of the law.

778,"November 29, 2021",Vestager Wants To Push Big Tech Regulation Through,"


Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition and digital policy chief, has urged the European Parliament and European Council to approve rules to curb the power of Big Tech as a matter of urgency, reported The Irish Times. 
Speaking ahead of the FT-ETNO Tech and Politics forum on Monday, Ms Vestager said: “It’s important that everyone realises that it is best to get 80% now than 100% never. This is another way of saying that perfect should not be the enemy of the very, very good.”
Ms Vestager’s appeal comes after almost a year of discussions among EU regulators and legislators, who have struggled to agree on the fine print of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DMA was created to force so-called gatekeepers, such as Google, to ensure more equal terms on their online platforms, while the DSA seeks to clarify the way large online companies should keep illegal content off their platforms.
Ms Vestager left open the possibility of legislators reviewing the new rules once they are enacted, which would mean bringing them before the EU Parliament and council again.
“We won’t let another 20 years pass before we may revisit [the legislation]. With the parliament and the council’s position we can make a very strong rule book that can be enforceable soon,” Vestager said. “We have so many companies out there waiting and asking for a level playing field.”
The latest draft of the DMA was voted through by MEPs on the European Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) on November 22, ahead of a plenary vote in December.

German software company Nextcloud made public today that it had filed complaints against the US company with the European Commission and the German competition authority and was planning further action with the French regulator, reported Politico. 
Nextcloud complained that Microsoft “pushes” its file-hosting service OneDrive in Windows, including by pre-installing the software, giving users free storage and nudging them with pop-up alerts to start using the service.
Nextcloud presents itself as a privacy-friendly alternative to OneDrive and other US rivals such as Dropbox and Google Drive, which allow users to store files and access them from different devices.
A coalition of 30 smaller EU tech companies and associations has come out in support of Nextcloud in a campaign that extends to other services Microsoft allegedly pushes such as Teams.
“The problem is that Microsoft is bundling their services with Windows where they have a dominant position,” Nextcloud founder Frank Karlitschek told Politico.

A longtime antitrust lawyer at Boies Schiller Flexner in Washington, DC, has left the firm to join the Federal Trade Commission, reported Reuters. 
Abby Dennis, a Boies Schiller lawyer for 12 years and a partner since 2016, joined the FTC earlier this month as a senior trial counsel, according to notices filed in court on Wednesday. Her arrival at the agency comes amid a surge in proposed corporate transactions and as antitrust regulators have vowed to ramp upenforcement activity.
Dennis is departing a lead role on the Boies Schiller team representing publishers suing Google Inc for alleged anticompetitive advertising-related practices. In a filing in the case, Boies Schiller partner Philip Korologos said the firm will remain interim co-lead counsel for the publisher class in the multidistrict litigation in Manhattan federal district court. Google has denied violating antitrust law.
Dennis, whose antitrust clients have included United HealthCare Services and Delta Air Lines, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Wednesday. A spokesperson for FTC also did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Boies Schiller managing partners called Dennis’ departure “bittersweet news for the firm,” according to an internal email viewed by Reuters. “Abby has made significant contributions to many of the firm’s high-profile antitrust cases in particular,” the message said.

781,"November 23, 2021",Indonesia May Start Charging Big Tech For News,"


Indonesian authorities are assessing a draft bill that could compel tech giants like Facebook and Google to negotiate with media firms for fairer revenues, media groups said on Tuesday, reported Reuters. 
Wenseslaus Manggut, chairman of Indonesia’s cyber media association (AMSI), which was involved in drafting the bill, told Reuters the aim was to ensure fairer revenues for outlets that produce core news and “good journalism”.
Algorithms of big tech companies can have a significant impact on income for digital news media, by determining how prominently an article appears in a Google search or on a Facebook news feed.
The draft, seen by Reuters, has yet to go to parliament. It calls for an agency to negotiate between media firms and tech companies, and also requires big tech firms to do more to filter content for hoaxes.
“Under the current ecosystem, clickbait is more profitable,” Wenseslaus said. “It’s hard to keep the integrity of journalism in this ecosystem.”
The Australian law has since March required Facebook and Alphabet’s Google to negotiate with Australian outlets for content that drives traffic and advertising to their websites.

A key committee of EU lawmakers on Tuesday agreed to tougher laws targeting Amazon, Apple,  Google and Facebook, reported Reuters. Frustrated by the slow pace of antitrust investigations, Vestager late last year proposed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which sets out a list of dos and don’ts for US tech giants designated as online gatekeepers.
Gatekeepers are companies with at least 8 billion euros ($9 billion) in European turnover and an 80 billion euro market capitalisation. The rules need to be thrashed out with the European Parliament and EU countries before they can be adopted.
A Parliamentary committee, drafting lawmakers’ negotiating position on the issue, voted for a tougher line that could also see travel website booking.com, China’s Alibaba and online retailer Zalando classified as gatekeepers.
The group also extended the scope of the DMA to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TV, from Vestager’s list of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing and video-sharing services.
It also wants to empower the European Commission to temporarily halt so-called killer acquisitions by gatekeepers, or takeovers aimed at shutting down nascent rivals.

784,"November 16, 2021",US Senate Approves Big Tech Critic To Head DOJ Antitrust Division,"


The US Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm Google critic Jonathan Kanter, who was backed by progressives, to head the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, reported CNBC.
In his confirmation hearing, Kanter pledged to enforce antitrust law in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and the labor market, as well as in Big Tech.
The Senate confirmed him on a vote of 68 to 29.
Kanter is the third of three people, who all have tech expertise and were backed by progressives, to be chosen for key antitrust posts. The other two were Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.

Kanter takes the reins of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division at a time of calls for tougher enforcement and bipartisan criticism of internet platforms like Facebook, Amazon and Apple.. The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Google, which the Justice Department sued last year alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble search engine rivals. The government is preparing to file a second lawsuit focused on the company’s digital advertising business. Google has also denied wrongdoing.
The DOJ has also reportedly looked into competition concerns around Apple. Kanter has done work for Spotify, which competes with Apple Music.
Kanter told lawmakers he would consult with ethics officials at the DOJ about recusal if confirmed. Still, he would be in position to appoint deputies that could assist his antitrust approach.
Kanter has won the support of senators across the aisle who have argued that too few tech companies control an outsized amount of power. Several Republican senators voted in favor of Kanter’s confirmation, including Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, ranking members on the Judiciary Committee and its antitrust subcommittee, respectively.

785,"November 15, 2021",Antitrust Advocate Looks To Be Next New York Attorney General,"


On Monday, progressive tech critic Zephyr Teachout announced that she will run for New York attorney general in 2022. A law professor at Fordham University and a scholar on corruption and antitrust laws, Teachout could push for more strenuous penalties in several major tech antitrust cases, reported The Verge. 
Teachout said earlier this year that she would run for attorney general if the incumbent, current attorney general Letitia James, decided to run for governor. In October, James announced that she would be running for the New York gubernatorial Democratic nomination, leaving the attorney general seat open next year.
At a press conference on Monday, Teachout said her priorities as attorney general would include fighting corruption and corporate abuse while defending civil rights. 
“I have been fighting against corruption for my entire career, and I will go after politicians who lie and who think they are above the law,” Teachout said on Monday.
While Teachout’s Monday announcement focused on political corruption, she has become a prominent proponent of using antitrust law to break up tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. In her 2020 book, Teachout discussed several ways in which state and federal governments could pursue breakups, like actions from the Federal Trade Commission and new laws from Congress.

Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, has warned that breakups are ‘in play’ if regulators can’t rein in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon. 
He said that break-ups would become an attractive option for the CMA if other countries were also struggling to constrain the big tech firms. The US and the EU have joined efforts to draw up new rules to promote competition online. 
Finger on the pulse: Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, has warned that breakups are ‘in play’
Coscelli made the comments in a speech on regulation as part of a lecture series run by the influential Westminster think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs. His remarks come after the CMA set up a digital regulator to stop tech companies snapping up smaller rivals that could one day grow into major competitors. 
Coscelli said: ‘It is also important to bear in mind that structural remedies – break-ups – are in play if [new] regulation does not deliver. 
‘In particular, structural remedies become increasingly attractive to us if other jurisdictions are also interested in structural solutions.’ 
The digital regulator – called the Digital Markets Unit – is already operational but will not receive the power to take on the tech giants until new laws pass through Parliament. It is thought that the DMU will be officially launched in 2022.

On Tuesday a judge denied Apple’s efforts to pause orders handed down after an antitrust case brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games, reported Reuters. 
Apple immediately said it would appeal the denial, aiming to stave off potentially significant changes to its lucrative App Store before a Dec. 9 deadline to implement the court’s orders.
Epic went to trial earlier this year over Apple’s practice of forcing developers to use its in-app payment system and to pay commissions to the iPhone maker. In September, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a ruling that was mostly favorable to Apple.
Related: Epic Games Sues Apple & Google In UK
But she expressed concern that Apple was keeping consumers in the dark about alternative payment methods and ordered Apple to lift its ban on in-app links, buttons and messages to users about other ways to pay.
Apple has appealed the judge’s ruling, asking her to pause her orders while the appeals process plays out, which could take several years.
In a sharp rebuke to the iPhone maker, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple’s prohibitions on telling consumers about other payment methods showed “incipient antitrust conduct including super-competitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins” for its App Store.
She wrote that Apple’s own in-app payment methods would still be more convenient than third-party methods and that many consumers might still choose to use it.
“The fact remains: it should be their choice,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote. “Consumer information, transparency, and consumer choice is in the interest of the public.” Apple said it will appeal Gonzalez Rogers’ denial to the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which could grant Apple a temporary stay before the Dec. 9 deadline.

New draft EU rules requiring US tech giants to share information with rivals could put companies’ intellectual property and trade secrets at risk, the United States government warned in a document seen by Reuters.
The paper said requiring gatekeepers, companies that control data and access to their platforms – to change their business practices and the design of their software may have implications for security and consumer protection.
The document, circulated to EU countries, the European Commission and involved companies, underlines US concerns that the rules will come at the expense of US companies.
Frustrated by the slow pace of investigations, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has proposed two sets of rules to rein in Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.
Related: Will the Digital Markets Act Kill Innovation in Europe?
The Digital Markets Act sets out a list of dos and don’ts that takes direct aim at each company’s core business model, reinforced by fines of up to 10% of global turnover.
The Digital Services Act forces the tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms, with fines of up to 6% of global turnover for non-compliance.
“DMA would require gatekeepers under certain circumstances to provide competitors with information that may be protected by intellectual property and trade secret law,” the document said. “However, the DMA does not include specific language relevant to the protection of intellectual property, including trade secrets.”
“As a result, there is a concern that the DMA may override existing protections for intellectual property rights, including protection for trade secrets, in EU law under certain circumstances.”

790,"November 9, 2021",Competition and Regulation: Friends or Foes?1,"

By Christine Ryu-Naya, Jane Antonio & Santos Leyva Rubio2
 
A stellar panel of competition experts from around the world gathered to debate the relationship between competition enforcement and regulation earlier this week, exposing a variety of viewpoints on the topic.  The discussion was featured as part of a new competition forum sponsored by the Business at OECD (BIAC) Competition Committee – the voice of the business community at the OECD Competition Committee – and was co-sponsored by the International Bar Association Antitrust Section.  Building on the June 2021 discussion at the OECD Competition Committee’s WP2 roundtable on competition enforcement and regulatory alternatives and the upcoming December 2021 Competition Committee hearing on ex ante regulation and competition in digital markets, the lively discussion looked back at regulations past, and forward towards the digital market-focused future.
Panelists included OECD Competition Committee Chair Frédéric Jenny, who provided opening remarks, as well as U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Commissioner Christine Wilson, Japan Fair Trade Commission (“JFTC”) Commissioner Reiko Aoki, Chief Competition Economist for DG Competition Pierre Régibeau, and Deputy Chair of Enforcement at the Bank of England Philip Marsden. The program was moderated by BIAC Competition Committee Chair John Taladay.
An overview of BIAC’s work on the topic was provided by BIAC Competition Committee Vice Chair Michael Koch.  He observed the “healthy tension” between the two regimes and the recent shift in many governments towards a more interventionist approach to markets. Koch noted that BIAC believes that “confusing the objective of competition law by pursuing non-competition objectives can have the effect of undermining the credibility of competition enforcement” and referenced the group’s “lodestar,” the concern of businesses to ensure fairness, legal certainty, and predictability of enforcement. Koch’s remarks tied back to the BIAC Competition Committee’s recent comments to the June 2021 roundtable on competition enforcement and regulatory alternatives.
Professor Jenny provided opening remarks, walking attendees through a brief history of the interaction between competition and regulation. He noted that the OECD began raising concerns about the impact of regulations on growth in the 1990s, but that “the interface between competition and regulation has attracted renewed attention in the 2000s, and the perspective on the relationship between the two has changed.” Jenny attributed this change to three key elements: the 2008 financial crisis, which “taught us that competitive markets can fail” and that strict regulation of the financial market was a necessary complement to competition between financial institutions; the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, which “revealed the competition instrument was ineffective” to address unique concerns such as price-gouging and the necessity of competitor collaborations to bring about rapid innovation; and the rapid development of the digital sector, which has shown the difficulty authorities can have in using competition law instruments to monitor anticompetitive practices, leading to increased discussion about ex ante regulation.
Prof. Jenny observed that there are differences between regulation and competition law as instruments, even if they pertain to the same goals, and that it is not easy to take a side given potential trade-offs with each option. He elaborated that regulations are likely to be more general and may miss precise, case-by-case conduct assessment, but allow for intervention before harm is caused, while competition enforcement takes a narrower approach focused on consumer welfare, but may not be equally effective across sectors. Citing the importance of predictability as a recurring theme with BIAC, he noted that the administrative regulatory process is faster and less costly and gives a higher level of predictability than enforcement.
 
Can Regulation Foster Competition?
Following Prof. Jenny’s opening remarks, Taladay began the discussion by asking what experience with economic activity teaches us about the ability of regulation and competition to coexist. Dr. Régibeau began by explaining that “the regulatory experience we’ve had is not necessarily relevant to the situation we have now,” pointing out that past regulation has very rarely had the explicit goal of fostering competition. As an example, he discussed the rigorously regulated pharmaceutical sector as one in which the regulations may appear pro-competitive but were actually motivated by non-competition concerns (e.g. patient safety). Experience “tells us that regulation still needs antitrust quite a bit as a backup,” Régibeau said, but he cautioned that “heavy” regulation could become a barrier to entry.
Commissioner Wilson picked up the theme of the past by citing a Russian proverb: “If you dwell on the past you will lose an eye, but if you forget the past you will lose both eyes.” She expressed hope that others would reflect on past experiences with regulations, saying that “we can characterize our experiences in ways that cabin them and do it with a bit more experience this time.” Wilson stated that the antitrust laws in the United States took “decades” to grow into a system based on sound economic principles that have allowed antitrust to develop “for the better.” While noting that this development has not been perfect – citing her own repeated calls to the FTC to undertake retrospectives and studies to enhance enforcement of the antitrust laws – she lamented calls for a hands-on approach to regulating entire sectors of the economy. “In the United States, we’ve learned that this can turn out badly,” she said, listing the historical failures of airline regulation and the Civil Aeronautics Board, and railroad regulation and the Interstate Commerce Commission, citing a 2012 article by now-FTC Chair Lina Khan acknowledging this issue. Observing that there have been calls to use railroad regulation as a model for future regulations, Wilson concluded, “unfortunately, I believe that the proponents of increased regulation in the U.S. are ignoring our past mistakes.”
  
The Interaction of Competition Agencies and Regulation
Commissioner Aoki relayed the JFTC’s considerable experience in cooperating with other agencies to jointly develop guidance and build a relationship between enforcement and regulation. These cooperative efforts, she explained, have included informal information and staff exchanges, as well as membership in government advisory committees. She gave a specific example related to the telecommunications sector, where the JFTC conducted a joint market survey of mobile phones and formulated guidelines for promoting competition in the sector, working to clarify problematic practices under both the Anti-Monopoly Act and the Telecommunications Business Law. Aoki also shared that the JFTC has been one of three agencies that has worked to establish a body to address digital market issues and has shared staff, assisted in setting up headquarters and counsel management, and provided background materials; going forward, competition issues identified by the body will be referred to the JFTC.
Dr. Marsden, a former senior official at the UK CMA and OFT prior to joining the Bank of England, declared that “regulation tends to step in where there’s a market failure – but regulatory failure can happen too.” Picking up on Régibeau’s pharma example, Marsden pointed out that pharmaceutical firms can exploit loopholes and gaps in regulation and “like a geyser, prices shoot up.” In these cases, he said, regulators cannot do anything – and are often the main complainant to competition authorities asking for action. Marsden called U.S. criticism of UK and EU excessive pricing restrictions “amusing” given the United States’ lack of residual protection in antitrust for failure regulation, characterizing the regime as “less ‘in God we trust’ than ‘in regulation we trust’ than Europe.” Marsden then shifted to digital markets, which he said have highlighted the weaknesses of antitrust as “too slow, too limited, too late, too narrow,” and an example of a failure of antitrust necessitating ex ante regulation to assist the laws.
Wilson responded by noting that a “surgical” approach to regulation inevitably leads to loopholes, leading to eventual expansion. Discussing the recent calls for increased FTC rulemaking, she observed that the calls have been accompanied by backlash over the FTC’s authority to promulgate rules. She concluded that there is “a lot of risk in competition rulemaking,” predicting that this would be playing out in U.S. courts in the near term.
The next question asked the panelists to consider the extent to which it may be appropriate for a competition enforcer to design rules and make policy choices. Jenny’s succinct response was that “this is a role for legislators rather than for competition authorities,” noting however that competition authorities could serve a useful advisory role, if based on sound experience and analysis. Régibeau agreed, noting that the past few years have seen a tendency for legislators to avoid this responsibility and delegate to competition authorities (leading Taladay to observe that “no one wants to take the heat”).
  
Regulation in the Digital Sector
Discussion then turned to the question of ex ante regulation in the digital sector. Jenny criticized a rush to regulation as ignoring the basic question of why the competition laws may have failed to deal with competition issues in the digital sector, opining that competition authorities and economists should first work together to understand how competition works in the digital sector. This will indicate, Jenny argued, whether competition law can adapt to address this unique sector – and if not, what types of regulations are necessary. Jenny noted that with regard to the digital sector, it is largely competition on quality and innovation of services between ecosystems, while authorities have experience with competition on prices. Competition law needs a retooling, adapted to this new reality. Competition economists and authorities need to review how to use the same principles in this new environment to know if competition law can be used or needs to be fixed.
Régibeau echoed this call for preliminary work, saying, “we need to think much, much more deeply before we think ex ante regulation is going to get us out of the problems we have now.” The digital sector is large and diverse, he explained, which creates its own set of problems that need to be carefully weighed before regulations can be conceived. When Taladay questioned whether ex ante regulation should be clear enough to know the impacts, Régibeau observed, “It’s a little bizarre to find in proposed regulation aspects that are currently being investigated for the first time.”
Marsden presented a contrary view, arguing that “we’re not moving all that fast, actually.” “Walk before you run is good advice for a toddler,” he said, observing that Microsoft’s interoperability requirements are already nearly two decades old – “we’re already running” – and that regulators and competition authorities “need to speed up and leap ahead in enforcement.” Calling the current suite of regulation and antitrust initiatives “natural experiments,” Marsden drew an analogy to financial regulations, which he said were already implementing many of the rules that are seen as “new” in the digital markets context.
Marsden detailed the UK’s Open Banking regulations as an ex ante regime of data mobility and interoperability for financial platforms that was initially developed as part of a competition market remedy. “We proposed those remedies and the sky did not fall in,” he said, attributing this in part to a tight focus and clear principles, rules, and standards. These Open Banking regulations, Marsden argued, have led to the UK becoming a global leader in fintech. He suggested innovation should be a primary consideration in regulations, noting that allowing some entry or economic diversity could lead to the next Google, leveling-up innovation standards, and that “lazy oligopolists” who are “reasonably innovative” are likely to increase innovation if required to interoperate and provide data access to would-be challengers.
Aoki responded, calling Marsden’s use of banking as a success story “a bit deceptive” given its status as a well-established industry and the UK’s long history as one of the world’s best financial markets, and highlighting the potential harm regulation could have in the future: “What makes sense now may not make sense 10 years, even five years from now.” Aoki admitted that some new ideas could be harmful and should be kept out of the market, but that ex ante regulation requires the ability to predict what is harmful. She cited conversations with innovators who have deplored the limited list of permissible activities under proposed regulations and proffered that listing permissible conduct in digital markets can be overly restrictive, and would amount to enabling gatekeepers with another form of licensing.
Jenny responded to Marsden, specifically his views on promoting innovation. “Of course we want to have as many innovators as possible,” he said, but how do innovators succeed in the digital sector? He ticked off possible necessities – algorithms, a sizeable user base, and a successful business model – and asked how this could be achieved. Is it by prohibiting platforms from buying innovators with new products but no resources? Or by allowing these mergers? He concluded that he did not have the answer but repeated his call for more preliminary legwork before determining whether and what regulations would be appropriate.
The group next considered the Digital Market Act (DMA) with Jenny opining that the Act “expresses a lot of concern for the competitors in ecosystems” but leaves the benefit to consumers unclear. He drew an analogy to past consideration of vertical integration that did not consider intra-brand competition. Régibeau posited that there is room for ex ante regulation but that at this stage it should be reserved for conduct that is known to be harmful. Asking whether sufficient evidence exists to support the ban on practices covered by the DMA, he stated, “I fail to see why we should not systematically have the same standards for supporting this type of regulation” as required for enforcement efforts.
Marsden again drew an analogy to financial services, noting that much of what is required by the DMA, including interoperability and fair dealing, is already regularly required in financial markets. He gave the example of self-preferencing detection in options exchange platforms. Marsden did disagree with the DMA’s focus on breaking up data pools, noting that platforms merging data across business divisions can lead to benefits and that the best remedy to date has been interoperability requirements. He predicted that other countries would draw an analogy to financial services, particularly as financial regulations tend to focus most heavily on companies with systemic power, similar to the focus on gatekeepers. “What I hope for,” he concluded “is that we cannot leave this all to the courts,” noting efforts in the UK to “code for compliance” rather than prepare for infringement.
Finally, Taladay asked the panelists whether legislative approaches are the best path forward for antitrust reform. Wilson came out firmly skeptical of legislative change, calling American antitrust laws “broad and adaptable” and listing “significant concerns” with current reform proposals in Congress. These include proposals focusing on size rather than market power, proposals untethered from antitrust effects, an innovation-harming “competitor-first approach,” and proposals shifting the burden of proof that she called a defiance of due process coupled with civil penalties “that will encourage baseless lawsuits.” Wilson opined that legislative reform is unnecessary to address competition concerns surrounding Big Tech but may be necessary for other things, such as information asymmetries and Section 230.
 
Approaches to Regulation
The panel concluded with a question about the DMA’s current structure – with a focus on “gatekeepers” – and the appropriate balance between competition and regulation approaches given concerns about the use of per se rules, procedural fairness, and the scope of remedies. Régibeau flagged the trade-off between regulation and flexibility, while Aoki noted that immediately jumping into ex ante regulation is likely unnecessary. Suggesting the two should be more “friend” than “foe,” Marsden called for legislation with “very flexible enforcement tools,” such as compliance units engaged in regular dialogue with platforms and a complaints panel for speedy adjudication. Such features are “completely unheard of” in the “competition bubble,” he said, but without them a single approach is likely to miss things on its own.
The discussion will continue before the OECD Competition Committee on December 2 with a hearing on ex ante regulation and competition in digital markets. The session seeks to create an understanding of what ex ante proposals are on the table and the precise nature of the relationship between regulation and competition enforcement in digital markets. The hearing will also include discussion of issues related to ex ante regulation, including data privacy, consumer protection, the role of fairness, innovation, and economic concentration, and trade-offs with competition

Currently, Amazon faces two EU antitrust investigations which they wish to settle to avoid hefty fines, reported Reuters.
In November of last year, the European Commission charged Amazon with using its size, power, and data to push its own products and gain an unfair advantage over rival merchants that sell on its online platform.
Vestager also opened an investigation into Amazon’s possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.

Amazon is engaged in preliminary discussions with the EU competition enforcer and has offered concessions to address their concerns, the people said.
According to Reuters, the settlement talks can take months to wrap up, with no guarantee that both sides will reach an agreement.
Amazon, however, may find a receptive ear in EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager compared to Alphabet unit Google, which tried, but failed, to settle with her.
Vestager, who has taken a tough line with Apple and Facebook as well, has cited Amazon’s willingness in 2017 to offer concessions to settle an investigation into its distribution deals with e-book publishers in Europe, which she subsequently accepted.

793,"November 8, 2021",CPI TV Ten Minutes With CADE President Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo,"

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the interview with Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo, President of Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), recorded on October 21, 2021.
This is part of a series of videos that CPI is producing where we will interview the heads of various NCAs all around the world.
Thank you, Mr. Macedo, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
A video of the complete interview is available HERE.

Esteban GRECO:
Hi, everyone, and thanks for tuning in today, for one of our exclusive talks with the headS of Competition Authorities from around the world. Today, we have the pleasure to speak with Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo, President of the Administrative Tribunal for Economic Defense (CADE), the Brazilian Competition Authority. Good afternoon, Alexandre and thanks so much for being with us today.

Alexandre CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Thank you, Esteban. It’s a pleasure for me and it’s also a pleasure to see you again, my friend.

GRECO:
A pleasure for me, too. Thank you very much, and I would like to start off today by asking, how has your authority specifically dealt with the challenge of the pandemic? Are there learnings that have emerged from the experience of the pandemic and the resulting antitrust enforcement challenges?

CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Yes, thank you, Esteban.
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an expectation about how the competition authorities would act to keep their enforcement on markets. One of the main points brought to light was the physical restriction imposed by the pandemic, and CADE operated effectively for the continuity of the investigation procedures that had to be carried out electronically, collaborating with other competition authorities to deal with this issue and a number of others.
One example of this collaboration that I can mention is a conversation we had with our colleagues from Mexico at the beginning of the pandemic crisis about our cooperation on benchmarking investigations, which had to be taken in electronic format. Thus, the conversation involved the management of electronic documents, gathering of evidence, term counting, as well as virtual court sessions.
Another example of challenge faced during the pandemic was when CADE decided to authorize the collaboration among a group of rival companies as a measure to minimize the effects of the crisis in the retail sector of consumer goods, such as beverages, food, and personal care products. At the time, CADE relied on international recommendations from the OECD and the ICN.
After that decision, CADE released a provisional informative note concerning the collaboration among companies to face the crisis generated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which provided guidance on recommended parameters in the elaboration of strategies to fight against the pandemic. This initiative was aligned with the measures taken by other competition authorities to address the new challenges faced during that period.
That said and, considering CADE’s internal experience with the technical and management challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, I can say that It definitely required a great deal of adaptation and innovation, based on the premise of promoting a competitive environment as healthy and promptly as possible.
In a more external panorama, CADE has also attended several webinars promoted by international forums in order to share some of the measures taken during the pandemic and to learn with other authorities experience. The ICN Merger Working Group, of which CADE is a co-chair, organized a series of regional webinars to promote discussions on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on merger review procedures. In this scope, CADE hosted the South American Regional Webinar and had the pleasure of having a representative from the Chilean Competition Agency attending it.
After more than a year and a half into the pandemic – as the first Covid-19 cases in Brazil were registered in March 2020 – we can observe several effects of the crisis in the country, especially in the economy.  However, it is too early to indisputably determine the consequences of the pandemic for the economic markets, considering that most of them are taking place and being verified nowadays, and many of the rumor’s that emerged at the beginning of last year have not concretized at the expected extent.
To sum up, we have to consider that market response is not usually immediate, and it is necessary to wait longer to determine more precise conclusions on the actual consequences of the pandemic, at least for the Brazilian scenario. Thus, a cautious performance by the antitrust authority is the safest path at the moment, in order to avoid excesses and opportunistic behavior. Finally, the pandemic context also forced CADE to adopt a new way of working with people working from home. As I believe it  happened in most places, this was a big challenge in terms of having to provide the work tools and develop internal organizational rules. This ended up resulting in greater productivity for CADE, as the need for the physical presence of the public servant was replaced by more objective metrics.

GRECO:
Thank you, Alexandre is really impressive to see that this crisis didn’t stop your agency’s activity and to stress all these capacities of flexibility with silence, and in this context, do you have any particular achievement that you would like to underline or mention recent enforcement achievements?

CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Esteban, over the past few years, CADE has increased its efforts on artificial and human intelligence services to develop investigative tools and techniques capable of detecting cartels and other anticompetitive conducts without an exclusive dependence on leniency instruments.
Thus, CADE has a specific Intelligence Unit responsible for, despite other duties, processing and analyzing digital evidence, using artificial intelligence techniques to collect information for ongoing investigations and coordinating the activities of the Project Cerebro. This project is the most relevant information technology tool that was developed by CADE’s officials and it is under operation since 2013, and it is mostly focused on fighting bid rigging.
Thus, the platform currently integrates government procurement databases and uses data mining tools and economic filters to analyze a significant amount of data on procurement procedures. In this context, it allows CADE’s officials to identify suspicious patterns of behavior, such as identical bids that may indicate simulated competition or other signs of anticompetitive practices in government public procurements.
It also allows CADE’s officials to monitor markets that are historically problematic, gather relevant information for ongoing investigations in a faster and easier way and analyze high volume of digital evidence gathered in inspections or search and seizures operations.
That was a focal point for CADE in recent years, with the agency investing resources and effort in developing tools and proactive approaches to detect bid rigging, since fighting this conduct is a priority for the autarchy since the year of 2007. Then, the Project Cerebro computerized some work previously done by case handlers, which increased CADE’s efficiency in many investigation activities and resulted in an increasing of the number of investigation on bid rigging.
Once this project is a priority for CADE, it receives continuous investment in research and development, and during the past few years, as the tools and techniques were improved, the team responsible for the project noticed that some tools, originally intended for investigative purposes might be adapted for digital evidence analysis, by preselecting digital evidence more likely to contain information relevant for the investigation. This tool is still in the early stages of development, but it seems very promising for cartel investigations that have a high volume of digital evidence to be analyzed.

GRECO:
Thank you, Alexandre, is really remarkable this brain project and I remember when you told us about this in Argentina, when you were here and this and other tool that you mentioned has to do with technology and digital tools. So I wonder, what is your view on the challenges posed by the technology sector? And do you think there is a need for reforms?

CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Esteban, technology sector is a hot topic nowadays, both nationally and internationally, mostly considering that big tech companies generated great discussions about the role of competition authorities. CADE has a different and conservative approach to this matter in comparison to other competition authorities from Europe and United States, which are usually imposing heavy fines to big tech companies, such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, besides imposing constrictive measures to reduce their market share.
I believe that intervention in the natural flow of markets is a complex issue that requires parsimony and self-restraint to perform the duties of the antitrust authorities within the limits of our responsibilities.  Protecting a competitive environment entails restricting practices aimed solely at maintaining monopolistic positions without providing any sort of benefit related to efficiency, but it also entails encouraging free initiative and creativity. We understand that measures to regulate digital markets may reduce investments and stifle innovation – and efficient and innovative companies are important to the development of the market.
An effective control of concentrations goes beyond intervention or regulation, and CADE is giving special attention to the dynamics of competition in digital markets. Business models are varied and constantly replaced, and companies use several means to serve their consumers. At times, consumers themselves show companies the way to go, so in such complex environments, an intervention aimed at solving an issue might end up causing many more.
We understand the matter is not the size or the efficiency of the big tech companies, but what these companies are doing with their market power, which may result in abuse of dominant position. Actually, we are concerned about anticompetitive practices, abuse of dominant position that may harm competition.
In Brazil, we understand that traditional antitrust tools should not be given up, since antitrust enforcement is flexible enough to provide the guidelines and basis for protecting competition. However, they need to be adapted to the new challenges, in order to prevent unnecessary and excessive interventions that could discourage innovation and, consequently, the dynamic competition so intrinsic to digital markets. In addition, ex-post evaluation plays a crucial rule in informing decision making.

GRECO:
Thank you for your meaningful thoughts about this. In your view, aside technology sector, what are other industries that enforcement and attention or scrutiny?

CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Esteban, given the current economic context, CADE made significant efforts to elaborate several technical opinions on relevant issues related to the pandemic concerning legislative proposals, regulatory framework or thematic review related to different sectors, such as healthcare industry, oil, gas, educational services, and transport services.
The ports and civil aviation sectors have market failures that often affect the competitive environment, and both sectors have been object of several works conducted by CADE, given their economic relevance and the respective competition concerns.
CADE, for example, played an important role in the debates concerning the baggage allowance and Avianca’s remaining slots in the civil aviation market and in the discussions concerning the THC-2 charge in the ports sector, aiming to stimulate competition in these sectors.
In Brazil, the civil aviation sector has enough characteristics to spark competition concerns. This is because a number of conditions in the sector limit competition: strong growth movements, legal barriers to entry, coordinated airport infrastructure barriers, and high levels of investment for operation, all of which together make the market very concentrated and tend to be oligopolistic.
The same is true in the ports sector. The new Ports Law established a number of guidelines for the operation of ports, including stimulating competition, encouraging private sector participation, and allowing broad access to facilities and services. The need to increase the efficiency of the sector was the central point of the regulatory reform in 2012, but we still have a long way to go to improve competitiveness in this sector.
In partnership with the OECD and other national organizations, we are implementing the Project on Competition Assessment in Port and Civil Airport Sectors, which aims to discuss the importance of competition and regulation for economic development in both sectors. The OECD’s Competition Checklist is based on a series of simple questions to assess and identify laws and regulations that unnecessarily restrict competition. This will help foster the development of less restrictive public policies that favor competition and thus promote greater market access, international competitiveness, and long-term growth.

GRECO:
Thank you, alright. Really impressive, the quality and the scope of CADE’s activity and I think it’s really inspiring for all practitioners in this Latin American region. So this brings us to the last question that, what do you think will be the future direction for antitrust enforcement, both domestically and internationally?

CORDEIRO MACEDO:
Esteban, antitrust goes from one extreme to other: sometimes society demands regulators to go beyond conventional ideas and sometimes they go back to basics. Now we are heading to before the 80’s, before the Chicago School, when regulators tried to be in charge of everything. In my opinion, we will soon see this will not work out and return to a more technical and specific analysis.
I am averse to any kind of activism that diverts our antitrust body from what I believe to be its primary mission: to look after the welfare of consumers. CADE tends to be more orthodox in its analysis – that is, we still guide our actions according to welfare standards. We do not bring social, environmental, and tax issues to our reviews. We are concerned with consumer welfare and economic efficiency.
I am not saying social, environmental, and labor matters are negligible. I just think they are not under the scope of antitrust law. I do not think the competition authority should be concerned with them, at least in Brazil, where CADE has the well-set role of looking after competition only. This is even so the case, because if we increase our scope to address all these topics we will open up a Pandora’s Box. Then, we will not be analyzing mergers under an antitrust perspective any longer; we will be discussing social matters – which undermines enforcement.
At first, people can think this would make CADE’s enforcement stronger, as our decisions would embrace much more, taking in other fields. However, from medium to long term it would have the opposite effect. In addition, in this scenario, other authorities would certainly try to limit our jurisdiction. That is why we prefer to focus on anticompetitive conduct that can damage competition, not social matters.

Two US senators have introduced bipartisan legislation that seeks to make it harder for Amazon and other tech giants to make acquisitions, reported Reuters. The office of Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, said on Friday that she and Republican Tom Cotton had introduced a bill targeting such companies Google and Facebook.
The bill would make it easier for the government to stop deals it believes break antitrust law by requiring the companies to prove to a judge that the deals are good for competition, and therefore legal.
A similar bill, introduced by Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries and others, has been approved in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and awaits a vote by the full House.
Traditionally it is up to the government in antitrust enforcement to show a particular transaction would cause prices to rise or is illegal for other reasons.
“We’re increasingly seeing companies choose to buy their rivals rather than compete,” Klobuchar said in a statement.
“This bipartisan legislation will put an end to those anticompetitive acquisitions by making it more difficult for dominant digital platforms to eliminate their competitors and enhance the platform’s market power.” Working with others, Klobuchar introduced a bill in October that would bar Big Tech platforms from favoring their products and services.

Spain has adopted a European Union copyright directive that allows third-party online news platforms to negotiate directly with content providers, Reuters reported. This will allow Alphabet’s Google News to return to the country.
In September of 2014, Google News, which links to third-party content, closed in response to legislation that forced it to pay a collective licensing fee to republish headlines or snippets of news.
The EU legislation, which must be adopted by all member states, requires platforms such as Google, Facebook and others to share revenue with publishers but it also removes the collective fee and allows them to reach individual or group agreements with publishers.
Google said it wanted to bring its news services back to Spain but would closely analyse the law before making any firm commitment.
“Based on the initial information… conditions look promising for the potential launch of Google News in Spain. However, we will need to see the final law before making any formal announcements,” a spokesperson said in an email.
Spain’s Culture Ministry said the new law brought national copyright legislation into step with the digital environment and would help artists and creators to receive fair remuneration for their work.

By Mark Smith, Bloomberg
Data security has evolved from a best practice to a required practice in many instances, but it may also factor as a business justification in the ever-growing antitrust frenzy against Big Tech.
In last year’s forecast, I discussed bipartisan rancor brewing against tech giants, particularly in the areas of privacy and antitrust. That unrest picked up steam in 2021, with the introduction of more bills, investigations, and enforcement actions.
The ire, however, is not limited to legislators and regulators purportedly battling on behalf of Davidesque entrepreneurs and small business rivals. Indeed, the fight against Big Tech also includes corporate giants, like Epic Games Inc.
Notably, Epic filed an antitrust suit against Apple last year, alleging that Apple’s “monopolistic” control over its “walled garden”—i.e., Apple’s mobile device operating system (iOS)—violated federal and state antitrust laws as well as California’s unfair competition law (UCL). Specifically, Epic claimed that by requiring iOS developers like itself to distribute their apps through the App Store, and by further requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system for in-app purchases, Apple violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

EU countries aim to agree on a common negotiating position on two sets of draft rules to curb the powers of US tech giants on Nov. 25, people involved in the discussions said on Friday.
The Digital Markets Act sets out a list of dos and don’ts for online gatekeepers – companies that control data and access to their platforms – such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet unit Google and Facebook.
The Digital Services Act (DSA) requires tech companies to do more to tackle illegal content on their online platforms. Violations can result in hefty fines.
EU countries have agreed on most key points for the DSA and will discuss the last remaining issue, namely who gets to regulate very large online platforms, during a preparatory meeting on Nov. 8, the people said.
The current rules mean that Ireland regulates Facebook, Google and Apple because they have their European headquarters there. Some countries however also want the same power.
A compromise proposal put forward by the French government and on the Nov. 8 agenda would allow the European Commission to regulate very large online platforms with more than 45 million active users in the EU in one year, the people said.

By: Robert Connolly (Cartel Capers)
At an October 1, 2021 in-person conference (Fordham’s 48th Annual Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy) Acting Assistant Attorney General Richard A. Powers of the Antitrust Division spoke about the history of and Antitrust Division’s commitment to enforcing the antitrust laws, including criminal enforcement, in labor markets:  “If it was important for enforcers to protect competition in labor markets decades ago — and I believe it was — it is essential now.”
I suggest reading the speech in its entirety (here) but I’ll quote a few of the remarks:
“Between 2010 and 2012, the Division filed civil enforcement actions against Adobe, Apple, eBay, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm, and Pixar for entering into unlawful agreements not to compete for each other’s workers through various means. These enforcement actions were important for a few reasons. First, they made clear that companies that do not compete to make or sell the same products or services nonetheless compete vigorously in labor markets. That is why they have incentives to collude in a labor market in the first instance. Second, the investigation reaffirmed that agreements to allocate labor markets are no different than agreements to allocate markets by territory or customer. [Well, they were treated a little differently as these likely would have been criminal cases given the explicit evidence of agreement but civil cases were brought first as a sort of “warning shot.].Beginning in October 2016, the Division made a series of public statements that, going forward, it intends to criminally prosecute naked labor market allocation and wage-fixing conspiracies.Since that time, labor market investigations have comprised a growing portion of our docket. Thus far, we have charged four criminal cases for alleged collusion in labor markets….

“Break ‘em up with antitrust” is a popular and surging political drumbeat. This essay argues for a closer look at history and experience.

The essay takes a special look at the breakup of Ma Bell — a restructuring that needed to happen — recalling that even this rare success took a decade after the trial to implement.

By Eleanor M. Fox & Donald I. Baker1
         
I. INTRODUCTION
“Antitrust” had been a low-profile technical discipline for decades. But then came the rise of Big Tech/Big Data platforms, an explosion of public fear that the platforms are taking over our lives and minds, political campaigns highlighting their alleged predations, and the emergence of a popular narrative that goes like this:
The Big Tech firms are pervasive, abusive and dangerous; enemies of the people. They subvert democracy and the economy. They misuse our data, they gobble up rising stars, they sabotage firms that compete on their platforms, they wall-in their gardens and dig moats around their castles. They spread disinformation and nurture divisiveness. They are too big and powerful. Antitrust is the tried and trusted tool. Break ‘em up.2
We write this essay to push back on the myth-telling and to cast a clear eye on what is the problem and what are the questions that should inform any restructuring s...

803,"October 25, 2021","If Breaking Up Is the Answer, Then What Is the Question?","
Antitrust and policy circles are abuzz with calls against the power, monopoly and other, held by large firms. If one is worried about a firm being too large, then the solution seems obvious: break up the firm and surely that will solve the problem. Any attempt to break up large firms is likely to face many practical and legal challenges. In this article I ask whether breakup is the correct answer, even if these challenges can be overcome.

By Aviv Nevo1
 
In many policy circles big tech companies, usually meant to refer to Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, are viewed as having too much power.2 Despite such concerns, consumers continue to shop on Amazon, search using Google, connect with their friends using Facebook and Instagram, and purchase Apple devices and services. Consumers’ continued support of these companies could be an indication that the products and services offered by big tech have benefited consumers and are superior to alternatives, or they could be an indication that consumers are locked into choices and effectively denied alternative options and the benefits of healthy competition.
Critics of big tech clearly think it is the latter and have proposed solving the problem by making big tech somewhat smaller. This involves limiting future acquisitions as well as potentially breaking up existing business units. For example, some have called for separating Amazon the retailer from Amazon the marketplace, to undo Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram...

804,"October 25, 2021",The Value of Data and Its Impact on Competition,"
Common regulatory perspective on the relationship between data, value, and competition in online platforms has increasingly centered on the volume of data accumulated by incumbent firms. This view posits the existence of “data network effects,” where more data leads to product improvements, which in turn leads to additional users and more data. In particular, this has raised concerns around incumbent data advantage creating an insurmountable barrier to entry and leading to winner-take-all outcomes in online platforms. However, this perspective generally does not reflect the value of data in practical settings. More recent work across economics, management science, and engineering shows that there are a variety of factors that impact the value of data and that implications for competition are much more complex and subtle. The framework in this paper presents four key factors – data quality, scale and scope of data, and data uniqueness – that can influence the value that firms can derive from data. Applying the framework to Netflix, Waymo, and the online advertising industry provides compelling evidence that incumbent data advantage, while generating value for innovation and for the consumer experience, does not necessarily lock out competitors and is not determinative of success. These examples illustrate that data can often serve as a catalyst for innovation that benefits both consumers and the broader ecosystem. The extent to which data accumulation can provide actu...

805,"October 25, 2021",The Limits of Antitrust in the New Economy,"
The rise of industrial concentration throughout the US economy has brought antitrust policy to the center of public debate. In many different sectors, a small number of large businesses are increasingly dominant. An increasing popular view amongst both academics and policymakers holds that this is a problem, one that can be reversed in large part by more aggressive antitrust enforcement. The other side of this debate normally takes a benign view of the rise of big business. Here I outline a third, alternative position: that the rise of industrial concentration is a problem, but one that antitrust law will probably not be able to systematically address. Instead, we may have to look to policies that more deeply address the underlying causes of the growing technological distance between big and small business.

Interest in antitrust law is cyclical. But the cycles stretch over many decades, to the point that a young practitioner or academic in, say, 2021, might not realize the extent to which debates over antitrust policy today so closely mirror debates that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. And sure enough, a historically familiar perspective has ascended in policy circles today: that a small number of big businesses have taken over a large amount of market share throughout the U.S. economy, and this rise in industrial concentration, caused by excessively lax antitrust enforcement, is bad for the economy, and must now be reversed ...

On Monday, October 18, a bipartisan group of US senators formally introduced a bill that would bar Big Tech platforms, like Amazon and Google, from favoring their products and services.
According to Reuters, the bill follows others introduced with the goal of reining in the market power of big tech firms. So far none became law, although one, which would increase resources for antitrust enforcers, passed the Senate.
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley’s bill would prohibit platforms from requiring companies operating on their sites to purchase the platform’s goods or services and ban them from biasing search results to favor the platform.
Related: Klobuchar, Grassley To Introduce Antitrust Bill Aiding Amazon Sellers
Amazon said in a statement that the bill, if it became law, “would harm consumers and the more than 500,000 US small and medium-sized businesses that sell in the Amazon store, and it would put at risk the more than 1 million jobs created by those businesses.”
Google stated that the measure would make it more difficult for companies to offer free services — Google’s search and maps are both free — and would make “those services less safe, less private and less secure.”
Klobuchar chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee while Grassley is the top Republican on the full committee. Co-sponsors include five Democrats and five Republicans.
The bill would have profound implications for companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google which all run their own marketplaces for products or information. Those companies have been accused of ranking their own products higher than rivals’ in an attempt to generate more profits for themselves.

810,"October 17, 2021",Big Tech Deepens Divides Over EU Regulation,"


A frank intervention in the European parliament last month captured the frustrations that are blunting the EU’s attempts to curb the powers of Big Tech, reported The Financial Times. 
Last year, the EU unveiled a radical blueprint for tech regulation that would put onerous responsibilities on the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon to clean up their platforms and ensure fair competition.
But since then, the package of measures has become bogged down in the European parliament, and now risks being watered down and heavily delayed.
There are even fears in Brussels that the new rules will not be in place before Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition and digital policy chief, leaves her post in three years.
“It sounded like we had agreed but that is not the case . . . at all. We are a long way from having a common position on this,” Evelyne Gebhardt, a German MEP, said in exasperation during last month’s debate.
The slow progress also gives Big Tech more time to fully capture key sectors of the economy. “If we wait too long some markets will not be able to be repaired any more. This is about protecting consumers and small companies in Europe. We need to get this done as soon as possible,” said one person directly involved in the parliamentary debate.
The two proposed bills are the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to force the so-called gatekeepers, such as Google, to ensure a level playing field on their vast online platforms, and the Digital Services Act (DSA), which clarifies the responsibilities of Big Tech for keeping illegal content off their services.

811,"October 17, 2021","Klobuchar, Grassley To Introduce Antitrust Bill Aiding Amazon Sellers","


Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, said she will soon introduce a major antitrust bill aimed at Big Tech alongside Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reported CNBC. 
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which shares a name and broad features with a bill introduced by House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., would prohibit dominant online platforms from engaging in discriminatory behavior. That could include wielding their gatekeeper power to disadvantage rivals or to preference their own products over others.
Cicilline’s version of the bill was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee this summer.
The bill would have profound implications for companies like Amazon, Apple and Google which all run their own marketplaces for products or information. Those companies have been accused of ranking their own products higher than rivals’ in an attempt to generate more profits for themselves.
Third-party sellers on Amazon, for example, have suspected the platform ranks its own similar private-label products over their own. Travel or local search sites like Yelp and Tripadvisor have complained that Google unfairly lowers their links in search results in favor of prime placement of its Google Maps tool. The platforms have denied any misconduct and say their decisions are based on determinations about what will make up the best experience for users.
“Congress and tech companies have plenty of work to do to make the Internet better, safer, and healthier — but instead of doing that, this bill takes a hammer to tech products that consumers love,” wrote Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a center-left group backed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, among others. “Preventing Amazon from selling Amazon Basics and banning Google’s maps from its search results isn’t going to do anything to make the Internet better for families.”
Klobuchar said in a statement that the bill would grant more choice to consumers.
“As Big Tech has grown and evolved over the years, our laws have not changed to keep up and ensure these companies are competing fairly,” Grassley said in a statement. “Big Tech needs to be held accountable if they behave in a discriminatory manner. Our bill will help create a more even playing field and ensure that small businesses are able to compete with these platforms.”

812,"October 17, 2021",South Korea Investigates Apple Over Payment Rules,"


Apple may be facing an investigation by the government of South Korea over whether the tech giant is truly complying with the nation’s new requirements dealing with its payment systems.
As Reuters reported Friday (Oct. 15), the issue stems from South Korea’s recent changes to the Telecommunication Business Act in an effort to prevent tech giants Apple and Google for charging developers commissions on in-app purchases.
The law went into effect in September, with Apple telling the government of South Korea that it was already in compliance and didn’t need to update its app store policy.
“This goes against the purpose of the amended law,” one Korean Communications Commission official said, asking for anonymity as the government was still in talks with Apple.
The KCC will ask Apple’s South Korean operations for a new policy that gives more autonomy in payment methods. If Apple doesn’t comply, the KCC will consider conducting a fact-finding probe ahead of possible fines or other penalties.
The KCC official said Google had informed the commission it would comply with the law and allow third-party payment systems and would discuss the matter with the KCC next week.
Neither Google or Apple replied to requests for comment.
Apple has more to lose here than Google, said Jung Jong-chae, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust matters.
“(The) differences between Apple and Google in willingness to give ground may be because Apple controls everything from hardware to operating system (OS) to app market to payment system,” he said, “and (Apple) has more to lose if its dominance breaks on any front, which could lead to calls for openness on other fronts.”

813,"October 14, 2021","Joan Robinson, Efficiencies from Concentration, and the Evolution of Competition Policy","
British economist Joan Robinson’s profound contributions to industrial economics still resonate across a wide range of subject matter. Her work is particularly relevant in the context of heightened concerns over whether product market concentration in developed Western economies has, in recent decades, resulted in both increased market power and increased buyer power – and whether this, in turn, has led to a rise in inequality and a decline in the share of value accruing to labor. At the same time, many competition agencies around the world remain skeptical about the potential for mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) to result in substantive cost reducing efficiencies. In this article, I highlight, through the lens of Robinson’s writing, the tensions between these two stances, and reflect on how Robinson’s analysis could influence future competition policy. My hope is that, in the important debate about the future evolution of competition policy, proponents on both sides can ultimately agree that we must collectively ensure worldviews underlying any changes are, at a minimum, consistent.

814,"October 14, 2021",Korean FTC To Accelerate Korean Air-Asiana Airlines Acquisition,"


Korea’s airline industry is expecting travel demand to boom again after more than a two-year slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the government takes steps to initiate a phased return to normal starting from the second week of next month. 
However, the process of Korean Air acquiring rival Asiana Airlines, which began in November of last year, is taking longer than expected. 
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) is raising concerns over Korean Air’s possible monopoly in the domestic market if the acquisition is approved. The top antitrust watchdog claims the combination of two full-service carriers can infringe on free competition in the flight service market.
Top regulator Joh Sung-wook told lawmakers that the KFTC will try to conclude its review by the end of this year. But with the start of a phased return to normal next month, the KFTC is facing calls to speed up its review, because the airline industry is one of Korea’s key business sectors.
The acquisition proposal is subject to approval from countries or regions whose industries will be affected by the merger. Korean Air has sought relevant approvals however only Turkey, Taiwan, and Thailand have given the deal the green light, while China, the EU, Japan, the US, and Vietnam are still reviewing the plan.
This led Korean Air to postpone the acquisition of Asiana Airlines shares to December 31. If any of the remaining countries disapproves the deal, Korean Air will not be able to acquire Asiana.
State-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) is said to have asked the KFTC to take prompt action regarding the pending issue. The rationale is that the more time the antitrust watchdog takes to review the deal, the more time the airline industry will need to normalize operations when the phased return to normal or “living with COVID-19” plan kicks off. 
“When the EU tried to regulate Amazon, Google and Facebook, the United States protected them. But Korean authorities are waiting for other countries to make the decision first before they do. It is regrettable that the KFTC is not showing enthusiasm here,” KDB Chairman Lee Dong-gull said.

815,"October 13, 2021",Apple Says There Are Security Risks If EU Opens Its Software,"


On Wednesday, October 13, Apple ramped up its criticism of EU draft rules that would force it to allow users to install software from outside its App Store, claiming that would boost the risk of cybercriminals and malware.
But the Coalition for App Fairness, which includes Spotify, Match Group, and Epic Games, dismissed Apple’s arguments, and stated that built-in security measures such as encrypted data and antivirus programs provide security to devices, not the App Store.
The group wants regulators to loosen Apple’s grip on its App Store so they can bypass it to reach Apple’s hundreds of millions of users and also to avoid paying commissions of up to 30% for purchases made in the Store.
The iPhone maker has been a fierce critic of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s proposed rules, announced last year in a bid to rein in Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet unit Google.
Building on CEO Tim Cook’s comments in June about the risks to privacy and security of iPhones, on Wednesday Apple published an analysis on the threats of so-called side-loading. 
“If Apple were forced to support sideloading, more harmful apps would reach users because it would be easier for cybercriminals to target them – even if sideloading were limited to third-party app stores only,” the report stated.

A coalition of anti-monopoly groups attacked the claim by US technology giants that bills aiming to crimp their power pose national security risks, arguing that over-reliance on a handful of companies is more dangerous, reported Bloomberg.
The most powerful US tech companies put shareholder profit over public interest, according to a letter from public advocacy groups obtained by Bloomberg News that rejects warnings about a series of antitrust bills before Congress.
The letter addressed to House leaders seeks to rebut the argument, voiced recently by several former national security officials, that moving forward with legislation targeting Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Google would disadvantage US companies and compromise their partnerships with the Pentagon
Related: New Study Says Antitrust Bills Put US Security At Risk
In the letter, the groups highlighted examples including Apple’s supply-chain reliance on China and reports that US tech companies aid in Chinese surveillance and censorship. The groups argue that business decisions in the interest of creating value for shareholders will always win out over national security and human rights concern. 
“Big Tech is not here to help national security or the public interest, but to maintain monopoly rents and market power,” the groups wrote. “It is codified in their corporate structure and law. It is the government’s job to protect our national security, not Mark Zuckerberg’s.”

817,"October 10, 2021",DOJ Continues Its Push On Antitrust Enforcement,"
The Justice Department (DOJ) has been ramping up antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration, despite not having a politically confirmed official to serve as antitrust chief.
The Department shares antitrust authority with the Federal Trade Commission, whose new liberal leadership has drawn much of the early spotlight. Yet in recent months, the DOJ has blocked a major insurance-industry merger between Aon and rival Willis Towers Watson; filed an aggressive challenge to a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue; and withdrawn from a real-estate industry settlement in order to take a deeper look at whether industry practices keep some broker commissions artificially high.
Antitrust staffers are advancing investigations of business practices at Apple, Google (which already is facing one Justice Department antitrust lawsuit), and Visa. The Department’s antitrust division also is deep into scrutinizing some high-profile pending mergers. Those include a publishing industry deal in which Penguin Random House’s parent company is seeking to buy Simon & Schuster, and UnitedHealth’s planned acquisition of health-care technology company Change Healthcare.
Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking at the New Yorker Festival on Monday, described the antitrust division as “energized and eager to go forward,” saying the Department had ongoing matters “involving everything from agriculture, to banking, to real estate.”
“We do think that ensuring fair competition is an essential element of our obligation to ensure that justice is done,” he said.

818,"October 10, 2021",French Antitrust Chief Was “Surprised” To Be Removed From Post,"


France’s antitrust chief has expressed her “surprise” and “disappointment” at President Emmanuel Macron’s decision not to renew her mandate in the middle of a review of a far-reaching broadcasting merger and several competition cases against US tech giants. 
Isabelle de Silva, who won plaudits after imposing two penalties against Google for a combined €720 million, said she found out last week that she would not be nominated by the French president for a second five-year term, and will therefore leave on October 13. The Elysée has not commented on the decision. 
“Until a few days ago I was quite confident that I would be renewed although you never have absolute certainty,” she told the Financial Times. “So it came as a bit of a surprise.”
“I would have liked to continue, but obviously I respect the decision and hope a new person will continue the work I have started. It is a personal disappointment for me and my team to have to come to terms with.”
The decision comes six months before presidential elections, in which Macron is seeking a second term, and at a time when the regulator is reviewing several large national mergers. One of them is the tie-up between TF1, France’s largest broadcaster, and smaller group M6. Tf1 is owned by construction billionaire Martin Bouygues and its 8pm news program is the most watched with about 6 million viewers on average.

Japan’s Fair Trade Commission will investigate whether Apple is leveraging their dominance in the smartphone operating system market to eliminate competition and severely limit options for consumers, reported Nikkei. 
The study will involve interviews and surveys with OS operators, app developers and smartphone users, commission Secretary-General Shuichi Sugahisa told reporters Wednesday. The initiative will explore market conditions not only for smartphones, but for smartwatches and other wearables.
The antitrust watchdog will compile a report outlining OS market structure and the reason why competition has remained static. The commission will work with the central government’s Digital Market Competition Council, which is moving forward with its own market probe.
Practices found to be anticompetitive will be itemized in the report, along with possible violations of Japan’s law against monopolies.
In February, the government implemented the Act on Improving Transparency and Fairness of Digital Platforms. If officials decide that the law applies to the OS market, OS operators will be told to submit regular reports on transactions to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
In Japan, Apple’s iOS commands a nearly 70% share among smartphone operating systems while Android’s share stands at 30%. Any developer of apps — whether they specialize in music, streaming videos, e-books or mobile games — need to match the software with specifications of the operating systems if they want to appear on smartphones.

Facebook’s six-hour outage the previous day shows the repercussions of relying on just a few big players and underscores the need for more rivals, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday, October 5.
The outage prevented the company’s 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector. read more
Droves of users switched to competing apps such as Twitter and TikTok on Monday. Several Facebook employees who declined to be named told Reuters that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems.
The incident showed the need for more competition, Vestager wrote on Twitter. “We need alternatives and choices in the tech market, and must not rely on a few big players, whoever they are, that’s the aim of (the) DMA,” she tweeted.
#facebookdown tells 2 things :1/ we need alternatives & choices in the #tech market, and must not rely on a few big players, whoever they are => that’s the aim of #DMA2/ that sometimes, there’s nothing better than talking to each other… just on the phone or … offline?— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) October 5, 2021 
Vestager last year proposed draft rules known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that sets out a list of dos and don’ts for Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google that in essence will force them to change their core business model to allow more competition.
EU lawmakers and EU countries are now debating their own proposals and will need to reconcile the three drafts before the tech rules come into force.

Below, we have provided the full transcript of the interview with Joshua Wright, Professor of Law at George Mason University, recorded on September 24, 2021.
This interview was done as part of the Antitrust Brainstorming Board created by CPI with the support of the CCIA.
Thank you, Prof. Wright, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
A video of the complete interview is available HERE.
 
Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Joshua WRIGHT:
I think the current antitrust framework largely does work for competition and consumers. The historical arc of antitrust is such that the current framework, usually we think about that as being encompassed by the consumer welfare standard. We took 70, 80 years of trial and error and getting a lot of things wrong to get here. While there are some tweaks in the system, no system is perfect. I think the U.S. system that we’ve adopted over that 70 or 80 years, until we adopted the Consumer Welfare Standard in the late seventies to current, largely works well by deterring anti-competitive behavior while still allowing consumers to benefit from competition that improves their lives.

Do you believe the vertical merger guidelines need to be changed?
WRIGHT:
Well, they’re largely gone now, right? Recently, with the vertical mergers being withdrawn at least by one agency, no doubt some changes are coming. But I’m happy to talk about what I think both about the guidelines that the FTC r...

822,"October 4, 2021",Top Big Tech Investigator Quits European Commission,"


EU competition czar Margrethe Vestager is losing another of her most experienced commanders in the campaign against Google to a large law firm, reported Politico.
Longtime official Nicholas Banasevic, who spearheaded the European Commission’s antitrust probes against Google, will join the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher The date of the move is still to be confirmed.
Banasevic is far from being the first high-profile name to jump ship this year. His move follows the departure of two other top competition officials with long experience in fighting Silicon Valley giants — Cecilio Madero Villarejo and Carles Esteva Mosso — who also are joining law firms that act for the very same companies. Madero was the chief of antitrust within the Commission’s competition department when Vestager launched her crusade against Google.
Banasevic has “decided to leave DG Competition and the Commission to join private practice,” Olivier Guersent, director general of the European Commission’s competition department, informed his staff on Monday morning. “Nick has been key to the success of a number of the landmark cases that have made the reputation of excellence of DG Competition,” Guersent wrote in an email seen by POLITICO.
Banasevic, a British national, has worked at DG Competition for more than 20 years. Since 2012, he has headed the unit that brought three Google investigations that hit the search giant with more than €8 billion in fines. On November 10, the EU General Court will rule on Google’s challenge of the first of those cases, which saw the company fined €2.42 billion over its shopping comparison service.
While the Commission has successfully concluded these cases with fines against the search giant, complainants in the cases grumble that Brussels’ action has been less effective at reining in Google’s dominance of the market.
The announcement of Banasevic’s departure comes right after a five-day court hearing in Luxembourg over the Commission’s €4.3 billion Android case against Google. At the court, the case team was represented not by Banasevic, but by his long-time deputy Brice Allibert.

823,"October 3, 2021",Big Tech Gives Feedback On Antitrust Legislation,"


Four of the biggest US technology companies are getting a belated chance to give feedback on antitrust legislation that could force drastic changes to their business models and consumer products, according to Bloomberg. 
The House antitrust subcommittee last month asked Alphabet’s Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple for more information on how the panel’s package of antitrust bills would affect the companies. 
The request comes more than three months after the House Judiciary Committee approved the measures on bipartisan votes, despite complaints from the companies that the process was rushed and they hadn’t been given an opportunity to weigh in.
The bills are stalled amid a busy legislative calendar and several fiscal deadlines demanding Congress’s attention. When asked about the legislation during a Tuesday, October 5, hearing, House antitrust Chairman David Cicilline said he’s working with Republicans to make sure that members of both parties understand the technology markets that the subcommittee examined during a 16-month investigation.
Related: New Study Says Antitrust Bills Put US Security At Risk
“We are committed to making sure these bills come to the floor, not just for a vote but for a vote that prevails,” added Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. 
Two of the people familiar with the House request for more information said it was odd for the query to come after the committee already debated the bills. Three of the four companies have responded with general complaints about the proposals, and one of those is working on more detailed feedback. One company still hasn’t responded.

824,"October 1, 2021",Senate Confirms Chopra As Consumer Watchdog,"
The Senate confirmed Rohit Chopra as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday, September 30, putting in place a seasoned regulator and Wall Street critic to police lending.
Senators approved Chopra in a 50-48 vote. No Republican supported his nomination, reflecting long-running antagonism from the right over the very existence of the consumer bureau, which Democrats set up a decade ago to crack down on predatory lending.
Chopra, who for the last three years served at the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to revive a more aggressive posture toward the finance industry after Democrats blasted the Trump administration for weakening consumer safeguards. The agency is the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat – Massachusetts), and Chopra helped her set up the bureau after its enactment in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
Credit reporting companies, small-dollar lenders, debt collectors, and financial technology startups are among the players expected to face scrutiny from Chopra’s CFPB, as well as the student loan industry and mortgage servicers. The agency under interim leadership for the last eight months has already taken some initial steps to address lenders’ pandemic-era treatment of consumers and to advance the Biden administration’s racial justice priorities.
“It’s already on the track, but Chopra’s going to be driving the train faster,” said Allyson Baker, a former CFPB enforcement attorney and the chair of the law firm Venable’s financial services practice.
Chopra’s confirmation is the latest victory for progressives who have so far succeeded in putting their stamp on the Biden administration’s recruitment of top financial regulators. President Joe Biden has scattered allies of Warren and other liberal lawmakers throughout agencies tasked with overseeing the finance industry, including Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.

Dear Readers,
Since 2012, when the Commission launched its State Aid Modernisation (“SAM”) reform of aid policy, new regulations have been steadily forthcoming – including, just last week, the adoption of new General Block Exemptions. So, it’s more than timely that this CPI issue brings us up to date on State aid. The first group of papers analyze the new reforms from a variety of perspectives. We then look at where State aid and private mandates intersect, followed by an especially topical question: How will State aid in the financial sector work with the reformed EU Banking Union?
Our last article strays from the topic, but merits being Of Special Interest given how many high-tech mergers authorities are currently analyzing — there are interesting lessons to be gained from a look back at the Google-AdMob merger.

Jonathan Kanter, President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the antitrust division of the Justice Department, will appear for a confirmation hearing next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee published on its website.
Kanter’s nomination is not expected to spark any significant opposition at the hearing on Wednesday, October 6. If the committee approves the nomination, it will go to the full Senate for confirmation.
Biden’s decision to pick Kanter, a longtime critic of Alphabet’s Google, as the Justice Department’s antitrust chief is the latest sign the White House is determined to rein in the world’s biggest corporations, especially Big Tech. Progressives who advocate tougher enforcement of antitrust law pushed for his nomination.
Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Google. The Justice Department sued Google last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals.
The Biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise, Tim Wu for the National Economic Council, and Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
If confirmed by the Senate, Kanter will take the reins of the Justice Department’s antitrust division amid calls for tougher enforcement, with special criticism aimed at Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.

Russia on Wednesday, September 29, threatened to block YouTube and the Kremlin called for “zero tolerance” towards the video hosting giant after it removed Russian state-backed broadcaster RT’s German-language channels from its site.
The online video company owned by Alphabet deleted Russian state-backed broadcaster RT’s German-language channels on Tuesday, stating that they had breached its COVID-19 misinformation policy.
On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it would block all anti-vaccine content, moving beyond COVID-19 to include content that alleges vaccines cause chronic health effects or contains misinformation on the substances in vaccines. 
Russia stated it was considering retaliating against German media and also accused YouTube of “unprecedented information aggression” after the company’s move against the RT channels.
The row creates a new line of tension in Russia’s standoff with foreign tech giants and its long-running push to assert greater sovereignty over its segment of the internet.
Russian state communications regulator Roskomnadzor stated it had written to Google and demanded that the YouTube restrictions on the RT channels be lifted. Russia could partially or fully restrict access to YouTube if it failed to comply, it added.

Dear Readers,
In this issue, we deal with the emergent issue of the competition concerns that arise in connection with Big Data. The contributors in this special issue on Big Data discuss several relevant questions – what role should Big Data play in assessment of mergers, i.e. should having and controlling consumer data be viewed as a form of market power. Then there is the related question on whether it is correct to deem “privacy” to be a non-price consideration in antitrust analysis, and whether it is fair to assume that entities owning big data have the power to foreclose markets, and which theories of harm may be applicable in context of big data. These questions reflect the thought process on big data underlying the Google/DoubleClick case in the EU and the Facebook/Watsapp decision in the U.S. The contributing authors in this issue help us look at Big Data and seek to encourage a more nuanced look at the competition concerns it may raise.
As always, thank you to our great panel of authors.

829,"September 27, 2021",Competing for Free,"
A feature of many digital platforms is that they offer services to one side of the platform “for free.” In some instances, the business model requires the consumer to trade their data and attention in return for “free” services. We consider how providing consumers with a service that is ‘free’ can provide consumer benefits but also make it harder for potential rivals to contest that market, since it can be very difficult to undercut an incumbent selling goods for “free.” Price reductions below zero are sometimes possible, as shown by cashback and bundled offers, but can be more challenging when the payment is in data or attention. In addition, any move away from free, up or down, may require a significant additional transaction cost, which can be a significant barrier to consumer switching in certain situations.

By Dr. Helen Jenkins, Dave Jevons & Dr. Andrew Mell1

I. INTRODUCTION
Consumers have been offered a variety of services “for free” for a long time, however the rise of digital technologies which exhibit high fixed costs and low variable costs has increased the prevalence of “free” services, including free internet search; free email; free social networking; free microblogging; and free entertainment. Of course, in economic terms, a free lunch is very rare, and consumers are typically paying for these services through a form of barter with their attention and their data.2 This is not a new phenomenon: historically consumers have recei...

Consumers on the Internet routinely give away data — information about their habits, preferences, purchasing patterns, contacts and more — in return for “free” access to an abundance of platforms and sites. While this may be an attractive model for some users, most are operating with less than full information. In the digital world, what is “freely” given can actually come with embedded costs. Defining large quantities of user data as a product cognizable under antitrust laws raises questions as to whether such data can confer market power, and what the consumer welfare implications of its use are. In addition to the personal cost to individuals, effective control of the data comes with a community cost: other innovators are barred from using those “free” inputs. This essay assesses the current state of antitrust matters related to the monetization of “free” data and where the landscape might be headed.

Little in this world is actually free. A particularly American salivation response is activated when we are informed, or believe, that something we receive, or could acquire, is “free.” A coupon for “buy 2 get 1 free” often inspires additional purchases; sales of bulk products at mega supermarkets may result in the acquisition of more mayonnaise jars than any family could consume in a decade. In the digital sphere, the Internet presents itself as a smorgasbord of “free”: free information, news, podcasts, so...

831,"September 27, 2021",Monetary Remedies for Zero-Price Privacy Regulation: An Economic Perspective,"
Zero-price goods and services potentially create a problem for regulators interested in crafting monetary remedies that are deterrent, efficient, and inexpensive to implement in that they prevent the use of an easy proxy for injury or gain. Major privacy regulations in the EU and U.S. seem to have focused on deterrence, but in pursuit of cheap, have left any hope of efficiency to the discretion of the enforcers with little guidance on what that would mean. This paper examines regulatory choices for monetary remedies in the context of zero-price privacy and data security practices. The paper lays out the economic framework consistent with a broad range of potential harms, and argue that failing to provide any link or guidance between these remedies and the welfare effects of the practices in question will create opportunity for regulatory capture or improper political influence, and muddy the deterrent signal to potential violators.

For efficiency reasons, economists often argue that monetary remedies for competition or consumer protection law violations should be tied, at least proportionally, to the welfare effects of those violations. Here, efficiency means both accounting for the intended benefits of regulatory activity and attempting to minimize any effects on legitimate activity. A convenient, if incomplete and sometimes misleading, way to proxy for negative welfare effects is with a price premium associated with the practice in question....

Since the release of its Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report in 2019, the ACCC has continued to be active in investigating digital platform market issues in Australia, including the collection and use of consumer data in exchange for the provision of “free” services. The ACCC has initiated a variety of enforcement actions before the courts relating to these services. However, these cases have not to date used Australia’s competition law but rather have been brought under consumer laws. This article explores whether current Australian competition laws are sufficient to address data issues or whether it is likely that, like their international counterparts, the ACCC may also move towards an ex-ante regulatory regime to govern digital platforms.

Consumers often exchange their personal data for “free” access to a digital service on one side of the market while the relevant digital platform sells that data (including after combining it with the consumer’s data across other services) to customers on the other side of the market. This multi-sided exchange has led to a variety of benefits. These include increased digital participation, economies of scale and innovations and efficiencies. However, such services are arguably not “free” in reality: because consu...

833,"September 27, 2021",Free as Air?,"
“Free” once had a simple meaning – something without constraint whatsoever, as in “free as air.” At times, some have suggested that antitrust enforcement should not target “free” services – but “free” is Protean in meaning. After all, “there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” “No-monetary-payment” is not the same thing as “free.” Making someone else pay is not “free.” Finally, receiving something in exchange for the alteration of one’s mind is not “free.” Firms, products and markets have changed; so too, must competition law. Recent cases against firms that provide users applications without monetary payment, such as Google and Facebook, suggest that competition law enforcers increasingly understand that “free” cannot be a get-out-of-antitrust enforcement card. These cases bear watching to gauge whether and how competition law can evolve as firms, products, and markets have done.

Services offered by Google, Facebook, and their kin are not truly free: users contribute to the monetization of the platform. The question is not whether a market can be defined for zero-price services, but rather how this should be done. This short piece assesses whether personal data can be conceptualized as a price, to enable a substitution analysis for zero-price services. To do so, the piece focuses on the notion of price and its role in quantitative substitution analysis (when consumers react to price changes) in the context of personal data. It makes a reflection on the feasibility of conceptualizing personal data as a price. This would require answering two questions: first, is there a relationship of exchange between the user and the platform; second, can reactions to changes in personal data collection be used to assess substitution. The piece then briefly considers a revised SSNIP test with personal data.

835,"September 23, 2021",US Senate Panel Allows AGs Choice In Where Their Antitrust Cases Are Heard,"


The US Senate Judiciary Committee approved on Thursday, September 23, legislation that would allow state attorneys general to choose which court hears their antitrust cases, a bill that could affect a pending lawsuit against Google.
The bill was sent to the full Senate by a voice vote, reported Reuters.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who sponsored the measure with Republican Mike Lee, said the measure would prevent state lawsuits from getting caught up in lengthy, multi-district litigation that takes years to resolve.
“This bill would simply strengthen the enforcement of our antitrust laws,” she said.
Senator Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, and others expressed concern about the bill being retroactive, saying that it would affect a case that the Texas attorney general and others filed against Google.
In August, a judicial panel ruled against the attorneys general to move that fight from Texas to the Southern District of New York, where other similar cases were being heard.
The text of the bill says that it would go into effect on June 1, 2021, before the panel ruled.
Texas joined with other states to sue Google in mid-December, accusing the search and advertising company of breaking antitrust law by dominating all steps in the process of placing digital advertising. Publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues. Google has denied wrongdoing.
A companion measure to the Senate bill was one of six that passed the US House Judiciary Committee in June, four of which were aimed specifically at reining in the power of big tech. It has not yet been considered by the full House, however.
Congress is also considering sharp increases in the budgets of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission, both of which enforce antitrust law.

836,"September 20, 2021",Bipartisan Coalition Asks Congress To Modernize Federal Antitrust Laws,"


New York Attorney General Letitia James continued her work fighting for New York’s consumers and small businesses on Monday, September 20, by calling on federal leaders to provide funding to support state antitrust enforcement efforts. Attorney General James co-leads a bipartisan coalition of 45 attorneys general in sending a letter to congressional leaders requesting the federal government to provide the necessary support to states so that antitrust efforts are not hamstrung as state budgets tighten, many now being exacerbated as the COVID-19 public health crisis continues to ravage state and local economies. 
“All too often we’ve seen powerful firms use their clout to stop competition from gaining a foothold, leaving every day New Yorkers and Americans across the nation to suffer,” said Attorney General James. “States investigate and litigate antitrust matters to ensure that consumers benefit from higher quality, increased innovation, and lower costs — all direct results of increased competition in the market. But these initiatives require massive commitments of resources, which is why we are asking the federal government to partner with us and help fund efforts to support state antitrust enforcement.”
State attorneys general around the country — from both parties — are currently leading cutting edge, resource-intensive antitrust cases against powerful and sophisticated Big Tech firms. Attorney General James is leading a bipartisan coalition of 48 attorneys general in a lawsuit against Facebook for anticompetitive conduct, and is simultaneously co-leading another bipartisan coalition of 38 attorneys general in suing Google on antitrust grounds. Additionally, in 2019, Attorney General James led a coalition of attorneys general in filing an antitrust lawsuit to stop the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.
These are just some of the examples of the many types of enforcement actions states have and can bring to challenge anticompetitive conduct by major players with vast resources in a variety of industries. Often working closely with federal partners, states bring these enforcement actions in the public interest to protect consumers and the competitive process.
The coalition noted in their letter to the chairs and ranking members of the respective Senate and House committees, that, as the nation’s economy has grown, so too has the need to staff and finance a greater number of antitrust enforcement actions that are fundamentally more complex and resource-intensive than in the past. There is a growing bipartisan consensus that antitrust is at a turning point, and Congress currently is considering a number of bills that would enable more robust enforcement. Whether antitrust investigations and litigation are pursued together with federal partners or in multi-state coalitions they require massive commitments by lawyers and experts, as well as significant technological resources. Congress is already considering additional funding for the federal agencies, but additional funding for state agencies will enhance the states’ ability to fulfill their obligations as integral partners to the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and as part of Congress’ plan for protecting competition.

Russia on Thursday, September 16, threatened US social media firms with sizable fines if they fail to delete content Moscow deems illegal and demanded Apple and Google stop allegedly meddling in its internal affairs on the eve of parliamentary elections.
Internet services are coming under increasing pressure ahead of Russia’s September 17-19 parliamentary vote. Russia’s authorities have said foreign firms are hampering their efforts to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and online resources linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Now, a long-running dispute over banned content looks set to move up a gear after Vadim Subbotin, deputy head of state communications regulator Roskomnadzor, signalled sizeable fines were possible.
“We will now consider applying turnover fines on those companies that systematically violate Roskomnadzor’s demands,” Interfax news agency cited Subbotin as saying.
While Russia has already levied several small fines on foreign tech companies, imposing penalties based on their turnover suggests potentially much bigger sums.
Subbotin named Facebook, Twitter, and Alphabet’s Google as some of the firms at risk.
Roskomnadzor now has “substantial” tools capable of enforcing the requirements of Russian law, he said, without giving further details.
Roskomnadzor has successfully slowed the speed of Twitter since March, impeded some VPN providers from operating, and last week blocked major domain name system (DNS) services for several hours.

US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff presented data on Wednesday, September 15, on small acquisitions by five big technology companies, and the agency scrapped guidelines on vertical mergers which combine a company with a supplier, reported Reuters.
Following a study begun during the Trump administration, the FTC staff found that Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft together had 616 acquisitions from 2010 to 2019 that were above US$1 million but too small to be reported to antitrust agencies, among other findings.
Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, said looking at deals individually was inadequate. “I think of serial acquisitions as a Pac-Man strategy. Each individual merger viewed independently may not seem to have significant impact. But the collective impact of hundreds of smaller acquisitions, can lead to monopolistic behavior,” she said.
Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, called for a similar study on health care mergers.

The FTC sued Facebook last year, alleging the social media company broke antitrust law. It has asked a judge to undo Facebook’s deals for photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp although both were reviewed by the agency.

839,"September 14, 2021",Sell/Buy Bundling,"
This note examines bundling where a firm sells content or a service and, in the process, buys the customer’s attention or data. For example, Google bundles search with ads. This kind of sell/buy bundle is prevalent in the digital economy. We develop a framework to address the question: When will the firm require customers to take a sell/buy bundle rather than allow them to buy the content without selling their attention? Under our assumptions, if the average customer’s value of content is large relative to the value of the ad and customer attention costs are relatively low, the profit-maximizing strategy for the firm is to price so that all customers take the bundle. We end by considering other reasons for sell/buy bundling that fall outside our economic model.

Newspapers and online platforms provide content to readers, and, in return, readers give their attention to advertisements. Sometimes, as in the case of newspapers, there is a net positive price charged to readers for the two transactions. Other times, as with Facebook or Google, the net price is zero.
The case of customers giving up data is similar. The firm provides content or a service and, in return, the customer provides personal data. In this note, we focus on bundles where the customer is selling their attention, but the results do not depend on the label we attach to what the customer is providing.

Significant attention has recently been paid to Apple’s behavior concerning the iPhone and App Store. In this paper, I employ economic theory concerning tying behavior to better understand the economic forces behind Apple’s behavior, and the extent to which intervention is justified. I identify three plausible motivations for Apple’s behavior – efficiency, price discrimination, and leveraging its market power – and discuss what each suggests concerning whether intervention is justified. The conclusion is that only the leverage argument provides a plausible rationale for intervention. In addition, this argument suggests that the case for intervention is stronger if Apple’ tying behavior concerning the iPhone and App Store significantly negatively affects the supply of apps.

Apple’s behavior concerning the iPhone and the App Store has attracted significant antitrust scrutiny. This includes the recent Apple-Epic case, attention from both U.S. and European antitrust authorities, and scrutiny from the U.S. Congress which is considering updating U.S. antitrust laws. This raises a number of related questions. Is this attention justified? Is Apple violating the antitrust rules in either market? Should Apple be forced to change its behavior concerning the iPhone and the App Store?
In this paper, I shed light on these questions by discussing what the economic theory of tying tells us about Apple’s behavior. As I discuss in t...

841,"September 14, 2021",Tying of “Free Goods” in Digital Platform Markets,"
As dominant platforms offer related services and expand into adjacent markets, there are serious concerns for anticompetitive tying that may serve to extend their market power to other markets. In this article, I review recent theoretical developments in the leverage theory of tying in relation to digital platform markets where goods are often provided for “free.” With zero pricing, the monopolist of the primary good may be unable to appropriate a rival firm’s efficiencies through the pricing of the primary product and therefore have an incentive to resort to tying to foreclose the rival firm and expropriate any rents associated in the tied product market. I also briefly discuss practical issues that may pose challenges in putting theory into practice. In particular, given potential precompetitive and efficiency-enhancing effects of tying, a rule of reason approach that carefully balances pro- vs. anticompetitive effects would be advisable.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) will not shy away from enforcing antitrust laws against so-called “killer acquisitions,” where dominant firms buy start-ups before they can become competitive threats, according to a top Department official, reported CNBC.
Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who oversees the agency’s Antitrust Division, spoke at the Georgetown Law Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium Tuesday, September 14. There, she said acquisitions of nascent competitors “are one category of particularly concerning transactions because they undermine competition that can disrupt monopolies.”
President Biden’s leadership choices have already indicated a tough approach on alleged monopolies and illegal acquisitions. But this speech marks one of the first times Biden’s DOJ has publicly outlined its stance on antitrust enforcement.
Gupta pointed to the department’s case against Visa’s proposed acquisition of payments company Plaid as an example of the government’s work to halt transactions with nascent competitors. The two companies ultimately abandoned the merger after the government sought to block it.
“The department will not shy away from similar challenges in the future,” Gupta said, adding that the department should remain “careful not to discourage investment in new start-ups. But we should also remember that startups cannot thrive without a competitive economy.”
Gupta also called the Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google “a major priority.” In addition, she said she welcomes lawmakers’ efforts to provide new tools to enforcers to go after illegal monopolies and transactions.
“The bottom line is that we will not stand by and watch dominant digital platforms thwart competition,” Gupta said.
“Digital markets may involve new technologies, but the tactics of these digital platforms are nothing new. Buying would-be rivals. Boxing out firms who won’t be bought. Leveraging a monopoly position in one market to grow a position in another. The Department of Justice has dealt with these tactics from the likes of Standard Oil and Microsoft. We will do so again whenever the facts and the law demand action to protect the economy, no matter how powerful the violator.”
Biden nominated tech critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission, and his nominee to lead the Antitrust Division, Jonathan Kanter, was a favorite among progressives seeking greater enforcement of antitrust laws. Kanter still awaits Senate confirmation, but he would report to Gupta if confirmed.

Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Daniel CRANE:
Framework of course could mean a number of different things. If we mean the consumer welfare standard in particular, which is what lots of people mean by framework. To the extent that what antitrust policy is focused on is preventing acts that harm the competitive functioning of the market, then I think that’s actually the right framework. If the question is how has that standard been applied in fact, I think we could do a better job in some areas, particularly in horizontal mergers, which I know we’ll talk about. Then if by framework we’re including institutional arrangements, which is something I’ve long been interested in, then I think we could also do better in a number of ways. I think for example the federal agencies need more funding to do more work. I would prefer to see more public enforcement funded by Congress and less reliance on private enforcement, which I think often does not particularly serve the consumer or the...

Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?
John NEWMAN:
I see two big problems with the current antitrust framework, loosely defined. The first is that it’s not really as intellectually cohesive as the Orthodox position suggests. And you can get at that a couple of different ways but one is to just ask whether it’s actually applied across the board in different types of cases. As an initial point on that, Hemphill, Rose, Melamed, antitrust insiders have starting to question that point and suggest that maybe we apply something more like a trading partner, welfare standard instead of a consumer welfare standard, so what we thought we were applying. The trouble with that then is that nobody’s done any, as far as I know, really rigorous theoretical work around what that trading partner welfare standard would mean in a given case. It seems like sometimes we’re applying in consumer welfare standards, sometimes we’re applying this trading partner ...

Elyse DORSEY:
So I think that’s a really great question to kick things off today. There are so many different values and benefits that are kind of competing for airtime in the popular antitrust discussion today, but at the forefront of the concern with antitrust law in the modern era and as it stands today is really consumers. The Consumer Welfare Standard puts the consumer front and center and it’s really a robust and pretty flexible system that provides this powerful and really concentrated lens through which we can analyze how various conduct or behavior affects consumers. And we’ve seen it, we’ve watched it adapt to changes in how firms compete over time. For example, while price is often a very important component of how firms compete, we see time and time again today that that’s not the only one and it might not even be a very important one in different markets.
What the Consumer Welfare Standard allows us to do though is really, to your question, put the consumer first and sa...

I think a good deal of it works, but not everything. Consumers benefit from high output measured by both quantity and variety and innovation and low prices, and in some areas I think antitrust is quite effective at that, but not in others. I do believe that the rule of reason needs to be modified as it’s applied in the US. It’s been far too pro defendant. It was never intended to be that way. It was intended to permit a prima facie examination and then give the defendant once a prima facie case of competitive harm was met, the defendant should have an opportunity to defend and what the Supreme Court has done instead is loaded all the proof requirements into the initial part of the case. And as a result, the burden of proof never shifts to the defendant. That has made rule of reason cases very, very difficult to prove. Plaintiffs don’t win them very often.
And the result is that the rule of reason has become almost useless ...

Epic was booted from the Apple App Store last August when the North Carolina game maker launched a payment platform to sidestep Apple’s payment system and 30% commission.
“We would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else,” Apple said in a statement, adding that Epic admitted it had breached its contract, so reinstatement is not on the table at the moment.
Apple stated that even if South Korea’s amendment becomes law, Fortnite would still have to comply with the App Store’s review guidelines. Additionally, Apple stated it controls who is allowed into its App Store.
After being ousted from the Apple App Store last year, Epic launched a lawsuit accusing the iPhone maker of running a monopoly by controlling payments. The federal case in California is awaiting a verdict.

850,"September 13, 2021",New Study Says Antitrust Bills Put US Security At Risk,"


Bipartisan antitrust legislation aimed at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google could hurt US competitiveness and give foreign adversaries access to sensitive information, according to a new report from a tech industry group.
According to Bloomberg, the white paper from the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which counts all four companies among its members, argues that a series of antitrust bills approved by the House Judiciary Committee in June would help foreign competitors, including Chinese and Russian companies, by placing severe restrictions solely on US tech giants.
Many of the paper’s arguments echo warnings from technology groups and lawmakers who opposed the measures during a June hearing.
In part because of their size and ability to innovate, US tech companies are valuable partners for the US government and intelligence community to counter global cyber threats, according to Dan Coats, a former Republican senator and director of national intelligence who now works at law firm King & Spalding and helped write the report.
Related: How the House Antitrust Bills Preserve Platforms’ Editorial Discretion and Spur Consumer Choice“A lot of people are talking about the pros and cons of the economic impacts and innovation, which is legitimate, but also take a look at the national security,” Coats said in an interview Friday, September 10. He urged lawmakers to consult with House and Senate intelligence committees and federal agencies before voting on antitrust legislation that he said could have unintended consequences.
The House Judiciary Committee approved a series of six bipartisan antitrust bills, and four of them target Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. It’s not clear when or if those four bills will get a vote on the House floor. Senators on the antitrust subcommittee have said they plan to introduce some similar measures.

851,"September 9, 2021","Netherlands, France & Germany Present Digital Markets Act Amendments","


The Netherlands, France, and Germany have jointly developed amendments to the Digital Markets Act (DMA): the introduction of a tailor-made remediation provision and the reinforcement of the role of national authorities in the enforcement of DMA.
The three countries already took a firm stance on the proposal when it was first announced by the European Commission in December 2020. France was especially concerned with the flexibility and the scope of the DMA, while Germany wanted greater leeway for member states to curb the dominant position of tech giants.
The joint statement calls for national governments to have a greater say in market investigations. While they can request investigations on the designation of gatekeepers under the current proposal, they also want to be included in the process of updating the list of substantial provisions in the regulation.
France, Germany, and the Netherlands also called for more leeway for national laws to tackle gatekeepers. In the current proposal, national governments are explicitly prohibited from taking national legislative steps.

852,"September 8, 2021","FTC Announces Agenda For Next Meeting, Focusing On Big Tech Acquisitions","


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will hold its next open meeting on September 15 to hear staff findings on deals that Big Tech firms like Facebook and Apple make which are sometimes too small to spark antitrust scrutiny, the agency said on Wednesday.
The agency began holding open meetings after Chair Lina Khan was sworn in June. Next week, the five commissioners will also consider whether to scrap guidelines put in place during the Trump administration regarding deals that combine a company with one of its suppliers.
The staff report will include Big Tech acquisitions from 2010 to 2019, some of which were not reported to antitrust enforcers because of their small size.
The Big Tech firms, which also include Alphabet’s Google and Amazon, have been under antitrust scrutiny for more than two years. The FTC has sued Facebook while the Justice Department sued Google. Others remain under investigation.
The agency had sent demands for information to five big tech firms, including Microsoft, in February 2020, stating that it wanted to probe whether any of the smaller deals resulted in harm to competition.
The three Democrats and two Republicans on the Commission will also vote on whether to issue a policy statement on privacy breaches by health apps and a process for accepting input on potential rules.
Business Before the Commission
Proposed Policy Statement on Privacy Breaches by Health Apps and Connected Devices: The Commission will vote on whether to issue a policy statement on the importance of protecting the public from privacy breaches by health apps and other connected devices.
Non-HSR Reported Acquisitions by Select Technology Platforms, 2010-2019: An FTC Study: Staff will present some findings from the Commission’s inquiry into large technology platforms’ unreported acquisitions, including an analysis of the structure of deals that customarily fly under enforcers’ radar. The public release of the report is subject to commission vote.
Proposed Revisions to FTC Procedural Rules Concerning Petitions for Rulemaking: The Commission will vote on putting in place a process to receive public input on rulemaking petitions by external stakeholders.
Proposed Withdrawal of 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines: The Commission will vote on whether to rescind the Vertical Merger Guidelines adopted in June 2020 and the Commentary on Vertical Merger Enforcement issued in December 2020.

Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Eleanor FOX:
First, if you don’t mind, I’d like to reframe the question because it does assume that the antitrust laws are for consumers and even assume that they’re only for consumers. So in terms of whether the antitrust laws work, I’d like to put it into a little larger framework because in my view, the antitrust laws are to make markets work and consumers are a really big, good proxy most of the time and not all of the time. So I would ask myself the question, do I think the antitrust laws work to help the markets work better, to take away the obstructions that keep them from working? And my view is they don’t work very well because they, most of, this is us, in the US they work very well for business, especially big business because they’re very oriented towards the libertarian view of markets.
I think what needs to change is, first of all, moving away from the language of consumer welfare, which to me is it implies short...

Do you think the current antitrust framework works for consumers?

Christopher YOO:
I think the current framework can serve consumers extremely well. The focus on higher quality, lower prices and greater access to goods has really yielded immense benefits and improved the economics,[…] the social welfare that people enjoy immensely.
Importantly, it made sure that antitrust didn’t favor certain competitors. You often see situations where someone complains about a practice and they’re saying, that’s hurting me as a company, but in fact, it led to lower prices for overall consumers or better products. And I understand from the company standpoint why that’s important, but there’s no reason consumers should have to pay to benefit an individual actor. And that’s an important aspect of the current regime.
The other thing is it’s kept most competition law processes from being politicized, which is another great weakness potentially of how antitrust can dis-serve consumers. And I t...

Catherine TUCKER:
What an interesting question. And I must admit that when I’m asked questions like that, my response is that there doesn’t seem to be anything missing in the regulation as it stands. The intent seems very clear. I think all of the debate is not so much about the framework, but just how we should interpret the framework in our new digital age.

Do you believe the vertical merger guidelines need to be changed?
TUCKER:
Again, I don’t want to go as far as to say we need to change them. But what strikes me, and this is because I’m an economist, is that we have vertical merger guidelines which were set up in an era of manufacturing, where we are interested in inputs into physical production.

State attorneys general (“State AGs”) continue to play a significant role in enforcing antitrust laws to promote competition and protect consumers. This takes the form of both collaboration between states in multistate enforcement actions and increasing enforcement within state borders. We predict that recent developments at the federal level will also lead to increased co-enforcement and parallel activity between state AGs and their federal counterparts. This article analyzes recent trends in state AG antitrust enforcement and provides insight as to what we can expect to see from state AGs going forward in this space.

I. INTRODUCTION
State Attorneys General (“State AGs”) continue to play a significant role in antitrust enforcement through collaboration with other states in multistate enforcement activities and increasing enforcement within their state borders. With the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) seeking to collaborate more with State AGs after losing its authority to seek restitution resulting from a recent loss at the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Biden Administration’s recent executive action making antitrust enforcement a top priority, there is a marked shift in focus in State AG co-enforcement activity with their federal counterparts.

858,"August 30, 2021","Competition for Thee, but Not for Antitrust!","
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and other Republican senators have proposed consolidating federal antitrust enforcement under the Department of Justice. While the stated justification for the proposal is enforcement efficiency, the more likely goal is to foreclose competition to the consumer welfare standard in federal antitrust policymaking. The recent appointment of Lina Khan to the FTC Chair position and President Biden’s July 9th Executive Order on Competition indicate that Neo-Brandeisian (“NB”) antitrust ideas are emerging as a competitive threat to the consumer welfare perspective, and Senator Lee’s proposals appear targeted at ending the threat before it gains a foothold in the antitrust marketplace of ideas. Because the current competition between consumer welfare and NB antitrust is beneficial to antitrust policy and American markets, Congress should reject these proposals.

By Max M. Miller1

Antitrust policy is entering a renaissance of new (and old) ideas that encourage more aggressive enforcement and shifts in legal standards that would remove obstacles for successful enforcement actions. The field is benefitting from robust debates and diverse perspectives, which are gaining audiences with practitioners, government enforcers, Congress, the courts, and most recently, the President of the United States. But not everyone is supportive of the debate and the prospect of reform. Recently, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), reintroduced his “One Agency Act” in the Sen...

This article will explore why big doesn’t always equal bad, comparing companies that have excelled and risen to the top of their markets with one of the greatest American Olympian of all time – Jesse Owens. Competition, whether in the Olympics or law, produces excellence. Next, the article will explain where it goes wrong – when someone tries to rig the game rather than compete on the merits – using another example, Tonya Harding.

Thank you, Mr. Peterson, for taking this time to talk to CPI.

1. Antitrust enforcement involves, by necessity, coordination between federal and State agencies. What, in your view, should be the approach to interagency cooperation in a contemporary context? How can States and Federal agencies better coordinate in the 21st Century?
Coordination between federal and state agencies is critical to ensure that we efficiently deploy our limited resources. Traditionally, there was an approach, particularly in smaller states, in which states followed the lead of our federal counterparts. There was very little appetite to independently investigate and litigate large antitrust cases — with a few notable exceptions, like Microsoft. That trend has been changing with recent actions against some large technology companies.
There is no single, ideal model of interagency cooperation. State enforcers, much like our federal counterparts, have a limited set of resources to tackle competition issues. As a result, our model for cooperation will depend upon how specific investigations or cases relate to state priorities.
Interagency cooperation can be broadly captured in two categories. There is the historical model of cooperation in which state enforcers join investigations and cases managed by federal enforcers. In this model, state enfor...

1. Antitrust enforcement involves, by necessity, coordination between federal and State agencies. What, in your view, should be the approach to interagency cooperation in a contemporary context? How can States and Federal agencies better coordinate in the 21st Century?
We have always worked collaboratively with our federal counterparts and continue to do so today. We often work, together, on many important cases, and frequently reach the same conclusions, as we did in our Facebook and Google investigations. But each state and each federal agency has independent enforcement authority and responsibilities. When we reach different conclusions on an antitrust matter, we may decide to exercise our independent authority by filing a lawsuit, coming to an agreement with a party, or taking another action.
One recent example is the T-Mobile/Sprint merger — a merger of two of the four mobile network operators in the United States. New York led a coalition of states investigating the merger, while the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) conducted its own investigation. Both the States and the DOJ determined that the merger, as originally proposed, would be anticompetitive and illegal. While a small number of fixes satisfied the DOJ, we were not persuaded, and sued to block the merger. Stil...

865,"August 25, 2021","The Relevant Antitrust Market in Digital Environments: Brazil, the EU, and the U.S.","

By Magali Eben* & Viktoria H.S.E. Robertson**
 I. Introduction
Digital markets, be it social media, online search or e-commerce, are becoming increasingly global. Although some regional and local players exist as well, it is striking how competition authorities around the globe are being confronted with similar or even identical antitrust questions concerning the same digital platforms – frequently the GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft). As one of the first steps in virtually every antitrust investigation, the delineation of a relevant antitrust market is particularly crucial, and this is also true in digital markets. In a recent working paper we discuss the application of market definition to digital markets from a comparative perspective, spanning Brazil, the European Union, and the United States.
 
II. Market Definition as the Basis of Competition Law: A Short Primer
Market definition is a core concept of competition law in Brazil, the European Union, and the United States. In all three jurisdictions, the main parameters of market definition are strikingly similar and market definition is understood to have both a quantitative and a qualitative side to it. In particular, antitrust authorities in all three jurisdictions have issued soft law guidance on delineating a relevant antitrust market – testament to the ongoing convergence on this important aspect of competition law.
Brazil
Market definition is a central feature of Brazilian competition law that is explicitly referenced in Article 36 of the Competition Act. That provision prohibits anti-competitive agreements and anti-competitive single firm conduct. As one possible infringement, the provision lists the control of a relevant product market. In addition, Article 36(3) of the Act defines what constitutes a dominant position, which is determined as a 20% share of the relevant market or more. Regular references to the relevant market concept under Brazilian law may partly be due to the fact that the current Competition Act dates from 2011 and is thus relatively young. Brazilian antitrust authority CADE (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica or Administrative Council for Economic Defense) has issued a number of soft law instruments that are directly relevant to market definition, such as its 1999 Resolution or its Horizontal Merger Guidelines of 2016. These Guidelines acknowledge alternative options for analyzing mergers that do not exclusively focus on market definition – for instance where multi-sided markets are concerned.
European Union
Under EU competition law, market definition is relied upon under Article 101 TFEU (anti-competitive agreements), Article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position), and merger control (Regulation 139/2004). In addition, the binding block exemption regulations issued by the European Commission (e.g., Vertical BER, R&D BER) and many soft law instruments (e.g., De Minimis Notice, Effect on Trade Notice) rely on market share thresholds that require the prior delineation of a relevant market. In its Market Definition Notice, the European Commission sets out how it intends to delineate a relevant antitrust market in its product and geographic dimensions. The delineation exercise is based on demand-side and supply-side interchangeability, something that also has the backing of the General Court and the Court of Justice. The Market Definition Notice operationalizes this interchangeability test through the SSNIP test (small but significant non-transitory increase in prices). The Commission is currently reviewing its Market Definition Notice against the background of digital markets, as it strives to better depict these for antitrust purposes.
United States
U.S. antitrust law relies on market definition under § 1 of the Sherman Act (anti-competitive agreements), § 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization and attempted monopolization) and § 7 of the Clayton Act (merger control). The relevant product market includes all products that are functionally interchangeable with each other, based on demand-side and supply-side substitutability. In their joint Horizontal Merger Guidelines of 2010, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission set out the hypothetical monopolist test that is nearly identical to the SSNIP test. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines attempt to de-emphasize the importance of market definition for merger control, stating that a merger review need not start with market definition. So far, however, the U.S. courts have not followed this view.
 
III. Market Definition for Digital Markets: The Decisional Practice of Brazil, the EU, and U.S.
Zero-price Services
Many digital services are offered for “free,” at least in the sense that users don’t have to hand over any money. Facebook doesn’t ask you for your bank details before you can see what your uncle has had for dinner, Google doesn’t require you to swipe your credit card in order to search for a restaurant for your date tonight, and Twitter doesn’t ask you to do a bank transfer every time you want to share a 280-character brilliant idea. These companies are not charities, but often generate revenue through multi-sided strategies: the users of the social network or the search engine may not be handing over cash, but they are paying attention to advertising or generating information for data-analytical products. The lack of a monetary exchange between users of these services and the undertakings offering them initially had far-reaching consequences for market definition. “Free” was a concept with an almost magical effect: it not only induced consumers to increased appreciation of a product (the so-called “zero-price effect”), but prompted competition authorities to believe that the undertakings could not be subjected to the provisions of competition law. The lack of price for certain (digital) services baffled authorities and courts, who initially showed a reluctance to intervene in the activities of the undertakings who supplied them, struggling to identify the “trade” relationship between the company and the users of its free service. A U.S. district court even went so far as to declare there was no market for search (Kinderstart v. Google). Luckily, this approach did not last. Competition authorities in all three jurisdictions now acknowledge that these companies do engage in economic activities – thus requiring the definition of a market. Such acknowledgement is evident from statements in both the European Commission and CADE’s Google decisions (Google Search (Shopping), Google Android, E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil).
Acknowledging the possibility of a market was evidently an important step, but there is still an important practical challenge to overcome: how to perform substitution analysis in the absence of monetary price. In all three jurisdictions, there have been attempts to adapt the SSNIP test. A U.S. court raised the possibility of imagining a price by considering whether consumers would switch if even “the most nominal of fees were charged” (Streamcast), but this is inappropriate since going from no price to any price at all would fundamentally change the way the consumer sees the product. Instead, real costs and consideration ought to be integrated in a revised quantitative test, such as the attention or data costs incurred by the users, or even the costs the other side incurs in the case of a two-sided platform (a possibility raised by FTC Staff in the U.S. (In the Matter of Google Inc.). The decisional practice on this remains sparse. Instead, quantitative tests are considered which focus on quality rather than price or costs, which is an option both the European Commission and CADE seem increasingly willing to explore. Quality-based substitution assessments have been mentioned in multiple cases (Facebook/WhatsApp, Microsoft/LinkedIn, Google Search (Shopping), E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil). The European Commission explicitly referred to a SSNDQ test (small but significant non-transitory decrease in quality) in Google Android, although there is still some lack of clarity on the correct parameters for such tests. The smaller number of investigations in the U.S. to date mean the willingness of U.S. antitrust authorities to adopt revised quantitative tests is not yet clear.
Where reimagined “SSNIP” tests are unavailable, authorities are likely to return to the more traditional qualitative approach. In the Google cases (Google Search (Shopping), E-Commerce Media Group Informação e Tecnologia Ltda/Google Brasil), the European Commission and CADE both considered the characteristics and functionalities of the services in their substitution analysis. The differentiation in the services involved may make it difficult to identify the most pertinent characteristics and functionalities, however, so that there is some contention on where to draw the line between different products and their substitutes. On the whole, it is clear that headway is being made. As more cases are brought in the EU, Brazil, and now the U.S., the variety of quantitative and qualitative tests which now exist will likely be further developed and perfected.
Multi-sided Platforms
The challenge of zero-price services often arises in the context of multi-sided platforms. A multi-sided platform caters to distinct groups of customers, who are brought together on the platform in a way which internalizes the indirect network effects between them. The number of markets to define when a platform has more than one side is probably the most common question in digital market definition. The existence of two or more distinct customer groups raises the query whether the platform operates on multiple markets (one for each “side”) or on a single platform market, and in any case whether and how to incorporate the relationship between the different groups. Considerable strides have been made in decisional practice, taking steps towards but not quite achieving a definite approach to market definition for digital, multi-sided, platforms.
The literature made a distinction between “transaction” and “non-transaction” platforms, which has inspired the decisional practice on multi-sided platforms both inside and outside digital markets. In transaction platforms, there is an observable transaction, a one-to-one interaction, between different sides of the platform. This is not present on a non-transaction platform, where interaction does not occur as a one-to-one transaction. Most of the decisions involving multi-sided market definition have concerned not digital services but payment cards, which are generally considered to be “transaction” platforms. The American Express judgment in the U.S. has by now become rather famous in antitrust circles, for the relatively simple but contentious answer given to market definition. This Supreme Court judgment came after a string of discussions on market definition in the lower courts. While the District Court had defined multiple but related levels (issuance, acquirer services, and the network level), the Second Circuit had contended that both sides (issuance for cardholders and acquiring for merchants) needed to be “collapsed” into a single market. The Supreme Court agreed with the Second Circuit, emphasizing the existence of a transaction product jointly consumed by both sides. Though this single-market-approach did not attract unanimous consensus, it fitted neatly into the transaction/non-transaction distinction whose simplicity renders it so appealing.
This decisional practice may inspire market definition for digital platforms, but only to the extent that digital services fit neatly in the transaction/non-transaction distinction. Moreover, the distinction may overlook the more nuanced approach which is present in the EU, and in Brazil in particular. The EU and Brazil have had their fair share of payment card cases, long before American Express. These decisions are characterized by more complexity, both in the business models under investigation and in the markets defined. Although the idea of a “joint” transaction product was not dismissed out-of-hand by the European Commission, the Commission was not convinced of its existence on the facts (MasterCard). The EU approach can be summarized as a recognition of the relevance of multi-sidedness to the economic analysis, and a willingness to define both markets for the whole platform as well as multiple one-sided markets where this is useful for the analysis (Cartes bancaires, Budapest Bank). Such a multi-layered approach also exists in Brazil, where CADE’s practice is noteworthy for its definition, in the same case, of both markets for a distinct side and a single market for the whole payment system, focusing its analysis on the relevant market most suited to its assessment (Visa-Visanet, Itaú/Credicard, Elo).
There have been cases specific to digital services in all three jurisdictions, with actual decisions being rendered in the EU and Brazil. The FTC investigated Google, but decided to close the investigation. Although there was no ultimate decision, the Staff and Economist Memoranda did give some insight into the market definition contemplated, namely the definition of three distinct but “interdependent” markets corresponding to the different sides of the Google search platform. A multiple markets-approach was also adopted by the EU in cases involving Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google (Facebook/WhatsApp, Microsoft/LinkedIn, Google Search (Shopping)). The rationale for defining distinct markets for each side was never fully set out, though the Google Search (Shopping) decision did describe the existence of the distinct sides on one platform an advantageous “strategy” by the company, which could be interpreted as an acknowledgement that the multi-sidedness is a commercial choice rather than that there is a joint product for which the participation of both sides is indispensable. In Brazil, CADE’s own Google investigation included reflections by Commissioners and the Department for Economic Studies on the transaction/non-transaction distinction. They seemed to more plainly consider the non-essential nature of the presence of both sides, and thus there was no joint product. Yet even in this case there was no definite statement that several markets had to be defined because Google’s search platform was a non-transaction market, let alone an overarching determination that the transaction/non-transaction distinction is conclusive in multi-sided market definitions. To truly come up with a framework for multi-sided market definition in digital markets, we will likely have to wait for more cases, preferably some involving a digital transaction platform, so that a comparison is possible between the decisional approach to digital non-transaction and digital transaction platforms.
Digital Ecosystems
Digital ecosystems, as the overarching building blocks of multi-sided digital platforms, are increasingly becoming a market force to reckon with and are also increasingly being looked at from the perspective of competition law and competition economics. They typically consist of an ecosystem orchestrator that brings together multiple actors and multiple products while maintaining maximum interoperability within the ecosystem. While the experience antitrust enforcers have gathered when taking zero-price services and multi-sided markets into account will be helpful in developing a useful approach to digital ecosystems, these types of commercial structures may also benefit from insights into cluster markets and aftermarkets.
As the European Commission’s Special Advisers’ Report on “Competition policy for the digital era” observed, companies are “draw[ing] consumers into more or less comprehensive ecosystems” which may need to be analyzed separately and/or alongside markets for specific products. Indeed, many digital platforms attract consumers because they offer multiple products in the same place: the convenience of a smartphone, a mobile operating system, a search app, an email service, a browser, a streaming service and a cloud service all in one place. The products that can be found in a digital ecosystem – such as online search, a mobile smart operating system, an app store, a photo storage software, a phone book, a browser, a messaging service, a document storage service, etc. – may often be complementary, but sometimes it is only the underlying technology or business model that links these digital services. Also, while the examples above relate to the software dimension of digital ecosystems, a digital ecosystem usually encompasses both hardware and software.
When defining cluster markets – such as in banking or in supermarkets – antitrust courts and authorities grouped together products that customers would usually expect from the same provider, even though the products themselves were not interchangeable (and not all clusters were made up of exactly the same products). In the U.S., cases included Philadelphia National Bank (commercial banking) or Grinnell (alarm systems); in the EU, they included Lombard Club and Carrefour; in Brazil, they included Banco Santander and Banco Nossa Caixa. Importantly, the cluster’s economic significance goes beyond the individual products or services that it groups together (United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust) – just like in digital ecosystems. However, digital ecosystems appear to go even beyond what the cluster market concept attempted to capture, through the focus on interoperability within the ecosystem and the capturing of customers that occurs thanks to this.
For digital ecosystems, it can be helpful to think of multiple layers of competition: at the ecosystem level, at the platform level, and on individual market sides. To understand these layers, market definition for aftermarkets can be a useful analogy: The question then centres on whether or not there is competition at the superior market level (for instance, see Eastman Kodak in the U.S. or EFIM in the EU). If one finds that there is no competition at the superior level, then customers at the inferior level may experience capture and lock-in despite the (seeming) possibility of competition – and thus the appearance of a broader market.
While the case law has already started to explore an appropriate methodology for taking zero-price services into account and for delineating multi-sided platforms, this area will require further antitrust attention in the near future – and can benefit from a cross-jurisdictional analysis of evolving issues.
 
IV. Conclusions
While market definition will remain a central tool for competition law, it can – and must – be adapted to the specific characteristics present in digital markets, as cases before antitrust authorities and courts in all three jurisdictions have already shown. Nevertheless, there still is considerable scope for more convergence on these questions. As these issues frequently are of a global nature, a global response in the shape of a more harmonized approach to market definition in digital markets is desirable. In this endeavor, it is crucial to embark on joint enforcement actions (wherever possible) and collaborative research in order to carve out possibilities for such convergence.

I. Introduction
This piece builds on our previous article2 covering the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (“ACCC”) examination of developments in digital platforms through its ongoing Digital Platforms Services Inquiry 2020-2025 (“DPSI”).3 The DPSI follows the ACCC’s original Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report (“DPI Final Report”), released in July 2019.4 Under the terms of reference for the DPSI, the ACCC must provide the Treasurer with an interim report on the inquiry every six months until the inquiry concludes. A final report will be provided to the Treasurer by 31 March 2025.5 The services which the ACCC may hold inquiries in relation to include digital platform services, as well as digital advertising services and data services provided by digital platform service providers.6 The terms of reference define digital platform services as search engines, social media, online private messaging services, digital content aggregation platforms, media referral services, and electronic marketplaces.7
Our previous work considered the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its second DPSI interim report covering app stores (“App Stores Issues Paper”),8 relevant international antitrust cases, and the public submissions received in response to the App Store Issues Paper.
This article summarizes the key findings ultimately released by the ACCC in its second DPSI interim report on app stores (“App Stores Report”). It also considers the main concerns identified in the ACCC’s issues paper for its third DPSI interim report covering choice screens in search services and default browsers (“Choice Screen Issues Paper”)9 and the public submissions received so far in response to this issues paper.
The ACCC has also released the issues paper for its fourth DPSI interim report (to be released in 2022).10 As part of this issues paper the ACCC will examine competition and consumer law issues in online marketplaces that operate across product categories (e.g. eBay, Amazon, Catch, etc.).11 Competition issues the ACCC will investigate as part of this report include: what the most significant online marketplaces in Australia are, whether any of them are “must-haves” for third-party sellers, barriers to entry and expansion for online marketplaces, the extent that online marketplaces compete with third-party sellers supplying direct, and third-party seller multi-homing across marketplaces.12
The focus of the ACCC’s App Stores Report (released April 28, 2021) was on the distribution of mobile apps to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. The ACCC focused on the two key distribution channels for such apps (i.e. “app stores”) in Australia: Apple’s “App Store” for mobile devices running Apple’s operating system, “iOS”; and, Google’s “Play Store” for mobile devices running Google’s operating system, “Android.”
The ACCC’s decision to focus on these app stores for its second DPSI report is no doubt related to the growing international attention they have received, particularly as a result of proceedings brought by Epic Games against Apple and Google in the United States13 and the European Commission’s investigation of complaints against Apple from a number of complainants, including Spotify, an unidentified e-book distributor, and an unidentified audiobook distributor.14
The concerns expressed by app developers like Epic Games and Spotify in these disputes and regulatory investigations, and those expressed by app developers in submissions responding to the ACCC’s App Store Issues Paper relate to a variety of issues. A key concern is Apple and Google’s requirements that apps offering “digital goods and services” use only Apple or Google’s respective in-app purchase (“IAP”) systems and pay a 30 percent commission on every transaction. This article will focus on this concern.
 A. The ACCC’s Findings 
The ACCC made a number of important findings which appeared broadly consistent with concerns expressed by stakeholders.
   
Competition Assessment and Market Power
While the ACCC did not formally define the markets in which the App Store and Play Store participate, it concluded that Apple and Google each have “significant market power” in the supply of mobile operating systems and mobile app distribution in Australia.15 Interestingly, the ACCC did not use the phrase “substantial market power” in its findings, which is a threshold requirement for establishing whether a company has contravened Australia’s prohibition on misuses of market power.16 It is unclear why the ACCC avoided engaging the language of the statutory prohibition in its findings here, though it may be that the ACCC is exercising caution and not revealing its hand too soon.
The ACCC also considered that the two app stores were “effectively isolated” from competition.17 While the App Store and Play Store place some constraint on each other, the ACCC found that this constraint is limited, for example, by high user switching costs, the tendency of users to single-home, and because both app stores are “must haves” for app developers.18 The ACCC also recognized that there were no alternatives to the App Store for iOS devices and it did not consider alternative Android app stores as significant constraints on the Play Store (particularly given the Play Store’s pre-installation on Android devices).19
   
Terms and Conditions of Access to the App Stores
The ACCC found that Apple and Google were “gatekeepers” for their respective app stores, and as such they have the power to set, amend and enforce their app store terms and conditions on a “take it or leave it” basis.20 The ACCC considered that while some of these terms seek to promote and maintain the quality and safety of apps, there are also issues with their implementation.21 In particular, the ACCC noted that businesses whose products or services are not clearly defined within the terms set by digital platforms face risks and uncertainties which may lead to inefficient investment decisions and unduly restrict or prevent the emergence of alternative business models.22
The ACCC noted that the need to protect users and the stability, performance and integrity of Apple and Google’s respective operating systems did not negate the need for fair and reasonable terms and timely processes.23 It referred to broad concerns expressed by app developers that challenging an app review process (whereby Apple or Google approve new apps or app updates for distribution on their app stores) was like “navigating a black box,” and to the desire of app developers for transparent dispute resolution mechanisms.24
  
Mandatory IAP Requirements and 30 Percent Commissions
In announcing the release of the App Stores Report, ACCC Chair Rod Sims said “the ACCC is also concerned with restrictions imposed by Apple and Google which mean developers have no choice but to use Apple and Google’s own payment systems for any in-app purchases.”25 The requirement for apps to use Apple and Google’s mandatory IAP systems depends on whether the app is deemed to offer “digital goods and services” by Apple and Google. In this respect, the ACCC highlighted the “discretion exercised by both Apple and Google in how their terms and conditions are modified and applied.”26 This creates risk and uncertainty for businesses whose products or services are not clearly within the definitions set by Apple and Google.
The ACCC indicated that there were divergent views on the appropriateness of the level of the 30 percent commission charged by Apple and Google.27 However the ACCC ultimately concluded that “… it is highly likely that the commission rates are inflated by the market power that Apple and Google have…”28 The ACCC recognized that, irrespective of whether IAP fees were inflated, mandatory IAP requirements may impact downstream competition between apps that are subject to the requirement and apps that are not, including raising “… costs for their [Apple and Google’s] rivals.”29 However, the ACCC said that it was difficult to determine how inflated these commissions were, including because charges for the use of a mobile ecosystem are not directly cost-based and costs may be common to the range of ecosystem-wide services supplied (e.g. cost of developing and maintaining the mobile operating system).30
The ACCC did not ultimately recommend that Apple or Google be precluded from imposing the mandatory use of their IAP systems at this stage. It found that the benefits and risks of such action (e.g. the impact of Apple/Google imposing alternative fee structures in response) required further analysis and industry consultation.31 It did note, however, that removing mandatory IAP requirements would “allow app developers to offer consumers alternative methods to pay for goods and services, including potentially cheaper prices.”32
  
Search, Discovery, and Display of Apps
The ACCC found a number of instances where the systems for prioritization of apps in search and discovery rankings were unclear. In particular, the ACCC said that Apple and Google’s app stores appear to prioritize apps which offer in-app payments, presumably because Apple and Google gain commissions from the use of those apps.33 The ACCC also referred to studies by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times to suggest that Apple’s App Store search algorithm may have systematically ranked Apple’s own apps more favorably than competitors’.34 Finally, the ACCC found that users were unable to leave written reviews or rate first-party Apple apps on the App Store,35 which likely impacts these apps’ rankings in app store search results.
In relation to the display of apps, the ACCC noted that pre-installed apps tend to be placed in highly visible locations on iOS and Android device displays and may also be set as default apps. It said this can heighten barriers to entry and expansion in downstream app markets.36
  
Data
Finally, the ACCC expressed concerns that Apple and Google have the ability and incentive to use information gathered from apps to gain a competitive insight into rival apps’ businesses, in order to assist their own strategic or commercial decisions regarding app development.37
 B. The ACCC’s Recommendations
The ACCC did not at this stage propose any Government or regulatory intervention as it did with respect to the Media Bargaining Code of Conduct in the DPI Final Report.
Instead, the ACCC proposed six “potential measures” that could be implemented by Apple and Google in response to the concerns identified in the App Stores Report. The ACCC said that “regulation may be required” if Apple and Google fail to implement these potential measures.38 The ACCC also said that it would revisit app store-related concerns during the course of the five-year DPSI and would take into account steps taken by Apple and Google to address them.39
The potential measures for Apple and Google include:

Allowing developers to provide users with information about alternative payment options off-app to address inadequate payment option information and limitations on developers.40
Providing greater transparency about key algorithms and processes determining discoverability to enable app developers to adapt in a timely way – this will increase transparency and address the risk of self-preferencing in app discoverability and display.41
Providing consumers with an option to rate and write reviews on all apps, including first-party apps – this will enable third party apps to compete on their merits with first-party apps.42
Providing consumers with the ability to choose default apps and to change pre-installed apps that are not a core feature – this will “… promote more robust competition in downstream markets for apps.”43 The ACCC will also be exploring this issue with respect to default search engines and browsers through its next DPSI report (see Section III below).
Information collected by Apple and Google through their position as app store operators being ring-fenced from their other operations and decisions to minimize the risk the information being used to gain an unfair competitive advantage.44

The ACCC appears at this stage to be taking a “wait and see” approach to the issues it identified in the App Stores Report. Unlike the DPI Final Report, the ACCC has not yet proposed direct regulatory intervention in relation to app stores. The ACCC commented that it is “considering the broader issues that arise when digital platforms occupy critical gatekeeper roles and at the same time compete with those businesses that rely on access…”45 Further, the ACCC noted that it is considering international regulatory developments, including “[t]he UK and EC draft proposals, as well as the reports which lead to these proposals, highlight the similarity of the issues across a range of gatekeeper platforms and services, including app marketplaces. The ACCC will continue to explore the issues highlighted here in relation to app marketplaces as well as in other digital platform markets through the course of the DPSI.”46
  
II. The Forthcoming Third DPSI Report Regarding Choice Screens (due September 30, 2021)47
The focus of the ACCC’s forthcoming third interim DPSI report is on the supply of web browsers and general search services to users (“Browser and Search Report”). The Browser and Search Report will also focus on the effectiveness of choice screens in facilitating competition and increasing consumer choice. A choice screen is effectively a pop-up display which enables users of a device to select a default web browser or search service from some, or all available providers on the market.
The ACCC’s decision to focus on choice screens for web browser and search services for its third DPSI report relates to its recommendation in the original DPI Final Report that:48
Google should provide Australian users of Android devices with the same options being rolled out to existing Android users in Europe; that is, the ability to choose their default search engine and default internet browser from a number of options. If Google does not introduce similar options for Australian Android users by six months from the date of the Report, the ACCC will submit to the Government that it should consider compelling Google to offer this choice.
In its December 2019 response to the DPI Final Report, the Australian Government asked the ACCC to monitor the rollout of the default internet browser and search services choice screen in Europe and report back in 2021.49 Around two years have passed since the ACCC made its recommendation and Google has not yet introduced a similar choice screen option for its Australian users.
 A. The Issues Paper
To inform the Browser and Search Report, the ACCC released the “Choice Screen Issues Paper” seeking feedback from interested stakeholders to understand several key issues, including:

how pre-installation or default settings can impact competition and consumer choice in the supply of web browsers and search services;50
the effectiveness of the rollout of choice screens in Europe;51 and
whether there was another form of intervention that may be implemented together with, or instead of choice screens that may facilitate competition and improve consumer choice. Examples include: restrictions on search services acquiring default positions, a requirement for Google to share click and query data with third-party search services, and mandating that Google and Bing provide syndicated search results on fair and reasonable terms.52

The ACCC’s focus for this report is on desktop and mobile devices as these remain the primary way consumers access web browsers and search services.
A key aspect of the ACCC’s Choice Screen Issues Paper is requesting information on the position of international competition regulators.53 The ACCC is focusing on the European Commission’s Google Android decision in 2018 which resulted in Google committing to the rollout of a choice screen.54 This rollout has gone through various stages:

The initial choice screen announced by Google was to be included on all existing and new Android devices and provide users with a choice of five browsers and five search services.55
During the rollout, Google announced the choice screen would only be implemented on new Android devices, display four search services and no browsers. Additionally, search services would have to bid in an action for a place on the choice screen and pay a price to Google each time a user selects them from the choice screen.
Google has recently announced it will expand the choice screen to include more search services and make participation free for eligible providers.56

 B. The Submissions in Response 
The ACCC received a number of submissions in response to the Choice Screen Issues Paper.57 These are summarized according to key themes below.
  
Network Effects
A major theme of submissions is the role of scale in driving network effects in search services and web browsers, and how a choice screen may address those impacts.
Microsoft and Mozilla both argue that scale plays a large role in driving network effects across search services and web browsers, which may be further amplified by customer inertia or default settings.58 In particular, they argue that scale drives network effects in the following ways:

Search services: users are attracted to general search services with more users as the algorithms learn faster and generally provide better quality results. The scale of consumers then attracts advertisers as they generally receive a better return on their campaign investments as the algorithms are better at ad matching. The presence of advertisers then incentivizes browsers to set default general search services that monetize the best and share advertising revenue.59
Web browsers: developers are more likely to spend time and money developing websites that are compatible with the underlying code of a dominant web browser as it has the most user traffic. In turn, users are attracted to web browsers with the most compatible websites as they are less likely to break, load faster, and are more secure.60

However, Google submitted that the implementation of choice screens or any other regulatory measure is unnecessary as the popularity of its search engine and browser does not reflect a market failure, but rather the superior quality of its offering which makes it the preferred search service for most consumers.61
  
Choice Screen Efficacy
Google submitted that the European Commission’s decision on Google Android does not support the need for a choice screen in Australia. Google argued that a key element of the European Commission’s decision was that Android and iOS do not compete. This, it argues, contradicts previous statements made by the ACCC that Android does face competition from iOS in Australia. While the ACCC acknowledged a level of competition between Apple and Google to attract consumers to their respective mobile ecosystems, the ACCC also acknowledged that measures may be required to increase competition within their respective mobile ecosystems.62
In contrast, the majority of non-Google submissions agreed that choice screens can be a beneficial tool to facilitate competition.63 However, these submissions also considered that choice screens are unlikely to be effective on their own because the Australian markets for both search services and web browsers have arguably already reached their tipping point due to the network effects outlined above (see by comparison the Russian case study below).64
  
Russian Case Study on Scale and Choice Screen Efficacy
In the Choice Screens Issues Paper, the ACCC reiterated its conclusion in the DPI Final Report that offering a choice screen may address customer inertia and the effect of default settings as a barrier to expansion for search engine suppliers and internet browsers.65 To support this conclusion, the ACCC noted that Google had previously introduced a choice screen in Russia following a decision by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service that Google restricted competition through mandatory pre-installation and preferential placement on device home screens.66
A number of the submissions to the ACCC’s Choice Screen Issues Paper referenced the effective implementation of this choice screen in Russia.67 One submission pointed to a report by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority which evidenced the consistent growth in Russian search engine Yandex’s market share since the implementation of a choice screen, surpassing Google in January 2019.68 However, Microsoft noted that at the time the choice screen was implemented in Russia, Yandex had over 30 percent market share. This meant it was arguably not too far behind Google in scale, and had sufficient brand recognition among users, which made the choice screen approach more effective than it might be in other contexts where the market has already reached its tipping point.
  
Additional Design Features of Choice Screens
DuckDuckGo’s submission, while broadly supportive of the ACCC’s proposal to implement a choice screen, went further by proposing its own design.69 DuckDuckGo’s choice screen design increases the number of search services displayed on the choice screen and includes a short promotional pitch from the search service.70 DuckDuckGo used its choice screen design to research consumer switching and found 24 percent of consumers selected a Google alternative when presented with more options (compared to 3 percent of consumers that switched to a Google alternative under the current design).71 Ecosia supported DuckDuckGo’s design in its submission72 and stated that it considers DuckDuckGo’s design proposal to have been widely endorsed by alternative search providers and academics.73
Microsoft also included a number of features that it considers critical to making a choice screen effective. These include, among other things, presenting the choice screen on all new and existing devices, listing competitors in an objectively randomized order, and removing the option for users to dismiss the screen.74
  
Additional Regulatory Actions Beyond Choice Screens
A number of submissions put forward proposals for what further regulatory tools or actions they felt were required to facilitate competition between browsers and search engines. These include providing consumers with accessible information about their choices and offering them greater control over the selection of alternative browsers and search engines,75 introducing data portability and interoperability standards that promote web compatibility and address information asymmetries in data driven markets,76 and considering further intervention if a breach of Australian competition law is found, such as self-preferencing.77
 C. What to expect from the ACCC
It remains to be seen what the ACCC’s response will be to the views canvassed in response to its Choice Screen Issues Paper and the concerns raised by alternative web browser and search engine providers. While the ACCC has not yet proposed any direct government or ACCC intervention in relation to app stores, it may be more likely to do so in its forthcoming Browser and Search Report given it already recommended in 2019 that Google implement choice screens in Australia. However, we have likely also not seen the final word on app stores and the ACCC may be considering broader digital regulatory reform.

In a new suit in NY, 1-800 Contacts is accusing eyewear upstart Warby Parker of infringing trademarks by buying search engine keywords like “1-800 Contacts.”
According to the complaint that it filed in a New York federal court on Wednesday, August 18, 1-800 Contacts asserts that Warby Parker is engaging in “continuing trademark infringement, unfair competition, and deceptive advertising practices” in an effort to attract consumers given its status as a “new entrant in the online contact lens marketplace.” 
In the newly-filed complaint, 1-800 Contacts alleges that in light of its “relatively low consumer recognition for contacts,” and “instead of independently developing its own brand awareness related to the online sales of contacts,” direct-to-consumer pioneer Warby Parker “has devised a plan to confuse and mislead consumers who seek to go to 1-800 Contacts’ online store.” Primarily a retailer of eyeglasses, Warby Parker is “trad[ing] off 1-800 Contacts’ brand name and reputation through unauthorized bidding on 1-800 Contacts’ trademarks as search engine keywords that generate Warby Parker advertisements,” 1-800 Contacts claims. 
1-800 Contacts alleges that Warby Parker “bids on 1-800 Contacts’ distinctive trademarks to make search engine keyword purchases with Google and other search engines, [and] by doing so, arranges to place its own ads at or near the top of the Google search results page that appears after a consumer searches for 1-800 Contacts or one of its trademarks.” 
The real kicker for 1-800 Contacts, however, is what comes next: Once consumers are presented with Warby Parker ads that “appear to be from 1-800 Contacts or an approved affiliate, licensee, or associate of 1-800 Contacts,” Warby Parker links those ads to “a Warby Parker landing webpage that deceptively and intentionally mimics the look and feel of 1-800 Contacts’ website, including through use of a confusingly similar color scheme, layout, and discount offering, along with imagery evoking the 1800contacts.com website.”

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a new antitrust complaint against Facebook on Thursday, August 19, continuing its fight in federal court after a judge threw out its initial claims.
Facebook has until October 4 to respond to the FTC’s amended complaint. The agency had to refile the case after the judge overseeing it said in June that the government had not provided enough evidence that Facebook was a monopoly in social networking, reported The New York Times.
The judge’s decision, and a similar one he made in a case against the company brought by more than 40 states, dealt a stunning blow to regulators’ attempts to rein in Big Tech.
Related: Judge Dismisses FTC’s Antitrust Lawsuit Against Facebook
His decision presented the first major test for Lina Khan, the FTC chair, who was only days into her role at the time. Ms. Khan represents a wave of new thinking about the industry among administration officials and many lawmakers, arguing that the government needs to take far more aggressive action to stem the power of technology giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. President Biden has appointed multiple regulators with similar aims and lawmakers proposed updates to antitrust laws to target the power of technology companies.
The new complaint is longer than the original, clocking in at 80 pages compared to 53. But in broad strokes, it maintains the core arguments of the original, including allegations that Facebook used anticompetitive acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to further its monopoly power and that it also unfairly blocked rivals from accessing its application programming interface (API).
The judge also dismissed a similar lawsuit from a coalition of state attorneys general in June, but declined to give them the same second chance as the FTC. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the coalition, said they would seek to appeal the ruling.

Digital business ecosystems (“DBEs”) reflect the culmination of progressive changes in business models over the last 40 years. Coupled with the unique economic characteristics of the DBEs, these features amplify concerns arounds their ubiquity and significant market power. This article argues that existing competition analysis and proposed remedial approaches miss important implications of the complex business model and unique economic characteristics of DBEs. These include pervasive market failures, economies of scale in cloud computing technology, and algorithmic preference-shaping, all of which have myriad implications for assessing and controlling market power. If unaccounted for, these features will likely lead to competition analysis and policy approaches that do not appropriately target the source of DBE market power and vast capacity for expansion and growth.

I. INTRODUCTION
Digital business ecosystems (“DBEs”) reflect the culmination of progressive changes in business models and organizational structure over the last 40 years. DBEs feature collaborations of entities, primarily through digital architectures of information and communication technologies. Leading examples of large DBEs are Facebook (social networking), Google (search), and Amazon (e-commerce). Other powerful DBEs, however, are on the rise, including Zillow (real estate) and Optum (healthcare technology). The ubiquity and significant market power of large DBEs is t...

870,"August 17, 2021",Fix It or Forget It: A “No-Remedies” Policy for Merger Enforcement,"
The inherent limitations of remedies as a method of resolving competitive concerns with mergers have become more evident. The expansive use of remedies in actual practice has likely exceeded the capabilities of agencies and courts; and empirical evidence has increasingly cast doubt on their effectiveness. Accordingly, we propose a “no-remedies” policy under which the antitrust agency would not accept any conduct remedies and only limited divestitures. The agencies would only consider those structural changes that have been undertaken (or at least committed to) prior to the parties’ filing their merger proposal and would not enter into negotiation with the parties during the review period. This “Fix It or Forget It” (“FIFI”) policy would encourage merging parties to initiate the necessary competitive fixes and permit the agency to evaluate precisely what the parties file in their proposal. We believe this policy would strengthen merger enforcement by restoring the traditional roles of the agencies and the courts.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past several years, merger remedies have come under ever closer scrutiny. Adverse experiences have exposed the difficulties of fashioning effective remedies while academic studies have documented the frequency with which remedies have failed. This is particularly true for conduct or behavioral remedies, which proscribe specified actions on the part of the merged firm, but it is ...

871,"August 17, 2021",Recapturing the Business Side of Innovation in Antitrust Merger Analysis,"
The antitrust laws were not passed as an academic exercise. They were passed to break up the great Trusts, and to preserve competition. These were and are business issues. Our current debate over the impact of mergers on innovation seems to have left that business purpose and dimension out of the discussion. It is time to bring business reality back into the antitrust analysis. Innovation drives progress, and is a key factor in determining the success or failure of a business, an industry, and society overall. Innovation also is a concept with a rich heritage in business and social science. But our current legal discussions focus on only a part of what makes innovation important. We have set up a distinction between the idea of an innovation and the development of that idea into a successful product, and then downgraded or ignored that second part. But the transition from idea to product is a critical step in the process. After reviewing the ways in which innovation has been defined in the legal literature, we propose a definition arising out of the business world that captures the full meaning of innovation. It turns out that the current approach to evaluating the impact of mergers on innovation doesn’t really have much to do with innovation at all.

Internet users surfing from one website to another, or using various web-enabled applications, regularly encounter “dark patterns” — web-design choices that trick users into unknowingly providing more time, money, or attention than they realize. Dark patterns thus manipulate users, impairing their ability to exercise free choice and to express their actual preferences. Their use on the web is pervasive. Moreover, as artificial intelligence develops and as the “internet of things” rolls out, the ability and opportunity to manipulate and exploit consumers via dark patters will, predictably, increase. This article discusses various dark pattern techniques and explains the conditions accounting for their frequency of use in the digital space. Legislation prohibiting dark patterns and litigation challenging them as deceptive acts or practices are becoming available. However, dark patterns also have anti-competitive consequences, as they shift surplus from customers to suppliers, while also raising rivals’ costs to compete. Accordingly, antitrust enforcement should also be available to remedy these ubiquitous and pernicious online practices.

By Kiran Stacey, Financial Times
In 1914, US President Woodrow Wilson enacted what was meant to be the final flourish of the early antitrust movement. In the previous decade, the US government had broken up some of the most powerful monopolies in history, including Standard Oil, American Tobacco and the Northern Securities Company. 
Now Wilson wanted to make sure such monopolies were never allowed to exist again. So he set up the Federal Trade Commission, an almost uniquely powerful Washington regulator tasked both with writing new competition rules and enforcing them. More than 100 years later, many progressives think the FTC has failed in its core mission. They point to the existence of giant US technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon and argue that monopolies have once more been allowed to take over the US economy.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced that it has provisionally found Facebook’s purchase of Giphy will harm competition between social media platforms and remove a potential challenger in the display advertising market.
The CMA stated it may require Facebook to unwind the deal, which is reportedly worth US$400 million, and sell off Giphy if its competition concerns are ultimately confirmed.
It’s the latest sign that the UK regulator isn’t happy with the power exerted by Silicon Valley’s tech giants and a rare example of an overseas regulator looking to unwind a deal involving two American firms.

Millions of GIFs are shared on social media websites like Twitter, Snapchat, and TikTok, as well as via email and text messages. Most social media platforms rely on access to Giphy’s database of GIFs, while some also come from Google’s Tenor.
Facebook’s ownership of Giphy could lead it to deny other platforms access to its GIFs, the CMA stated.

875,"August 3, 2021",Disruptive Innovations on Digital Platforms:  Lessons from Epic Games v. Apple in the U.S. and Rappi v. iFood in Brazil,"

By Victor Oliveira Fernandes*
 
Invoking core insights from theories of disruptive innovation in order to explain competition among digital platforms has become commonplace in competition law literature.1 Tales of how Google overtook AltaVista or how Facebook overcame MySpace2 are often told to illustrate how market power in the digital world could be fleeting.
While these anedoctes do indeed help us understand there is a vital element of technological discontinuity in competition among digital platforms,3 it is not easy to translate these lessons into concrete proposals for competition policy. When investigating digital markets, antitrust agencies might struggle with whether past events of disruption are a reliable guide for antitrust purposes. Especially when facing today’s highly concentrated market, it is not clear whether the iconic downfall of former market leaders reveals something about the future.
This article briefly claims that theories of disruptive innovation have little value as a normative policy guide for competition law.4 That is because the core purpose of these theories is to point out business behavior patterns, and not to serve as crystal balls. Instead, antitrust authorities could better incorporate these theories as analytical lenses, i.e. as descriptive frameworks to unveil the economic rationality of dominant platform strategies in a context of dynamic competition.
The article pursues a twofold goal. In part I, I review the core insights from Clayton Christensen’s work on disruptive innovation and show that there are relevant limitations on using these theories to support ex-ante predictions of market outcomes. In part II, I argue that insights from the theories of disruptive innovation might sometimes explain the rationale behind exclusionary practices. I provide two examples to illustrate this point. The first example comes from the Apple Store vs. Epic Games case in the U.S., while the second comes from the Brazilian antitrust case against iFood, Brazil’s largest online food delivery platform.

I. On the Normative Limits of Theories of Disruptive Innovation
In several areas other than antitrust, the popularity of Clayton Christensen’s writings have led to conceptual misunderstandings that make disruptions narratives artificially ubiquitous.5 As a result, rather than expanding the disruption approach to any succession of a new economic agent, theories of disruptive innovation describe more restricted phenomena.
In his early works, Christensen examined disk storage and computer processor markets to understand why some high-profile firms like IBM, Apple, and Xerox have failed to maintain their market leadership.6 These failures did not result from lousy management, but from wrong decisions when dealing with technological evolution within a given value network, understood as the context in which a company identifies and responds to customer needs.7
Christensen identified that leading firms tended to prioritize technology solutions that were less costly and allowed them to best serve their current customers with higher profit margins. These innovations, called “sustainable innovations,” improved the performance of established products along performance dimensions that key customers valued historically.
By prioritizing this type of innovation, however, incumbents ended up serving customers with products that were more expensive and technologically superior to what consumers themselves demanded in a historical trajectory.8 As a result, fringe consumers formed at the bottom of these markets who were either unwilling to pay for the technologically superior products provided by the incumbents or, even if they did purchase these products, felt they were not worth as much.
A careful understanding of these theoretical lessons makes the examination of dynamic competition between digital platforms even harder.
First, disruptions describe processes of resource allocation that occur over time, so it is inappropriate to claim that a given product or service is itself disruptive.  Disruption resides in the strategic choice to introduce the innovation in the market, not in the product’s technical attributes.
Second, disruptive innovation does not necessarily represent a threat to incumbents at the beginning. Instead, disruptions usually address low-end customers’ needs, or target new markets. These segments serve as true “footholds” so that the new entrant can focus on the fringe and, only after reaching some competitive quality level, attack the incumbents’ conventional consumer groups. For this reason, disruptive innovations are usually of lower quality at the beginning.
Third, and related to the previous point, superior technology does not define a disruptive innovation. Instead, its distinctive nature lies in how it addresses consumer preferences.  Because of this, even when a technology appears superior in its technical attributes, it may not represent a deviation from traditional demand preferences.9
All these theoretical aspects raise doubts about whether one can predict disruption outcomes. Moreover, Christensen’s work has been criticized for cherry-picking particular industries as examples.10 Although many studies have tried to develop ex-ante predictions, the results are mixed at best. A conservative way to assess the chances of disruption is to compare performance trajectories in the historical demand curve versus the trajectory of performance improvement supplied by the new technology.11 However, this analysis requires speculation on how demand varies along multiples dimensions for some product. Even if we could draw some inferences by looking at the customers’ past behavior, data on young technologies would be rarely available.

II. Assessing Single-firm Conduct Through the Lens of Innovation Disruption 
The normative limitations of theories of disruptive innovation do not mean that they are useless for antitrust. On the contrary, these theories might illuminate new ways of conceptualizing market power and comprehending exclusion incentives, not from a normative approach but from a descriptive one.
A) Identifying New Disruptors
First, antitrust authorities should try to correctly identify competitors that pose a real risk of market disruption. Traditional market definition methods are insufficient for measuring dominant platforms’ market power, and are unsatisfactory as a general method for assessing damages to competition within a given artificial space. Moreover, some market definitions cannot be taken in isolation.
Disruptive innovations, in that sense, do not meet the historical preferences of consolidated consumers. Whether in digital markets or any other, the factor suggesting the presence of a disruptor is a product that either addresses low-end customers or even constitutes a new market. For this reason, the examination of market shares or even of recent entries within some timeframe can be misguided. Face-to-face competition on core digital markets is often just one aspect of the various dimensions of the competitive process, as much of the competitive forces are directed to new markets or against non-consumption.12
Disruptive competition between digital platforms develops from what Pierre Laourche13 has rightly identified as competition “on” the market – not “for” or “in” the market. The author highlights that disruptive competitors want to shift the value network or replace the dominant architectural design to gain control of a competitive bottleneck. Therefore, “the prize is not so much some amount of profit in a competitive market, but a commanding market position that enables the firm to reap a far larger profit.”14
Assessing competition from a disruption approach requires looking for the decisions taken by current or potential challengers. More specifically, antitrust authorities should be vigilant with entrants’ strategies that suggest a discontinuation between the historical preference trajectory of consumers and the demand curve at the bottom of the existing market. Of course, future scenarios are uncertain. But some recent examples might demonstrate that competitors are trying to find alternative ways to address low-end customers, even in the face of consolidated digital platforms.
Despite Google’s strong dominance in the universal search engines market, it seems that competition against non-consumption comes from the way customers value the services’ other quality dimensions, such as privacy. As Google has become the target of antitrust investigations and increased regulatory scrutiny to protect users’ privacy, some start-ups with high venture capital like Neeva are betting on creating a search engine paid by subscription.15
In social networks, competitors also seem to be trying to run sideways. Despite Facebook’s long-established leadership, in the last decade we have seen significant entries from companies such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.16 These players appear to have bet on disruptive or alternative strategies, like investing in relevant architectural innovations and sophisticated photo and video capabilities accessible to non-professional users.17 They do not reproduce the exact characteristics or the marginal increments of the incumbent social network, which has even led Facebook to adopt similar novelties to those brought by these entrants.
When defining a relevant market, antitrust authorities cannot ignore that potential disruptors are unwilling to address the mainstream preferences of traditional customers of the incumbent platforms. Thus, even when we do not see face-to-face competition in the present, incumbents might try to impede the success of challengers that may shift their value network.
B) Platform Responses to Disruptive Challengers
Second, theories of disruption can explain how digital platforms might have incentives not to respond to innovative threats imposed by new disruptors. Dominant agents can use vertical agreements, predatory practices, or abuses of intellectual property “to make the access to the lower end of the consumers more difficult and/or render the interface between its value network and another value network more difficult.”18
Of course, it is not a simple task to determine when single-firm conducts aimed at protecting their dominant position will be unlawful or not. Nevertheless, some insight shared in this article can inspire new theories of dominant platform harm with regard to exclusionary conducts.
The narratives of successful disruption cycles assume that consumers at the bottom of the market who are unwilling to pay for sustainable innovations biased by the incumbent’s historical trajectory can freely migrate or simultaneously adopt the new technology offered by the entrant. To prevent such migration from the value network, incumbents will seek to delay the migration or adoption of a new product.
 
III. Lessons from the Present – Epic v. Apple and Rappi v. iFood
While we cannot elaborate on all possible exclusion scenarios, it is interesting to look at two particular cases
First, take the ongoing battle between Epic Games and Apple in the U.S.19 As of August 2020, Epic Games launched a new direct payment system in their “Fortnite” game called “The Fortnite Mega Drop.” Epic Games’ primary goal in introducing this system was to prevent Apple Store from charging a 30 percent fee for each transaction between final customers and Epic Games. The new Epic Games payment system guaranteed permanent discounts on the game’s currency, V-Bucks. In response, Apple banned Epic Games from the Apple Store for violating its rules.20 Epic Games have argued that Apple engaged in unalwfull monopolization practices both in the IOS app distribution market and in the market for payment solutions.21
But how could antitrust agencies frame Epic Games v. Apple as a tale of disruption? First, consider that Apple historically imposes fees for in-app purchases. Thus, under some circumstances, we could see the introduction of Epic Games’ payment system as a disruptive attack to “capture” low-cost customers. Most users who make purchases in smartphone apps might value the support features provided by Apple’s App Store. People who own iPhones and iPads can make these payments using their own Apple Account valid for the entire Apple Ecosystem. Regular users can also make payments with a simple touch and secure personal identification system that involves the buyer’s face or fingerprint recognition. These features provided by Apple seem to be positively valued on the preference curve of consumers who are at the “top end of the markets.”
On the other hand, at the bottom of the market, big fans of the Fortnite game may not follow the same preference pattern. Fortnite players will probably not be willing to pay a higher price for V-Bucks just because the Apple Store brings greater convenience to transactions. While there is not enough data to elaborate on this point, one could imagine a case where demand curves show that V-bucks buyers do not give high value to parameters historically valued by most Apple Store users. In that case, Fortnite players would constitute a group of “low-cost” customers who might be a foothold for disruption.
If that is the case, Apple may be concerned not only about the free-rider effect provided by the Fortnite Mega Drop. The dominant firm may also fear a significant revolution in payment systems in general. If every highly-popular app creates its own payment system, app stores themselves may become obsolete as a medium to mediate payment between users and app developers. The likelihood of this market revolution depends on consumer behavior patterns, which should be closely examined.
Next, we look at a somewhat more obscure case, taking place in Brazil. In March 2021, Brazilian competition watchdog CADE issued an interim decision prohibiting iFood, Brazil’s most popular food delivery app, from signing exclusivity agreements with bars and restaurants.22 The investigation started after competitor Rappi filed a complaint in September of last year. Another competitor, Uber Eats, controlled by Uber Technologies Inc., also spoke against iFood’s exclusivity agreements. In addition, an association of bars and restaurants complained before the authority asserting that iFood’s bargaining power for exclusivity became stronger during the COVID-19 pandemic.23
In its decision, CADE considered that iFood holds a dominant position in the food delivery app market due to its large market share (around 86 percent according to the Brazilian Association of restaurants and bars).24 Moreover, CADE acknowledged that iFood benefits from a “first-mover” advantage, as it started as the first national food delivery app in the country.25
As this is an interim decision, the authority did not elaborate further on a theory of harm, but mentioned that exclusive agreements with restaurants might lead to market foreclosure and higher barriers to entry. CADE deemed these market harms were imminent once the COVID-19 pandemic enormously boosted the food delivery market.
One of the central defensive claims put forth by iFood is that interim measures are misplaced as the national food app market is highly dynamic and subject to significant risks of disruption. However, even though this is a digital platform market, there seems to be little evidence of threats of market disruption anytime soon.
On the one hand, we could try to assert that iFood is a legitimate incumbent. The firm developed a new business model when apps did not seem to be a very reliable business partner for restaurants. iFood only started to face competition from other national platforms (as Aiqfome, 99 Food, Delivery Much, Uber Eats, and Rappi) in Brazil’s medium-sized cities over the last two years.
But it is not so simple to state that the new entrants shall be “disruptors” in the market. Most of iFood’s competitors seem to represent face-to-face competition instead. Others seem to be betting on differentiated business models that are even more sophisticated and do not seem to address “low-end customers.” Rappi, for example, offers various forms of delivery service – not only food-related. The platform’s partner portfolio is much more pluralist, including supermarkets, drugstores, and specialized retail stores. The platform even offers personalized deliveries of virtually anything. On the other hand, Uber Eats exploits a strong brand name in logistics and its high reputation among drivers. In both cases, however, there is no clear sign of competition outside the value network.
As there is little room for framing the case under a dynamic competition approach, CADE will probably assess the practice under its traditional legal criteria for exclusionary practices as developed in the case law. The authority will evaluate whether the alleged efficiencies of the practice, namely the potential for avoiding free-rider effects, can overcome these concrete and potential exclusionary effects.
 
IV. Final Remarks 
These are just a few examples of how disruptive innovation theories can rewrite (or not) the checklist of exclusionary abuses. For all the reasons set above, this brief article attempts to show the importance of advancing a research agenda that firmly grasps the core insights of theories of disruptive innovations in order to strengthen the antitrust analysis.

Central banks and financial regulators urgently need to get to grips with the growing influence of “Big Tech,” according to top officials from central bank umbrella group the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
Global watchdogs are increasingly wary that the huge amounts of data controlled by groups such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Alibaba could allow them to reshape finance so rapidly that it destabilized entire banking systems.
The BIS, in a paper led by its head Agustin Carstens, pointed to examples such as China where the two big tech payment firms Alipay and WeChat Pay now account for 94% of the mobile payments market.
China has already rattled its markets with a series of clampdowns on top tech and e-commerce firms. Last November regulators torpedoed the public listing of Jack Ma’s fintech Ant Group and in the nine months since other tech giants and, lately, tutoring firms, have all faced scrutiny.
In many other jurisdictions too, tech firms are rapidly establishing footprints, with some also lending to individuals and small businesses as well as offering insurance and wealth management services.
“The entry of big techs into financial services gives rise to new challenges surrounding the concentration of market power and data governance,” the BIS paper published on Monday, August 2, stated.
There was scope for “specific entity-based rules” notably in the European Union, China, and the United States, it added.
“Any impact on the integrity of the monetary system arising from the emergence of dominant platforms ought to be a key concern for the central bank.”

878,"August 1, 2021",The Usefulness of the Consumer Survey Method in Defining Relevant Markets,"

By Garima Sodhi,1 Sailee Sakhardande,2 & Bhaavi Agrawal3
 
 I. Introduction
The superstructure of robust economic arguments in antitrust cases is based on an underlying foundation of market definition. Defining the relevant market is the yardstick for measuring competitive constraints faced by firms.4 In several cases, the comparison of physical characteristics, functionality, and intended use is sufficient to determine a workable relevant market and it may not require the use of more sophisticated and complex analysis. However, in certain cases, substitution is not easily discernible as it is difficult to predict the consumer’s reaction to price increases, or the market may be too complex to delineate. The Small but Significant Non-transitory Increase in Price test (“SSNIP test”) is a powerful empirical tool used by antitrust agencies all over the world to identify relevant markets.5
Implementing the SSNIP test involves estimating own and cross-price elasticities, price correlations, and factoring in characteristics of products and consumer preferences.6 Estimation of these economic parameters thus requires firm and industry-specific information over multiple years, which can be difficult to gather. For instance, official government statistics that provide information on consumer behavior may often be too aggregated for analytical purposes.7 Further, revealed preference data in terms of historical consumer behavior are more likely to be unavailable or insufficient to identify the relevant market.8
In such cases, a Stated Preference approach manifesting through a consumer survey can offer an effective way of gauging demand substitutability, which is the most important factor to be assessed while defining the relevant market. Consumer surveys are a popular tool employed by competition commissions around the world. They are not devoid of errors, but a carefully designed survey with an appropriate sample can provide reasonable insights and data to help arrive at the relevant market. The consumer survey method may be all the more useful in digital markets, given the huge complexity involved with using econometric analysis due to the presence of indirect network effects. In such a case economic analysis can be performed using qualitative data like the functionality of services, technical characteristics, and specific features of consumer demand.
In some of the recent cases before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI” or “Commission”), market definition has been a particular point of contention. A broadly defined market can by nature dilute both market shares and market power, and can reduce a dominant firm to a constrained, price-taking firm. For example, in the Mohit v. Flipkart9  case, it was contended by the online platforms that the relevant market for books be identified on the basis of genre, language, and the nature of sales, viz. consumer or institutional (CCI). A consumer survey in this case can either dispel or confirm certain contentions regarding the characteristics of different products that can make them substitutes.
In view of the above, this paper aims to examine the usefulness of the consumer survey method in defining the relevant market, particularly in the case of digital markets.
 
II. Literature Review
A. The Role of Consumer Surveys in Competition Analysis
The discourse on the admissibility of consumer surveys as evidence in the U.S. dates back to the twentieth century10 and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission notes the role of consumer surveys in estimating demand elasticity and their ability to control leading questions, selection bias, and randomness.11 The UK’s Office of Fair Trading stated that consumer survey evidence can be particularly useful when the competition concerns affect a large segment of the population, whose opinion may not be sufficiently captured by consulting a few members of the segment.12 It comes as no surprise then, that the UK Competition and Markets Authority has used consumer surveys in about half of its merger enquiries.13 The European Commission also uses consumer surveys on usage patterns and attitudes to consider whether two products can be regarded as substitutes, in addition to understanding their brand strength.14
Consumer surveys are a popular research tool amongst antitrust authorities on account of several important factors. For one, a stated preference survey is an effective alternative to traditional econometric tools used to assess consumer demand and delineate market boundaries.15 Further, consumer surveys can be used in the computation of Critical Loss Analysis as well as Diversion Ratios, which are conventional economic tools for market definition and merger analysis.16 For example, in the Kraft Gen. Foods case17, the Federal Trade Commission deployed consumer surveys to understand the determinants of demand for cereal such as taste, prices, and nutrition, as well as garner evidence to debunk the plaintiff’s claim of separate “adult” and “child” cereal segments.
Given the usefulness of consumer surveys in establishing market definition and carrying out merger analysis, as well as in supplementing qualitative or other documentary evidence18, it is no wonder that surveys find relevance in the complexities of digital markets. For example, in the HungryHouse and Just Eat merger case19, the UK Competition and Markets Authority supplemented the econometric analysis with market surveys to define the market as well as to obtain diversion estimates. Keeping in mind the transactional nature of the platform (i.e. the interaction between customers and restaurants), the CMA interviewed both restaurant owners as well as customers. The survey helped in clarifying how closely the merging parties competed for both restaurants and customers and the extent to which other competitors exert constraints.20
Despite their usefulness, consumer surveys have almost always been classified as “other evidence”.21 And while survey evidence is generally accepted by the courts, the variability in their acceptance as evidence by judges and lawyers means that survey evidence can be challenged vigorously in cases where they are key.22 This is because of a number of technical complexities in the execution and interpretation of surveys. For one, it can be argued that consumer behavior in practice can be different from what is stated, a phenomenon referred to as the “privacy paradox”.23  A case in point is the Lufthansa/Airholding24 merger case where Lufthansa critiqued the “switching question” for a lack of quantification of the minimum percentage of customers that should switch for the SSNIP to recognize that the Brussels and Antwerp airports were substitutes. The CMA, however, could defend its position by demonstrating that it evaluated the survey results for the switching question in tandem with responses to other questions that related to actual past behavior, which was acknowledged as a much more credible source by Lufthansa. This highlights the importance of including questions on past behavior and preferences alongside hypothetical future choices in the survey.
Another key issue is response bias (e.g. self-interest) and there is a risk that responses can systematically over or understate actual behavior depending on how the question is designed.25 For example, if asked whether a product is too expensive, it is in the interest of the consumer to answer affirmatively even if that might not be the case. In this regard, a carefully designed survey which is worded neutrally and refrains from asking agree/disagree questions when possible can be helpful.26
 
III. Background
We next turn to the application of consumer surveys in the Indian context. First, the Competition Act considers factors such as interchangeability or substitutability and consumer preferences while defining the relevant market.27 Thus, consumer surveys can be an effective tool in identifying products and services as weak or strong substitutes, especially in the case of digital markets where zero prices make price correlation analysis virtually impossible. Second, there is often a lack of consensus regarding the apposite market definition, with the plaintiff, the defendant, and possibly the CCI having different notions of the relevant market (See for e.g. Fast Track v. OLA case28 and RKG v. OYO29). Consumer surveys can come in handy at this point, evaluating whether products or services claimed as substitutes by various parties may indeed be deemed as such.
To examine the usefulness of consumer surveys in understanding the relevant market in India, we consider the recent abuse of dominance (“AoD”) case against Google filed with CCI.30 While the investigation spans across three distinct sections, this paper specifically addresses the market definition for applications facilitating payment through Unified Payment Interface (“UPI”). In the case of UPI payments, the informant and CCI both concurred on the relevant market as the “market for UPI enabled Digital Payment Apps in India,” while the defendant contested this market definition stating that it “ignores competitive reality, as it excludes other forms of payment that users consider to be substitutes (such as net banking, mobile wallets, and credit and debit cards).”
Against this backdrop, we designed a consumer survey that assesses the substitutability of UPI with other modes of payment and evaluates whether UPI apps can themselves constitute a market in their entirety. UPI apps are digital platforms that facilitate pecuniary transactions between senders and beneficiaries of money.  A regulatory push, a Virtual Payment Address (“VPA”), and the possibility of origination across a range of other platforms including direct and instant transfer to bank accounts, have been driving the growth of UPI platforms.31 Besides, a number of third-party players and most banks have their own UPI apps which means that consumers now have more than 100 UPI applications to choose from.32
 
IV. Methodology
Given the nature of the market classified as “transaction markets,” it becomes important to examine factors influencing competition on both sides of the platform before coming up with a relevant market definition. Given the time constraint, however, we examine the consumer side of the UPI-enabled payment app platform and evaluate substitutability among various payment modes.
A. Objective and Target Population
The first step in survey design is the definition of a clear objective followed by identification of a target group for the survey.33 In the case of our survey, the purpose is to identify whether other modes of payments (both digital and non-digital) such as internet banking, Aadhar-based payments (payment service that allows customers to use their biometric data as identification to perform basic banking activities), mobile banking, debit and credit card transactions, as well as cash and cheques, serve as viable alternatives to UPI-based payment applications. The target population therefore are the users of both digital and non-digital payment modes throughout India.
B. Choice of Survey Questions
Meyer34, Reynolds & Walters35 as well as OECD36 provide useful guidelines in designing survey questions. To elicit meaningful responses to questions that may not always be perfectly tuned, the UK Competition and Markets Authority tries to have respondents relive their usage or purchasing decisions.37 This is achieved by asking questions which encompass four factors: matters of fact, matters of behavior, matters of choice, and matters of attitude.
Matters of fact address simple factual points and try to understand the context in which the decision was made. Matters of behavior seek to understand both the range of alternatives considered by customers and the most potent among them.  The next factor considered is matters of choice, which aims to uncover the factors responsible for the choice that was eventually made. Matters of attitude usually address counterfactual scenarios of a hypothetical price increase, typically referred to as price diversion. Our survey questions follow these guidelines. Further, questions that profile the average user to understand whether a certain population segment has been over or under represented are included, such as respondent’s age, gender, internet usage, family income etc.

Choice of Alternatives

We identified an exhaustive list of digital and non-digital alternatives to UPI available to users. Cash and cheques were the most common non-digital alternatives, while digital alternatives included mobile wallets, BHIM Aaadhar, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (“USSD”), Point of Sale (“PoS”), Bank prepaid cards, internet banking, mobile banking, credit and debit cards, micro ATMs, and the Aadhar-Enabled Payment System (“AEPS”).38 Since most digital modes and UPI in particular require the use of a smartphone, some of the options listed above do not make for credible substitutes.39 Digital alternatives for smartphone users are depicted in Figure 1 and our final list of possible substitutes thus comes down to cash, cheque, internet banking, mobile banking, mobile wallets, Aadhar payments, bank prepaid cards, and credit and debit cards.
Figure 1: Summary

Another important consideration was categorizing different types of expenditures into multiple segments and examining the use of various digital and non-digital modes of payment for that segment. This was done because consumers often employ varied modes of payment for different types of purchases. The idea behind questions 4a – 4g is thus to identify the areas where UPI apps are more likely to be used and then to further zero in on close and weak substitutes for those areas. This is facilitated by understanding the frequency of usage of various digital payment modes for each of these areas – which pans out in the form of a qualitative scale ranging from “Always” to “Never.” While calculating the average score for each question, we use a linear scale from zero to four where zero corresponds to “Never” and “Always” corresponds to a score of four.

Addressing Bias

Based on the guidelines in OECD (2017)40 and Meyer (2007)41, we incorporate a number of factors in our survey design in order to minimize response bias. For one, we do not include any question which requires respondents to agree or disagree with a statement which can elicit confirmation bias.
Second, we have not included any questions which ask respondents for their opinion on the quality of the service or their satisfaction with the applications in their current state. This minimizes the possibility of respondents’ self-interest influencing their answers.  A third key issue is the bias from differences in respondents’ behavior in real life and in their stated choices.42 Since we include a question on forced diversion, we cannot rule out the existence of such a bias. However, we corroborate the findings from the diversion question with results from questions on usage based on past behavior. Fourth, to minimize confusion, we ensured that survey questions are worded simply and neutrally.
Another important aspect that can influence responses is the length of the questionnaire and the ordering of the questions. For both these parameters, we refer to the Hungry House and Just Eat merger survey.43 The consumer survey consists of 24 questions which address consumers’ food ordering behavior, diversion scenarios, and information to profile the users followed by questions on historical usage and frequency. Our survey includes 17 questions and takes about 10 minutes to answer, which is the ideal length for a web survey.44 The survey was designed using Google Forms which ensured that the same ordering of questions and responses were recorded between November 13-20, 2020, with surveys shared through social media including LinkedIn and WhatsApp.
C. Limitations
There are a number of limitations to our survey design, as discussed below.
The first limitation is the inability to measure the response rate and thus to control for non-response bias. Since the survey was shared using social networking sites, it was not possible to identify potential respondents who saw the post with the survey but did not fill it up. The second limitation is the absence of sophisticated stratified sampling techniques that can be applied on various sub-groups, especially if such sub-groups cannot be deemed to constitute a single population.45 The third limitation is the relatively small sample size in this study. This is solely due to time and resource constraints in the context of this study and can easily be scaled up to make it commensurate with the total UPI users in India.
  
V. Results
The survey recorded 113 responses and after accounting for duplicates and the screening question, the final sample comprised 98 responses.
A. Respondent Characteristics
We collected basic information in the form of respondents’ age, gender, internet usage and household income to profile the average user. Our sample is 43 percent female and 57 percent male. In terms of age distribution, nearly half (46 percent) of respondents are between 25 and 34 years old followed by 24 percent of respondents between 35 and 44 years old, 17 percent between 18 and 24 years, and another 10 percent between 45 and 54 years of age. The median monthly annual income among respondents is between INR 1,50,000 and 2,00,000. Median internet usage for personal use is about 10 hours a week.
To ascertain whether respondents can differentiate between digital payments such as Aadhar-based payments, UPI transactions, and mobile wallets, we introduced a short write-up at the beginning of the survey. Respondents had to choose all the correct options based on the text from a set of four alternatives. Only 35 percent of the respondents managed to answer the question correctly, indicating that consumers are not necessarily aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the payment applications they are using.
B. Respondent Preferences
Respondents used three payment applications on average, providing strong support for multi-homing. The most popular UPI app was Google Pay with 77 percent of respondents using it, followed by Paytm with 72 percent of users and PhonePe with 29 percent. Amazon and UPI Bank Apps have a share of 22 percent each. In terms of the most preferred payment apps, Google Pay again stood first with 61 percent of users listing it among the top two digital apps, used followed by Paytm with 50 percent of users, PhonePe with 17 percent and BHIM with 7 percent. Further, an overwhelming majority of respondents could list two or more such UPI apps, which again strengthens the presence of multihoming and thus lower multihoming costs.
Further, swiftness (72 percent) and instant (55 percent) nature of transfers, as well as wider acceptance by merchants, friends, and online sites (54 percent) emerged as the main factors for usage of UPI apps. Other factors include no transaction charges (46 percent), ease of becoming a user (40 percent) and long-term usage of the app due to fewer options earlier (34 percent).  Pre-installation of the app does not appear to be an important reason driving the usage of payment apps as only 10 percent of respondents chose that as the reason for their current choice of apps.
About 74 percent of respondents used an Android phone and the remaining 26 percent used an iOS device. 88 percent of Android users did not report any pre-installed payment application on their phone. Of the 12 percent (9 respondents) that answered affirmatively, six respondents (6 percent of the total sample) reported that Google Pay was pre-installed on their phone, whereas one respondent each reported that Samsung Pay, Paytm, PhonePe and MI Pay were pre-installed on their phone.
C. Historical Behavior
We use Questions 3 and 4 to understand historical usage patterns and substitutability between various modes of payment for different payment categories. Table 2 depicts the average scores for different payment modes for questions 3 and 4. Notably, the overall ranking for questions 3 and 4 is quite similar.  In terms of the most used payment modes in question 3, Credit and Debit cards emerged as the first choice with an average score of 2.9, followed by UPI with a score of 2.7 and cash, which scored 2.6. Based on the linear scale where 2 denotes “Sometimes” and 3 denotes “Often,” these scores indicate frequent usage.

Tables 3 and 4 represent the top three payment modes for each category of payment listed in questions 4a to 4g. Our analysis indicates that UPI payments register a score greater than 2 and feature in the top three payment modes for five payments categories. More specifically, UPI emerged as the first choice for 4a) Transferring money to friends and family 4b) Paying for utilities including mobile bills, grocery bills, etc. It was the second choice for 4e) Paying for travel bookings including flights, hotels, etc. 4g) Paying for online shopping. And it ranks third in the case of 4c) Paying for services including restaurants, salon, movies, etc.
Based on the rankings, we evaluate substitutes for UPI apps by narrowing our focus to these five payment categories. Credit and debit cards, cash, internet banking, and mobile wallets thus emerge as close substitutes for UPI. For the five payment categories under consideration, modes of payment such as cheques, Aadhar based payments, and bank prepaid cards always score below 1.5 which indicates rare usage amongst respondents. Mobile banking scores 1.7 and 1.6 for 4a, and 4b respectively, while scoring below 1.5 for 4c, 4g, and 4e. However, it fails to feature in the top three payment modes for any of the payment categories and never scores above 2 which indicates less than frequent usage.

D. Diversion
When asked about the mode of payment that respondents would switch to due to unavailability of their most used UPI application, 34 percent of respondents said they would switch to another UPI application. This result is consistent with the finding that our respondents make use of three payment applications on average, which makes it easier to switch to other UPI applications. Further, 31 percent of respondents would switch to a different mode of payment i.e. credit or debit cards. Given that credit and debit card transactions have emerged as the most used payment method for various transactions, this result also comes as no surprise. Internet banking stood third, as a choice in the absence of UPI for 13 percent of the respondents, followed by mobile wallets and cash. These choices are consistent with the results from questions on usage patterns and choice of payment modes across a variety of transactions where credit and debit card payments, internet banking, mobile wallets, and cash rank in the top five together with UPI apps.

VI. Discussion
A. Market Definition
UPI apps are digital markets characterized by the interaction between transacting parties, thus, a single market definition that includes both sides of the platform becomes necessary.46 The consumer survey employed in this study seeks to clarify market boundaries on the consumer side of the platform, which together with a survey on the merchant side of the platform can be used to identify the relevant market for UPI apps.
Our analysis of the consumer side indicates that UPI apps may not constitute a market by themselves. This assertion is supported by three different results from the consumer survey. First, UPI apps along with credit and debit cards, cash, internet banking, and mobile wallets are the most frequently used modes of transaction and together they constitute the market for “payments.” Second, credit and debit cards, cash, internet banking, and mobile wallets are equally and sometimes even more popular payment modes for transaction categories where UPI apps are one of the most preferred choices. This indicates clear substitutability between UPI apps and the aforementioned modes based on historical consumer behavior. And third, an overwhelming majority (66 percent) of UPI app users would switch to alternative modes of payment in case their most preferred UPI app becomes unavailable as against using another UPI app. This further consolidates the argument for not considering the market for UPI payments in isolation.
In terms of substitutability between UPI and other modes, credit and debit cards emerge as the strongest alternative, consistently ranking high on frequency of usage in the past year as well as for different categories of payments, often outperforming all other modes. Further, about 31 percent of users indicated that they would switch to credit and debit card payments in case their favored UPI app becomes unavailable, which comes a close second to a switch to other UPI apps (34 percent). Cash, internet banking, and mobile wallets consistently rank in the top three modes of payment that compete with UPI for the same payment categories. This supports the notion of a moderate substitution with UPI apps. In the case of Mobile banking, the evidence for substitutability is weak at best. Other evidence such as the size of SMS banking vis-a-vis UPI and recent trends in usage among smartphone users along with its substitutability on the other side of the platform i.e. for merchants should be considered before excluding it from the definition.
Our survey thus points to a product market definition that is inclusive of credit and debit card payments, cash, internet banking, and mobile wallets when considering the market for UPI apps.
B. Within UPI payments
Qualitative evidence from the survey presents a strong evidence for multihoming within the UPI universe. For one, when asked about the number of payment apps installed on their phone, users indicated that they use an average of three apps. Second, when asked to choose from a list of UPI apps that respondents used, an average user was again found to select three apps. Thus, there appear to be no or little switching costs as users tend to use more than one payment app simultaneously. Third, in our sample, while Google Pay and Paytm were used by over 70 percent of respondents, PhonePe, UPI bank apps and Amazon Pay were used by over 20 percent of respondents. This additionally supports the notion of multihoming by users. The offering of over a 100 UPI apps together with multihoming by users is indicative of strong competition amongst providers of UPI apps and lower switching costs.
Our analysis indicates that Google Pay is the most used and most preferred app among respondents, closely followed by Paytm and PhonePe which is a distant third. Data on UPI transactions however, indicates that Google Pay and PhonePe are the most popular UPI apps followed by Paytm and other UPI apps47  and thus stratified sampling may be employed in a bigger survey in order to sample UPI users commensurate with each app’s market share.

Pre-installation and the Status-quo Bias

In the referenced Google AoD case, the informant has alleged that “by pre-installing and prominently placing Google Pay on Android smartphones at the time of initial set-up resulting in a “status-quo bias” to the detriment of other apps facilitating payments through UPI” Our survey results provide mixed evidence for the existence of such a bias. Only 10 percent of the respondents stated “pre-installed payment app” as one of the reasons for currently using it, which provides weak evidence in support of this bias. However, out of the six Android users that listed Google Pay as an app that was pre-installed on their phone, 83 percent or five respondents frequently use Google Pay and state it to be one of the most preferred apps. This lends support to the existence of a status quo bias. Since the sample size used to draw this inference is very small in this case (10 and 6 respondents respectively), a larger sample is required to conclusively confirm the existence of such a bias.
C. The SSNDQ dilemma
In digital markets with zero prices, SSNDQ tests may be considered instead of SSNIP tests which cannot be applied in this case.48 However, a number of challenges in implementing the SSNDQ test can render it unworkable.49 A major challenge is identification of the highly ranked vertical dimensions of quality.50 Further, Hartman et al proposed 25 percent decrease in a major performance quality for the SSNDQ test.51 However, differences in the nature of price and quality can make implementing the author’s proposal quite challenging.52 In the case of UPI, factors attracting consumers the most towards UPI were not clear a priori which made identifying key qualities that could be hypothetically downgraded considerably difficult.
 
VII. Conclusion
Digital markets characterized by network effects, switching costs and multiple sides have posed challenges to traditional market definition tools such as SSNIP tests. Consumer surveys are a popular research tool amongst antitrust authorities for defining the relevant market and have been particularly useful in the complex digital market cases. This paper takes a qualitative approach to market definition in the form of a consumer survey that evaluates the substitutability between UPI apps and other modes of payment. The survey has certain limitations due to time and resource constraints, and hence the results cannot be used conclusively for delineating the relevant market in this case, but it is indicative of a strong substitutability between UPI and other modes of payment suggesting that the relevant market in the referenced case is contestable. The survey method can, however, be easily challenged as stated preferences may be different to actual preferences, thus, requiring caution when designing and sampling.

879,"July 29, 2021",Senators Defend Their Antitrust Venue Bill,"


The four lawmakers responsible for antitrust legislation defended their bill to allow state attorneys general to determine the venue to bring an antitrust case, a measure that would prevent companies from choosing a court that might be more sympathetic to their defense, reported Bloomberg.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline, both Democrats, joined with two Republicans, Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, on a letter addressed to a judge who questioned the bill to exempt antitrust cases brought by attorneys general from review by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. This exemption already exists for federal antitrust cases.
The bill “reaffirms the importance of state antitrust enforcement,” according to the letter, addressed to Judge Roslynn Mauskopf. “State attorneys general have critical opportunities to protect consumers from the problems that result from monopolies and oligopolies.”
The lawmakers’ letter also points out that the judge’s complaint hews closely to the argument by Alphabet’s Google concerning the appropriate venue for the antitrust case brought by states, including Texas.
“It strikes us as unusual, if not inappropriate, for the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to adopt the arguments of a party in active litigation before the federal courts in a policy letter to Congress,” the letter stated.
The bill in question, H.R. 3460, was approved by the House Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, but has yet to get a vote from the full House. A similar bill has also been introduced in the Senate

880,"July 27, 2021",Why the New Administration Should Bury the New Madison Approach,"
The “New Madison” approach sounds so promising. Old but new. Updating the classics for the modern era. What could be bad? In a word: everything. The intersection of patent and antitrust law has a long pedigree. For decades, antitrust’s role in patent-based activity has been acknowledged. Patent licenses are subject to antitrust scrutiny. “Pay for delay” settlements are not entitled to antitrust immunity. And activity in the context of standard setting organizations (“SSOs”) could conceivably violate antitrust law. That history has recently come under attack. Between 2017 and 2020, the head of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, introduced a radical framework — the “New Madison” approach — that extricated patent-based conduct from antitrust scrutiny. Such a gambit diverged from the longstanding bipartisan approach that had recognized antitrust’s role in policing standards-based conduct. This essay introduces standards and then addresses five tenets of Delrahim’s approach. For each, it presents the argument and then discusses its flaws.

881,"July 27, 2021",The Old Brandeis and the New Madison in Historical Perspective,"
The modern progressive view of antitrust, which has its origins in Louis Brandeis’s famous attack on “The Curse of Bigness,” regards large firm size as a source of improper political influence, regardless of the concentration of market power within the industry. That Brandeisian view, championed today by Tim Wu and Lina Khan, now in the Biden administration, calls for a vast expansion of antitrust enforcement. Unfortunately, all too often that approach has given a free rein to monopolistic activities in agriculture and labor, while at the same exposing productive firms to political attacks that all too-often work to prop up weaker market competitors. The New Madison approach of Makan Delrahim rightly exposes the overreaching of that approach in dealing with patent pools. And his cautionary attitude also warns against the counterproductive effects of the antitrust laws in other sectors outside the IP sector.

I. INTRODUCTION
One striking feature about modern intellectual debates is how much emotional impact can be packed into a single word — big, as in bad. Today, a debate is raging in the overlapping areas of antitrust and patents. Their combination holds the keys to innovation, which everyone on both sides of the political spectrum seem, at least as at some abstract level, to support. But the means to that end, and its relationship to other social ends, divide the academic and practical worlds into two warring camps. On the one side st...

882,"July 27, 2021",French Watchdog: Big Fines Can Change Big Tech,"


Multimillion-euro fines can force Big Tech companies to change their behaviour, despite their deep pockets, the president of the French Competition Authority has argued. 
According to the Financial Times, Isabelle de Silva said she did not believe sanctions could be played down as merely “the cost of doing business”, breaking away from the consensus in the EU, where competition officials have struggled for years to contain the market power of Big Tech, despite levying billions of euros of penalties. “It is not my line of thinking,” she said in an interview with the Financial Times. 
“Fines are an element of the identification of what is wrong in the conduct.” De Silva’s comments come as the slow pace of antitrust probes and the apparent inefficiency of the fines have frustrated European regulators. In October 2019, the region’s top enforcer of competition and digital policy, Margrethe Vestager, said fines were not enough to ensure a fair playing field. In France, however, De Silva argues that the work done by competition regulators is having an impact. Since June, her office has hit Google with €720m in fines in two separate cases.  
The first was related to its advertising technology business, with investigators mapping out how Google leveraged its different roles in selling online banner ads to disadvantage competitors. The California-based group decided to settle and pay €220m in penalties in full with no appeal — a first for the search engine giant.

883,"July 25, 2021",US FTC Asks For Extension To Refile Its Facebook Antitrust Suit,"


The Federal Trade Commission on Friday asked a federal judge to give it more time to refile an antitrust suit against Facebook that is the agency’s biggest test in reining in the power of big tech, reported The New York Times. 
In a filing with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the agency asked for a three-week extension, or until Aug. 19, to amend a lawsuit that the court dismissed last month. The FTC said in its request that it had reached an agreement with Facebook over the proposed extension.
Last month, Judge James E. Boasberg of the federal court knocked down a core argument made by the FTC saying prosecutors had failed to provide enough persuasive facts to back up the claim — that Facebook holds a monopoly over social networking. But the judge gave the FTC a 30-day window to refile its lawsuit.
The new lawsuit will be the first major action by Lina Khan, the new chair of the FTC and a critic of Facebook, Google and Amazon who has advocated for the breakup of the digital platforms.

884,"July 22, 2021",The Antitrust Duty to Deal in the Age of Big Tech,"


By Erik Hovenkamp (University of Southern California)
The antitrust duty to deal is perhaps the most confounding and controversial form of antitrust intervention. It is sought by plaintiffs in situations where a monopolist controls a critical input (or “essential facility”) and unilaterally refuses to sell access to rivals. Courts have substantially narrowed the doctrine in recent decades. However, the prevalence of dominant platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon has provoked intense debate over whether the antitrust duty to deal needs a revival. Many such platforms are accused of refusing to deal with (or otherwise discriminating against) rivals in adjacent markets.
The debate centers mainly on what a plaintiff should have to show to trigger a duty to deal. However, I argue that this overlooks the most pressing problem, which is not the standard of liability but rather its domain: the set of cases in which it must be applied. At present, this domain is far too broad, conjoining two very different lines of cases that have no business being evaluated under a common standard. In one line of cases, the defendant’s refusal raises substantially the same theory of harm as tying or related vertical restraints. However, formalistic legal doctrine prevents plaintiffs from challenging them as such. As a result, these cases almost never receive meaningful scrutiny. This is problematic, because a large majority of meritorious refusal-to-deal cases fall into this category. It also happens to include almost all cases involving platform defendants.

885,"July 20, 2021",Biden To Name Kanter As DOJ Antitrust Chief,"


President Joe Biden has picked Jonathan Kanter to serve as the Justice Department’s (DOJ) assistant attorney general for antitrust, in a major win for progressive Democrats who accused the agency of failing to aggressively pursue major tech companies’ antitrust and privacy violations, Bloomberg reported.
According to the New York Times, Biden’s plan to appoint Mr. Kanter, an antitrust lawyer who has made a career out of representing smaller rivals of Big Tech, signals how strongly the administration is siding with the growing field of lawmakers, researchers and regulators who say that Silicon Valley has obtained outsize power over the way Americans speak with one another, buy products online and consume news.
If the Senate confirms him, Kanter would head the division that filed an antitrust suit against Google in October. 
Kanter began his career as a staff attorney at the Federal Trade Commission before moving to private practice. A protege of Rick Rule, a Republican who served as President Ronald Reagan’s DOJ antitrust chief, Kanter represented Microsoft when it settled the Justice Department’s probe in the early 2000s and then through the company’s travails with European antitrust authorities.
He also represented companies including US Airways in its merger with American Airlines, and health insurer Cigna in its failed deal with Anthem.

886,"July 15, 2021",US & EU Competition Policy Is Aligning: WSJ,"


The European Union’s top antitrust regulator foresees greater alignment with the US on competition enforcement, particularly in the tech sector, amid a broader policy reorientation under the Biden administration, reported The Wall Street Journal. 
EU Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition commissioner, said she expects “much more intense work when it comes to technology and the digitized market” between her team and Washington.
President Biden’s policy statements and appointments, plus legislative proposals from Congress, indicate the US is moving closer to positions long held in the EU regarding internet giants, pharmaceutical firms and other industries with diminishing competition.
As the world’s two most powerful antitrust regulators, the US and the EU can shape global competition discourse and rein in many of the world’s largest companies, so greater cooperation could have significant impact.
For supporters of aggressive enforcement, “it will certainly be a marriage made in heaven,” said Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory LLP. “I think they’ll work hand in hand. Increased coordination makes enforcement stronger.”
That alignment will make it even more incumbent on companies in the crosshairs to develop broad, cross-Atlantic strategies on how to respond to that scrutiny, Mr. Jacobovitz said.
While tech companies say similar policies in multiple jurisdictions can simplify operations, some worry about the U.S. adopting some of Europe’s more aggressive positions.
“The U.S. should be wary of copying EU-style experimental regulation,” said Christian Borggreen, vice president and head of the Brussels office at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents companies including Amazon, Facebook and Google. “As a leader in tech innovation, the U.S. would have much more to lose if they get it wrong.”
Mr. Biden’s appointments of high-profile U.S. progressives who have criticized tech giants—Lina Khan to run the Federal Trade Commission, and Tim Wu to the White House Economic Council—have been widely seen as indicating that Mr. Biden plans to turn up the heat on internet conglomerates.

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the company “is on the right side of history” in the antitrust debates about whether big technology companies abuse user privacy and squash competition, reported Bloomberg. 
While Congress and U.S. regulators have clashed with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. over the companies’ business practices, Microsoft hasn’t received the same kind of scrutiny more than 20 years after it was sued by the U.S. Justice Department on antitrust issues.
The software company “makes sure” user privacy and internet safety are among its highest priorities for products “and then when it comes to competition, I mean you should go talk to the people who are investing a lot of capital and a lot of M&A competing with Microsoft and we welcome that,” Nadella said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
During the interview, the Microsoft CEO also spoke about cybersecurity threats, the future of remote work and the company’s rivalry with Alphabet’s Google.
Nadella said he is concerned about the wave of hacks in the past few months, which have included ransomware attacks that stopped business at a major pipeline company and food producer in the US.
“We have another real pandemic, which is a cyber” pandemic, he said. “The level of attacks for sure have increased, but the need for our response to be top notch has also increased. We just have to get better as an industry.”
Nadella also discussed tensions with Google, following the end of a five-year cease-fire between the two companies, which mutually agreed not to fuel legal lobbying efforts against one another. He said he “has a lot of respect” for Google and its leadership.
“We’re fighting the good fight to sort of compete against colossal lead in that space,” he said of digital advertising sales, which is led by Google and Facebook.
Nadella weighed in on Microsoft’s work-from-home policy, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and accommodating “changed expectations” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke with Bloomberg Television after appearing at Microsoft’s Inspire conference for partners, where the company among its announcements unveiled a cloud-based version of Windows aimed at remote workers.

888,"July 14, 2021",German Watchdog Tells EU To Broaden Draft Tech Regs,"


The German competition watchdog has advised pumping up draft regulations crafted by the European Union (EU), Financial Times reported Wednesday, July 14.
Andreas Mundt, head of the German watchdog said the EU draft regulations are “narrow” and might not be able to tap anti-competitive behaviors from technology companies like Google and Facebook, the article stated. Mundt called on Brussels to improve its Digital Markets Act away from targeting previous cases of abuse of dominance to mandate behavior.
Mundt is advocating for new mandates that have a “looser definition” of anti-competition laws and leave space for adopting anti-competitive best practices.
“I think the DMA is somewhat narrow,” Mundt said, per FT, claiming it copies past behaviors and “there might be new conduct that might be difficult to catch.”
EU proposals on the table aim to find out more about gatekeeper platforms. Gatekeeper platforms own the marketplaces where products and services are sold and have the leverage to determine rules of operation, per FT.
The EU proposals and regulators seek to prohibit big digital firms from preventing the use of alternative services and from abusing their power to give their products preferential treatment, according to the article. The European Commission has begun to regulate companies with large ecosystems. The Commission, for instance, has had three cases against Google since 2010 and has fined the company billions of dollars. Google, denying any implication that it has broken the law, is contesting the fines.
“The German law is broader and so easier to catch new strategies because the conduct from the past is given just as an example of the type of things that should be prohibited but it leaves space to identify new [anti-competitive] conduct,” Mundt said.

889,"July 11, 2021","A More Flexible, Effects Based Approach is Required if the DMA is to Foster Innovation and Protect the Value Platforms Offer","
By Felipe Florez Duncan & Gareth Shier1
 
In a recent “myth-busters” post on LinkedIn, Thierry Breton claims (in reference to the Digital Markets Act, “DMA”) that:
“We [the European Commission] address a list of clearly egregious practices by gatekeepers. Years of experience in investigations and research have shown that these types of behaviour are problematic. There is no need to spend years analysing their effects each time they take place: we have done it ex ante, once and for all.”
But is this really the case? Are all the practices targeted by the DMA so “clearly egregious” they require no further analysis? Or are there cases in which those same practices can offer benefits to society, warranting a closer examination of their specific effects rather than simply condemning them “once and for all”?
In a recent study,2 commissioned by the Computer and Communication Industry Association, we dug in to these questions to better understand how platforms create value for society and to ask whether certain of the practices being restricted by the DMA — namely bundling and tying, self-preferencing, and leveraging — can deliver benefits for consumers and business users in certain circumstances.
The study examines the academic literature on platform markets and management to shed light on how these practices are used by platforms to help create value for their users, and illustrates this with a large number of examples and case studies from both online and offline markets.
 
How Platforms Create Value
At their most basic level platforms act as intermediaries, connecting users to facilitate an interaction. In doing so, platforms are often characterized by what economists would call “positive network effects.” This simply means that as more people use the platform, the value to all users increases.
For example, if more people join a social network, each user enjoys more opportunities to make new connections; while if more buyers join an online marketplace, more sellers are incentivized to offer their goods and services for sale on that platform (and vice versa).
However, most modern-day digital platforms generate considerable value over and above their simple role as intermediaries. In particular, many platforms play active roles as:

aggregators: helping to unlock scale economies for businesses while reducing transaction costs, increasing quality and building trust with consumers; and/or
innovators: realizing economies of scope as they add new features and services that foster innovation and dynamic competition, both within and between digital ecosystems.

In both cases, we find that tying and bundling, self-preferencing and leveraging can be important tools for platforms as they seek to create value for their users.
 
Platforms as Aggregators
The bundling and tying of different features and services by platforms can boost economic efficiency in the market by: (i) making it easier and cheaper for consumers and business to trade; (ii) increasing choice for consumers; and (iii) helping businesses reduce costs through scale economies while avoiding infrastructure duplication. This can be observed both offline (for example, in the range of services offered by supermarkets) and online (such as with social media platforms or app stores).
Similarly, helping consumers find the products and content that are most relevant to them is a fundamental way in which platforms add value as aggregators. Both online and offline businesses can use self-preferencing to increase product discovery and choice for consumers, as well as to promote quality and build trust; while the leveraging of data helps them provide greater convenience through product personalisation and better matching users to the most relevant options for them.
Google Maps is an excellent example of how these different practices can come together to deliver significant aggregation benefits to consumers.
First, a range of additional Google services are bundled with Google Maps, such as user reviews, photos and navigation. This is highly convenient for consumers, can benefit business users (who may gain from increased trade), and gives Google greater confidence and control over the quality of the information it is providing.
Second, Google often uses its own mapping service to provide users with richer general search results. A detailed assessment by the UK High Court3 confirmed that the deep, cross-product integration enabled by this self-preferencing unlocked benefits for users that could not have been equaled by using third-party mapping services.
Finally, Google creates additional value by leveraging data and know how throughout its ecosystem. ​ Drawing on the same data — such as local business information — across multiple products ensures consistency for consumers and unlocks efficiencies for Google; while the use of personal data plays an important role in matching consumers to the most relevant search results and content for them.
 
Platforms as Innovators
For platform operators looking to compete with other digital ecosystems, self-preferencing can be an important tool to differentiate their service and offer meaningful choice to consumers. For example, while some consumers prefer a more “closed” ecosystem (because of the benefits that tighter end-to-end control over the services offered affords) others prefer a more “open” ecosystem with more choice of services but less guarantee of seamless interoperability.
The bundling and tying of additional features, tools or services can also serve to incentivize innovation and competition; both by platforms and by third parties on platforms. In either case, the platform’s users stand to benefit as the number of features and functionalities available to them grows. Similarly, both online and offline businesses can also leverage the data and know-how at their disposal to create new innovations that spur dynamic competition and challenge the status quo.
Apple Silicon (i.e. Apple’s new, in-house chipset that has been developed to power the next generations of Mac computers) is a neat example of how platforms can use each of these practices to facilitate innovation and competition between ecosystems.
First, Apple’s decision to self-supply processors for its Mac line has allowed performance gains from the closer integration of hardware and software. One of Apple’s key motivations for self-supplying their own chips over third-party alternatives was to give themselves more flexibility and agility when it comes to future CPU needs​​. This will allow Apple to be more innovative with its product development, increasing the differentiation and competition between Macs and Windows computers.​
Second, the switch to Apple Silicon has also offered a level of standardization that helps support innovation on the platform by third-party developers​​. Prior to Apple Silicon, developers wishing to offer apps across the Apple ecosystem had to build and maintain separate macOS and iOS apps​​. In contrast, as Apple Silicon leveraged the know-how developed from building chips for iOS devices, developers can now create universal apps and/or port their iOS apps to Mac by making some relatively simple tweaks to the existing code​​. Apple’s hope is that the large and active iOS developer community can quickly and easily build and maintain more apps for macOS​ — increasing the competitiveness of the Mac platform while benefiting all Mac users.​
 
Implications for the DMA  
Our study has shown that platforms are not just neutral intermediaries helping users reach and/or interact with each other. Rather, platforms also take an active role in the creation, design and governance of the markets in which they operate In doing so, they are often able to stimulate competition and create value for their users by engaging in many of the practices that are under the scope of the DMA.
As such, we find limited support for the contention that there is “no need to [analyze the] effects” of these practices, as claimed by Mr. Breton. Instead, we recommend that the DMA should develop a more flexible, effects-based approach which provides greater room for the tailoring of proportionate and effective remedies in their specific market context.
This could include strengthening the role of the regulatory dialogue process envisaged in the DMA and providing a clear route to appeal decisions “on the merits” to specialist courts. Similar provisions already exist in the European telecoms regulatory framework, and are also being considered in the recent proposals from the UK’s Digital Markets Taskforce,4 and as affirmative defenses in some U.S. proposals.
Fast-moving digital markets require equally nimble regulatory authorities to oversee them. However, speed of action must not come at the cost of evidence-led market analyses, unless we are to risk jeopardizing the benefits digital markets have to offer.

890,"July 7, 2021",House Republicans Release Their Big Tech Antitrust Agenda,"


House Judiciary Committee Republicans led by Ranking Member Jim Jordan (Republican – Ohio) laid out their framework for regulating Big Tech companies on Wednesday, July 7.
According to CNBC, the document is meant as a roadmap for new legislation aimed at Big Tech power, according to a Republican aide. The proposals, if passed, could have significant impact on large platforms including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.
The framework comes just weeks after the Committee voted to advance six bipartisan antitrust bills after more than 20 hours of debate. The markup session revealed that members in both parties have doubts about the effectiveness and the potential side effects of the bills. While the bills advanced with bipartisan support, they will not make it to a floor vote anytime soon. Once they do, they could look much different.
Any new proposed legislation from Republicans could face an uphill battle, especially if it includes politically touchy issues like alleged censorship of conservatives voices on social media. But it could also reveal areas of overlap between even the most skeptical Republicans on the committee and Democrats pushing for antitrust reform.
The agenda is broken into three parts: speed, accountability, and transparency.
The first, speed, is the most likely of the three to gain bipartisan support. For example, one item on in this category seems to follow the same line of thought as an existing antitrust bill passed by the committee last month. The bill would give state attorneys general more say over where their antitrust cases can be heard. The Republican agenda released Wednesday calls for empowering state AGs, though specifically by giving them the ability to fast-track cases.
But the proposals laid out under “Accountability” and “Transparency” may be a tougher sell to Democrats. Under those categories, Republicans included reforming tech’s legal liability shield, Section 230, which is under the jurisdiction of a different committee. Although there is bipartisan desire for reforming that law, Democrats and Republicans have remained deeply divided over how to do so since they view the issues with the law quite differently.
Republicans suggest giving individuals the ability to “directly challenge Big Tech in court for its censorship and silencing of conservatives,” according to the agenda. They also propose requiring Big Tech companies engaged in content moderation to publicly disclose their decisions to remove of posts online.

Leni PAPA:
Good day everyone.
I am Leni Papa from the OECD competition division, and it is my great pleasure to be your moderator for today’s conference on “Regulating online platforms: A Balanced Approach to  South Korea”, organized by Competition Policy International and Sogang University, the ICT Law and Economy Research Institute in cooperation with Asia Competition Association and Seoul National University’s Competition Law Center.
So as the title suggests, we are going to talk about digital platforms today, and we know that digital platforms connect users and enable easier business transactions. It has enabled the creation of new markets and reshaped existing ones.
But we also know that these platforms benefit from strong network effects that they generate and the significant economies of scale and scope that they have. These characteristics of digital platforms have led to market dynamics that have attracted the attention of competition, enforcement entities, and policymakers around the world, including South Korea.
So we have today a discussion including a number of jurisdictions, proposing various solutions in an attempt to find a balanced approach towards the regulation of onlin...

895,"July 1, 2021",How to Tame the Tech Giants: Reverse the Burden of Proof in Merger Reviews,"
By: Tomasso Valletti (Pro Market)
As you read this, please remember two numbers: 1,000 and zero. The former number represents the 1,000 acquisitions made by GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) in the past 20 years. The latter is the number of those acquisitions actually blocked by regulators worldwide. 
Mergers and acquisitions have directly increased market concentration across Europe and the US, including in brewing, supermarkets, hospitals, car rentals, eyeglasses, crop seeds, industrial chemicals, meat packing, wireless carriers, and many others. Detailed studies document a rise in concentration and market power, a decline in the rate of new firms entering markets, and a fall in labor’s share of economic output.
When I was Chief Competition Economist at the European Commission from 2016-2019, I found myself in an unbalanced tug of war. My team of 30 (really excellent) economists, supervising the economic analysis of every major merger, antitrust, and state aid case in Europe, faced dominant companies that could hire any number of lawyers against us. They paid an army of consultancies to create doubt around an issue, while the burden of proof was on us to dismiss their claims. This burden was made worse by asymmetric information: the companies had all the incentives to hide vast amounts of information from us and use it selectively to create more obfuscating smoke.
As we tried to build our cases, the dominant companies bogged us down in endless, esoteric arguments about definitions of markets and other matters. This has a long history. When Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, for instance, the discussion between the enforcers and the parties ultimately revolved around the “supply of photo apps,” which would be of limited interest to advertisers because “eyeballs are not on the app for a significant period of time” and “limited user data is captured.”  Of 8,000 cases analyzed by the European Commission since 1990, only 30 have been prohibited…

896,"July 1, 2021",New U.S. Antitrust Legislation Before Congress Must Mandate an Anticompetitive Presumption for Acquisitions of Nascent Potential Competitors by Dominant Firms,"
By: Steven C. Salop (Washington Center for Equitable Growth)
The current U.S. economy is increasingly characterized by dominant firms controlling digital platforms. One way that dominant networks maintain or even increase their power is by acquiring nascent or potential competitors that otherwise might become significant competitors by themselves or by joining with other rivals. Now, there is legislation before Congress to correct past anticompetitive presumptions by dominant firms. Reining in acquisitions by these burgeoning monopolies in the digital arena is important to U.S. economic competitiveness and innovation.
Most of the discussion about digital monopolies focus on Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., but there are other digital platforms with substantial market power. In air travel, Sabre Corp. is the dominant platform that connects airlines and travel agents. In auto repair, CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. is the dominant platform that connects the auto industry’s original equipment manufacturers and other parts suppliers and repair shops. There are many credit-card-issuing banks, but only three major credit card networks (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express), and the networks’ rules make it impossible for merchants to negotiate lower fees with the card-issuing banks or each other. 
Viewpoints on these anticompetitive market conditions largely support greater antitrust scrutiny. Various commentators—including the University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ Stigler Report, Carl Shapiro at the University of California, Berkeley’s Hass School of Business, and me—recommend that there be increased enforcement in this area.

897,"July 1, 2021",Addressing Big Tech’s power over speech,"
By: Bill Baer & Caitlin Chin (Brookings Institution)
At many points during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, social media platforms demonstrated their power over speech. Twitter decided to ban political advertisements permanently in October 2019, sparking a vigorous debate over free speech and so-called “paid disinformation.” One year later, Facebook and Google imposed temporary restrictions on political ads shortly after the polls closed. In May 2020, Twitter assigned fact-check labels to two misleading tweets from then-President Donald J. Trump about mail-in ballots; Facebook initially refused to follow, but later adopted its own fact-checking policy for politicians.
In June 2020, Twitter, for the first time, “hid” one of President Trump’s tweets that appeared to call for violence against Black Lives Matter protesters. Facebook chose to leave the post up. Ultimately, after the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, all three platforms suspended Trump’s account. In the days that followed President Trump’s suspension, online misinformation about election fraud dropped almost 75 percent across multiple platforms.
These events demonstrate the ability of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and others to amplify—or limit—the dissemination of information to their hundreds of millions of users. Although we applaud the steps these companies eventually took to counter political misinformation and extremism during the election cycle, their actions are also a sobering reminder of their power over our access to information. Raw power comes with the possibility of abuse—absent guardrails, there is no guarantee that dominant platforms will always use it to advance public discourse in the future.
Some leaders have suggested using antitrust law to limit the power of social media companies. U.S. Representative David Cicilline (D-R.I.) echoed this sentiment in a House Antitrust Subcommittee hearing last summer by accusing Facebook of “getting away” with disseminating misinformation because it is “the only game in town.” He continued by noting that, for social media giants, “there is no competition forcing you to police your own platform”…CONTINUE READING…

898,"June 30, 2021",Antitrust Ruling On Facebook’s Kustomer Buy Expected By August ,"


Facebook’s fate in terms of its acquisition of US customer service startup Kustomer will be decided by antitrust officials soon, US News reported.
The deal was intended to help scale up the social media company’s WhatsApp, which saw a new spate of usage in the pandemic. It was announced late in 2020.
But with antitrust concerns being paramount these days, EU antitrust regulators want to look more closely at deals with tech, pharma and biotech startups.
They’re looking out for warning signs of “killer acquisitions” in which big companies buy out rivals to squash competition — something Facebook has been accused of before. Austria had asked the EU to take over the review. Now, the Commission can either clear the deal or decide that a four-month investigation would be prudent.
Earlier this year, Facebook hit a market cap of US$1 trillion, with that making it the fifth company — following Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet — to gain the distinction.
The revenue for Facebook is almost entirely the result of personal ads that Facebook users see when scrolling the popular social media site, along with companies it owns like Instagram.
The company has some new ideas in the pipeline, including a video-calling device and new virtual reality headsets from Oculus, with smart glasses slated to be released later in 2021.

899,"June 29, 2021",The NCAA: A Cartel in Sheepskin Clothing,"
In spite of enjoying substantial commercial success, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) continues to limit the compensation of student-athletes through collusive monopsonistic restraints. The NCAA benefits from an antitrust exemption that can be traced to the Board of Regents (468 U.S. 85 (1984)) decision in 1984. In this paper, we examine the NCAA’s unique buyer cartel operation when antitrust attack is no longer a concern, including its organization structure and implementation of a wide array of restrictions. We further analyze the vitality of the antitrust exemption and the NCAA’s recent antitrust challenges.

By Roger D. Blair & Wenche Wang1

I. INTRODUCTION
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a 1200-member cartel that exercises considerable monopsony power in the market for collegiate athletes. Ordinarily, buyer cartels are unlawful per se, but the NCAA enjoys a peculiar antitrust exemption when it comes to its employment of collegiate athletes. This exemption can be traced to the Supreme Court’s misguided decision in its Board of Regents opinion.2 As a result of this antitrust exemption, the NCAA cartel operates openly for all the world to see. Since its operations need not be clandestine, organizing and implementing the cartel is less complicated. Moreover, since the cartel rules are spelled out in its Operations Manual, cartel communication is facilitated.3

900,"June 29, 2021",Antitrust & Privacy: It’s Complicated,"


By James C. Cooper & John M. Yun (George Mason University)
Privacy and antitrust are on a collision course. Increasingly, privacy practices of large digital platforms are coming under antitrust scrutiny. It has become almost an article of faith that zero-price platforms exercise market power by offering lower levels of privacy. Yet, a rigorous examination of the assumptions underlying this data-price analogy is seriously lacking. Even more important, there is almost no empirical work that has been done in this area. This Article contributes to the debate by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between market power and privacy. First, we examine the privacy grade for each app in the Android App marketplace (covering the 2014-15 period)—as well as metrics that measure the number of users and app quality. These data suggest no relationship between privacy grades and measures of market concentration, that is, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and market shares based on Google Play store categories. Second, we collected website traffic data from SimilarWeb and matched it to DuckDuckGo’s privacy ratings for sites in thirty-seven website categories. Again, the data suggest a lack of a reliable relationship between privacy ratings and market concentration. The theoretical analysis and empirical results cast doubt on the notion that firms exercise market power by reducing privacy levels.

901,"June 28, 2021",White House Reportedly Working On Executive Order On Antitrust,"


The White House is said to be developing an executive order that will ask government agencies to consider antitrust concerns in decision making, Reuters reported, citing White House spokesperson Emilie Simons.
The order goes after corporate monopolies across a broad swath of industries ranging from banking to airlines, one of the sources said.
The drive comes as House lawmakers are moving forward with sweeping antitrust legislation aimed at restraining the power of Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple and staving off corporate consolidation. 
It was not immediately clear how such an order would aid those efforts on Capitol Hill and rein in the power of large tech companies that have thrived for years without much regulation.
One of the sources described the order as “well developed” and said it builds on a 2016 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Both sources said it is being worked on by former Obama administration officials who now work for President Joe Biden.
White House spokesperson Emilie Simons did not comment on specific details, but said the president made clear during his campaign that he is committed to increasing competition in the American economy, including banning noncompete agreements for workers and protecting farmers from abusive practices.
“There is no final decision on any actions at this time,” she said.

902,"June 28, 2021",Rep. McCarthy Unveils Plans For Big Tech “Stop The Bias” Legislation,"
House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, unveiled plans over the weekend to hold Big Tech companies accountable for what he described as “conservative censorship” and anticompetitive practices, reported the New York Post.
In a letter to fellow Republicans on Sunday, McCarthy outlined plans that would curb existing legal protections for companies like Twitter if they censor content, while also making it easier for state attorneys general to bring antitrust actions against tech behemoths like Google and Amazon if they break the law.
“For the sake of preserving free speech and a free economy, it’s time Big Tech faces the music,” McCarthy wrote. “House Republicans are ready to lead.”
The GOP leader pointed to 2018, when conservative figures such as Rep. Devin Nunes (Republican – California) and Donald Trump Jr. were “shadow banned” on Twitter, while Google search results for “California Republicans” compared them to Nazis.
“Since then, the examples of conservative censorship and bias across internet platforms has proliferated,” the letter stated. “Each one of you are all too familiar with how Big Tech and its overwhelmingly liberal executives want to set the agenda and silence conservatives.”
Regarding accountability, McCarthy wrote in his letter that his group’s proposal would include Section 230 reform, referring to a provision of the Communications Decency Act, which provides a legal shield to tech companies for content on their websites.
Section 230, McCarthy wrote, “would be changed to limit liability protections for moderation of speech that is not protected by the First Amendment and would preclude Big Tech from discriminating against Americans based on their political affiliation.”
“We would also require regular reauthorization of Section 230 so Congress may update regulations of the constantly-evolving internet landscape.”
On transparency, McCarthy wrote that his bill will require social media platforms to list their content moderation or censorship practices, “with specificity, on a publicly available website.”
“[B]y requiring Big Tech to implement and maintain a reasonable user-friendly appeals process, our plan will empower conservatives and others whose speech rights have been infringed to challenge Big Tech’s attacks,” the letter added.

Australia’s competition watchdog is looking into a claim that Facebook refused a publisher’s request to negotiate a licensing deal, according to The New York Post, setting the stage for the first test of the world’s toughest online content law.
The Conversation, which publishes current affairs commentary by academics, said it asked Facebook to begin talks as required under new Australian legislation that requires the social media firm and Alphabet’s Google to negotiate content-supply deals with media outlets.
Facebook declined without giving a reason, The Conversation said, even though the publisher was among the first in Australia to secure a similar deal with Google in the lead-up to the law in 2020.
The knockback could present the first test of a controversial mechanism unique to Australia’s effort to claw back advertising dollars from Google and Facebook: If they refuse to negotiate license fees with publishers, a government-appointed arbitrator may step in.
In a statement responding to Reuters’ questions, Facebook’s head of news partnerships for Australia, Andrew Hunter, said the company was “focused on concluding commercial deals with a range of Australian publishers.”
Hunter did not answer specific questions concerning The Conversation, but said Facebook was planning a separate initiative “to support regional, rural and digital Australian newsrooms and public-interest journalism in the coming months,” without giving details.

904,"June 24, 2021",The Globalization of Antitrust: History and Prospects,"


By Alden F. Abbott (George Mason University)
The United States stood virtually alone when it enacted its first antitrust statute in 1890. Today, almost all nations have adopted competition laws (the term used in most other nations), and US antitrust agencies interact with foreign enforc-ers on a daily basis. This globalization of antitrust is becoming increasingly important to the economic welfare of many nations, because major businesses (in particular, massive digital platforms like Google and Facebook) face grow-ing antitrust scrutiny by multiple enforcement regimes worldwide. As such, the United States should take the lead in encouraging adoption of antitrust policies, here and abroad, that are conducive to economic growth and innovation. Anti-trust policies centered on promoting consumer welfare would be best suited to advancing these desirable aims. Thus, the United States should oppose recent efforts to turn antitrust into a regulatory system that seeks to advance many objectives beyond consumer welfare. American antitrust enforcers should also work with like-minded agencies—and within multilateral organizations such as the International Competition Network and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—to promote procedural fairness and the rule of law in antitrust enforcement.

905,"June 24, 2021",US Lawmakers Advance “Break Up” Antitrust Bill ,"
The House Judiciary Committee narrowly advanced a sixth and final piece of legislation that has been dubbed the “break up” bill, on the notion that it ultimately could lead to tech giants shedding assets or splitting in two. US lawmakers advanced the “Break Up” antitrust bill on Thursday, June 24. 
The bill, the Ending Platform Monopolies Act, which passed 21-20, would prohibit major tech platforms from selling product lines that they own and control, reported Reuters.
The bill is aimed at rooting out conflicts of interest that arise when a company like Amazon sells its own lines of products on its platform, giving it the incentive to disadvantage rivals. It also could pose a problem for Google, which ranks videos on its search engine, and also operates YouTube.
Over the span of 29 hours, the Judiciary Committee also passed five other bills, including one that prohibits major tech companies from discriminatory conduct, and another that requires that platforms make user data portable.
The support and opposition was not along party lines. The Ending Platform Monopolies Act was opposed by four Democrats, including Rep. Zoe Lofgren (Democrat -CA), Rep. Eric Swalwell (Democrat – California), Rep. Lou Correa (Democrat – California) and Rep. Greg Stanton (Democrat – Arizona). Two Republicans, Rep. Ken Buck (Republican – Colorado) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (Republican – Florida), joined with the rest of the Democrats to support the bill.
The legislation now faces a close vote in the full House, although it is unclear when the legislation would get to the floor.
On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters, “There have been concerns on both sides of the aisle about the consolidation of power of the tech companies, and this legislation is an attempt to address that.”
She confirmed a New York Times report that Apple CEO Tim Cook called her to warn her of the potential harms of the legislation.
Pelosi indicated that she told Cook that “Congress will work its will,” and that if Apple has “substantive concerns, and they have members that have voted with them on this, they can put forth what they want to put forth. But we are not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened, and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.”
Rep. David Cicilline (Democrat – Rhode Island), who along with Buck led the push for the legislation, said that he did not think that the bills would impact Amazon’s planned purchase of MGM, or platform streaming services in general.

On Wednesday, June 23, the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved five antitrust bills, three of them aimed at Big Tech, and took up the last and most aggressive proposed legislation on Thursday. This last is a bill that could require platforms to sell off lines of business.
The debate was extended and began midmorning on Wednesday and stretched into early on Thursday, lawmakers voted to approve a measure that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from disadvantaging rivals who use their platform.
According to Reuters, it also voted to accept a measure that would require big tech companies contemplating mergers to show that they are legal, rather than requiring antitrust enforcers to prove that they are not.
Jerrold Nadler, Committee Chairman said the bills were needed to protect an open internet that has “delivered enormous benefits to Americans and our economy.”
“A small set of online platforms have become gatekeepers for much of the digital marketplace,” he said. “These dominant platforms can have the incentive and ability to abuse their market power to pick winners and losers among the firms that rely on their platforms to reach users and customers.”
When the committee resumes work, it will take up what some call the “break ’em up” bill. This would require a platform, again like Amazon, to sell any business that competes with other businesses using its platform.
There has been vociferous opposition to that bill and others, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.
The committee also approved a bill that would increase the budgets of the agencies enforcing antitrust law. A companion measure has already passed the Senate.
The panel additionally approved measures to require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere and to ensure that antitrust cases brought by state attorneys general remain in the court they select.

The US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday, June 23, to approve a bill to increase the budgets of antitrust enforcers and increase fees on the biggest mergers as the panel considered six antitrust bills, many aimed at reining in Big Tech.
According to Reuters, Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in an opening statement called the bills a “historic package of bipartisan legislation” aimed at “reining in anticompetitive abuses of the most dominant firms online.”
After more than three hours of discussion, the committee voted 29-12 to approve a measure to sharply increase the budgets of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law. It would also increase the filing fees for the biggest mergers.
The panel also voted 34-7 to approve a bill that would ensure that antitrust cases brought by state attorneys general remain in the court they select.
The committee then began discussion of a bill that would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere.
There has been a flurry of opposition to the most sweeping reform bills, including from the powerful US Chamber of Commerce, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.
The companies spent nearly the past two years under federal, state, and congressional investigation into how they use their clout to fend off competition, extend their dominance into adjacent markets or abuse their dominance.
Of the remaining bills, two bills address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon and Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses. One would require the competing business to be sold while the other would require platforms to refrain from favoring their own businesses.
Another would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it could show the acquired company does not compete with it.

German and French antitrust watchdogs and their counterparts in the other 25 EU countries on Wednesday, June 23, argued for a bigger role in enforcing proposed tough new rules reining in Alphabet unit Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA), proposed by the European Commission last year, targets online gatekeepers – companies that control data and access to their platforms – which thousands of businesses and millions of Europeans rely on for their work or social interactions.
Under the draft legislation, three or more EU countries can ask the EU competition regulator to open an investigation while a digital markets advisory committee made up of national representatives will be consulted on fines and non-compliance, reported Reuters. 
The national antitrust agencies stated that giving them a bigger role in enforcement would make the DMA more effective and future-proof.
“These authorities have accumulated the highest level of expertise within the digital economy with respect to the practices of digital platforms which affect fair and open competition in their respective ecosystems,” the watchdogs stated.
“Enforcement powers could be shared, under the supervision of DG COMP, with national competition authorities, when appropriate,” they stated, referring to the Commission’s competition unit.
The agencies also asked for the power to start investigations on the basis of the DMA or called on to help during dawn raids.
France has slapped millions of euros in fines on Google and Apple in the last two years for anti-competitive practices while the German antitrust authority, beefed up with new powers, opened investigations into Apple, Google, and Amazon in the last two months.

909,"June 23, 2021",Report: Big Tech Antitrust Bills Could Hurt Small Businesses,"
Antitrust efforts are gaining traction on Capitol Hill, and tech giants Google and Amazon stated those efforts are likely to hurt smaller businesses, CNBC reported.
“As many groups and companies have observed, the bills would require us to degrade our services and prevent us from offering important features used by hundreds of millions of Americans,” Google Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Policy Mark Isakowitz said, per CNBC. “This would all dramatically undermine US technology leadership, damage the way small businesses connect with consumers, and raise serious privacy and security concerns. We respectfully recommend that these consequences receive more thoughtful consideration before Congress takes action.”
There are six bills up for consideration, according to CNBC. Two of them could lead to break-ups or at least structural changes in the companies as they cite prohibitions on business types with conflicts of interest or rules against discriminatory business practices.
Some of the others would bolster the strength of regulators in antitrust proceedings by making the burden of proof in merger cases fall on the dominant platform, raising filing fees, and allowing state attorneys general more prominent voices in those types of cases, CNBC reported.
In addition, another bill would let customers take their personal data with them and make it easier for customers to switch platforms, according to CNBC.
Those bills only apply to ...

On Tuesday, June 22, the US Chamber of Commerce criticized antitrust legislation set to be considered this week by a US House of Representatives committee, claiming the bills would have “dangerous consequences for America.”
According to Reuters, the largest US business group stated “antitrust laws should not be rigged against a small number of companies. Such an approach punishes success and has the government picking winners and losers in our free market economy.”
The US House Judiciary Committee will vote on Wednesday on a package of antitrust bills, including several targeting the market power of Big Tech.
Two of the bills address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon and Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses. A third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in.
For its part, Amazon’s Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy, said on Tuesday that the company believed that the bills “would have significant negative effects on the hundreds of thousands of American small- and medium-sized businesses that sell in our store, and tens of millions of consumers who buy products from Amazon.”
“The committee is moving unnecessarily fast in pushing these bills forward,” added Husemen. “We encourage Chairman (David) Cicilline and committee members to slow down, postpone the markup, and thoroughly vet the language in the bills for unintended negative consequences.”
Five of the six bills to be considered on Wednesday were introduced to the House on Friday.

911,"June 22, 2021",Amazon’s $6.4B MGM Acquisition Probed By FTC,"
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be the agency to review Amazon’s proposed acquisition of Hollywood studio MGM, the Wall Street Journal. Amazon’s US$6.4 billion MGM deal was announced in May.  
Amazon announced its deal for MGM, which would boost its Prime Video streaming platform in a market that includes rivals such as Netflix and Walt Disney MGM has a library of more than 4,000 films, including the James Bond franchise, and a TV catalog that includes “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Vikings.”
Companies doing sizable mergers have to submit their deals for government antitrust review. The FTC shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, and the two agencies split up the work of reviewing proposed deals. The Department has recently reviewed transactions involving video content, including Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox and AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, a deal the Department unsuccessfully attempted to block in court.
During recent interagency negotiations, the FTC secured the right to review Amazon’s US$6.4 billion MGM deal, the people familiar with the matter said. The FTC pushed for jurisdiction over the merger review because it already has an open, wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Amazon’s business practices, the people said.
The FTC and the Justice Department previously agreed to divide up investigations of four leading tech giants’ conduct, with the Department taking Google and Apple, while the FTC took Facebook and Amazon.
The MGM review could present an early test for new FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan, who made her name in antitrust circles in large part by criticizing Amazon. She wrote a widely read law-review article while at Yale Law School that argued US antitrust law has failed to restrain the online retailer.
Amazon is a growing producer of its own video content and has become an aggressive buyer of sports rights including those for the National Football League. But it still has a relatively modest library compared with traditional media giants.
MGM is now one of the smaller studios in Hollywood, meaning the tie-up isn’t necessarily the kind of transaction that in the past would have raised immediate red flags about anticompetitive concentration. But in light of Amazon’s broader marketplace footprint, the addition of MGM could raise concerns about the expansion of the online giant’s platform, which critics in Washington already believe is too powerful.

Thirteen organizations, many allied with high-tech companies, wrote to the US House Judiciary Committee on Monday, June 21, urging lawmakers to vote against two of the most far-reaching antitrust bills that the Committee will discuss this week.
The two bills – one introduced by Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, and the other by Representative Pramila Jayapal – address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
Cicilline’s bill would ban platforms from giving advantages to their businesses while Jayapal would ban platforms from competing on their own platform.
The groups stated that Cicilline’s bill would bar Google from including YouTube videos in search results and block Apple from pre-installing “Find My Phone” on new iPhones. They argued that Jayapal’s bill would force companies like Google to sell Maps, YouTube, and other free services.
“We believe that voters want Congress to fix things that are broken – not break or ban things that they feel are working well,” the groups.
Among the 13 signatories were the Chamber of Progress, Computer and Communications Industry Association, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, and NetChoice.

Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany’s antitrust watchdog on Monday, June 21, after the cartel office announced that it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position, reported Reuters.
The Bonn-based watchdog stated that it will examine whether Apple has “paramount significance across markets” that thwarts competition.
“A key focus of the investigation will be the operation of the App Store, as in many cases it empowers Apple to influence the operations of third parties,” said Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO).
The watchdog has made use of enhanced powers gained under recent reforms to Germany’s competition laws to open investigations into Alphabet’s Google, Facebook, and Amazon over their data practices. 
Further proceedings against Apple are also being considered with regard to complaints received about potentially anti-competitive practices, the watchdog said.
These include a complaint that Apple gives itself preferential treatment by pre-installing its own applications, the watchdog stated.
An Apple spokesperson said the company’s App Store has given German developers of all sizes the same opportunity.
“We look forward to discussing our approach with the FCO and having an open dialogue about any of their concerns,” the spokesperson added.

914,"June 20, 2021",Data Sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook: The CCI Opens an Investigation Against the Social Juggernauts,"

By Parumita Pal and Hrishav Kumar*
 
Introduction 
The switch from traditional brick-and-mortar business models to rapidly a evolving digital mode of doing business has impacted the way the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) has been looking at cases involving data privacy and protection issues. The decisions by the CCI in the past few years indicate how the CCI has been slowly acclimatizing itself to these changing markets. Particularly with regard to competition cases involving WhatsApp as a party, the paradigm shift in the CCI’s decisional practice is evident.
  
Can the CCI Regulate Data Sharing and Privacy Concerns?
Earlier in June 2017 the CCI examined allegations of abuse of dominance against WhatsApp. It was alleged that WhatsApp’s privacy policy, updated in 2016, compels its users to share their data with Facebook. However, in dismissing the allegations the CCI observed that users were provided with the option to opt out of sharing user account information with Facebook within 30 days of the updated terms coming into operation. On the allegations of a breach of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) and right to privacy, the CCI observed that violations of the IT Act do not fall within its purview.1
Interestingly, in August 2020, the CCI noted that Facebook and WhatsApp undeniably deal with sensitive data which is amenable to misuse (i.e., through targeted advertisement) and may raise potential antitrust concerns, among other data protection issues.  However, in absence of any concrete accusation or specific information, the case against WhatsApp was dismissed with respect to the allegation of misuse of consumer data.2
In June3 and November4 2020, while analyzing two combinations involving prominent players, the CCI noted that business combinations between entities having access to user data can be analyzed from the perspective of data-backed market power. Be that as it may, both combinations were approved by the CCI with a caveat that any anticompetitive conduct resulting from data sharing could be taken up under enforcement provisions (i.e., Section 3 and Section 4) of the Competition Act, 2002 (“Competition Act”).
Notably, the CCI in its E-commerce Report and Telecom Report had highlighted some data related issues that may raise competition concerns. The Market Study on E-commerce in India (“E-commerce report”) observed the intermediary role of the platform which allows it to collect and leverage competitively relevant data to enhance the quality of their platform and either introduce their own private label or boost its ‘preferred seller’.5
Recently, in March 2021 the CCI ordered a suo moto investigation against WhatsApp and Facebook (“WhatsApp Privacy Policy Case”). The CCI observed that WhatsApp through its updated privacy policy has made it mandatory for its users to accept the new terms and privacy policy including sharing their data with Facebook. Thereby, the CCI formed a prima facie opinion that the ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ nature of WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy and terms of service appear to be unfair for WhatsApp’s users, and accordingly ordered a detailed investigation. Notably, the CCI also observed that cross-linking and data integration can strengthen the data advantage, as well as safeguarding and reinforcing the market power of dominant firms. Further, for Facebook collecting data from WhatsApp can be a means to supplement the consumer profiling that Facebook engages in across a vast number of locations and devices outside the Facebook platform. Thus, the CCI observed that the impugned data sharing provision may have exclusionary effects in the display advertising market, which has the potential to undermine the competitive process and create entry barriers other than leveraging.6
  
Is the CCI Stepping Beyond Its Jurisdiction?
The WhatsApp Privacy Policy Case also dealt with issues challenging the jurisdiction of the CCI in matters concerning data. The case has surely raised certain doubts as to whether the CCI has jurisdiction to deal with data-related matters in the absence of any data regulator.
Interestingly, in its Market Study on the Telecom Sector in India (“Telecom Report”) the CCI observed that while overlapping jurisdictions between institutions cannot be eliminated, they ought to be harmonized through better regulatory design and improved lines of communication.7
The legislature had foreseen such issues and included inbuilt safeguards to deal with such issues. While Section 60 of the Competition Act contains a non-obstante clause and expressly provides that the provisions of the Competition Act will have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law, Section 62 expressly provides that. The Competition Act would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law.
Nevertheless, WhatsApp and Facebook challenged the order of the CCI before the Delhi High Court (“DHC”). WhatsApp argued that since the judicial challenge to its updated privacy policy is already pending before the Supreme Court and the DHC, it is not proper for the CCI to consider the same issues in exercise of its suo moto powers under the Competition Act. Earlier in the Bharti Airtel case, the Supreme Court deferred the jurisdiction of the CCI until the Telecom Regulator of India examines and decided upon the factual and technical matrix of the case. However, the DHC limited the application of the Bharti Airtel case and upheld the jurisdiction of the CCI to adjudicate upon competition concerns pertaining to data collection and usage. It further observed that it would have been prudent for the CCI to have awaited the outcome of the petitions before the Supreme Court and the DHC. However, pending petitions before other courts cannot oust the jurisdiction of the CCI.8
Presently, the matter is pendente lite in the DHC and awaits consideration by the division bench. Needless to say, the case would leave behind a historic precedent for similar disputes on the subject.
  
Global Trends: Antitrust Wave Against the Big Techs?
‘Data’ is the new ‘profit’ and the global trends indicate that the antitrust regulators worldwide are well aware of it. In Europe, the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed two legislative proposals: The Digital Services Act (“DSA”) and the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”), as part of the European Digital Strategy. While the DMA governs gatekeeper online platforms and targets lack of competition in the digital market, the DSA governs online intermediaries and is essentially concerned with transparency and consumer protection.9 Meanwhile, in the United States, the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law released an investigation report on competition on digital markets. The report is the result of 16 months investigation launched against the Big 4 tech giants- Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.10
In particular, the Indian competition watchdog isn’t the first antitrust regulator to have initiated an investigation against WhatsApp over its new privacy policy. On January 11, the Turkish Competition Authority announced that it will launch an investigation against Facebook and WhatsApp to determine whether there’s been an abuse of market dominant position.11 Moreover, only last year on June 23, 2020, the (German) Federal Court of Justice held Facebook guilty of abusing its dominant position by sharing data across platforms without their users’ consent.12 Recently on March 24, 2021, the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf halted the proceedings and filed a request for a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Justice (‘ECJ’) thereby putting the ball in their court.13
 
Conclusion
It is evident from the trends indicated in this note that Antitrust enforcers around the world are becoming increasingly active in launching cases against the big tech companies. At the same time, many countries are actively enacting new privacy laws. Be that as it may, the trends beg the question: How is the intersection between data privacy laws and competition law going to affect the business community? Apart from ongoing proceedings against WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also issued a cautionary notice to WhatsApp to roll back its update in the privacy policy on May 18, 2021.14 Evidently, the Indian government is taking a hardline stance on the new updates, but WhatsApp is also giving a fair fight in the belief that their policy does not affect personal messages but only business communication, with users having an option to block businesses they want to interact with. However, there is very little certainty on how things are going to unfold for the Big Tech giants in the near future.

The US and EUn plan to cooperate more on technology regulation, industrial development, and bilateral trade following President Biden’s visit, in a bid to help Western allies better compete with China and Russia on developing and protecting critical and emerging technologies.
Central to the increased coordination will be a new high-level Trade and Technology Council (TTC) the two sides unveiled Tuesday, June 15. The aim of the TTC is to boost innovation and investment within and between the two allied economies, strengthen supply chains, and avert unnecessary obstacles to trade, among other tasks.
“You see the possibility for alignment,” said European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager in an interview.
In a sign of both sides’ aspirations for the council, it will be co-chaired on the US side by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. The EU side will be co-chaired the Ms. Vestager, the bloc’s top competition and digital-policy official, and fellow Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who handles trade.
As the EU’s top antitrust enforcer, Ms. Vestager has gained prominence for her cases against US tech giants including Apple, Google parent Alphabet, and Facebook. Former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump both said her policies unfairly targeted American companies.
Ms. Vestager has said her work doesn’t single out any nationality. The TTC, which is slated to hold its first meeting in the fall and oversee many working groups, will allow the EU and US to focus on cooperation, she said. Both sides stressed they would maintain regulatory autonomy within their respective legal systems.

Apple boss Tim Cook took aim on Wednesday at proposed European rules aimed at curbing the power of US tech giants, saying they could pose security and privacy risks to iPhones.
Cook, in his first public comments about the Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said parts were good but others were not. He said he feared the draft rules would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple’s App Store, or “side-loading”.
“You take an example here where I don’t think it’s in the best interest (of the user): the current DMA language that is being discussed would force side-loading on the iPhone,” the Apple CEO, speaking remotely, said at VivaTech, France´s biggest tech conference.
“And so this would be an ultimate way of getting apps onto the iPhone,” he said. “It would destroy the security of the iPhone, and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we’ve built into the App Store or the privacy intrusion labels and app-tracking transparency,” he added.
Earlier this month, EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who is leading the European Parliament scrutiny of the draft rules, said he wanted to beef up the legislation and narrow its scope to just big companies like Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook.

917,"June 16, 2021",US House Panel To Vote On Antitrust Bills Next Week,"


The US House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel next week will begin reviewing five recently introduced antitrust bills including several targeting the market power of Big Tech, Committee chair Jerry Nadler said on Wednesday.
Five antitrust bills were introduced last week in the House of Representatives. They will be marked up in committee to consider changes and then voted on by the panel to decide whether the full House should vote on the measures.
Two of the bills introduced last week address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet  Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
These bills — one of which would force companies to sell businesses — have attracted the most opposition. Some pro-tech groups have said they could mean the end of popular promotions like Amazon Prime free shipping and iMessage in iPhones.
A third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in. A fourth would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere if they desire, including to a competing business.
The House members also introduced a fifth bill which is a companion to a Klobuchar measure that has already passed the Senate and would increase the budgets of antitrust enforcers and make companies planning the biggest mergers pay more. Observers have said that this bill was the most likely of the five to become law.

Lina Khan was sworn in today as Chair of the Federal Trade Commission. President Biden named Khan, a Democrat, to a term on the Commission that expires September 25, 2024, and designated her as Chair. Khan was confirmed by the US Senate on June 15, 2021.
“It is a tremendous honor to have been selected by President Biden to lead the Federal Trade Commission,” said Chair Khan. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the public from corporate abuse. I’m very grateful to Acting Chairwoman Slaughter for her outstanding stewardship of the Commission.”
Prior to becoming Chair of the FTC, Khan was an Associate Professor of Law at Columbia Law School. She also previously served as counsel to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, legal adviser to FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, and legal director at the Open Markets Institute.
In her new role, Ms. Khan will lead efforts to regulate the kind of behavior highlighted for years by critics of Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. She told a Senate committee in April that she was worried about the way tech companies could use their power to dominate new markets. The agency is investigating Amazon, which Ms. Khan has been highly critical of, and filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook last year.
Khan became a well-known figure in antitrust circles after writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” for the Yale Law Review in 2017, while a student at the university. The paper made the case for using a different framework for evaluating competitive harm than the popular consumer welfare standard. That standard essentially says that antitrust law violations can be determined based on harm to consumers, which is often measured based on prices.
In the years since, Khan has become a recognized name among those in the field and a noted figure among progressives eager to see more expansive enforcement of antitrust laws. She participated in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, helping to compile the report from Democratic staff that found each held monopoly power.

920,"June 15, 2021",Interoperability: The Wrong Prescription for Platform Competition,"
In this paper we assess the potential effects of recent proposals to mandate interoperability as a competition remedy for digital platforms. We find that mandating interoperability for digital platforms may harm competition and innovation. Interoperability standards for digital platforms may reduce differentiation and result in fewer functionality options for users. Interoperability may also weaken platforms’ incentives to compete through innovation and pricing. Interoperability may discourage Schumpeterian competition and entrench incumbents. The process of establishing interoperability standards may result in excess inertia as well as inferior technology and design choices for standards. The benefits of interoperability for digital platforms may be relatively small when multihoming costs are low and there is a high degree of differentiation across platforms. We urge caution in adopting policies that would mandate interoperability for digital platforms as such policies may do far more harm than good.

Interoperability is the ability of different systems to work together by exchanging information.2 Recently, there have been a number of calls for mandating interoperability as a competition remedy for digital platforms.3 For example, the recent House of Representatives Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law majority staff report stated that, “in the absence of ...

Platforms, including vertically integrated platforms, are ubiquitous — both in the modern economy, and throughout history. While some such firms have managed to capture the popular imagination (and ire), there is good reason to expect self-preferencing by vertically integrated platforms is far more likely to benefit competition than to harm it. While there are limited cases in which self-preferencing could be harmful, existing antitrust laws are more than capable of addressing these situations. Finally, the proposed cures for a largely illusory problem are likely to inflict a great deal of harm, for little apparent gain. Antitrust enforcement involving platform self-preferencing should continue to follow the better course established by the existing legal and economic framework.

By D. Bruce Hoffman & Garrett D. Shinn1
 
Over the last few years, antitrust law has surged to an unusually prominent position in popular and political discourse — largely due to a chorus of claims that antitrust enforcement has been overly lax for close to half a century.2 Some of the loudest complaints target situations where a firm that offers a place for others to sell their products (a “platform”) decides that it’s going to sell its own products there as well — and sometimes gives its products an advantage.
This practice, frequently called “self-preferencing,” is often taken as a self-evident evil in need of a cure. Thus, Senator Elizabeth Warren colorfully used a base...

922,"June 15, 2021",The Unilateral Conduct Gap Sacrificing Interoperability and Innovation,"
The Sherman Act and related antitrust jurisprudence have proven flexible and capable of balancing competitive effects of virtually any kind of concerted conduct among two or more conspirators under the rule of reason. The same flexibility, however, is not available to plaintiffs seeking to remedy unilateral conduct — no matter how anticompetitive — except in very limited circumstances. The current U.S. antitrust framework overwhelmingly fails to reach anticompetitive, unilateral conduct by companies growing upwards of seventy percent in any well-defined product market. This unilateral conduct gap severely restricts the ability to protect interoperability and innovation, particularly with respect to complementary products that increase consumer welfare and choice. Congress should seize upon the rare cross-aisle support for modernizing antitrust legislation to create a new rule of reason cause of action to remedy anticompetitive unilateral conduct separate and apart from Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

I. INTRODUCTION
The recent focus on anticompetitive conduct in digital markets has exposed a fundamental limitation of U.S. antitrust legislation and jurisprudence: How do we rein in anticompetitive, unilateral conduct in emerging and adjacent markets by entities that may be dominant players in related markets, but might not have a monopoly share in the complementary market restrained by the conduct? The Sherman Act and rela...

As the concepts of network effects, tipping, and lock-in have grown in importance with the rise, growth, and current ubiquity of platforms, data analytics, and computer software in the modern economy, competition concerns have followed. Considered through the lens of competition policy generally and antitrust law specifically, interoperability emerges as an indispensable part of the answer to these competition concerns, but one that requires careful implementation to navigate the inevitable frictions with intellectual property, privacy, and other doctrines that rub up against antitrust and competition policy. To the extent courts, regulators, and policymakers contemplate interoperability as a cure for network effects and other market failures, they will need to think carefully about how to strike the balance between sacrificing privacy and mandating interoperability, using the right combination of antitrust and regulation.

Interoperability is increasingly recognized as a core legal and regulatory concept for the modern internet economy. This is befitting in light of the rise, growth, and current ubiquity of platforms, data analytics, and computer software in the economy, which have elevated the importance of the concepts of network effects, tipping, and lock-in.

Self-preferencing occurs when a firm unfairly modifies its operations to privilege its own, another firm’s, or a set of firms’ products or services. Extensive domestic and international investigations have confirmed that dominant technology corporations, like Google and Facebook, use self-preferencing to acquire, maintain, and entrench their dominant market position. This article will explain how self-preferencing can violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Part 2 of the article will discuss how Congress intended and designed the Sherman Act to prohibit unfair competition. Part 3 will detail the harmful and exclusionary effects of self-preferencing. Part 4 will explain how self-preferencing can violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act by analyzing the statute’s current legal framework, as determined by the Supreme Court, and the statute’s application to historical monopolization cases.

Self-preferencing occurs when a firm unfairly modifies its operations to privilege its own, another firm’s, or a set of firms’ products or services. For example, Google can manipulate its search rankings to favor its own shopping platform and prevent dependent (often rival) firms from obtaining visibility on its site.2 Exhaustive investigations into Google’s, Apple’s, Facebook’s, and Amazon’s (collectively, “GAFA’s”) operations by private and public institutions show the harms self-preferencing can cause to market participa...

As the world increasingly considers antitrust as a tool for governing and shaping large internet companies, we ask whether traditional antitrust analysis and remedies are well-suited to current regulatory challenges. We examine interoperability as a potential remedy, suggesting that a proper understanding of its objective and outcome is greater diversity of user experience and an increase in user agency rather than direct improvements in more traditional price or access metrics. Regulating interoperability from that perspective will involve practical challenges in balancing effectiveness with clarity of obligation. As a result, new models of co-regulatory governance including extensive engagement from all stakeholders should be explored.

Throughout the early days of the internet ecosystem, antitrust was rarely used as a means of investigating allegations of harm from a single company.2 In the late 2010s, that began to change. In the European Union, antitrust actions were brought against Google,3 Facebook,4 Apple,5 and Amazon;6 followed by the United States with federal and state antitrust suits against both Google7 and Facebook.8 Academic and government studies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union have now led to major legislative proposals: the Judiciary Committee report in the House of Representatives,9 the Final Report of the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK,10 and the EU’s Digital Markets ...

According to 9to5mac, the latest big tech antitrust hearing is being held by US lawmakers and Sonos is the main party testifying. Many of the company’s antitrust concerns revolve around Google and Amazon, but Sonos’ chief legal officer also called out its issues with Apple in his testimony.
Last month Tile, Spotify, and more testified to the US Congressional Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights in a hearing back in April. Apple and Google’s counsel also joined.
Tuesday, June 15’s hearing titled “Protecting Competition and Innovation in Home Technologies” includes Sonos sharing its concerns along with Amazon and Google presenting their cases. With Apple not being a central part of this hearing, it didn’t send a representative. However, that’s not to say Sonos didn’t share some concerns about how Apple handles its Siri and HomeKit business.
At the outset, Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus shared platform openness as key to its success vs. “a walled-garden experience.”
“Our success is based in significant part on elevating the idea of an open platform facilitating consumer choice rather than a walled-garden experience. Sonos customers can choose audio content to play on our systems from more than 100 streaming services, such as Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Google’s YouTube Music. They can also choose between one of the two leading voice assistants, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant. Moreover, we provide these services with a strong emphasis on quality and privacy, focusing on using customer data to enhance their experience rather than aggressive monetization.”

The Senate confirmed President Joe Biden’s nominee to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Lina Khan, the young progressive who helped launch a reckoning amongst antitrust scholars and enforcers, in a 69-28 vote, reported The New York Times.
At 32, Khan will become the youngest commissioner ever confirmed to the agency. Her confirmation also signals a bipartisan desire to impose more regulations on Big Tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple. Khan received the support of several Republicans, including Commerce Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker (Republican – Mississippi), who participated in her confirmation hearing.
According to the NYT, her appointment was a victory for progressive activists who want Mr. Biden to take a hard line against big companies. He also gave a White House job to Tim Wu, a law professor who has criticized the power of the tech giants.
Khan became a well-known figure in antitrust circles after writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” for the Yale Law Review in 2017, while a student at the university. The paper made the case for using a different framework for evaluating competitive harm than the popular consumer welfare standard. That standard essentially says that antitrust law violations can be determined based on harm to consumers, which is often measured based on prices.
In the years since, Khan has become a recognized name among those in the field and a noted figure among progressives eager to see more expansive enforcement of antitrust laws. She participated in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, helping to compile the report from Democratic staff that found each held monopoly power.
As a commissioner, Khan will be tasked with voting on enforcement matters in areas of both competition and consumer protection. That means she will also have to deal with questions of whether companies have effectively secured their customers’ data or misled them with deceptive marketing or so-called dark patterns that can influence users’ choices online through calculated designs.

929,"June 14, 2021",Competition Tools for Digital Markets in Mexico: Section 94 of the Economic Competition Federal Act,"

By Alejandra Palacios1
Digital markets share several economic characteristics that are manifested in isolation in traditional markets, but which come together in the digital environment: network effects (direct and indirect), economies of scale and scope, and the existence of multi-sided platforms. The above, along with a growing capacity for using and processing large quantities of information, favors concentration and results in a reduced number of providers with a large share of the market.2
Furthermore, once an economic agent obtains a wide presence in these markets it is hard for other agents to compete with the dominant player. Given the aforementioned economic characteristics and the advantages in data gathering, potential competitors face difficulties in trying to reach the critical mass required to put some competitive pressure on the dominant incumbent.
The digital world makes it easier for the dynamics of “winner takes all” to take hold, where the most relevant competitive process is that which determines who among the participants will be the first to corner the market. It must also be taken into account that during this process there may be uncompetitive practices used to displace or prevent access to the market.
This set of characteristics and circumstances has become a cause for concern among competition authorities. Indeed, in recent years several competition authorities around the world have looked into and applied sanctions to several “Big Tech” players due to uncompetitive behavior.3 However, the truth is that the results of these investigations have not brought about more competitive environments. This is in addition to the fact that the intrinsic characteristics of the digital economy mentioned above have contributed to the existence of highly dynamic markets, in stark contrast to cumbersome competition procedures that are generally lengthy and involve administrative and judicial entities.
 
International Discussion Concerning Competition Policy in the Digital Environment
The Antitrust Community has raised the question of whether the current tools at their disposal (investigations for collusion and abuse of dominance, as well as merger control) and the effects of these investigations are good enough to generate competitive conditions in these markets, whether the exploration and creation of new competition policy tools is required, or even if new regulations and/or regulators are needed.
In general, the international discussion has primarily revolved around two aspects: the possibility of creating an ex ante regulation for certain economic agents as a function of their share of the market, and/or the creation of new competition policy tool for dealing with digital markets.
Regarding a possible ex ante regulation, some jurisdictions such as the UK, EU and Germany have taken it upon themselves to explore a series of obligations for economic agents that meet certain quantitative and/or qualitative criteria related to traits such as company size, share of the market, or ability to participate in adjacent markets, among others.
In this sense, the Digital Markets Taskforce (“DMT”) spearheaded by the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”)4 established a new regime targeting economic agents who hold a strategic status in the market (Strategic Market Status,” SMS”). This “SMS” label is created under certain, primordially qualitative criteria, such as being of a relevant size or scale in digital activities; having control over the entry of other companies into particular markets or lines of business; as well as having entrenched market power, that is, power that is neither temporary nor transitory. One of the effects of this procedure is the imposition of several obligations, such as committing to a code of conduct or to specific merger control rules.5
In a related step, this past December the European Union launched their proposal for a Digital Markets Act (DMA), establishing a set of mostly quantitative6 criteria for considering a platform to be a “gatekeeper,”7 which would force it to comply a set of obligations8 which, if not followed, could carry fines of up to 10 percent of the total business by volume over the previous fiscal year.9
Meanwhile, in February 2021 Germany published an amendment to their competition law which grants new powers to the Bundeskartellamt to determine the existence of economic agents with “paramount significance for competition across markets” whenever they meet certain criteria related to their position in the market.10 The determination is accompanied by a prohibition over certain behaviors, such as preferential treatment for their own products or services (self-preferencing); blocking competitors in markets where the company could expand rapidly, even if it lacks substantial power at present; and creating barriers to entry through the strategic use of data in the market, among others.11
In regards to the analysis of new tools and powers, some authorities are evaluating how appropriate these would be. The most notable case was the “New Competition Toolbox” promoted by the European Commission, which was discarded following a public consultation process. It sought to allow the European competition authority to carry out investigations on the structure of a market and, given the case, to determine: (i) the existence of structural risks to competition – the existence of market characteristics which, together with the conduct of certain economic agents, create a threat to competition -; and (ii) the structural lack of competition in scenarios where the market lacks competitive conditions due to its own structure. The proposal also provided powers to impose conduct and structural remedies in order to solve these competition problems.
The CMA, for their part, also has the power to carry out market investigations whereby it analyzes the particular characteristics of a market, including other elements unrelated to competition policy but which have an impact on competitive dynamics; for example, consumers’ cognitive biases. Market investigations allow the regulator to impose conduct and structural remedies that can generate or restore the competitive process and can even make policy recommendations to the government or sector regulators.12
 
Article 94 of the Mexican Federal Law on Economic Competition
COFECE is no stranger to this debate, and we have dedicated our time and resources to analyze whether the tools at our disposal are sufficient for facing the challenges posed by digital markets.
Through these discussions we have noted there are certain issues related to the digital environment where our catalogue of uncompetitive practices related to abuse of dominance largely covers the conducts that have recently been looked into in other jurisdictions. However, this catalogue was not designed to analyze the so-called “exploitative practices” directed towards consumers, such as the imposition by a platform of obscure or abusive terms and conditions, which have been sanctioned in the digital environment.13
We have also studied the possible scope of Article 94 in the Federal Economic Competition Law (Ley Federal de Competencia Económica, LFCE), which allows the Commission to identify structural, behavioral, and normative barriers or essential inputs that could result in the absence of competitive conditions in a specific market, so as to apply corrections through behavioral or structural remedies and/or regulate access to the essential input.
This determination came about with the constitutional reform of 2013 and materialized as part of the LFCE in 2014. It was integrated with the idea of addressing a very Mexican reality: highly concentrated markets in certain economic sectors, where the current lack of competition cannot be explained as due to anticompetitive conducts by the companies involved, but rather as a result of years of regulatory failures or antiquated behaviors that created market concentrations and market structures that traditional antitrust tools are unable to correct. For instance, there are markets that have been segmented for years, where at one time there may have been an uncompetitive agreement that is no longer there today, yet the legacy of which has seen the market become configured in that way, and/or markets where dominant players have advantages in accessing the necessary infrastructure for participation in the market, with access restricted to others.
In this sense, Article 94 allows for the analysis of a specific market following any indication that could make the Commission suspect the presence of market distortions that do not necessarily depend on an anticompetitive of an economic agent, but which is due to the structures and conditions of the market itself, or to the normativity that affects the competitive process.
In Mexico’s case the LFCE defines as a barrier to competition any structural characteristics, facts, or actions by economic agents that would impede access to competitors, limit their capacity to compete within the market, or prevents or distorts competition, as well as legal dispositions that unduly cause these damaging effects for the competitive process.14 In order to eliminate these barriers to competition Article 94 grants the Commission the power to impose two kinds of remedies: (i) behavioral, forcing economic agents to act in a certain way or stop performing actions that distort the competitive process; and (ii) structural, which allow for modifications to the market structure, including the possibility of divesting assets, rights, or social entities with the goal of creating or restoring competitive conditions in the market. Additionally, COFECE may issue recommendations to authorities at every level of government to help eliminate any detected normative barrier.
Likewise, essential inputs are the set of elements (goods, infrastructure, and rights, among others) whose availability to other economic agents is indispensable for the delivery of goods or services in one or several markets; which are controlled by an economic agent with substantial market power; have no close substitutes; and whose reproduction is not viable from a technical, legal, or economic reasons by another economic agent.15 Through this procedure the Commission can determine whether such an input exists, and establish rules for access and use by other economic agents.
Article 94 is a “hybrid” tool. On the one hand, there is the rigor and respect to the formalities as for investigations into monopolistic practices, while it allows for the imposition of regulatory-type remedies. The Commission holds the same powers and investigative tools as those needed to detect anticompetitive conducts, including requests for information, dawn raids, subpoenas, forensic analyses, and screenings. Furthermore, it includes a stage similar to a trial-like procedure for investigative procedures, where the economic agents involved are given the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence, which are analyzed by the Commission´s Board before a final decision is made. On the other hand, the procedure included in Article 94 is not aimed at sanctioning anticompetitive conducts carried out by economic agents, but rather on identifying structural problems, and using several types of remedies, including setting conditions or regulation for access to essential inputs.
  
COFECE’s Experience in Using Article 94
COFECE has applied Article 94 of the LFCE to eight investigations since 2014:

IEBC-001-2015, probe into the market for the provision of air transport services used in the Mexico City International Airport for takeoff and/or landing services, as well as into the market for airport services offered by the same airport, necessary for takeoff and/or landing procedures (SLOTS).
IEBC -002-2015, probe into the market for public transportation of cargo in each of the eighteen municipalities in Sinaloa state, for the transport of construction or stone materials, for the transport of agricultural resources and products, their derivatives, and general cargo (TRANSPORTE SINALOA).
IEBC-001-2016, carried out in the market for production, distribution, and sale of malted barley (cebada) seed and grain for beer production (CEBADA).
IEBC-002-2016, in the market for port services, maritime transport services, and land transportation services for the commercialization of agricultural wholesale and general cargo in the port of Progreso, in the state of Yucatan (PUERTO PROGRESO).
IEBC-002-2017, in the market for production, distribution and/or sale of raw bovine milk for industrial uses originating in and/or destined for the state of Chihuahua (LECHE CHIHUAHUA).
IEBC-003-2017, probe into the market for accreditation, evaluation of conformity and normalization services nationwide (SERVICIOS DE ACREDITACIÓN).
IEBC-005-2018, probe into the market for card-based payment systems whose processing includes a Clearing House (SISTEMAS DE PAGO).
IEBC-002-2019, probing the national market for aircraft fuel, including production, storage, transportation, distribution, sale, dispatch, and related services (COMBUSTIBLES PARA AERONAVES).

Of these eight cases, three have been closed (CEBADA, PUERTO PROGRESO, and SERVICIOS DE ACREDITACIÓN), one (SISTEMAS DE PAGO) is currently in the post-investigation stage, and another (COMBUSTIBLES PARA AERONAVES) is still in the investigative stage.
With the application of this procedure we have identified some interesting learning points. For instance, in TRANSPORTE SINALOA and LECHE CHIHUAHUA it was determined that the competitive process had been distorted by normative barriers. In both cases non-binding recommendations were made to local authorities to eliminate said barriers. They remain in place. The lesson here is that, if during the pre-investigation process one notices that anticompetitive effects are derived from normative barriers, and therefore the likely result of the market investigation will be only recommendations for authorities to modify said norms, it becomes senseless to allocate investigation resources to these cases, especially if the same result can be reached via an opinion by the Commission’s Board. To my judgement, while market investigations are undoubtedly helpful for determining the impact (including monetary impact) on competitive conditions caused by the normative barrier, it is not worth the expense of the resources assigned.
In the SLOTS case, the existence of an essential input was determined, as was the consequent regulation. This experience led to an important preliminary criteria related to the Commission’s scope in regulating access to an essential input, insofar as the Judicial Branch has interpreted that COFECE’s powers to regulate access to essential facilities have limits when a sector regulator exists, in this case being the Aeronautical authority. With reference to this judiciary interpretation it is important to point out two aspects: first, this is an isolated judicial precedent that does not carry an obligatory jurisprudence, and second, Mexico has no entity in charge of regulating the digital economy, which allows the Commission, in any case, to exert its powers as they relate to regulatory measures for essential inputs in said markets.
The most relevant lesson is that, with Article 94, it is possible to carry out far more detailed analyses of market structures, bringing to light elements that may hamper competition, but which are often overlooked in anticompetitive conduct investigations. Within these elements are factors that help better understand consumers’ behavior, including behavioral biases that could be induced by economic agents, the use of personal user data for commercial ends, as well as the influence of other public policies and consumer or data protection policies on the conduct of economic agents.
  
Application of Article 94 to Digital Markets
The Commission’s experience with market investigations has contributed to our identification of Article 94 as a possible tool for analyzing digital markets and the problems related to them in at least three areas.
The characteristics of certain markets within the digital environment makes them prone to reaching a “tipping point,” which may take place when they attain a critical mass of users who, due to network effects, accelerate the move towards a highly concentrated market with one or very few competitors. There are certain conducts taken by economic agents who, even if they lack substantial market power, may accelerate this tipping point and affect the competitive process. For instance, behaviors that make it more difficult for users to switch between platforms or services (switching) or that reduce multi-homing, such as price parity clauses, bundling. This is especially the case with pure bundling, “most favored nation” pricing clauses, among others.16
And so, Article 94 allows us to analyze and correct behavioral barriers used by economic agents who, despite having no substantial market power, can still engage in conducts that accelerates the “tipping point” and may affect the competitive process. In this sense, the international discourse has pointed out that intervention by competition authorities using traditional tools may come too late, when the remaining potential entrants are no longer able to compete with consolidated platforms. Here, Article 94 would allow the Commission to intervene at an earlier stage and, given the case, establish remedies to counteract any potential anticompetitive effects within the market.
Also, this disposition would allow for the analysis of behaviors not included in our catalogue of abuse of dominance practices established by the LFCE such as, as mentioned above, exploitative practices. In the digital environment some jurisdictions, such as Germany, have considered the imposition of abusive or excessive terms and conditions for the use of platforms to be exploitative practices, as it allows for considerable amounts of information and user data to be gathered for commercial use.
Finally, Article 94 allows for the imposition of behavioral remedies that have already been discussed in the global stage as possible solutions to the lack of competition in these markets. This includes: (i) establishing codes of conduct applicable to dominant platforms, in the hopes of prohibiting certain behaviors; (ii) prohibiting self-preferencing or differential treatment measures; (iii) data and protocol interoperability; (iv) data portability allowing user data to migrate from one platform to another; and (v) divestment and functional separation of digital platforms with the capability of wielding market power and distorting the competitive process.
  
New Methods and Solutions for New Challenges
Reality makes it clear that, whenever new challenges arise, what is needed are new methods and new solutions that are up to the task. COFECE has cutting-edge tools at its disposal and must be ready to use them as needed.
Lastly, I would like to mention that, even with the advantages of Article 94 presented here, one of its main disadvantages is the time that it takes to implement structural or behavioral remedies. This is why, to my judgement, we must also consider the need for an expedited procedure which through clearly determined quantitative criteria and equally concrete effects allows for the imposition of obligations in a swift, opportune and effective way against economic agents who meet similar characteristics to what other jurisdictions have labelled “gatekeepers”: an expedite procedure that would allow us to guarantee competitive conditions in digital markets, recognizing that the tools contemplated by Mexican law – including Article 94 — cannot respond quickly enough.
Mexico has ample experience with such expedited procedures, such as the procedure used to determine the existence of dominant economic agents in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors when they hold a national market share above 50 percent. Such a proposal would require the inclusion of a new procedure into the LFCE.

930,"June 13, 2021",Breaking Up Big Tech In Focus As New U.S. Antitrust Bills Introduced,"


By Diane Bartz, Reuters
A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced four bills on Friday aimed at reining in the power of the tech giants, with one potentially leading to their break-up.
Two of the bills address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.
One measure bans platforms from owning subsidiaries that operate on their platform if those subsidiaries compete with other businesses – potentially forcing the Big Tech firms to sell assets.

House members on Friday introduced five antitrust bills — including one that would force Amazon.com Inc. and others to essentially split into two companies or shed their private-label products — in the most aggressive action yet by federal lawmakers to rein in the market influence of Big Tech.
Another bill, called “American Innovation and Choice Online Act,” targets the ability of companies, presumably Amazon, Apple, and Google parent Alphabet, to leverage their online platforms to favor their own products over competitors.
The “Ending Platform Monopolies Act,” which proposes structural separation, in part says, “It shall be unlawful for a covered platform operator to own or control a line of business, other than the covered platform, when the covered platform’s ownership or control of that line of business gives rise to an irreconcilable conflict of interest.” The Wall Street Journal first reported on the bill, which is sponsored by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.
“A Stronger Online Economy: Opportunity, Innovation, Choice,” also includes two bills that address make it more difficult for dominant platforms to gobble up competitive threats via mergers and acquisitions. A fifth bill promotes competition online by “lowering barriers to entry and switching costs for businesses and consumers through interoperability and data portability requirements.”
“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy,” Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House’s Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, said in a statement announcing the bipartisan legislation led by Democrats. “They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work. Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.”
While the bills are an outgrowth of bipartisan support and a growing chorus of unsettled consumers and privacy activists, several pro-business organizations voiced their alarm at the tone and severity of the legislation.

Honeywell International plans to spin off its quantum computing business and merge it with a software firm to form a new company that is likely to trade publicly, reported Bloomberg.
Honeywell will own a 54% stake of the venture after combining the business with Cambridge Quantum Computing, a London-based specialized software firm that will own the remaining 46%. Honeywell has committed to investing up to US$300 million in the company, which may seek to sell shares to the public, said Tony Uttley, who heads Honeywell’s quantum computing business and will be president of the new entity.
“We are setting up this company to accelerate. This is truly about hyper-scaling,” Uttley said in an interview Tuesday, June 8. “You put the capital in now and grow massively.”
Honeywell scientists have been working to build a quantum computer, which could be vastly more powerful than traditional computers, for about a decade with tools from its energy and aerospace units. The effort has thrown Honeywell’s hat in the ring to be among the first to build a practical quantum computer, a race pitting it against a number of startups and tech giants including International Business Machines and Alphabet’s Google.

The architect of Australia’s new law making Alphabet’s Google and Facebook pay news outlets for content on Thursday, June 10, rejected a suggestion the move was the result of lobbying by News Corp, calling the claim “extremely strange.”
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair Rod Sims, who oversaw drafting of the law, acknowledged the negotiating system was proposed by the Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher, but said all major media operators in the country supported it.
Asked at an FT conference in Britain if Australia had acted at the behest of News Corp, Sims said Google had “sent emails to all parliamentarians saying ‘don’t let big business control the internet’, and they were of course referring to News Corp.”
“News Corp is 1% the size of Google. News Corp is one of four main media companies (in Australia). It’s very likely not the one with the biggest reach. I just think this is a line put out by Google,” Sims added.
“There were many people giving us ideas. News Corp was but one. This whole notion that this is about News Corp is extremely strange.”
In February, Australia passed laws that make the Big Tech players such as Google and Facebook pay media companies for content on their platforms. If the online giants and media companies can’t strike a deal, the government appoints an arbitrator to do it for them.

934,"June 9, 2021",Democrats To Take On Big Tech With 5 Major Antitrust Bills,"


House Democrats plan to introduce five separate bills as early as this week that could dramatically reign in big tech companies’ economic dominance, Politico reported Wednesday, June 9.
The bills address a number of lawmakers’ concerns about the growing power of tech titans like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet-owned Google, and Facebook.
One bill, headed up by Rep. Pramilia Jayapal, of Washington, would let the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sue to break up tech companies by forcing them to sell parts of their business that present a conflict of interest, Politico reported. That could spell trouble for companies like Amazon and Google, which critics say use their dominance of web hosting and digital ad markets to promote their own products and services.
A second bill, authored by Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, would ban large tech companies from favoring their own products in digital marketplaces they operate and set the rules for, according to Politico. That takes aim at how Apple’s App Store policies impact app developers and how Amazon treats third-party sellers in its marketplace.
A third bill, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, would prohibit platform companies from acquiring or merging with potential competitors, Politico reported. That follows criticism of Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the FTC’s probe into potentially anticompetitive acquisitions by Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
A fourth bill, sponsored by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, of Pennsylvania, would require platforms with more than 500,000 US users, or those designated by regulators as a “critical trading partner,” to make it easier for users to move their data to rival platforms, Politico reported. Lawmakers have criticized Facebook and Google for hoarding users’ personal data in an endless “feedback loop” that helps them maintain their market power.
The final bill, identical to one sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Democrat – Minnesota) and Chuck Grassley (Republican – Iowa) in a spending bill that passed this week, Politico reported, would require companies to pay antitrust regulators more when seeking their approval for mergers. Regulators are vastly under-resourced compared to the tech giants they’re tasked with regulating, placing them at a huge disadvantage if they seek to block a merger and it goes to court — increased legal fees could help balance the scales.

On Monday, June 7, the New York state Senate passed legislation making it easier for plaintiffs to win antimonopoly lawsuits, in the latest state-led effort to rein in large technology companies in the absence of action by Congress.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the bill was opposed by business groups and backed by unions and other critics of corporate giants such as Amazon and Alphabet’s Google. To become law, it must also pass the state assembly and be signed by the governor.
Monday’s 43-20 party line vote represented an incremental victory for advocates of tougher antitrust laws, who will seek to use it as a springboard to tougher laws in other states and at the federal level.
“We have a problem in this country. We have a problem that there is tremendous market power in very, very few hands,” said New York state Sen. Michael Gianaris, a Democrat and the bill’s lead sponsor, at a virtual press conference Monday. “Small startups and medium-sized businesses don’t have the opportunity to grow and innovate.”
Opponents of the bill claimed that it would lead to a torrent of class-action lawsuits.

By Thomas Hoppner (Technical University Wildau) & Philipp Westerhoff (Hausfeld)
With the most recent updates of its mobile operating systems, in April 2021 Apple implemented a new global App Tracking Transparency policy. The policy obliges app developers to display an additional (Apple-designed) prompt to request permission from end users for the developer to “track” the user, even when the user has already consented to the sharing of its data through the developer’s own consent tool. Apple presents the new policy as a step to enhance privacy. Others, including the authors of this article, see it as a “bombshell for third-party mobile ad tech” that, together with Google’s disabling of third-party cookies, only entrenches the data supremacy of Apple and Google, and forecloses data-based competition and consumer choice across the entire Apple ecosystem.

Draft rules aimed at reining in the power of Facebook, Alphabet unit Google, Amazon, and Apple should only target these US tech giants, a leading EU lawmaker said, reported Reuters.
Proposed by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager last year, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) could force US tech giants to change their lucrative business models and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals.
The DMA defines online gatekeepers as companies with more than €6.5 billion (US$8 billion) in annual European turnover in the last three years or €65 billion in market value in the last financial year, and which provide a core platform service in at least three EU countries.
Such criteria could catch big EU and Asian tech companies in addition to the US competitors.
That revenue threshold should be ratcheted up to €10 billion and the market value to at least €100 billion, European Parliament lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who is leading the file for the EU body, said in a report.
“The DMA should be clearly targeted to those platforms that play an unquestionable role as gatekeepers due to their size and their impact on the internal market,” he wrote in his report.
“To this end, it is appropriate to increase the quantitative thresholds and to add … that they are providers of not only one but, at least, two core platform services,” Schwab said.
The EU competition enforcer should be able to designate in a month which gatekeepers should be subject to the rules instead of its proposed three-month period, he said.

President Joe Biden’s proposed budget would give an 11% funding increase to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as well as a hefty boost to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, both of which filed major lawsuits against big tech companies last year.
The agencies, which review mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law and other enforcement, have been at the center of a political storm, with progressives and some Republicans accusing them of being too lax, reported Reuters.
Under the Biden budget, released Friday, may 28, the FTC, which has about 1,140 people and also investigates companies accused of deceiving consumers, would see its staff increase to about 1,250 in the 2022 fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
The Biden budget for the next fiscal year envisions the agency spending US$389.8 million. That’s an increase from US$351 million this year, or about 11%.
Under Biden’s plan, the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division would see its budget increase from US$185 million to US$201 million, an increase of 8.6%.
The president’s budget is generally seen as a statement of intent in terms of policies. In addition to being at the center of a policy debate, the agencies filed major antitrust lawsuits last year. The Justice Department sued Alphabet’s Google while the FTC sued Facebook.

The first hearing will focus on “competition concerns” in the world of smart home technologies, which have exploded in popularity over the last few years.
Concentration in the market is already being scrutinized by the European Commission, which opened an investigation into the broader “Internet of Things” — simply understood as devices connected to the internet — last summer.

Facebook is likely to face its first EU antitrust investigation in the coming weeks as regulators zoom in on its online marketplace after rivals complained about the service, a person familiar with the matter said.
The move by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would make Facebook the latest US tech giant to be in her crosshairs following cases against Alphabet’s Google, Apple, and Amazon.
Facebook’s online marketplace, launched in 2016, is used by 800 million Facebook users in 70 countries to buy and sell items. It drew scrutiny in 2019 from the European Commission, which sent out questionnaires seeking details about its role in relation to rivals in online classified ads, an EU document seen by Reuters at the time showed.
Companies were asked at that time whether they see Facebook Marketplace as a close rival in online classified ads services and how many visits to their sites came from ads placed on Facebook’s site.
Classified ads competitors complained that Facebook uses its market power to give it an unfair competitive advantage, people familiar with the matter had told Reuters.
Opening an investigation would mark the start of a lengthy process that could take years before regulators issue a decision that could include a fine as much as 10% of global turnover and an order to stop anti-competitive practices.

Today, online platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have become the primary means of expression and source of information for many Americans. Since their inception, these platforms have enjoyed legal immunities under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a 25-year old statute that largely shields them from liability for hosting and moderating content posted by their users. For years, Section 230 was seen as striking the right balance between encouraging free expression on the internet and protecting content moderation by online platforms. But as both sides of the political aisle start to criticize “Big Tech,” the once-obscure statute, which is seen as providing sweeping immunities to some of the largest companies in the world, is taking fire from all directions. Multiple reform bills have been proposed by legislators, including ones that would prevent online platforms from using Section 230 as a defense in cases brought under antitrust law. Some have suggested that a Section 230 reform would broaden the reach of antitrust law and make it more likely for an antitrust case against “Big Tech” to succeed. This article explains why we believe a Section 230 reform would have little impact on antitrust law.

Most Section 230 reformers are motivated by a desire to constrain the power of large technology companies, but many proposals to reform Section 230 would do the opposite. They would shift power toward large technology platforms and away from people and governments, making it even harder for startups to compete with large platforms. This paper provides a typology of these power shifts, examining the specific ways in which reform proposals could increase the power of large tech platforms. The paper then offers alternative proposals for addressing some of the concerns raised by legislators that would instead shift power in the opposite direction: away from platforms and toward people and governments.

The CEOs of a handful of tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter — have testified repeatedly in congressional hearings over the past eight months, responding repeatedly to questions about the existence of an offensive tweet, a horrific Facebook Group, or an objectionable YouTube video. Each time, the message from legislators has been the same: you have too much power to set the rules for speech on your platform, we don’t like the rules you set, and we don’t like how you enforce them. Democrats argue that tech companies censor too little, that harmful speech is allowed to run rampant on their platforms, posing particular harm to vulnerable communities.

In their zeal to curb Big Tech, regulators are crafting legislative reforms that make distinctions between Internet services based on size. A crucial Internet law, Section 230, is among the targets for such reforms. This essay discusses the nuanced considerations that regulators should address when drafting size-based distinctions for Internet services. It also raises concerns that such distinctions are not good policy in the context of Section 230.

By Eric Goldman & Jess Miers1

I. INTRODUCTION
Regulators across the globe want to impose more stringent regulations on “Big Tech,” but that requires regulators to explain what “Big” Tech means. As it turns out, it’s not easy to craft sensible regulations that distinguish Internet services by size.
This essay will consider how regulators might incorporate a size-based regulation distinction into a critically important Internet law, Section 230,2 which says websites typically aren’t liable for third-party content.3 When Congress enacted Section 230 in 1996, the Internet looked quite differently than it does now.4 Now, with help from Section 230, Google and Facebook have emerged as two of the most valuable companies ever.5 In response, pending bills would reduce or eliminate Section 230 for large services.6 Other proposals at the federal7 and state8 level would impose greater duties on big Internet services.

When we talk about Section 230 in a vacuum, separate from antitrust policy, or public utility policy, we miss how it works — or rather, how it fails, and, more importantly, how to coherently set up a new, comprehensive regulatory regime with a thriving informational sphere. Section 230 was born along with consolidation, and instead of just talking about full or partial repeal, we should be talking about a new vision for communications infrastructure in America.

By Zephyr Teachout1
 
It was probably about five years ago that I realized I had been totally wrong on Section 230, a kind of depth of wrongness that can make one more humble not just about the particular policy area, but all policy areas. I had adopted the view that Section 230 was fundamentally necessary for the flowering of decentralized, creative, online life, and that without it, there would be an internet, but it would be a highly controlled internet, one without joy or quirks, one that was organized from the top down. I advocated for it and campaigned on it.
There are two primary reasons for my wrongness about 230. First, I came to the law through copyright, and while I am by no means a free culture warrior, I have real and ongoing concerns about the monopolistic lock up of culture, and control that flows therefrom, in our current intellectual property regimes. As a result, many of my late aughts-early 2010s objections to touching 230 came not from a deep belief in the importance of platform immuni...

The internet has been an incredibly powerful tool for enabling users to share a wide variety of content. Some have argued that large online platforms like Facebook and Twitter have too much power over what speech can be heard. Often this leads to calls to change Section 230, a critical legal protection that enables content moderation and protects platforms from being held liable for their users’ content, or is used as evidence of these platforms’ “monopoly” power. To use antitrust enforcement to address concerns about content moderation is unlikely to result in the desired policy changes and could set a dangerous precedent for abusing antitrust enforcement for non-competition related purposes. Policymakers should not ignore the important role Section 230 plays in enabling a dynamic market for services to host user-generated content well-beyond the social media context. History has shown that it is often hard to predict which small company may prove to be an innovative and disruptive success, but a framework including Section 230 that allows new entrants to start with minimal regulation is most likely to yield a competitive marketplace and benefit consumers.

947,"May 25, 2021","Antitrust, Section 230 & the First Amendment","
The First Amendment allows antitrust action against media companies for their business practices, but not for their editorial judgments. Section 230 mirrors this distinction by protecting providers of interactive computer services from being “treated as the publisher” of content provided by others, including decisions to withdraw or refuse to publish that content (230(c)(1)), and by further protecting decisions made “in good faith” to take down content, regardless of who created it (230(c)(2)(A)). Section 230 provides a critical civil procedure shortcut: when providers of interactive computer services are sued for refusing to carry the speech of others, they need not endure the expense of litigating constitutional questions. Thus, changing Section 230 could dramatically increase litigation costs, but it would not ultimately create new legal liability for allegedly “biased” or “unfair” content moderation. Nor will the First Amendment permit new quasi-antitrust remedies that compel websites to carry content they find objectionable.

Apple & Epic made their final pitch to a federal judge Monday, May 24, Epic looks to curb the market power of the App Store while the iPhone maker pleaded to leave its marketplace for 2 million apps undisturbed, reported Bloomberg.
US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers heard closing arguments Monday from attorneys for the creator of the blockbuster game Fortnite and the iPhone maker in a case that threatens to upend the how the US$142 billion world of mobile applications is managed.
Reprising the themes of a three-week trial in Oakland, California, the lawyers debated a set of topics, including the scope of the market in which Epic claims Apple wields power and whether Apple’s tight controls on its store hurts developers and users. Gonzalez Rogers, who is deciding the case without a jury, said she hopes to deliver a ruling as soon as possible but she didn’t specify a date.
After aggressively questioning Apple CEO Officer Tim Cook Friday in his first time testifying as a witness, the judge on Monday asked how Apple’s practice of taking a 30% commission from developers for in-app purchases made through its App Store has remained unchanged since the store opened in 2008.
“If there was real competition, that number would move and it hasn’t,” Gonzalez Rogers said. “If the relevant market here includes developer-side competition, so far there doesn’t seem to be anything that is in the market itself that is pressuring Apple to compete for developers.”
Apple’s lawyer Daniel Swanson said that Apple has improved its device quality even as its developer commission rate stayed the same. Games played on Apple’s iOS operating system can “hold their own” with some of the best games on consoles and PCs, Swanson said. “That is quality competition.”
Epic sued Apple in August, after the iPhone-maker removed Fortnite from its App Store because the gaming company created a workaround so it wouldn’t have to continue paying a 30% fee on customers’ in-app purchases. The case has drawn interest across Silicon Valley, with everyone from Microsoft Corp. to Nvidia Corp. weighing into the fight. In November, Apple sliced its revenue cut from 30% to 15% for developers who generate up to US$1 million in revenue.

Lina Khan, a progressive champion nominated by President Biden for a key enforcement post, wants to transform antitrust policy into a bulwark against corporate power by blocking more mergers, attacking monopolistic practices and potentially breaking up some of America’s largest companies, reported The Wall Street Journal.
Ms. Khan, 32 years old, is awaiting Senate confirmation for a Democratic seat on the five-member Federal Trade Commission (FTC) after she was cleared by the Senate Commerce Committee. She has risen to prominence—and gained bipartisan support—as Democrats and Republicans alike have said lax antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech sector, has allowed dominant firms to hobble rivals and stifle competition.
Her targets have included not just Big Tech, but also Big Chocolate and others. She has argued for hawkish positions that would overhaul legal doctrine and go well beyond the approach of recent antitrust enforcers. While her most ardent supporters believe such changes are long overdue, her views have prompted a debate on whether her approach is realistic and potentially so sweeping that it could prove jarring to the economy.
“Stepped-up antitrust enforcement is one thing,” said Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil, who was a top FTC staffer the last time Democrats controlled the Commission. “Changing the standards is a different matter,” he said.
Mr. Gavil, who favors more enforcement, said Ms. Khan will have to consider how to translate her views into something that can be applied in practice. “That’s more challenging than simply being a critic on the outside,” he said.

In December 2020, the European Commission proposed an ambitious new set of rules, the Digital Markets Act (“DMA”),1 which could be applicable in 2023 and whose rationale leans heavily on innovation. In many places throughout the proposed DMA recitals, the Explanatory Memorandum included therewith and the Impact Assessment attached thereto, the Commission explains in greater detail how innovation is currently adversely impacted in the digital economy and how its proposal would improve the situation.2
 
General Relationship Between Competition and Innovation 
At a general level, the Commission reiterates its core belief that there is a direct relationship between competition and innovation: more competition leads to more innovation.3 Similar statements are found throughout the decisions and soft-law instruments issued by competition agencies across Europe. One might fault the Commission for taking what looks like a strong Arrowian view4 of the relationship between competition and innovation, ignoring both the Schumpeterian analysis5 (which posits an inverse relationship) and the contemporary synthesis (which returns an inverted-U relationship) made by a cluster of authors around Aghion.6 In the context of competition law, authorities are usually dealing with markets where competition is rather diminished than excessive. It may then not matter much in practice whether they take an Arrow or Aghion theoretical perspective, since in all likelihood authorities are active on the upward-sloping part of the inverted-U, where Arrow and Aghion coincide.
While the DMA may also play out in the upward-sloping part of the inverted-U, it cannot be excluded that in some situations, competition is already strong, so that authorities could be acting on the downward-sloping part of the inverted-U, where it is no longer correct to assume that more competition will unavoidably foster innovation. Indeed, in the more elaborate parts of its analysis, the Commission shows that it is aware that the relationship between competition and innovation is not so simple. There are some trade-offs involved, especially once the specific features of so-called Core Platform Services, i.e. the digital services targeted by the DMA, are brought into the picture, namely: economies of scale and scope, network effects (compounded by multi-sidedness), lock-in, lack of multi-homing, vertical integration and data-driven advantages. Innovation can come from the platform itself – and the firm controlling it (the “gatekeeper” pursuant to the DMA) – or it can arise around the platform, typically driven by a firm using the platform to bring an invention to the market (a “user” pursuant to the DMA). The Commission is well aware that the DMA could reduce the innovation incentives of the platform owner; the question then becomes what is gained in return. Once the analysis reaches that level of sophistication, however, it starts branching out in different directions. As the following paragraphs show, two distinct innovation scenarios are bundled together in the DMA.
 
Scenario 1: Sustaining Innovation by Users Based on the Core Platform Services
As a starting point, the Commission recognizes that online platforms have proven to be innovation hotbeds, with innovation originating throughout the platform ecosystem, i.e. not just from the gatekeepers themselves, but also from platform users, businesses and individuals alike.7 Platform users innovate by introducing complementary products, for instance games or productivity apps for mobile operating systems. Yet the heady early days of the Internet are over. In the current context, the Commission points to evidence that the rise of powerful gatekeepers controlling the main online platforms leads to sub-optimal levels of innovation. Essentially, the innovation incentives of the gatekeepers and the users become misaligned, and the gatekeepers start to divert some of their efforts towards preventing or appropriating innovations brought about by platform users. In that case, certain courses of conduct by platform operators hinder business users and adversely affect their innovation incentives. Ultimately, these businesses refrain or are prevented from bringing innovative offerings to the market.
Under this scenario, the main concern is that the platform gatekeeper would go out of its way to control the flow of innovation around its platform. While blocking inventive offerings by users is certainly possible, a more likely course of conduct, witnessed in a number of cases already (from Microsoft to Google Shopping and Google Android),8 is that the gatekeeper would use bundling or self-preferencing to exclude the inventive user and appropriate the profits from the innovation via a competing offering of its own. A significant proportion of the obligations contained in the DMA are designed to address that concern. They include generic prohibitions against the use of non-public data to compete with business users or self-preferencing in search rankings, as well as an obligation to grant equal access to APIs and other interoperability features.9 In addition, the DMA proposal protects more specifically some neighbouring markets against gatekeeper conduct, namely identification services, apps and app stores and payment services.10
As far as innovation theory is concerned, this scenario involves what would typically be incremental innovation around the existing core platform service (as with the Novell and Sun server operating systems in relation to Windows Server Operating System in Microsoft). Furthermore, that innovation will also be sustaining innovation as it will remain within the value network or the architecture created by the platform. For instance, it would consist of apps running on a smartphone operating system platform such as iOS or Android; a specialized search engine (or another ancillary service such as maps, etc.) accessible through a general search engine such as Google; or a retail business hosted on an online retailing platform such as Amazon.
As a normative matter, the Commission cannot be faulted for intervening to safeguard the ability of third parties to carry out incremental innovation around the core platform services. Incremental innovation is especially prevalent in the digital economy, and it can greatly contribute to consumer welfare. Starting with Microsoft, competition enforcement in the EU has protected incremental innovation in the digital economy, although this has never been explicitly stated.11 In that respect, the DMA proposal merely extends the innovation policy choices made in competition law enforcement.
Whereas the first scenario is laid out in the Commission Impact Assessment and translated in the list of obligations and prohibitions applicable to gatekeepers, it does not entirely fit within either the “contestability” or “fairness” objectives defined in the DMA proposal. Regarding fairness, the proposal indicates that it should be understood as a contractual imbalance between the respective rights and obligations of gatekeeper and user.12 This definition does not fil well with the first innovation scenario which is more about equality of competitive opportunity.13 As for contestability, the DMA proposal almost always defines it in relation to core platform services, in line with economic theory where contestability is a redeeming feature of monopolistic markets.14 However, the first innovation scenario, as regards both the analysis and the remedial obligations, has little to do with the contestability of core platform services: rather, it is about containing gatekeeper power and preventing it from adversely affecting neighbouring markets in the ecosystem of the core platform service.
 
Scenario 2: Innovation in the Core Platform Services: Frontal Competition or Disruption? 
When it comes to contestability on the core platform services, the DMA proposal does not clearly explain the link with innovation. The Impact Assessment mentions that the gatekeepers divert their resources away from R&D and towards M&A, in order to compete “for the market.” At the same time, it is known that “a significant amount of innovation is driven by disruptive firms,” so that the DMA proposal should seek “to protect the competitive process by which disruptive firms challenge the status quo.”15 These passages hint at disruptive innovation, but do not fully develop the analysis. For one, the Commission misunderstands disruptive innovation by linking it with competition “for the market.” In the case of gatekeepers within the meaning of the DMA, competition for the market would be very difficult to achieve, since gatekeepers have fully exploited the characteristics of core platform services to build a quasi-unassailable position. There is little hope for a new search engine to outperform Google, for a competing social network to oust Facebook or for an alternative online commerce and retail platform to outcompete Amazon.
The more likely scenario is not frontal competition, but rather sideways competition, where a core platform service is side-lined and made less central for users (competition “on the market”).16 Such sideways competition usually involves disruptive innovation in the technical sense – as introduced by Christensen and then updated by Gans17 – namely an innovation where the incumbent firm is caught off-guard and punished despite doing what made it successful. Disruptions are never frontal assaults: they involve a shift in the value network binding consumers to a given product space, or in the dominant architecture used by suppliers on that space. We witnessed a number of disruptions in the digital economy in recent years, usually with positive implications for competition policy. So it is that Google heralded the rise of Internet-centric computing, which turned client operating systems (such as Windows) into a sideshow. Then Facebook turned a social media platform into an alternative portal to search engines such as Google, limiting the impact of Google’s dominance. The rise of smartphones – led by the iPhone – not only reshuffled the market for mobile devices but also made computers less central, thereby reducing the impact of dominant positions in CPUs, for instance.
If disruptive innovation does not involve frontal competition and blindsides incumbents, can these incumbents do anything to avert it? Possible defensive strategies include trying to prevent potential disruptors (to the extent they can be detected) from gaining a foothold – as Microsoft did when it saw the threat emerging from Netscape in the 1990s – or acquiring potentially threatening firms to throttle any disruption.18
By now it has become clear that the Facebook/Instagram and Facebook/WhatsApp acquisitions were textbook cases of the latter strategy, as the recent US state-level and FTC antitrust case against Facebook indicate.19 The DMA proposal picks up on strategic acquisitions with its obligation to inform the Commission about intended concentrations but it is a relatively weak provision.20 In combination with the new Guidance on Case Referrals to the Commission,21 it could become a clever workaround to the notification thresholds. However, even if the Commission could eventually review these strategic acquisitions, they remain a blind spot in the current merger control law. Many questions remain unaddressed, such as which theory of harm would justify blocking such acquisitions, and which standard of proof should apply (balance of probabilities or balance of harms).
As for the defensive exclusionary strategy, even if the disruption analysis is not developed in the DMA, some of the obligations could help to keep gatekeepers vulnerable to disruption: they include the obligation to keep advertising markets transparent, to provide data to users and to allow for data portability, to refrain from MFN clauses and steering and to offer access to search engine data to third-party search engine.22 It is apparent from the rationale and the wording of these obligations that they are meant to support frontal competition with the core platform service in question. Yet these obligations can also provide cover for a disrupting innovator to come close enough to the gatekeeper, so that the disruptor can use its position as a stepping stone to shift the value network or the dominant architecture.
By way of illustration, the obligations relating to data portability, or to the availability of data generated by and through the activities of business users,23 could be used to enable a frontal competitor to Google, Facebook or Amazon – however unlikely – to survive by feeding on the data obtained from such gatekeepers via its users. But these obligations – depending on how they are specified in practice – could also be used to funnel data to an innovative entrant that would try to disrupt the value network or the dominant architecture: hypothetically, business users may for instance transfer the data they obtained from Amazon to a provider of a platform dedicated to second-hand sales and trades, local sourcing or ethical sourcing, that could disrupt online retail if successful.
For the sake of completeness, it should be added that disruption could also conceivably come from an innovator in a complementary product around a core platform service (Scenario 1), where this product would evolve from a mere complement into a disruptive offering. Such was the case, for instance, for Netscape’s original web browser, which started as a complement to an operating system such as Windows (enabling it to open up to the World Wide Web). Later it became an existential disruptive threat, triggering an anti-competitive reaction from Microsoft in order to protect its position. The obligations that surround Scenario 1 can therefore protect not just sustaining innovation on a core platform service, but also open up a path to disruption.
 
DMA and Innovation
Putting it all together, the DMA would be meant to affect innovation as follows. First, it seeks to preserve the innovation incentives of the users of core platform services, so that they can deliver innovative offerings of the incremental type, by way of complementary products within the platform ecosystem and thus of sustaining innovation (Scenario 1 above). Second, as far as the contestability of core platform services is concerned, the DMA proposal seems focused on enabling frontal competition with the gatekeepers (Scenario 2 above). It is questionable whether this is a realistic perspective, and how significant an innovation this would generate. Third, it could be argued that, in trying to safeguard innovation Scenarios 1 and 2, the DMA proposal is also opening some paths for inventive rivals to attempt disruption, either by starting from a complementary offering or by staking a market position close to the gatekeeper and using it as a springboard.
Thus, the DMA proposal leaves as many paths open as possible to innovative firms. This may be the best policy choice given the inherent unpredictability of innovation.24 Fairness (defined as equality of opportunity) and contestability (defined as reducing entry barriers on and around core platform services) would then be shorthand for a regulatory objective of keeping markets open and competitive as much as possible. Seen from that angle, the DMA would fit within a revamped version of the ordo-liberal tradition that still underpins much of EU competition law and economic regulation.25 This ordo-liberalism for the 21st century would have dynamism and innovation at its core, as the main reason why markets should be kept open and competitive.26 Seen from that angle, the DMA will not kill but rather promote the diversity – and hopefully the level – of innovation in Europe.

The statement from the UK regulators for competition and data protection – the first of its kind globally – highlights the strong overlap between promoting and protecting competition in digital markets and safeguarding people’s data. Coherent and clear regulation is vital for creating the conditions that allow new innovative services to flourish and for people to have confidence in digital services.
The ICO and CMA affirm that rather than competition and data protection being in opposition, they are complementary agendas. The regulators have committed to work together to find regulatory solutions that achieve good competition and data protection outcomes.
Competitive digital markets, with coherent and well-targeted regulation, can empower consumers by giving them greater control over their personal data and driving positive competition outcomes.
The ICO and CMA are committed to continuing working together on projects that will put this joint statement into practice. This is already the case on the CMA’s investigation into Google’s Privacy Sandbox and the ICO’s investigation into real time bidding in the adtech industry.
This commitment has been reinforced through an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the ICO and CMA, which sets out how the two regulators will collaborate further in future, for example through information sharing and the potential for joint projects.

953,"May 18, 2021",DuckDuckGo Wants True “One-click” Search Competition On Android,"


Consumers deserve a competitive search market where the search engines they want are actually “just one click away” wrote Duck Duck Go in a blogpost. A properly designed search preference menu can accomplish “one click away” search competition if search engines have an easy way to guide consumers to the menu.
Google adopted a so-called “choice screen” on Android in the EU region — which prompts device users to pick a default search engine from a selection of options (Google auctions slots to rivals).
But the choice is more of a one-shot than a dynamic, ongoing possibility to switch the default for Android users — as they are only asked to choose their default choice on set up of a new device or after a factory reset.
“That means, for all practical purposes, if you want to change your default device search engine again easily, you can’t,” writes DuckDuckGo in its latest blog post pushing for reform of Google’s self-serving Android ‘remedy’.
By DDG’s count it takes 15+ clicks (not one) to switch default search engine on an Android device at any other point (i.e. after initial set up or factory reset). And it says it knows “from experience” that this over-15-clicks method “trips up almost everyone”.
“In other words, one click competition becomes in fact ‘one factory reset away’,” it goes on. “The only reasons we can think of for setting up a preference menu this way are anti-competitive ones.”
The pro-privacy search engine has been banging the drum on this point for months at this point. Nor is it alone in complaining about Google’s remedy. And complaints aren’t limited to how hard it is to switch search engines at any other point after set-up, either.

954,"May 17, 2021","South Africa Launches Probe Into Takealot, UberEats & Other Online Markets","


The South Africa Competition Commission (Comp Comm) has the likes of Takealot, Airbnb, Uber Eats, and Google Play in its sights, as it’s preparing to launch its Online Intermediation Platforms Market Inquiry on Tuesday, May 18.
According to a report on Business Tech, the Competition Commission claims that its investigation will cover online markets in which the sales of goods and services are transacted between businesses and consumers. This essentially means that e-commerce marketplaces, in which consumers can buy anything from food, to software, accommodations, and travel (on ride-sharing apps, for example) will be under the spotlight.
The report goes on to state that the Comp Comm has identified several corporate entities that are cause for concern. Among them are Takealot (and by extension Superbalist), Uber Eats and Mr Delivery, Airbnb, Google Play, and the Apple App Store.
While all these entities operate in different spaces (food delivery, online shopping, app purchases, and the like), the Commission’s complaint about all of them is the same: they all hold a very dominant position and, in some instances, are the only options for their consumers.
“Online markets have become an increasingly important channel for businesses to reach consumers, a trend which has accelerated under the Covid-19 pandemic and which is likely to continue,” the Commission said in a statement.
“Online markets provide consumers with the convenience of comparing a wide range of options and then safely purchasing online. For businesses, the online markets offer a ready-made infrastructure to sell online and a means to reach an enormous number of consumers nationally and internationally.”

955,"May 13, 2021",US Senate Panel Passes Bill To Raise Merger Fees For Big Deals,"


A bill to increase the fees that companies planning the biggest mergers pay to government antitrust agencies and to give those agencies bigger budgets passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, May 13, on a voice vote. 
The bill – co-sponsored by Amy Klobuchar, the top antitrust senator, and Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee – would lower the fee for smaller mergers under US$161.5 million from US$45,000 to US$30,000. But for deals worth US$5 billion or more, the fee would rise from US$280,000 to US$2.25 million.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Justice Department’s Antitrust Division assess mergers to ensure that they comply with antitrust law.
The bill would increase authorizations to each, giving the FTC a budget of $418 million while the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division would receive US$252 million.
In brief remarks before the vote, Klobuchar said the fees had not changed since 2001, and that the Justice Department sued Alphabet’s Google last year while the FTC filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Facebook.
“You just cannot take on the biggest companies in the world with duct tape and Band-Aids,” she said.
Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said in comments during a discussion of the bill that he was “quite disappointed by the lax antitrust enforcement we saw in the previous administration.”

956,"May 12, 2021",Amazon Wins Appeal Over $300M EU Tax Bill,"


Amazon struck a new blow to European Union efforts to wring more tax from big tech companies when the bloc’s second-highest court sided with the company over a US$300 million tax bill, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The EU court on Wednesday, May 12, annulled a 2017 decision from the European Commission, the EU’s top antitrust authority, that had ordered Amazon to pay €250 million in taxes to Luxembourg, the latest of several big EU tax decisions to be overturned.
In its decision, the court backed Amazon, saying that EU regulators had failed to prove that the company got an illegal advantage from tax rulings issued by Luxembourg, and saying that the Commission’s analysis had been “incorrect in several respects.”
Amazon stated it welcomed the decision, “which is in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment.”
The ruling is a significant blow to Margrethe Vestager, an executive vice president of the Commission who is leading a campaign to curb alleged excesses by some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, and Alphabe’s Google.
Ms. Vestager had already been rebuked once by the same court in a similar case. The General Court overturned her 2016 order that Ireland must recoup some €13 billion in taxes from Apple. Ms. Vestager has since appealed that case to the Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

Attorneys general from 45 states and territories cited calls from Republicans and Democrats for a “more robust antitrust enforcement across a multitude of markets.” The officials did not say in the letter how much they needed.
“An appropriation of federal funding for state antitrust enforcement, particularly with respect to Big Tech litigation, will inure to the benefit of the economy and consumers throughout the United States,” they wrote in a letter to Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mike Lee, the chair and top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel.
The letter was also addressed to Representatives David Cicilline and Ken Buck, their counterparts in the House of Representatives.

958,"May 4, 2021",CPI Talks… with KFTC Chairperson Joh Sung-wook,"

In this edition of CPI Talks… we have the pleasure of speaking with Ms. Joh Sung-wook, Chairperson of the Korea Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”).
Thank you, Ms. Joh Sung-wook, for sharing your time for this interview with CPI.
 
1. The KFTC recently celebrated its 40th As such, the KFTC is one of the most mature enforcement agencies in Asia. What would you consider to be the KFTC’s most significant achievements in its first three decades of existence?
Only a half century ago, Korea was one of the least developed countries in Asia with a GDP per capita of only USD 279 in 1970. KFTC helped Korea become a fair, competitive, market-oriented economy, which drove its rapid economic growth and transformed it into one of the world’s most innovative economic powerhouses; Korea’s economy has grown over 100 times to become the 10th largest economy in the world with a GDP per capita of USD 30,644 in 2020.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Korea lacked capital, so its government’s state-led development strategy invested in target industries, such as steel, shipbuilding, and petroleum processing. These profitable industries quickly grew the economy but also created monopolies.
To tackle this issue, the government enacted the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (“MRFTA”) in 1980, which established the Korea Fair Trade Commission in 1981. Under MRFTA, we promoted competition by being a fair umpire, monitoring cartels, investigating abuse of market dominance, and punishing abusers with fines or prosecution. Also, we enacted the Subcontracting Act in 1984 to protect SMEs and micro businesses with little bargaining power, thereby broadening our economy.
To strengthen consumer rights and welfare, we enacted the 1980 Frame Act on Consumers and the 2002Act on the Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce (the “E-commerce act”). To foster a fair market ecology, KFTC ensured fair transactions in the Korean economy to build and maintain consumer trust, thereby serving as an effective gardener that ensures fertile soil to birth and grow companies with new products and services.
In short, KFTC promotes competition, investigates abuse of market dominance, and protects smaller firms and consumers — thereby contributing to Korea’s economic miracle.
2. Moving on from the KFTC’s 40th anniversary, what will be its priorities for its fourth decade and beyond? Specifically, what industries or sectors do you foresee will be of the greatest significance for the KFTC?
The advancement of information and communications technology ICT has (a) increased contact-free and online transactions; and (b) accelerated digitization of the economy via platforms and big data. Hence, KFTC will focus on promoting fair transactions in the digital economy.
Thanks to the growth of the digital economy, businesses have greater access to more markets, and consumers can enjoy old and new products and services with low search costs. However, network effects and tipping points can drive large platform dominance. Such platform tech giants can abuse their monopoly power via unfair, anti-competitive business practices. For example, big platforms can unfairly extend their dominance in one market into adjacent markets and use their market power to extract concessions from online stores. These platforms can also exploit consumer information by selling or sharing it with business clients/associates or inadequately protecting it from outsiders — all of which violates consumer privacy. In short, big platforms can abuse their power to harm both businesses and consumers.
Hence, KFTC will prioritize promoting fair transactions in the online platform sector. For example, online suppliers might restrict the online sales of distributors, so KFTC will prohibit this. We plan to implement policies that establish transparent and fair transaction relationships between large platforms and online stores. In addition, we also require for platforms to take appropriate responsibilities depending on their roles in online business transactions. By doing so, we extend our umpire and gardener roles into the digital realm, by (a) monitoring and investigating big platforms for abuse of their market dominance; and (b) nurturing a safe transaction environment for smaller businesses and consumers.
3. The KFTC is soon to set out its work plan for 2021. Among other things, its 2020 work plan set out plans to focus on issues relating to mobile platforms, online platforms, standard-essential patents, and the 5G semiconductor business. Will the 2021 plan differ substantially from the 2020 plan, particularly in light of the intervening COVID-19 pandemic?
COVID-19 accelerated the growth of the digital and contact-free economy. As platforms have become essential players in the digital economy, KFTC will focus on online platforms in two parallel lines: (a) legislation and institutionalization; and (b) investigation.
First, KFTC’s deep understanding of the multi-faceted nature of transactions in the online platform sector (platform to platform [P2P], platform to businesses [P2B], and platform to consumers [P2C] relations) will inform systematic and comprehensive measures to foster competition, protect consumers, and grow the digital economy.
Specifically, KFTC proposed the Act on Fair Intermediate Transactions on Online Platforms (the “Online Platform Act”) to ensure a transparent and fair business environment for platforms and online businesses. Unfair contracts had unfavorable terms and conditions in over-the-top (“OTT”) platforms, crowd funding, online learning and delivery app sectors. To tackle these problems, KFTC requires platforms to provide contracts with specific, essential components for their transactions with online businesses. To ensure that platforms fulfill their responsibility to protect consumers, we plan to amend the 2002 E-commerce Act. In addition, KFTC will revise guidelines for monopolistic conducts in the online platform sector. The new guidelines will specify criteria for market definition and market dominance that reflect the multi-faceted characteristics of the platform market, including criteria for assessing anti-competitiveness of practices by platforms.
Second, KFTC is improving its binoculars to detect unfair practices in the digital economy. Last year, we launched the ICT Task Force to monitor online platforms, mobile, intellectual property rights and semiconductor sectors for anti-competitive practices by its dominant firms. This year, we plan to add two more divisions to the ICT Task Force for app-marketplace and online-to-offline (“O2O”) platforms. All of this will help KFTC see the digital economy more clearly.
As contact-free transactions grew, online deception also grew. Fake consumer reviews, dark nudges like pre-checked “Yes” boxes, and other online deception harm consumers, so KFTC will spotlight them to discourage them, inform consumers, determine appropriate regulations, and ultimately prevent them.
Lastly, we will help businesses, especially vulnerable small and micro ones, see their changing digital environment more clearly to make better business decisions. For example, off-line businesses must consider online competitors as well as off-line ones. To provide business with material information to gauge their competition more accurately, KFTC will encourage franchise headquarters to share online sales information with franchisees. When firms see their digital environment more clearly, they can make better business decisions to survive, grow, and contribute to Korea’s economy.

The KFTC’s recent enforcement action against Naver, the leading search engine in Korea, regarding alleged search algorithm manipulation to give preference to its paid advertisement customers, bears remarkable parallels to similar actions against Google in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere. What has the KFTC learned from these investigations? And what lessons does the KFTC’s experience have to teach other enforcers worldwide?
As the digital economy grew, large platforms dominated their markets and become “gatekeepers” that allow or prevent transactions between businesses and consumers. For example, platforms decide how to display search results for goods and services, and can unfairly show their own/friendly vendors before rivals (self-preferencing).
Self-preferencing is the heart of both the Naver and Google cases. Both tech giants’ self-preferencing extended their search market dominance to unfairly pursue online shopping market dominance. So, these two cases demonstrate the need for competition authorities to detect self-preferencing and other unfair practices by thoroughly monitoring gatekeepers acting as both intermediaries and sellers.
Naver exploited its dominance over search engines for unfair, anti-competitive actions in many markets, including online shopping, online real-estate brokerage, and online video platforms. As each market has different business tactics, technologies, and market structures, investigating all of them takes a lot of time, people, and resources, so relying on reactive, law enforcement alone to restore fair, competitive environments in all markets is slow and expensive. Therefore, all competition authorities also need proactive measures for prevention and voluntary correction of unfair practices across markets; informing platforms, other firms, and consumers of fair and unfair practices activates stakeholders not only (a) to file earlier complaints with greater accuracy; but, especially, (b) to expect, demand, negotiate, and engage in fairer transactions and behaviors.
Specifically, KFTC proposed the Online Platform Act to encourage platforms to disclose information about their criteria for displaying ranked search results for products and services sold on their platforms, thereby hindering unfair self-preferencing while increasing predictability for platform users.
5. The KFTC has been active in promoting a new law for fair intermediate transaction on online platforms, which will apply to every business acting as an intermediary between a consumer and an online platform. Please outline the key aspects of this legislation. Has the KFTC learned from similar initiatives elsewhere? What aspects of this legislation could teach lessons to regulators worldwide?
KFTC is advocating for the Online Platform Act (“OPA”) to increase the transparency and fairness of transactions between online platforms and online stores, thereby fostering a digital ecology with mutually beneficial relations.
First, OPA requires online platforms whose revenue exceed USD 90 million in 2020 to provide contracts with essential terms, such as a standard for charging service fees. Second, OPA requires platforms to notify their online stores in advance before changing the contract terms, restricting services, or terminating them. Third, OPA translates and details MRFTA’s existing provisions on prohibition of abuse of market dominance to online platforms.
When drafting OPA, KFTC examined EU and Japan’s corresponding regulations governing online platforms, which also tried to improve transparency and fairness in transactions involving influential gatekeepers.
OPA reaffirms our strong commitment to enhancing transparency and fairness in online platform transactions by taking a balanced regulatory approach for fostering and growing innovation in new industries.

Verizon announced on Monday, May 3, that it is selling off its media business, which includes Yahoo and AOL, to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for US$5 billion. The telecom giant will still own 10% of Verizon Media, which is simply being called Yahoo!.
“The past two quarters of double-digit growth have demonstrated our ability to transform our media ecosystem,” said Guru Gowrappan, CEO, Verizon Media, in a press release. “With Apollo’s sector expertise and strategic insight, Yahoo will be well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities.”
Verizon Media also has a digital advertising platform. Gowrappan will lead the newly named Yahoo.
Apollo is “thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Reed Rayman, private equity partner at Apollo. He praised Verizon Media’s team and its progress in recent years.
“Verizon Media has done an incredible job turning the business around over the past two and a half years — and the growth potential is enormous,” said Hans Vestberg, CEO, Verizon. “During the strategic review process, Apollo delivered the strongest vision and strategy for the next phase of Verizon Media. I have full confidence that Yahoo will take off in its new home.”
The deal is the latest drama for two of the internet’s earliest powerhouses. AOL was once the go-to service that most people used to get online, while Yahoo was a top search engine. Since the 1990s, however, the two have been supplanted by search engine Google and social media powerhouse Facebook. Verizon Media also publishes online news sources Yahoo Sports and TechCrunch.

960,"April 30, 2021",EU Accuses Apple Of Antitrust Breach After Spotify Complaint,"


European Union regulators accused Apple on Friday, April 30, of violating the bloc’s antitrust laws, alleging the iPhone maker distorts competition for music streaming by imposing unfair rules for rival services in its App Store.
The EU’s executive Commission stated it objected to Apple’s rules for music streaming services that compete with its Apple Music service, claiming they end up costing consumers more and limiting their choices.
The charges underscore the long-running feud over app payments between Apple and popular music streaming service Spotify, which filed a complaint that sparked the investigation – one of four the company is facing from the EU. Regulators in Brussels are also investigating other big US tech companies like Amazon and Google, amid a growing global movement to rein in their power.
The EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, outlined two main concerns. One centers on Apple’s practice of forcing app developers selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.

France’s competition agency has concluded an investigation into banks, Big Tech, and the financial technology (FinTech) sectors, with a warning that vigilance is needed due to “significant changes in the payments sector, characterized in particular by the arrival of major digital platforms.”
The competition agency stated there is “the risk of marginalization, in the long term, of traditional banking actors.” The agency pointed to newer technologies — such as cloud computing, contactless payment, and blockchain — as notable developments. In response, French banks are adapting to the new digital ecosystem by investing in FinTechs along with their own research and developments. Also, banks have struck deals with Big Tech.
The probe, which started in January of last year, concluded that “technological innovation and regulatory changes have allowed the arrival in the payments sector of new players, FinTechs and Big Techs, who have developed, alongside traditional banking players, innovative payment methods for consumers, and new diversified services” for businesses.
The Autorite de la Concurrence stated that one of the big changes has been the emergence of Big Tech platforms in the payments sector, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Amazon Pay. The report stated that these companies have not been subject to the same regulatory constraints as traditional banks. Now, the European Payments Initiative “should finally make it possible to create a pan-European payment system that could connect banks to each other without using current networks, such as Visa and Mastercard.”

Microsoft will decrease the share of money it charges independent developers that publish PC games on its online store, starting in August, reported The New York Times.
Developers will keep 88% of the revenue from their games, up from 70%. That could make Microsoft’s store more attractive to independent studios than competitors like Valve’s gaming store, called Steam, which typically starts by taking a 30% cut. Epic Games’ store takes 12%.
“We want to make sure that we’re competitive in the market,” said Sarah Bond, a Microsoft vice president who leads the gaming ecosystem organization. “Our objective is to have a leading revenue share and really a leading platform.”
The share of revenue that developers get to keep has come under greater scrutiny across the tech industry. Google and Apple have faced antitrust questions for the 30% fees they charge developers whose programs appear in their app stores.

963,"April 29, 2021",Supreme Court Gives Competition a Booster Shot in Landmark Fair Use Decision,"
by: John Bergmayer (Public Knowledge)
I’m happy about the Supreme Court’s 6-2 decision in Google v. Oracle, affirming that Google’s reimplementation of the Java API for Android was a fair use and thus not copyright infringement. Google and Oracle’s competitions can breathe a sigh of relief, since a result that went the other way could have seriously inhibited the ability of smaller companies and new entrants to compete with established software giants.
Oracle is less happy, and frames the decision differently. In its statement, it says that the decision makes “the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower.” The opposite is true.
It is correct that only companies like Google can afford to litigate a case for a decade, all the way to the Supreme Court. But now that it has done so, others can rely on the precedent it set, and its holding that reimplementing a software API to create a competing or compatible version is a fair use as a matter of law. This is a very strong fair use opinion that would seem to cover most kinds of API reimplementation, which the court correctly found is essential to competition, new market entry, and interoperability. 
It is also true that even with strong precedent on your side, you might still have to litigate a fair use case, since fair use is so fact-specific. In many ways it would have been cleaner if the Court had recognized that APIs should not receive any copyright protection at all, as Public Knowledge asked the Court to do. At the same time, the Court’s reasoning is not limited to APIs and would seem to cover other forms of compatibility, cloning, and reverse engineering. Some of the Court’s reasoning might have applicability beyond software—not just its lucid description of the purpose of copyright itself (to promote the creation of new works, which includes allowing the creation of new works via fair use) but in other areas. For example, in its analysis of the fourth fair use factor—effect on the market—the Court noted that plaintiffs cannot simply assert that they have lost revenue from the fair use itself, as this is simply circular, and that courts must look to the broader public benefits that could result from a fair use holding, not just the effect on the parties to the case…

964,"April 29, 2021",Identifying the Market In the Facebook Antitrust Case,"
By: Herbert Hovenkamp (ProMarket)
In late 2020, the Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust suit accusing Facebook of monopolization. Every antitrust case claiming an unlawful monopoly must identify a “market” that the defendant is monopolizing. Past defendants often produced a single, readily identifiable product such as aluminum ingot, cellophane, or Intel-based computer operating systems. Often, parties dispute the boundaries of these markets. For example, should the cellophane market be broadened to include wax paper and tin foil? Or should the operating system market in Microsoft be broadened to include Apple’s operating system?
Facebook has generated a different kind of dispute, however, which is that the grouping of products it offers is not a “market” at all. A fundamental proposition of economics since the nineteenth century is that markets are made up of close substitutes. Competition occurs inside a market because it defines the range of a customer’s choices. For example, we say that three gasoline stations in a two-block area are in the same market. Customers can choose among them, so they must compete for that customer’s business. A station fifty miles away is not in the same market if it is not a realistic option, nor is a grocer that is nearby but does not sell gasoline.
The FTC claims that Facebook monopolizes a market for “personal social networking services.” That includes services that are quite dissimilar, however. For example, Facebook offers general messaging, two-party chatting, posting of photographs and videos, discussion boards, a marketplace and digital advertising, and even a kind of dating platform. Facebook moved to dismiss the case by stating that the FTC “has not alleged a plausible relevant market.”  A similar issue is likely to arise in the Google antitrust case, as well as a potential future case against Amazon. To date, the lawsuits against Apple have focused mainly on its control of app sales through its Appstore.
So what binds Facebook’s diverse assembly of products into a “market”? Facebook’s individual services are clearly not close substitutes for one another. Further, many firms offer individual services that compete with one of Facebook’s services. For many of these, Facebook is not the biggest. For example, it is not the biggest messaging app, platform for hosting photos or videos, or even digital advertising platform. This is also true of Amazon, which has less-than-dominant market shares in most of the individual products that it sells, save ebooks….

Verizon is exploring a sale of assets including Yahoo and AOL, as the telecommunications giant looks to exit an expensive and unsuccessful bet on digital media, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The sales process, which includes private-equity firm Apollo Global could lead to a deal worth $4 billion to $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter—assuming there is one. Other details couldn’t be learned.
Verizon splashed out billions of dollars assembling a portfolio of once-dominant websites, including AOL in 2015, and Yahoo in 2017, paying more than $9 billion in total to acquire the pair.
Verizon, the country’s largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers, bought the websites intending to resurrect brands that had lost traffic since their heyday but still counted a base of hundreds of millions of account holders.
It reorganized the businesses in 2017 under former AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong, dubbing the combined division “Oath” and signaling its intention to go head to head with digital-advertising powerhouses like AlphabetInc.’s Google and FacebookInc.

966,"April 28, 2021",Facebook Appeals Giphy Merger Restrictions In The UK,"


On Wednesday Facebook argued to an appellate court that the UK’s antitrust enforcer cannot use interim measures during merger reviews to “regulate the structure of competition” across markets. Facebook is looking to challenge the restrictions imposed by the CMA while investigating its purchase of Giphy, saying the restraints are too broad.
Earlier this month Britain’s competition regulator said that it was referring Facebook’s acquisition of GIF database Giphy for an in-depth investigation.
The watchdog says it found evidence that Giphy had plans to expand its digital advertising partnerships to the UK and other markets before the deal was reached. It believes Giphy’s combination with Facebook would mean the firm has less incentive to expand its digital ads business, leading to a potential loss of competition.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation,” a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.
“This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services — from developers to service providers to content creators,” the spokesperson added.
Giphy is one of the world’s top libraries for GIFs, animated images involving memes or pop culture references that are shared on the internet. It competes with the likes of Google-owned GIF platform Tenor and the start-up Gfycat.
Though both Giphy and Facebook are headquartered in the U.S., the CMA has the power to investigate mergers when the business being acquired has annual revenues of at least £70 million ($96.5 million) or when the combined businesses have at least a 25% share of any “reasonable” market.

967,"April 26, 2021",Rawlsian Antitrust,"
This paper attempts to reconcile the goals of competition and equality within antitrust, and suggests that this task corresponds to John Rawls’ efforts to reconcile liberalism and equality within his principles of justice. Applying a Rawlsian analysis, I propose the adoption of inclusivity as a secondary objective within competition law (not as an additional primary objective, as under a public interest test), and suggest that this approach might be labelled Rawlsian Antitrust. In locating this approach among the existing established schools of thought, I emphasize both its economic basis, and the clarity of its values, and how the reconciliation between those might be operationalized. I identify pro-enforcement and more cautious factions within this approach, and suggest that between them lie the tools that will hardwire inclusivity into competition policy. These will help make competition policy play its role within a coherent policy response to the need for greater inclusivity, arguably the great challenge of our time, which was first stirred, and then made urgent by successive crises that have shaken our world, and which now threaten to burn down the technocratic antitrust chateau.

Phone calls from prisons and jails are extremely costly for inmates and their families. In this article, we examine the market structure of inmate calling services and the inherent market failures that lead to such high calling rates. We determine that there is a classic anticompetitive problem involving vulnerable populations captive to a monopolist service provider, and discuss the Federal Communications Commission’s attempts to lower these rates. In addition to phone call expenses, we discuss other costs such as the disproportionate effects on People of Color and lower-income individuals, the impact on recidivism and inmate mental health, and other welfare harm, and show that lowering these rates would further the goal of inclusive competition.

By Coleman Bazelon & Paroma Sanyal1
             
The concept of Inclusive Competition means that antitrust should not improve or preserve competitive dynamics to the benefit of only certain parts of the population, but rather, takes into account how competitive dynamics may be improved for the benefit of all segments of the population. Indeed, it might look particularly at vulnerable populations captive to certain providers of goods or services or market dynamics, who are not reaping the benefits of competition that antitrust seeks to provide. In this article, we discuss our experience analyzing the competitive dynamics that impact one such captive audience.

Apple was questioned on its inability to rein in subscription scammers on its App Store during’s Senate antitrust hearing, reported TechCrunch. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.
One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, has made it his mission to highlight some of the most egregious scams on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses.
Some of the more notable scams he’s uncovered as of late include a crypto wallet app that scammed a user out of his life savings (~US$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids game that actually contained a hidden online casino; and a VPN app scamming users out of US$5 million per year. And, of course, there’s the scam that lit the fire in the first place: A competitor to Eleftheriou’s own Apple Watch app that he alleges scammed users out of US$2 million per year, after stealing his marketing materials, cloning his app, and buying fake reviews to make the scammer’s look like the better choice.
In a line of questioning from Georgia’s Senator Jon Ossoff, Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was asked why Apple was not able to locate scams, given that these fraudulent apps are, as Ossoff put it, “trivially easy to identify as scams.”
He asked why do we have rely upon “open-source reporting and journalists” to find the app scams — a reference that likely, at least in part, referred to Eleftheriou’s recent activities.

Columbia Law School professor Lina Khan, whom President Joe Biden has nominated to serve on the Federal Trade Commission, told lawmakers antitrust enforcers need to scrutinize the power that large technology companies have over digital markets, from app stores to online journalism., Bloomberg reported.
Khan, testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday, April 21, said Apple and Google in particular have too much power, according to Bloomberg. She cited Apple’s taking of 30% commission from developers as something that can’t be justified.
Khan, 32, is the first Biden nominee for an antitrust position. Bloomberg reported that she came to prominence with a research paper about Amazon, in which she argued that the eCommerce giant represents a harmful monopoly and puts practices in play that merit a rethinking of antitrust enforcement in the US.
Khan spoke in her testimony of some missed opportunities in the recent past to stop acquisitions because of a “mistaken” view that digital markets should be disrupted by new competitors, according to Bloomberg. She said it is important to be “more vigilant” in the examining of some of the acquisitions.
For journalism in particular, Khan said the dominance of digital ads and the “arbitrary” power of algorithms have damaged smaller, more local publishing, Bloomberg reported.
Khan has worked as an advisor for the FTC and helped author the findings of a 16-month investigation into Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook that took aim at their allegedly abusive gatekeeping powers, according to Bloomberg. During her testimony, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah inquired if that work would force her to recuse herself on investigating the companies, and Khan responded she had no financial conflicts, although she said she would follow all ethics guidelines.

Earlier this year, the CMA invited third parties to comment on the merger ahead of a formal antitrust investigation. That investigation will probe the deal’s possible effects on competition in the UK.
In February, US federal regulators opened an investigation into the purchase while soliciting information from third parties.

Apple has approved Parler’s return to the iOS app store following improvements the social media company made to better detect and moderate hate speech and incitement, according to a letter the iPhone maker sent to Congress on Monday, April 19. 
The decision clears the way for Parler, an app popular with conservatives including some members of the far right, to be downloaded once again on Apple devices. The letter — addressed to Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Ken Buck and obtained by CNN — explained that since the app was removed from Apple’s platform in January for violations of its policies, Parler “has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices.” 
On April 14, Apple’s app review team told Parler that its proposed changes were sufficient, the letter continued. Now, all Parler needs to do is to flip the switch. “Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it,” Apple’s letter read. 
Parler, an alternative to Facebook and Twitter that bills itself as a haven for free speech, was removed from major tech platforms in early January following the US Capitol riots of January 6. Parler was kicked off of Apple and Google’s app stores, as well as Amazon Web Services, which had been hosting the company’s product. 
All three tech giants cited the presence of violent speech on Parler as a reason for removal; Parler later stated that other vendors also cut ties with the company, effectively shutting the service down and making it inaccessible on the web. For several weeks, visitors to Parler’s website were greeted by a static page instead of a functioning social networking app.

977,"April 12, 2021",Antitrust and Privacy Are on a Collision Course,"


By Gilad Edelman, Wired
Here’s something to puzzle over. In December, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of states filed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook, alleging that as the company grew more dominant and faced less competition, it reneged on its promises to protect user privacy. In March, a different coalition of states, led by Texas, accused Google of exclusionary conduct related to its plan to get rid of third-party cookies in Chrome. In other words, one tech giant is being sued for weakening privacy protections while another is being sued for strengthening them. How can this be?
That question, and others like it, are going to become increasingly urgent over the next few years. Antitrust enforcers are bringing cases against the biggest tech companies while states enact new privacy laws and Congress prepares (maybe, perhaps, hopefully) to pass one of its own. Meanwhile, those very companies are making all sorts of splashy changes to their privacy policies even as the government lawyers close in. If policymakers and enforcers can’t figure out the right way to think about how to reconcile privacy law with competition law, they risk badly screwing up both.

There are already over 3 million consumers and small businesses using these products each month and take-up has been particularly rapid among small businesses.

The UK was the first country in the world to implement open banking but now around 603 jurisdictions have either adopted it or are seriously considering doing so. This paper sets out the problems that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) was trying to address when we mandated open banking and the o...

Following an upward trend in the global agenda for digital-driven economies, Open Banking has emerged as a hot topic in Brazil. Since 2018, the Central Bank of Brazil has been playing a major role to stimulate debates and foster initiatives aimed at developing a national Open Banking framework as a measure with the potential to add new features and change the course of the Brazilian financial sector, so as to pave the way for a more competitive, efficient, innovative, transparent and inclusive financial system able to better address customers’ needs, besides empowering them with control over their personal data. However, in order to secure positive effects on both the national economy and society at large, the implementation of a suitable framework in Brazil requires that the protection of personal data, the financial awareness and the privacy rights remain at the foreground of the design of Open Banking products and services.

Open Banking has emerged as a worldwide agenda regarding the financial sector and is a buzzword when discussing policy frameworks to promote competition among financial players.2
As a matter of fact, the Brazilian landscape reflects this take. In recent years, both regulatory and competition authorities and customers have witnessed the consolidation of the national financial sector ...

A senior Apple executive has agreed to testify before the US Senate on competition issues related to mobile app stores, days after panel leaders criticized the company for refusing to appear.
The company wrote in a letter sent to senators, seen by Reuters, that Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer will be available to testify at an April 21 hearing held by part of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
App makers have long complained that mandatory revenue sharing payments and strict inclusion rules set by Apple’s App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google’s Play store for Android devices, amount to anticompetitive behavior.
On Friday, April 9, US Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Mike Lee, a Republican, sent a letter to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook calling it “unacceptable” the company was refusing to send a witness. The pair are leaders of the Senate Judiciary panel’s subcommittee on competition policy and antitrust.

Apple is refusing to testify at an upcoming US Senate subcommittee hearing on competition issues related to mobile app stores, reported Reuters.
App makers have long accused Apple’s App Store for iPhones and iPads, along with Google’s Play store for Android devices, of engaging in anticompetitive behavior by requiring certain revenue sharing payments and setting strict inclusion rules. A subcommittee hearing was being planned for late April, but no date has been set yet.
Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Mike Lee, a Republican, said they wrote to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Friday, April 9, urging the company to reconsider.
“A little more than two weeks before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness,” the letter read. “Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify… is unacceptable.”
Apple and game maker Epic Games are scheduled to square off on those issues in a federal trial beginning May 3 in California.

An Australian judge has ruled that Epic’s lawsuit against Apple in Australia will be temporarily suspended as the two sides prepare for a trial in the US, Gizmodo Australia reported.
Apple had asked for a permanent stay of the case in Australia, arguing that the US and Australia cases were very similar, and that the matter should be settled in the original jurisdiction of the US.
The two companies are fighting over Epic’s battle royale game Fortnite, and the fees Apple charges. In August, Epic set up its own in-game payments system, effectively circumventing Apple’s App Store payments and avoiding the 30% surcharge Apple collects on App Store purchases. Apple then removed Fortnite from its iOS App Store for violating its rules. Epic fired back with an antitrust lawsuit seeking to establish Apple’s App Store as a monopoly and tried to rally Fortnite fans with a protest video mocking Apple’s iconic “1984” ad.
In November, Epic filed a similar legal claim against Apple in Australia, saying the iPhone maker’s conduct was “unconscionable, and breaches the Australian Consumer Law as well as various sections of the Competition and Consumer Act [of] 2010.” Epic has also filed similar claims against Google and its mobile app store. 
Australian Judge Nye Perram ordered Friday, April 9, that the case in that country be temporarily stayed for three months. He also said the proceedings will continue to be suspended in Australia if Epic continues to pursue its case in the US, but could bring the case back to Australian courts depending on the outcome in the US.

983,"April 8, 2021",Epic Games & Apple Outline Their Arguments Ahead Of Trial,"


Epic Games and Apple outlined their arguments in a dispute over Apple’s control of the App Store before an antitrust trial set to begin next month through their own separate legal filings, CNBC reported.
Apple will contend that its 30% commission basically matches that of digital stores such as Google Play or shops for video game hardware, while its fee has fallen over time. It will also contend, among other arguments, that its policies have brought about a boom in the software sector and led to more security and safety for users.
However, Epic will contend that Apple manages the single avenue to install software on an iPhone by the way of the App Store. It will also argue that Apple harnesses its Apple Review workflow for anti-competitive ends, among other claims.
Epic Games, which is renowned for its Fortnite program, has been in a legal disagreement with Apple since 2020, when Epic Games attempted to steer clear of Apple’s 30% App Store commission via a technology update that avoided Apple’s payments infrastructure. Apple, in turn, removed Fortnite from its App Store.
In March, news surfaced that Epic Games is suing Google in Australia over allegedly anti-competitive behavior that contravenes the nation’s antitrust rules. “Google gives the illusion of being open by making arguments about the presence of alternative app stores on its platform or allowing direct downloading of apps from third-party providers, but in reality, these situations are so rare that they barely make a dent in the monopoly of the Android OS,” Tim Sweeney, Epic founder and chief executive officer, wrote in a March blog post.

The UK launched a new regulatory body aimed at policing allegations of anticompetitive behavior among the world’s largest technology companies, adding another agency to a growing list of watchdogs scrutinizing how tech giants use their market heft.
Britain’s new Digital Markets Unit will be tasked with making sure tech giants like Facebook and Alphabet’s Google don’t exploit any market dominance to crowd out competition, officials said. The new unit was unveiled last year but launched officially—with limited powers at first—late Tuesday, April 6.
It won’t be able to levy fines until Parliament approves legislation governing its oversight power, a legal framework that is expected to be in place by next year. Meanwhile, the agency is hiring staff and will begin drawing up what would become a legally binding code of conduct for companies once that legislation passes.
The new UK unit comes amid Europe’s biggest expansion of global tech regulation in years. The continent has often led the world in regulating technology companies, but Washington and Beijing have both begun to increase their own scrutiny recently. The US filed two major antitrust lawsuits against Google and Facebook in December. The two companies have argued that they don’t abuse their market power.

985,"April 7, 2021", Indian CEO Says Regulating Big Tech Requires Delicate Balance,"


Tech regulation is a delicate balancing act and cannot be implemented too early or too late, according to the CEO of Tech Mahindra, reported CNBC.
His personal belief is that “the regulator should chase innovation,” CP Gurnani told CNBC on Tuesday, April 6, as part of the World Economic Forum Global Technology Governance Summit.  
“The need for tech governance only comes in when you have a problem or when you anticipate a problem,” he said. “You do it too soon you stifle it (innovation). You’re doing it too late, you allow the misuse to happen.”
His comments come as US tech giants like Google and Facebook face increasing scrutiny from regulators in the USs, as well as in Europe and the rest of the world.
The EU has been leading the fight against Big Tech, pushing for new rules that focus on increasing competition and making online platforms responsible for the content they host.
While tech regulation is necessary at this stage globally, Gurnani argued that “ethical governance” is the better way forward. He explained it means educating people on “what is right and what is wrong.”
“I am convinced that governance too soon means bad for innovations, bad for (research and development) and bad for that early initiative guy who creates,” he said.

986,"April 7, 2021",US Justice Thomas Wants To Changes To Big Tech Regulation,"
Big technology platform players like Facebook and Google could see massive changes in regulations if US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas gets traction on his idea that the segment should be regulated like utilities, CNBC reported on Tuesday, April 6.
The conservative associate justice, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, voiced his opinion in a concurrence submitted with a decision to vacate a lower court’s ruling regarding former President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, noted CNBC.
“As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms. The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions,” Thomas wrote in part of his 12-page decision. “There is a fair argument that some digital platforms are sufficiently akin to common carriers or places of accommodation to be regulated in this manner,” he added.
The Supreme Court decision negated a federal appeals court ruling that Trump violated the Constitution by keeping anyone critical of him off his Twitter feed. The lower court’s opinion was that excluding some citizens from a public forum violates their First Amendment rights. Since Trump is no longer in office, the Supreme Court said the case is moot. With the dismissal, the federal appeals court decision cannot be used as a precedent for future cases.
“Any control Mr. Trump exercised over the account greatly paled in comparison to Twitter’s authority, dictated in its terms of service, to remove the account ‘at any time for any or no reason,’” Thomas wrote.
In order for digital platforms to be regulated the same as utilities, there would have to be basic changes to how the companies currently operate, the report noted. Any such changes could make it difficult for social platforms to moderate posts and comments for hate speech, fake news, nudity and harassment. Democrats have largely been lobbying for tech platforms to take on more liability if they choose to host illegal or unsavory content and to hold them accountable for removing it in a timely manner.

987,"April 6, 2021",Data Privacy and Competition Protection in Europe: Convergence or Conflict?,"
By Laura Liguori & Enzo Marasà & Irene Picciano1
In a recent interview,2 Europe’s antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, warned Apple that its recent changes to privacy rules must not give preferential treatment to its apps over those of its competitors or it might be in violation of antitrust norms. Apple has framed those changes as being designed to protect users’ personal data, but that does not exempt its actions from competition rules.
This warning came in reaction to recent changes to the Cupertino-based group’s privacy policy, which led other platforms in the digital advertising market to accuse it of unduly distorting competition. Specifically, the changes to Apple’s privacy policy will make blocking ad tracker software targeting users’ personal data the default setting on all apps sold for use on Apple devices (meaning through the Apple Store). Apple users can choose to allow ad tracking of their data, but they must actively provide consent. At first glance, this seems to give users more control over their own privacy and looks as though it is a response to the recommendations of the authorities responsible for application of the GDPR. However, on closer inspection it becomes clear that by reducing the ability for others to profile app users, thereby reducing their value for advertising purposes, this change would make it much less lucrative for app developers to sell their apps for Apple devices. This is especially true for those who generate earnings solely through ad tracking. In its defense, Apple said the rule also applies to its own apps, but detractors say this would have the effect of funneling the advertising revenues from traffic generated by users of Apple devices to Apple apps.
There are two reasons for this: first, Apple apps, according to competitors’ accusations, use technology and profiling models that are different from those blocked by the new changes, meaning that the policy changes do not have the same consequences for Apple applications; and secondly, the Apple operating system (“iOS”) is a closed-source system, meaning manufacturers of non-Apple devices cannot get a license to use it. Furthermore, Apple prevents the sale of apps on its devices outside of the Apple Store (and therefore iOS users cannot be accessed and tracked outside of an ecosystem that exists under conditions set by Apple). It is this second point in particular that would make Apple a dominant force in the market of non-licensable operating systems for mobile devices: according to the Commission’s precedents against Google/Android, this is separate from the market of licensable (or open-source) operating systems, where Android is considered the dominant player. It follows that any conduct on the part of Apple that is judged “discriminatory” — which would include conduct that results in it advantaging its own collection of advertising data over that of its competitors — could constitute an antitrust violation in the form of abuse of a dominant market position (Art. 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). The Commission already has two antitrust investigations underway regarding the ban on selling apps outside of the Apple Store at the behest of Spotify and Epic Games.
No formal antitrust investigations have yet been undertaken with regard to the updated Apple privacy policy, but Commissioner Vestager’s statements seem to suggest strongly the tendency to see privacy rules adopted by Internet platforms as crucial drivers of competition in digital markets (especially when it comes to collecting advertising data, the main source of revenue). It stands to reason that privacy policy and practices are therefore subject to antitrust laws and not just privacy laws. While that theory has been debated academically for some time now, the Italian authority (together with their German, UK and French equivalents) seem to be taking a leading role in aggressively enforcing competition rules in that direction. Indeed, in late October 2020 the Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”3) opened an investigation into Google4 for conduct that was in some ways similar to the conduct at issue here, cementing its position as one of the most active and aggressive authorities when it comes to applying antitrust rules in the digital sector. The French authority, too, may be ready to take action: recently an association of online advertising companies filed antitrust charges5 in France over Apple’s changes to privacy rules.
However, on March 17, the Autorité announced6 that it did not intend to impose interim measures on Apple. The President Isabelle de Silva reported that the decision came after the Autorité sourced an analysis from the French data protection supervisor (“CNIL”) that came to the conclusion that Apple’s privacy changes would bring benefits to users on data protection grounds. Nonetheless, the Autorité will continue to conduct a probe into whether the company unfairly favors its own services. Further, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) has heard similar concerns as in the French case from complainant Marketers for an Open Web (“MOW”) in the context of an abuse of dominance probe it launched into Apple’s App Store in early March.7 Finally, in January this year, the CMA opened an investigation into Google’s proposals to remove third party cookies and other functionalities from its Chrome browser.
To date, the combination of privacy and antitrust issues raised by the digital economy has been considered a matter of overlap between regulations that until recently were seen as covering completely separate areas. The most recent policy indications on competition in Europe tend to consider privacy protection a quality element (or lower “price”) for digital services, resulting in greater privacy protection should be considered to correspond to greater competitiveness among digital services. However, as our understanding of the competitive dynamics linked to data use has grown, we have begun to see potential conflict between the two regulatory areas: while privacy rules applied by Apple and Google clearly seem to result in users being afforded greater data protection (and therefore better “quality” or “price”) for digital services, at the same time the way this is playing out in real terms may result in limiting competition among suppliers of digital services in closed-source ecosystems, where users do not have the option of switching or multi-homing to other platforms without incurring significant costs (such as purchasing a new device), or are at least discouraged from doing so by opportunity costs (e.g. no being able to use the data uploaded on the other platform). However, treating practices that tend to improve user privacy as antitrust infractions seems to fly in the face of the teachings of the European competition authorities.
Therefore, we need to seek the correct balance between these two sets of needs — one that allows the large platforms (so called “gatekeepers”) to know with a fair amount of certainty which privacy behaviors and terms they can provide to users without incurring heavy antitrust fines. Legal certainty and the freedom to conduct business also deserve maximal constitutional protection. The European Commission’s newly proposed Digital Markets Act8 currently under discussion – which aims at limiting the market power of gatekeepers to improve competitiveness in the digital sphere, including by regulating specific conduct relating to data collection and sharing – seems to contemplate this issue and offers an opportunity to address this issue properly, though it is to be seen whether the final text will strike the right balance between transparency rules, mandatory access and sharing of data and data privacy.

President Joe Biden’s search for the Justice Department’s top trust-busting role is being bogged down by ethics concerns, both about candidates who have represented Silicon Valley’s giants and those who have represented critics of the big tech companies.
The debate is now imperiling the prospects for the favorite candidate of progressives who are eager to rein in the power of Silicon Valley.
Specifically, White House ethics officials are raising objections about DOJ antitrust candidates who have represented critics of big tech companies like Google, Facebook or Apple people familiar with the deliberations told POLITICO. Those concerns prompted one prime candidate for the department’s top antitrust role to pull herself out of the running, the people said. And they would also pose a major obstacle to Biden hiring Jonathan Kanter, a progressive favorite who has represented many clients with complaints about Google.
At the very least, the ethics standards as interpreted by the Biden team would force Kanter to recuse himself from the antitrust suit that DOJ filed against Google in October, the people said. The Trump administration took a more lenient approach, hiring top DOJ antitrust officials from law firms who represent Google complainers.
Biden already faces pressure from the left not to hire lawyers who have worked for major Silicon Valley companies — another restriction that is putting the White House in a bind as it tries to find an assistant attorney general for antitrust.

“We are in dialogue with the FAS and are working on the next steps,” Yandex said on Thursday.

Britain’s competition regulator said Thursday that it was referring to Facebook’s acquisition of GIF database Giphy for an in-depth investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently completed its initial probe into the Facebook-Giphy merger — which has already closed — and concluded that the deal raises competition concerns.
The watchdog says it found evidence that Giphy had plans to expand its digital advertising partnerships to the U.K. and other markets before the deal was reached. It believes Giphy’s combination with Facebook would mean the firm has less incentive to expand its digital ads business, leading to a potential loss of competition.
The CMA gave the companies five working days to address their concerns about the deal but Facebook refused to do so, the watchdog said.
“We will continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation,” a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.
“This merger is good for competition and in the interests of everyone in the UK who uses GIPHY and our services — from developers to service providers to content creators,” the spokesperson added.
Giphy is one of the world’s top libraries for GIFs, animated images involving memes or pop culture references that are shared on the internet. It competes with the likes of Google-owned GIF platform Tenor and the start-up Gfycat.

994,"March 28, 2021","EU Wants More Say In Tech, Pharma, Biotech & Start-Up Mergers","


EU antitrust regulators are set to have more say over small merger deals involving start-ups in the technology, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries, the EU enforcer announced on Friday, March 26, in a warning to big companies eyeing such deals. 
According to Reuters, the move comes amid regulatory concerns on both sides of the Atlantic that a buying spree of start-ups by big companies, which do not trigger competition scrutiny because of the low value of the deal, may be so-called killer acquisitions.
This refers to a company buying a potential rival still in a nascent stage with the aim of shutting it down.
Critics have often cited the hundreds of small companies acquired by Alphabet’s Google and Facebook in recent years while supporters say such deals provide the money and resources to help start-ups to grow.
The European Commission stated it wants national competition watchdogs to refer more small deals to the EU enforcer. Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said, “The EU merger procedures have served us well so far. Our evaluation however has identified some areas for improvement. A number of transactions involving companies with low turnover, but high competitive potential in the internal market are not reviewed by either the Commission or the Member States. A more frequent use of the existing tool of referrals under Article 22 of the Merger Regulation can help us capture concentrations which may have a significant impact on competition in the internal market. In parallel, we are also looking at the possible revision of certain procedural aspects of EU merger control. To this end, we invite input from stakeholders on different policy options to achieve further targeting and simplification of the EU merger control procedures.”

President Joe Biden’s recent nomination and appointment, respectively, of superstar scholars Lina Khan to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Tim Wu to work on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council have reignited optimism that the United States government will finally take action against Big Tech giants like Google and Facebook for their anti-competitive behaviour. Why isn’t Canada taking a similar approach?
In 2019, the Competition Bureau assured Canadians that it was “monitoring” the tech giants for anti-competitive practices. Since then, it launched an investigation into Amazon. But when compared to other competition authorities, like the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FTC in the U.S. and the European Commission, the Competition Bureau’s enforcement in the digital sphere has been lacking.
Since 2011, the Competition Bureau has launched five modest investigations into the FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In that same time, authorities in the U.S. and the European Union have launched nearly double and triple that amount, respectively.

By Noga Blickstein Shchory & Michal Gal (University of Haifa)
Some digital information intermediaries, such as Google and Facebook, enjoy significant and durable market power. Concerns regarding the anti-competitive effects of such power have largely focused on conduct engaged in by the infomediaries themselves, and have led to several recent, well-publicized regulatory actions in the US and elsewhere.
